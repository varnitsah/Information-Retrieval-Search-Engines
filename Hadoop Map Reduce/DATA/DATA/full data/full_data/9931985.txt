9931985	the trial  or  more links of the daisy chain   by  charlotte m yonge     chapter i  quand on veut dessecher un marais on ne fait pas voter les grenouillesmme emile de giradin   richard  thats right  heres a teacup waiting for you as the almost thirtyyearold incumbent of cocksmoor still looking like a young deacon entered the room with his quiet step and silent greeting to its four inmates  thank you ethel  is papa gone out  i have not seen him since dinnertime  you said he was gone out with dr spencer aubrey  yes i heard dr spencers voicei say dicklike three notes of consternation said aubrey and off they went  i fancy theres some illness about in the lower pond buildings that dr spencer has been raging so long to get drained  the knell has been ringing for a little child there added mary scarlatina i believe  but richard burst forth the merry voice of the youngest you must see our letters from edinburgh  you have heard then  it was the very thing i came to ask  oh yes there were five notes in one cover said gertrude  papa says they are to be laid up in the family archives and labelled the infants honeymoon  papa is very happy with his own share said ethel  it was signed still his own white flower and it had two calton hill real daisies in it   i dont know when i have seen him more pleased  and hectors letteri can say that by heart continued gertrude my dear father this is only to say that she is the darlint and for the pleasure of subscribing myselfyour loving sonthe son as big as all the rest put together  i tell blanche that he only took her for the pleasure of being my fathers son said aubrey in his low lazy voice  well said mary even to the last i do believe he had as soon drive papa out as walk with blanche  flora was quite scandalized at it  i should not imagine that george had often driven my father out said aubrey again looking lazily up from balancing his spoon  ethel laughed and even richard smiled then recovering herself she said poor hector he never could call himself son to any one before  he has not been much otherwise here said richard  no said ethel it is the peculiar hardship of our weddings to break us up by pairs and carry off two instead of one  did you ever see me with so shabby a row of teacups  when shall i have them come in riding double again  the recent wedding was the third in the family the first after a five years respite  it ensued upon an attachment that had grown up with the young people so that they had been entirely one with each other and there had been little of formal demand either of the maidens affection or her fathers consent but both had been implied from the first  the bridegroom was barely of age the bride not seventeen and dr may had owned it was very shocking and told richard to say nothing about it  hector had coaxed and pleaded pathetically talked of his great empty house at maplewood and declared that till he might take blanche away he would not leave stoneborough he would bring down all sorts of gossip on his courtship he would worry ethel and take care she finished nobodys education  what did blanche want with more education  she knew enough for him  couldnt ethel be satisfied with aubrey and gertrude or he dared say she might have mary too if she was insatiable  if dr may was so unnatural as to forbid him to hang about the house why he would take rooms at the swan  in fact as dr may observed he treated him to a modern redhaired scotch version of make me a willow cabin at your gate and as he heartily loved hector and entirely trusted him and blanches pretty head was a wise and prudent one what was the use of keeping the poor lad unsettled  so mrs rivers the eldest sister and the members wife had come to arrange matters and help ethel and a very brilliant wedding it had been  blanche was too entirely at home with hector for flutterings or agitations and was too peacefully happy for grief at the separation which completed the destiny that she had always seen before her  she was a picture of a bride and when she and hector hung round the doctor insisting that edinburgh should be the first place they should visit and calling forth minute directions for their pilgrimage to the scenes of his youth promising to come home and tell him all no wonder he felt himself rather gaining a child than losing one  he was very bright and happy and no one but ethel understood how all the time there was a sensation that the present was but a strange dreamy parody of that marriage which had been the theme of earlier hopes  the wedding had taken place shortly after easter and immediately after the rivers family had departed for london and tom may had returned to cambridge leaving the home party at the minimum of four since cocksmoor parsonage being complete richard had become only a daily visitor instead of a constant inhabitant  there he sat occupying his never idle hands with a net that he kept for such moments whilst ethel sat behind her urn now giving out its last sighs profiting by the leisure to read the county newspaper while she continually filled up her cup with tea or milk as occasion served indifferent to the increasing pallor of the liquid  mary a fine young woman as george rivers called her of blooming face and sweet open expression had begun at gertrudes entreaty a game of french billiards  gertrude had still her childish sunny face and bright hair and even at the trying age of twelve was pleasing chiefly owing to the caressing freedom of manner belonging to an unspoilable pet  her request to aubrey to join the sport had been answered with a half petulant shake of the head and he flung himself into his fathers chair his long legs hanging over one arman attitude that those who had ever been under mrs mays discipline thought impossible in the drawingroom but aubrey was a rival pet and with the family characteristics of aquiline features dark gray eyes and beautiful teeth had an air of fragility and easy languor that showed his exercise of the immunities of illhealth  he had been ethels pupil till toms last year at eton when he was sent thither and had taken a good place but his brothers vigilant and tender care could not save him from an attack on the chest that settled his publicschool education for ever to his severe mortification just when toms shower of honours was displaying to him the sweets of emulation and success  ethel regained her pupil and put forth her utmost powers for his benefit causing tom to examine him at each vacation with adjurations to let her know the instant he discovered that her task of tuition was getting beyond her  in truth tom fraternally held her cheap and would have enjoyed a triumph over her scholarship but to this he had not attained and in spite of his desire to keep his brother in a salutary state of humiliation candour wrung from him the admission that even in verses aubrey did as well as other fellows of his standing  conceit was not aubreys fault  his father was more guarded than in the case of his elder sons and the home atmosphere was not such as to give the boy a sense of superiority especially when diligently kept down by his brother  even the half year at eton had not produced superciliousness though it had given eton polish to the homebred manners it had made sisters valuable and awakened a desire for masculine companionship  he did not rebel against his sisters rule she was nearly a mother to him and had always been the most active president of his studies and pursuits and he was perfectly obedient and dutiful to her only asserting his equality in imitation of harry and tom by a little of the goodhumoured raillery and teasing that treated ethel as the family butt while she was really the family authority  all gone ethel he said with a lazy smile as ethel mechanically with her eyes on the newspaper tried all her vessels round and found creamjug milkjug teapot and urn exhausted will you have in the river next  what a shame said ethel awakening and laughing  those are the teamakers snares  do send it away then said aubrey the urn oppresses the atmosphere  very well ill make a fresh brew when papa comes home and perhaps youll have some then  you did not half finish tonight  aubrey yawned and after some speculation about their fathers absence gertrude went to bed and aubrey calling himself tired stood up stretched every limb portentously and said he should go off too ethel looked at him anxiously felt his hand and asked if he were sure he had not a cold coming on  you are always thinking of colds was all the satisfaction she received  what has he been doing said richard  that is what i was thinking  he was about all yesterday afternoon with leonard ward and perhaps may have done something imprudent in the damp  i never know what to do  i cant bear him to be a coddle yet he is always catching cold if i let him alone  the question is whether it is worse for him to run risks or to be thinking of himself  he need not be doing that said richard he may be thinking of your wishes and papas  very pretty of him and you ritchie but he is not three parts of a boy or man who thinks of his womankinds wishes when there is anything spirited before him  well i suppose one may do ones duty without being three parts of a boy said richard gravely  i know it is true that some of the most saintly characters have been the more spiritual because their animal frame was less vigorous but still it does not content me  no the higher the power the better of course should the service be  i was only putting you in mind that there is compensation  but i must be off  i am sorry i cannot wait for papa  let me know what is the matter tomorrow and how aubrey is  richard went and the sisters took up their employmentsethel writing to the new zealand sisterinlaw her history of the wedding mary copying parts of a new zealand letter for her brother the lieutenant in command of a gunboat on the chinese coast  those letters whether from norman may or his wife were very delightful they were so full of a cheerful tone of trustful exertion and resolution though there had been perhaps more than the natural amount of disappointments  normans powers were not thought of the description calculated for regular mission work and some of the chief aspirations of the young couple had had to be relinquished at the voice of authority without a trial  they had received the charge of persons as much in need of them as unreclaimed savages but to whom there was less apparent glory in ministering  a widespread district of very colonial colonists and the charge of a college for their uncultivated sons was quite as troublesome as the most ardent selfdevotion could desire and the hardships and disagreeables though severe made no figure in historynay it required ingenuity to gather their existence from metas bright letters although from mrs arnotts accounts it was clear that the wife took a quadruple share  mrs rivers had been heard to say that norman need not have gone so far and sacrificed so much to obtain an underbred english congregation and even the doctor had sighed once or twice at having relinquished his favourite son to what was dull and distasteful but ethel could trust that this unmurmuring acceptance of the less striking career might be another step in the discipline of her brothers ardent and ambitious nature  it is a great thing to sacrifice but a greater to consent not to sacrifice in ones own way  ethel sat up for her father and mary would not go to bed and leave her so the two sisters waited till they heard the latchkey  ethel ran out but her father was already on the stairs and waved her back  here is some tea  are you not coming papait is all here  thank you ill just go and take off this coat and he passed on to his room  i dont like that said ethel returning to the drawingroom where mary was boiling up the kettle and kneeling down to make some toast  why whats the matter  i have never known him go and change his coat but when some infectious thing has been about  besides he did not wait to let me help him off with it  in a few seconds the doctor came down in his dressinggown and let himself be put into his easychair his two daughters waiting on him with fond assiduity their eyes questioning his fagged weary face but reading there fatigue and concern that made themrather awestruckbide their time till it should suit him to speak  mary was afraid he would wait till she was gone dear old mary who at twentytwo never dreamt of regarding herself as on the same footing with her three years senior and had her toast been browner would have relieved them of her presence at once  however her father spoke after his first long draught of tea  well  how true it is that judgments are upon us while we are marrying and giving in marriage  what is it papa  not the scarlatina  scarlatina indeed he said contemptuously  scarlet fever in the most aggravated form  two deaths in one house and i am much mistaken if there will not be another before morning  who papa asked mary  those wretched martins in lower pond buildings are the worst  no wonder living in voluntary filth but it is all over the streetwill be all over the town unless theres some special mercy on the place  but how has it grown so bad said ethel without our having even heard of it  whypartly i take shame to myselfthis business of hector and blanche kept spencer and me away last dispensary day and partly it was that young coxcomb henry ward thought it not worth while to trouble me about a simple epidemic  simple epidemic indeed repeated dr may changing his tone from ironical mimicry to hot indignation  i hope he will be gratified with its simplicity  i wonder how long he would have gone on if it had not laid hold on him  you dont mean that he has it  i do  it will give him a practical lesson in simple epidemics  and henry ward has it repeated mary looking so much dismayed that her father laughed saying  what mary thinks when it comes to fevers being so audacious as to lay hold of the doctors it is time that they should be put a stop to  he seems to have petted it and made much of it said ethel so no wonder  what could have possessed him  just this ethel and it is only human nature after all  this young lad comes down as master tom will do some day full of his lectures and his hospitals and is nettled and displeased to find his father content to have spencer or me called in the instant anything serious is the matter  but you are a physician papa said mary  no matter for that to mr henry im an old fogie and depend upon it if it were only the giving a dose of salts he would like to have the case to himself  these poor creatures were parish patients and i dont mean that his treatment was amiss  spencer is right it was an atmosphere where there was no saving anyone but if he had not been so delighted with his own way and i had known what was going on id have got the guardians and the town council and routed out the place seventeen cases and most of them the worst form  but what was mr ward about          says i to myself heres a lesson for me           this mans but a picture of what i shall be  when master tom gets the upper hand of me returned dr may  poor ward who has run to me in all his difficulties these thirty years didnt like it at all but mr henry was so confident with his simple epidemic and had got him in such order that he durst not speak  and what brought it to light at last  everything at once  first the clerics go to see about the family where the infant died and report to spencer he comes after me and we start to reconnoitre  then i am called in to see shearmans daughtera very ugly case thatand coming out i meet poor ward himself wanting me to see henry and theres the other boy sickening too  then i went down and saw all those cases in the lower ponds and have been running about the town ever since to try what can be done hunting up nurses whom i cant get stirring dishes of skim milk trying to get the funerals over tomorrow morning by daybreak i declare i have hardly a leg to stand on  where was dr spencer  ive nearly quarrelled with spencer  oh he is in high feather he will have it that the fever rose up bodily like kuhleborn out of that unhappy drain he is always worrying about when it is a regular case of scarlet fever brought in by a girl at home from service but he will have it that his theory is proved  then i meant him to keep clear of it  he has always been liable to malaria and all that sort of thing and has not strength for an illness  i told him to mind the ordinary practice for me and what do i find him doing the next thing but operating upon one of the worst throats he could find  i told him he was as bad as young ward i hate his irregular practice ill tell you what he said vindictively as if gratified to have what must obey him you shall all go off to cocksmoor tomorrow morning at seven oclock  you forget that we two have had it said mary  which of you  all down to blanche  never mind for that  i shall have enough to do without a sick house at home  you can perform quarantine with richard and then go to flora if she will have you  well what are you dawdling about  go and pack up  papa said ethel who had been abstracted through all the latter part of the conversation if you please we had better not settle my going till tomorrow morning  come ethel you have too much sense for panics  dont take nonsense into your head  the children cant have been in the way of it  stay papa said ethel her serious face arresting the momentary impatience of fatigue and anxiety i am afraid aubrey was a good while choosing fishingtackle at shearmans yesterday with leonard ward and it may be nothing but he did seem heavy and out of order tonight i wish you would look at him as you go up  dr may stood still for a few moments then gave one long gasp made a few inquiries and went up to aubreys room  the boy was fast asleep but there was that about him which softened the weary sharpness of his fathers manner and caused him to desire ethel to look from the window whence she could see whether the lights were out in dr spencers house  yes they were  never mind  it will make no real odds and he has had enough on his hands today  the boy will sleep quietly enough tonight so let us all go to bed  i think i can get a mattress into his room without waking him if you will help me mary said ethel  nonsense said her father decidedly  mary is not to go near him before she takes gertrude to cocksmoor and you go to your own bed and get a nights rest while you can  you wont stay up papa  iwhy it is all i can do not to fall asleep on my feet  good night children  he does not trust himself to think or to fear said ethel  too much depends on him to let himself be unstrung  but ethel you will not leave dear aubrey  i shall keep his door open and mine but papa is right and it will not do to waste ones strength  in case i should not see you before you go  oh but ethel i shall come back  dont pray dont tell me to stay away  richard will have to keep away for daisys sake and you cant do all alonenurse aubrey and attend to papa  say that i may come back  well mary i think you might said ethel after a moments thought if it were only aubrey i could manage for him but i am more anxious about papa  you dont think he is going to have it  oh no no said ethel he is what he calls himself a seasoned vessel but he will be terribly overworked and unhappy and he must not come home and find no one to talk to or to look cheerful  so mary unless he gives any fresh orders or richard thinks it will only make things worse i shall be very glad of you  mary had never clung to her so gratefully nor felt so much honoured do you think he will have it badly she asked timidly  i dont think at all about it said ethel something in her fathers manner  if we are to get through all this mary it must not be by riding out on perhapses  now let us put daisys things together for she must have as little communication with home as possible  ethel silently and rapidly moved about dreading to give an interval for tremblings of heart  five years of family prosperity had passed and there had been that insensible feeling of peace and immunity from care which is strange to look back upon when one hour has drifted from smooth water to turbid currents  there was a sort of awe in seeing the mysterious gates of sorrow again unclosed yet darling of her own as aubrey was ethels first thoughts and fears were primarily for her father  grief and alarm seemed chiefly to touch her through him and she found herself praying above all that he might be shielded from suffering and might be spared a renewal of the pangs that had before wrung his heart  by early morning every one was astir and gertrude bewildered and distressed yet rather enjoying the fun of staying with richard was walking off with mary  soon after dr spencer was standing by the bedside of his old patient aubrey who had been always left to his management  ah i see he said with a certain tone of satisfaction for once there will be a case properly treated  now ethel you and i will show what intelligent nursing can do  i believe you are delighted growled aubrey  so should you be at the valuable precedent you will afford  ive no notion of being experimented on to prove your theory said aubrey still ready for lazy mischief  for be it known that the rovingtempered dr spencer had been on fire to volunteer to the crimean hospitals and had unwillingly sacrificed the project not to dr mays conviction that it would be fatal in his present state of health but to ethels private entreaty that he would not add to her fathers distress in the freshness of margarets death and the parting with norman  he had never ceased to mourn over the lost opportunity and to cast up to his friend the discoveries he might have made while dr may declared that if by any strange chance he had come back at all he would have been so rabid on improved nursing and sanatory measures that there would have been no living with him  it must be owned that dr may was not very sensible to what his friend called stoneborough stinks  the place was fairly healthy and his town councillors conservatism and hatred of change as well as the amusement of skirmishing had always made him the champion of things as they were and in the present emergency the battle whether the enemy had travelled by infection or was the product of the pond buildings miasma was the favourite enlivenment of the disagreeing doctors in their brief intervals of repose in the stern conflict which they were waging with the fevera conflict in which they had soon to strive by themselves for the disease not only seized on young ward but on his father and till medical assistance was sent from london they had the whole town on their hands and for nearly a week lived without a nights rest  the care of the sick was a still greater difficulty  though aubrey was never in danger and dr spencers promise of the effects of intelligent nursing was fully realized ethel and mary were so occupied by him that it was a fearful thing to guess how it must fare with those households where the greater number were laid low and in want of all the comforts that could do little  the clergy worked to the utmost and a letter of mr wilmots obtained the assistance of two ladies from a nursing sisterhood who not only worked incredible wonders with their own hands among the poor but made efficient nurses of rough girls and stupid old women dr may who had at first in his distrust of innovation been averse to the importationas likely to have no effect but putting nonsense into girls heads and worrying the sick poorwas so entirely conquered that he took off his hat to them across the street importuned them to drink tea with his daughters and never came home without dilating on their merits for the few minutes that intervened between his satisfying himself about aubrey and dropping asleep in his chair  the only counter demonstration he reserved to himself was that he always called them miss whatdyecallher and those gems of women instead of sister katherine and sister frances     chapter ii  good words are silver but good deeds are goldcecil and mary   it has been a very good day papa he has enjoyed all his meals indeed was quite ravenous  he is asleep now and looks as comfortable as possible said ethel five weeks after aubreys illness had begun  thank god for that and all his mercy to us ethel and the long sigh the kiss and dewy eyes would have told her that there had been more to exhaust him than his twelve hours toil even had she not partly known what weighed him down  poor things she said  both gone ethel both both and as he entered the drawingroom he threw himself back in his chair and gasped with the longrestrained feeling  both she exclaimed  you dont mean that leonard  no ethel his mother  poor children poor children  mrs ward  i thought she had only been taken ill yesterday evening  she only then gave waybut she never had any constitutionshe was done up with nursingnothing to fall back onsudden collapse and prostrationand that poor girl called every way at once fancied her asleep and took no alarm till i came in this morning and found her pulse all but gone  we have been pouring down stimulants all day but there was no rousing her and she was gone the first  and mr warddid he know it  i thought so from the way he looked at me but speech had long been lost and that throat was dreadful suffering  well in their death they were not divided  he shaded his eyes with his hand and ethel leaning against his chair could not hinder herself from a shudder at the longing those words seemed to convey  he felt her movement and put his arm round her saying no ethel do not think i envy them  i might have done so oncei had not then learnt the meaning of the discipline of being without herno nor what you could do for me my child my children  ethels thrill of bliss was so intense that it gave her a sense of selfishness in indulging personal joy at such a moment and indeed it was true that her father had overlived the first pangs of change and separation had formed new and congenial habits saw the future hope before him and since poor margaret had been at rest had been without present anxiety or the sight of decay and disappointment her only answer was a mute smoothing of his bowed shoulders as she said if i could be of any use or comfort to poor averil ward i could go tonight  mary is enough for aubrey  not now my dear  she cant stir from the boy they are giving him champagne every ten minutes she has the nurse and spencer is backwards and forwards i think they will pull him through but it is a near a very near touch  good patient unselfish boy he is too  he always was a very nice boy said ethel i do hope he will get well  it would be a terrible grief to aubrey  yes i got leonard to open his lips today by telling him that aubrey had sent him the grapes  i think he will get through  i hope he will he is a good friend for aubrey  so touching it was this morning to hear him trying to ask pardon for all his faults poor fellowfits of temper and the like  that is his fault i believe said ethel and i always think it a wholesome one because it is so visible and unjustifiable that people strive against it  and the rest  was henry able to see his father or mother  no he can scarcely sit up in bed  it was piteous to see him lying with his door open listening  he is full of warm sound feeling poor fellow  you would like to have heard the fervour with which he begged me to tell his father to have no fears for the younger ones for it should be the most precious task of his life to do a parents part by them  let me see he is just of harrys age said ethel thoughtfully as if she had not the strongest faith in harrys power of supplying a parents place  well said her father remember a medical student is an older man than a lieutenant in the navy  one sees as much of the interior as the other does of the surface  we must take this young ward by the hand and mind he does not lose his fathers practice  burdon that young prig that spencer got down from london met me at gavins when i looked in there on my way home and came the length of minster street with me asking what i thought of an opening for a medical manpartnership with young ward c  i snubbed him so short that i fancy i left him thinking whether his nose was on or off his face  he was rather premature  ive settled him any way  i shall do my best to keep the town clear for that lad theres not much more for him as things are now and it will be only looking close after him for a few years which spencer and i can very well manage  if he will let you  there thats the spitefulness of women  must you be casting up that little natural spirit of independence against him after the lesson he has had  i tell you he has been promising me to look on me as a father  poor old ward he was a good friend and fellowworker  i owe a great deal to him  ethel wondered if he forgot how much of the unserviceableness of his maimed arm had once been attributed to mr wards dulness or how many times he had come home boiling with annoyance at having been called in too late to remedy the respectable apothecarys half measures  she believed that the son had been much better educated than the father and after the fearful lesson he had received thought he might realize dr mays hopes and appreciate his kindness  they discussed the relations  ward came as assistant to old axworthy and married his daughter he had no relations that his son knows of except the old aunt who left averil her £2000  there are some axworthys still said ethel but not very creditable people  you may say that said dr may emphatically  there was a scapegrace brother that ran away and was heard of no more till he turned up a wealthy man ten or fifteen years ago and bought what they call the vintry mill some way on this side of whitford  he has a business on a large scale but ward had as little intercourse with him as possible a terrible old heathen  and the boy that was expelled for bullying tom is in the business  i hate the thought of that said the doctor  if he had stayed on who knows but he might have turned out as well as ned anderson  has not he  im sure i have no right to say he has not but he is a flashy slang style of youth and i hope the young wards will keep out of his way  what will become of them  is there likely to be any provision for them  not much i should guess  poor ward did as we are all tempted to do when money goes through our hands and spent more freely than i was ever allowed to do  costly house garden greenhouseshed better have stuck to old axworthys place in minster streetdaughter at that grand school where she cost more than the whole halfdozen of you put together  she was more worth it said ethel her music and drawing are firstrate  harry was frantic about her singing last time he was at homeone evening when mrs anderson abused his goodnature and got him to a teapartyi began to be afraid of the consequences  pish said the doctor  and really they kept her there to enable her to educate her sisters said ethel  the last time i called on poor mrs ward she told me all about it apologizing in the pretty way mothers do saying she was looking forward to averils coming home but that while she profited so much they felt it due to her to give her every advantage and did not i thinkwith my experiencethat it was all so much for the little ones benefit  i assured her from my personal experience that ignorance is a terrible thing in governessing ones sisters  poor thing  and averil had only come home this very easter  and with everything to learn in such a scene as that  the first day when only the boys were ill there sat the girl dabbling with her watercolours and her petticoats reaching half across the room looking like a milliners doll and neither she nor her poor mother dreaming of her doing a useful matter  who is spiteful now papa  thats all envy at not having such an accomplished daughter  when she came out in time of need so grandly and showed all a womans instinct  womans nonsense  instinct is for irrational brutes and the more you cultivate a woman the less she has of it unless you work up her practical common sense too  some one said she made a wonderful nurse  wonderful  perhaps so considering her opportunities and she does better with spencer than with me i may have called her to order impatiently for she is nervous with me loses her head and knocks everything down with her petticoats  thennot a word to any one ethelbut imagine her perfect blindness to her poor mothers state all yesterday and last night not even calling burdon to look at her why those ten hours may have made all the difference  poor thing how is she getting on now  concentrated upon leonard too much stunned to admit another ideano tearshardly full comprehension  one cant take her away and she cant bear not to do everything and yet one cant trust her any more than a child  as she is said ethel but as she wont be any longer  and the two little ones  it breaks ones heart to see them just able to sit by their nursery fire murmuring in that weary resigned sick childs voice i wish nurse would come  i wish sister would come  i wish mamma would come  i went up to them the last thing and told them how it was and let them cry themselves to sleep  that was the worst business of all ethel are they too big for mary to dress some dolls for them  i will try to find out their tastes the first thing tomorrow said ethel at any rate we can help them if not poor averil  ethel however was detained at home to await dr spencers visit and mary whose dreams had all night been haunted by the thought of the two little nursery prisoners entreated to go with her father and see what could be done for them  off they set together mary with a basket in her hand which was replenished at the toyshop in minster street with two chinafaced dolls and a little farther on parted with a couple of rolls interspersed with strata of cold beef and butter to a household of convalescents in the stage for kitchen physic  passing the school still taking its enforced holiday the father and daughter traversed the bridge and entered the growing suburb known as bankside where wretched cottages belonging to needy grasping proprietors formed an uncomfortable contrast to the villa residences interspersed among them  one of these with a wellkept lawn daintily adorned with the newest pines and ornamental shrubs and with sheets of glass glaring in the sun from the gardens at the back was the house that poor mr and mrs ward had bought and beautified because it was so much better for the children to be out of the town  the tears sprang into marys eyes at the veiled windows and the unfeeling contrast of the spring glow of flowering thorn lilac laburnum and above all the hard flashing brightness of the glass but tears were so unlike ethel that mary always was ashamed of them and disposed of them quietly  they rang but in vain  two of the servants were ill and all in confusion and after waiting a few moments among the azaleas in the glass porch dr may admitted himself and led the way upstairs with silent footfalls mary following with breath held back  a voice from an open door called is that dr may and he paused to look in and say ill be with you in one minute henry how is leonard  no worse they tell me i say dr may  one moment and turning back to mary he pointed along a dark passage  up there first door to the right  you cant mistake then disappeared drawing the door after him  much discomfited mary nevertheless plunged bravely on concluding there to be up a narrow uncarpeted stair with a nursery wicket at the top in undoing which she was relieved of all doubts and scruples by a melancholy little duet from within  mary mary we want our breakfast  we want to get up  mary mary do come please come  she was instantly in what might ordinarily have been a light cheerful room but which was in all the dreariness of gray cinders exhausted nightlight curtained windows and fragments of the last meal  in each of two cane cribs was sitting up a forlorn child with loose locks of dishevelled hair pale thin cheeks glazed with tears staring eyes and mouths rounded with amaze at the apparition  one dropped down and hid under the bedclothes the other remained transfixed as her visitor advanced saying well my dear you called mary and here i am  not our own mary said the child distrustfully  see if i cant be your own mary  you cant  you cant give us our breakfast  oh i am so hungry from the other crib and both burst into the feeble sobs of exhaustion  recovering from fever and still fasting at halfpast nine  mary was aghast and promised an instant supply  dont go and a birdlike little hand seized her on either side mary never came to bed and nobody has been here all the morning and we cant bear to be alone  i was only looking for the bell  it is of no use minna did jump out and ring but nobody will come  mary made an ineffectual experiment and then persuaded the children to let her go by assurances of a speedy return  she sped down brimming over with pity and indignation to communicate to her father this cruel neglect and as she passed henry wards door and heard several voices she ventured on a timid summons of papa but finding it unheard she perceived that she must act for herself going downstairs she tried the sittingroom doors hoping that breakfast might be laid out there but all were locked and at last she found her way to the lower regions guided by voices in eager tones of subdued gossip  there in the glow of the huge red fire stood a wellcovered table surrounded by cook charwoman and their cavaliers discussing a pile of hotbuttered toast to which the little kitchenmaid was contributing large rounds toasted at the fire  marys eyes absolutely flashed as she said the children have had no breakfast  i beg your pardon maam and the cook rose but it is the nursemaid that takes up the young ladies meals  mary did not listen to the rest she was desperate and pouncing on the bread with one hand and the butter with the other ran away with them to the nursery set them down and rushed off for another raid she found that the commotion she had excited was resulting in the preparation of a tray  i am sure maam i am very sorry said the cook insisting on carrying the kettle but we are in such confusion and the nursemaid whose place it is has been up most of the night with mr leonard and must have just dropped asleep somewhere and i was just giving their breakfast to the undertakers young men but ill call her directly maam  oh no on no account  i am sure she ought to sleep said mary it was only because i found the little girls quite starving that i came down  i will take care of them now  dont wake her pray only i hope and mary looked beseechingly that they will have something good for their dinner poor little things  cook was entirely pacified and talked about roast chicken and presently the little sisters were sitting up in their beds each in her wrapper being fed by turns with delicatelybuttered slices mary standing between like a motherbird feeding her young and pleased to find the eyes grow brighter and less hollow the cheeks less wan the voices less thin and pipy and a little laugh breaking out when she mistook minna for ella  while tidying the room she was assailed with entreaties to call their mary and let them get up they were so tired of bed  she undertook to be still their mary and made them direct her to the housemaids stores went down on her knees at the embers and so dealt with matches chips and coal that to her own surprise and pride a fire was evoked  but said ella i thought you were a miss may  so i am my dear  but ladies dont light fires said minna in openeyed perplexity  oh exclaimed the younger sister you know henry said he did not think any of the miss mays were firstrate and that our ave beat them all to nothing  the elder minna began hushing and it must be confessed that honest mary was not superior to a certain crimson flush of indignation as she held her head into the grate and thought of ethel flora and blanche criticized by mr henry ward  little ungrateful chit  no it was not a matter of laughing but of forgiveness and the assertion of the dignity of usefulness was speedily forgotten in the toilette of the small light skinandbone frames in the course of which she received sundry complimentsher hands were so nice and soft she did not pull their hair like their own mary they wished she always dressed them  the trying moment was when they asked if they might kneel at her lap for their prayers  to mary the twelve years seemed as nothing since her first prayers after the day of terror and bereavement and her eyes swam with tears as the younger girl unthinkingly rehearsed her wonted formula and the elder clinging to her whispered gravely please what shall i say  with full heart and voice almost unmanageable mary prompted the few simple words that had come to her in that hour of sorrow  she looked up from stooping to the childs ear to see her father at the door gazing at them with face greatly moved  the children greeted him fondly and he sat down with one on each knee and caressed them as he looked them well over drawing out their narration of the wonderful things she had done the fingers pointing to designate who she was his look at her over his spectacles made marys heart bound and feel compensated for whatever mr henry ward might say of her  when the children had finished their story he beckoned her out of the room promising them that he would not keep her long  well done molly he said smiling it is well to have daughters good for something  you had better stay with them till that poor maid has had her sleep out and can come to them  i should like to stay with them all day only that ethel must want me  you had better go home by dinnertime that ethel may get some air perhaps i shall want one of you in the evening to be with them at the time of the funeral  so soon  yes it must be  better for all and henry is glad it should be so he is out on the sofa today but he is terribly cut up  and leonard  i see some improvementburdon does notbut i think with heavens good mercy we may drag him through the pulse is rather better  now i must go  youll not wait dinner for me  mary spent the next hour in amusing the children by the fabrication of the dolls wardrobe and had made them exceedingly fond of her so that there was a very poor welcome when their own mary at length appeared much shocked at the duration of her own slumbers and greatly obliged to miss may  the little girls would scarcely let mary go though she pacified them by an assurance that she or her sister would come in the evening  dont let it be your sister  you come and finish our dolls frocks and they hung about her kissing her and trying to extract a promise  after sharing the burthen of depression it was strange to return home to so different a tone of spirits when she found aubrey installed in ethels room as his parlour very white and weak but overflowing with languid fun  there was grief and sympathy for the poor wards and anxious inquiries for leonard but it was not sorrow brought visibly before him and after the decorous space of commiseration the smiles were bright again and mary heard how her father had popped in to boast of his daughter being as good as a housemaid or as miss whatshername and her foray in the kitchen was more diverting to aubrey than she was as yet prepared to understand  running away with the buttered toast from under the nose of a charwoman let harry never talk of taking a chinese battery after that her incapacity of perceiving that the deed was either valiant or ludicrous entertaining him particularly  it had evidently hit the medium between the sublime and ridiculous  when evening came mary thought it ethels privilege to go as the most efficient friend and comforter but ethel saw that her sisters soul was with the wards and insisted that she should go on as she had begun  o ethel that was only with the little ones  now you would be of use to poor averil  and why should not you and of more use  you know i am only good for small children but if you tell me  you provoking girl said ethel  all i tell you is that you are twentythree years old and i wont tell you anything nor assist your unwholesome desire to be second fiddle  i dont know what you mean ethel of course you always tell me what to do and how to do it  ethel quite laughed now but gave up the contest only saying as she fondly smoothed back a little refractory lock on marys smooth open brow  very well then go and do whatever comes to hand at bankside my dear  i do really want to stay at home both on aubreys account and because papa says dr spencer is done up and that i must catch him and keep him quiet this evening  mary was satisfied in her obedience and set off with her father just as they reached bankside a gig drove up containing the fattest old man she had ever beheld her father whispered that it was old mr axworthy and sent her at once to the nursery where she was welcomed with a little shriek of delight each child bounding in her small armchair and pulling her down between them on the floor for convenience of double hugging after which she was required to go on with the dolldressing  mary could not bear to do this while the knell was vibrating on her ear and the two coffins being borne across the threshold so she gathered the orphans within her embrace as she sat on the floor and endeavoured to find out how much they understood of what was passing and whether they had any of the right thoughts  it was rather disappointing  the little sisters had evidently been well and religiously taught but they were too childish to dwell on thoughts of awe or grief and the small minds were chiefly fixed upon the dolls as the one bright spot in the dreary day  mary yielded and worked and answered their chatter till twilight came on and the rival mary came up to put them to bed an operation in which she gave her assistance almost questioning if she were not forgotten but she learnt that her father was still in the house the nurse believed looking at papers in mr henrys room with the other gentlemen  and you will sit by us while we go to sleep  oh dont go away  the nurse was thankful to her for so doing and a somewhat graver mood had come over minna as she laid her head on her pillow for she asked the difficult question can mamma see us now which mary could only answer with a tender perhaps and an attempt to direct the child to the thought of the heavenly father and then minna asked who will take care of us now  oh will you cried ella sitting up and both little maids holding out their arms made a proffer of themselves to be her little children they would be so good if she would let them be  mary could only fondle and smile it off and put them in mind that they belonged to their brother and sister but the answer was ave is not so nice as you  oh do let us  but i cant my dears  i am dr mays child you know  what could i say to him  oh but dr may wouldnt mind  i know he wouldnt mind  mamma says there was never any one so fond of little children and he is such a dear good old gentleman  mary had not recognized him as an old gentleman at fiftyeight and did not like it at all  she argued on the impracticability of taking them from their natural protectors and again tried to lead them upwards finally betaking herself to the repetition of hymns which put them to sleep  she had spent some time in sitting between them in the summer darkness when there was a low tap and opening the door she saw her father  indicating that they slept she followed him out and a whispered conference took place as he stood below her on the stairs their heads on a level  tired mary  i have only just got rid of old axworthy  the nurse said you were busy with papers in henrys room  aythe will  henry behaves very well and is full of right feeling poor fellow  what becomes of those dear little girls  they want to make themselves a present to me and say they know you would like it  so i should the darlings  well as things are left it all goes to henry except the £10000 ward had insured his life for which divides between the five  he undertakes most properly to make them a homewhether in this house or not is another thing he and averil will look after them and he made a most right answer when mr axworthy offered to take leonard into his office proceeded the communicative doctor unable to help pouring himself out in spite of time and place as soon as he had a daughter to himself  settle nothing noweducation not finished but privately he tells me he believes his mother would as soon have sent leonard to the hulks as to that old rascal and the scamp his grandnephew  marys answer to this as his tones became incautiously emphatic was a glance round all the attic doors lest they should have ears  now then do you want to get home said the doctor a little rebuked  oh no not if there is anything i can do  i want to get this girl away from leonard  he is just come to the state when it all turns on getting him off to sleep quietly and not disturbing him and she is too excited and restless to do anything with her she has startled him twice already and then gets upsettired out poor thing and will end in being hysterical if she does not get fed and rested and then we shall be done for  now i want you to take charge of her  see heres her room and i have ordered up some tea for her  you must get her quieted down make her have a tolerable meal and when she has worked off her excitement put her to bedundressed mindand you might lie down by her  if you cant manage her call me  thats leonards door and i shall be there all night but dont if you can help it  can you do this or must i get miss whatdyecallher the elder one if she can leave the greens in randalls alley  well was it that marys heart was stout as well as tender and instead of mentally magnifying the task and diminishing her own capabilities she simply felt that she had received a command and merely asked that ethel should be informed  i am going to send up to her  and shall i give averil anything to take  muttonchops if you can  i meant salvolatile or anything to put her to sleep  nonsense  i hate healthy girls drugging themselves  you dont do that at home mary  mary showed her white teeth in a silent laugh at the improbability there being nothing ethel more detested than what she rather rudely called nervous quackeries  her father gave her a kiss of grateful approbation and was gone  there was a light on the table and preparations for tea and mary looked round the pretty room where the ornamental paper the flowery chintz furniture the shining brass of the bedstead the frilled muslin toilet and et ceteras were more luxurious than what she ever saw except when visiting with flora and so new as to tell a tale of the mothers fond preparation for the return of the daughter from school in a few moments she heard her father saying in a voice as if speaking to a sick child yes i promise you my dear  be good be reasonable and you shall come back in the morning  no you cant go there  henry is going to bed  here is a friend for you  now mary dont let me see her till she has slept  mary took the other hand and between them they placed her in an armchair whose shining fresh white ground and gay rosepattern contrasted with her heated rumpled overwatched appearance as she sank her head on her hand not noticing either marys presence or the doctors departure  mary stood doubtful for a few seconds full of pity and embarrassment trying to take in the needs of the case  averil ward was naturally a plump welllooking girl of eighteen with clearlycut features healthy highlycoloured complexion and large bright hazel eyes much darker than her profuse and glossy hair which was always dressed in the newest and most stylish fashion which as well as the whole air of her dress and person was though perfectly lady like always regarded by the stoneborough world as something on the borders of presumption on the part of the entire ward family  to marys surprise the five weeks terrible visitation and these last fearful five days of sleepless exertion and bereavement had not faded the bright red of the cheek nor were there signs of tears though the eyes looked bloodshot  indeed there was a purple tint about the eyelids and lips a driedup appearance and a heated oppressed air as if the faculties were deadened and burnt up though her hand was cold and trembling  her hair still in its elaborate arrangement hung loose untidy untouched her collar and sleeves were soiled and tumbled her dress with its inconvenient machinery of inflation looked wretched from its incongruity and the stains on the huge hanging sleeves  not a moment could have been given to the care of her own person since the sole burthen of nursing had so grievously and suddenly descended on her  marys first instinct was to pour out some warm water and bringing it with a sponge to say would not this refresh you  averil moved petulantly but the soft warm stream was so grateful to her burning brow that she could not resist she put her head back and submitted like a child to have her face bathed saying thank you  mary then begged to remove her tight heavy dress and make her comfortable in her dressinggown  oh i cant  then i could not go back  yes you could this is quite a dress besides one can move so much more quietly without crinoline  i didnt think of that and she stood up and unfastened her hooks perhaps dr may would let me go back now as a mountain of mohair and scarlet petticoat remained on the floor upborne by an overgrown steel mousetrap  perhaps he will by and by but he said you must sleep first  sleepi cant sleep  theres no one but me  i couldnt sleep  then at least let me try to freshen you up  there  you dont know what good it used to do my sister blanche for me to brush her hair i like it  and mary obtained a dreamy soothed submission so that she almost thought she was brushing her victim to sleep in her chair before the maid came up with the viands that dr may had ordered  i cant eat that said averil with almost disgust  take it away  please dont said mary  is that the way you use me miss ward when i come to drink tea with you  oh i beg your pardon was the mechanical answer  mary having made the long hair glossy once more into a huge braid and knotted it up came forth and insisted that they were to be comfortable over their grilled chickens legs  she was obliged to make her own welcome and entertain her hostess and strenuously she worked letting the dry lips imbibe a cup of tea before she attempted the solids then coaxing and commanding she gained her point and succeeded in causing a fair amount of provisions to be swallowed after which averil seemed more inclined to linger in enjoyment of the liquids as though the feverish restlessness were giving place to a sense of fatigue and need of repose  this is all wrong said she with a faint bewildered smile as mary filled up her cup for her  i ought to be treating you as guest miss may  oh dont call me miss may  call me mary  think me a sister  you know i have known something of like trouble only i was younger and i had my sisters  i do not seem to have felt anything yet said averil passing her hands over her face  i seem to be made of stone  you have done and that is better than feeling  done and how miserably  oh the difference it might have made if i had been a better nurse  papa and dr spencer both say you have been a wonderful nurse considering the last word came out before mary was aware  oh dr may has been so kind and so patient with me i shall never forget it  even when i scalded his fingers with bringing him that boiling waterbut i always do wrong when he is thereand now he wont let me go back to leonard  but averil the best nurse in the world cant hold out for ever people must sleep and make themselves fit to go on  not when there is only one and she gasped  all the more reason when there is but one  perhaps it is because you are tired out that you get nervous and agitated  you will be quite different after a rest  are you sure whispered averil with her eyes rounded are you sure that is all the reason  what do you mean said mary  averil drew in her breath and squeezed both hands tight on her chest as she spoke very low they sent me away from mammathey told me papa wanted me then they sent me from him they said i was better with leonard andand i said to myself nothing should make me leave leonard  it was not papamy fatherthat sent you without telling you said mary confidently  no said averil  no i have heard him say that he would take all risks rather than deceive anybody said mary eagerly  i have heard him and dr spencer argue about what they called pious frauds and he always said they were want of faith  you may trust him  he told me leonard was in the state when calm sleep was chiefly wanted  i know he would think it cruel not to call you if there were need and i do not believe there will be need  something like this was reiterated in different forms and though averil never regularly yielded yet as they sat on there came pauses in the conversation when mary saw her nodding and after one or two vibrations in her chair she looked up with lustreless glassy eyes mary took one of these semiwakened moments and in the tone of caressing authority that had been already found effectual said she must sleep in bed took no notice of the murmur of refusal but completed the undressing and fairly deposited her in her bed  marys scrupulous conscience was distressed at having thus led to the omission of all evening orisons but if her own simplehearted loving supplications at the orphans bedside could compensate for their absence she did her utmost  then as both the roomdoor and that of the sickchamber had been left open she stole into the passage where she could see her father seated at the table and telegraphed to him a sign of her success  he durst not move but he smiled and nodded satisfaction and mary after tidying the room and considering with herself took off her more cumbrous garments wrapped herself in a cloak and lay down beside averil not expecting to sleep but passing to thoughts of harry and of that 23rd psalm which they had agreed to say at the same hour every night  by how many hours was harry beforehand with her  that was a calculation that to mary was always like the beads of the chaplain of norham castle  certain it is that after she had seen harry lighting a fire to broil chickens legs in a chinese temple under the willowpattern cannonball tree and heard henry ward saying it was not like a lieutenant in the navy she found herself replying use before gentility and in the enunciation of thisher first moral sentimentdiscovered that it was broad daylight  what oclock it was she could not guess  averil was sound asleep breathing deeply and regularly so that it was a pleasure to listen to her and mary did not fear wakening her by a shoeless voyage of discovery to the place whence dr may was visible  he turned at once and with his noiseless tread came to her  asleep still  so is he  all right  here waken me the moment he stirs  and rather by sign than word he took mary into the sickroom indicated a chair and laid himself on a sofa where he was instantaneously sound asleep before his startled daughter had quite taken everything in but she had only to glance at his haggard wearied face to be glad to be there so as to afford him even a few moments of vigorous slumber with all his might  in some awe she looked round not venturing to stir hand or foot her chair was in the full draught of the dewy morning breeze so chilly that she drew her shawl tightly about her but she knew that this had been an instance of her fathers care and if she wished to make the slightest move it was only to secure a fuller view of the patient from whom she was half cut off by a curtain at the foot of the bed  a sort of dread however made mary gaze at everything around her before she brought her eyes upon himher fathers watch on the table indicating ten minutes to four the minster tower in the rising sunlightnay the very furniture of the room and dr mays position before she durst familiarize herself with leonards appearancehe whom she had last seen as a sturdy ruddy healthful boy looking able to outweigh two of his friend aubrey  the original disease had long since passed into typhus and the scarlet eruption was gone so that she only saw a yellow whiteness that marked by the blue veins of the bared temples was to her mind deathlike  mary had not been sheltered from taking part in scenes of suffering she had seen sickness and death in cottages as well as in her own home and she had none of the fanciful alarms either of novelty or imagination to startle her in the strange watch that had so suddenly been thrust on her but what did fill her with a certain apprehension was the new and lofty beauty of expression that sat on that sleeping countenance  a nice boy rather a handsome lad a boy of ingenuous face they had always called leonard ward when animated with health and spirits and the friendship between him and aubrey had been encouraged but without thinking of him as more than an ordinary lad of good style  now however to marys mind the broad brow and wasted features in their rest had assumed a calm nobility that was like those of ethels favourite championsthose who conquered by suffering and being strong  she looked and listened for the low regular breath almost doubting at one moment whether it still were drawn then only reassured by its freedom and absence from effort that it was not soon to pass away  there was something in that look as if death must set his seal on it rather than as if it could return to the flush of health and the struggle and strife of schoolboy life and of manhood  more than an hour had passed and all within the house was as still as ever and through the window there only came such sounds as seem like audible silencethe twittering of birds the humming of bees the calls of boys in distant fields the faraway sound of waggonwheelswhen there was a slight move and mary in the tension of all her faculties had wellnigh started but restrained herself and as she saw the halfclosed fingers stretch and the head turn she leant forward and touched her fathers hand  dr may was on his feet even before those brown eyes of leonards had had time to unclose and as mary was silently moving to the door he made a sign to her to wait  she stood behind the curtain  you are better for your sleep  yes thank youmuch better  the doctor signed towards a tray which stood by a spiritlamp on a table in the further corner  mary silently brought it and as quietly obeyed the finger that directed her to cordial and spoonwell knowing the needsince that unserviceable right arm always made these operations troublesome to her father  have you been here all night dr may  yes and very glad to see you sleeping so well  thank you  and there was something that made marys eyes dazzle with tears in the tone of that thank you  the doctor held out his hand for the spoon she had prepared and there was another thank you then is ave there  no i made her go to bed  she is quite well but she wanted sleep sorely  thank you again said the boy then with a moments pause dr may tell me now  mary would have fled as breaking treacherously in upon such tidings but a constraining gesture of her father obliged her to remain and keep the cordial ready for immediate administration  my dear i believe you know said dr may bending over himand mary well knew what the face must be saying  both the faint tones asked  recollect the sorrow that they have been spared said dr may in his lowest tenderest tones putting his hand out behind him and signing to mary for the cordial  she could not have borne it and the feebleness of those words made mary eager to put the spoon once more into her fathers hands  that is right my boy  think of their being together and mary heard tears in her fathers voice  thank you again showed that the cordial was swallowed then a pause and in a quiet sad low tone poor ave  your mending is the best thing for her  then came a long sigh and then after a pause the doctor knelt down and said the lords prayerthe orphans prayer as so many have felt it in the hour of bereavement  all was quite still and both he and mary knelt on for some short space then he arose in guarded stillness hastily wiped away the tears that were streaming over his face and holding back the curtain showed mary the boy again sunk into that sweet refreshing sleep  that is well over he said with a deep sigh of relief when they had moved to a safe distance  poor fellow he had better become used to the idea while he is too weak to think  he is better asked mary repressing her agitation with difficulty  i believe the danger is over and you may tell his sister so when she wakes     chapter iii    and a heart at leisure from itself   to soothe and sympathizemiss waring   recovery had fairly set in and better was the universal bulletin eating and drinking the prevailing remedy  henry ward had quickly thrown off his illness  the sense that all depended on him acted as a stimulus to his energies he was anxious to be up and doing and in a few days was downstairs looking over his fathers papers and making arrangements  he was eager and confident declaring that his sisters should never want a home while he lived and when he first entered his brothers room his effusion of affection overwhelmed leonard in his exceeding weakness and the thought of which during the rest of the day often brought tears to his eyes  very grateful to dr may henry declared himself anxious to abide by his advice and discussed with him all his plans  there had been no will but the house and land of course were henrys  the other property gave about £2000 to each of the family and averil had about as much again from the old aunt from whom she had taken her peculiar name  the home of all should of course still be their present one averil would teach her sisters and superintend the house and leonard continue at the school where he had a fair chance of obtaining the randall scholarship in the course of a year or two and if not said henry he may still not lose his university education  my father was proud of leonard and if he would have sent him there why should not i  and when dr may thought how his own elder sons had insisted on greater advantages of education for their juniors than they had themselves enjoyed he felt especially fatherly towards the young surgeon  on only one point was he dissatisfied and that he could not press  he thought the establishment at bankside too expensive and counselled henry to remove into the town and let the house but this was rejected on the argument of the uncertainty of finding a tenant and the inexpediency of appearing less prosperous and considering that mr and mrs ward had themselves made the place dr may thought his proposal hardhearted  he went about impressing every one with his confidence in henry ward and fought successfully at the board of guardians to have him considered as a continuation of his father instead of appointing a new union doctor and he watched with paternal solicitude that the young mans first return to his practice should be neither too soon for his own health or his patients fears giving him no exhortation more earnest nor more thankfully accepted than that he was to let no scruple prevent his applying to himself in the slightest difficulty calling him in to pauper patients and privately consulting in cases which could not be visited gratis  the patronage of henry ward was one of the hobbies that dr may specially loved and he cantered off upon it with vehemence such as he had hardly displayed for years  aubrey recovered with the tardiness of a weakly constitution and was long in even arriving at a drive in the brougham for dr may had set up a brougham  as long as hector ernescliffes home was at stoneborough driving the doctor had been his privilege and the old gig had been held together by diligent repairs but when maplewood claimed him and adams was laid aside by rheumatism flora would no longer be silenced and preached respectability and necessity  dr may did not admit the plea unless adams were to sit inside and drive out of window but then he was told of the impropriety of his daughters going out to dinner in gigs and the expense of flies when flora talked of propriety in that voice the family might protest and grumble but were always reduced to obedience and thus blanches wedding had been the occasion of ethel being put into a hoop and the doctor into a brougham  he was better off under the tyranny than she was in spite of the solitude he had bewailed young adams was not the companion his father had been and was no loss and he owned that he now got through a great deal of reading and at times a great deal of sleep and mourned for nothing but his moon and starsso romantic a regret that dr spencer advised him not to mention it  after aubreys first drives dr spencer declared that the best way of invigorating him would be to send him for a month to the seaside while the house could be thoroughly purified before gertrudes return dr spencer and mary would take care of dr may and ethel had begun to look forward to a teteatete with aubrey by the sea which they had neither of them ever seen when her anticipations were somewhat dashed by her fathers exclaiming that it would be the best thing for leonard ward to go with them  she said something about his not being well enough to travel so soon  oh yes he will said dr may he only wants stimulus to get on fast enough  i declare ill ask henry about it im just going to meet him at the hospital  and before another word could be said he let himself out at the back door of the garden in which they had been meeting richard who was now allowed to come thus far though both for daisys sake and his flocks he had hitherto submitted to a rigorous quarantine and the entire immunity of cocksmoor from the malady was constantly adduced by each doctor as a convincing proof of his own theory  well i do hope that will go off exclaimed ethel as soon as her father was out of hearing  it will be a terrible upset to all ones peace and comfort with aubrey  indeedwhat harm will the poor boy do asked richard  make aubrey into the mere shamefaced sisterhating commonplace creature that the collective boy thinks it due to himself to be in society said ethel and me from an enjoying sister into an elderly caretaking despised spinstera burden to myself and the boys  but why ethel cant you enjoy yourself  my dear richard just imagine turning loose a lot of boys and girls with no keeper to enjoy themselves in some wild sea place  no no the only way to give the arrangement any shade of propriety will be to be elderly infuse as much vinegar as possible into my countenance wear my spectacles and walk at a staid pace up and down the parade while my two sons disport themselves on the rocks  if you really think it would not be proper said richard rather alarmed i could run after my father  stuff richard papa must have his way and if it is to do the boy good i can sacrifice a crabi mean myselfnot a crustacean  i am not going to be such a selfish wretch as to make objections  but if it would not be the correct thing  or could not you get some one to stay with you  i can make it the correct thing  it is only to abstain from the fun i had hoped for  i meant to have been a girl and now i must be a woman thats all and i dare say aubrey will be the happier for itboys always are  if you dont like it i wish you would let me speak to papa  richard have you these five years been the safetyvalve for my murmurs without knowing what they amount to  i thought no one complained unless to get a thing remedied  exactly so  that is man  and experience never shows man that womans growls relieve her soul and that she dreads nothing more than their being acted on  all i wish is that this scheme may die a natural death but i should be miserable and deserved to be so if i raised a finger to hinder it  what must you go  rule daisys lines if she writes to meta please  i did so  i have been trying to make her write straighter  of course you have  i expect i shall find her organ of order grown to a huge bump when she comes home  oh when will our poor remnants be once more a united family and when shall i get into cocksmoor school again  when dr may came home his plan was in full bloom  henry had gratefully accepted it and answered for his brother being able to travel by the next monday and dr may wanted ethel to walk with him to bankside and propose it theretalking it over with the sister and making it her own invitation  ethel saw her fate and complied her father talking eagerly all the way  you see ethel it is quite as much for his spirits as his health that i wish it  he is just the age that our norman was  that was the key to a great deal  ethel knew that her father had never admitted any of the many excuses for the neglect of normans suffering for the three months after his mothers death but though it thrilled her all over she was not prepared to believe that any one far less any ward could be of the same sensitive materials as norman  to avoid answering she went more than halfway by saying dont you think i might ask those poor girls to come with him  by no manner of means said the doctor stopping short  it is just what i want to get him away from his sister  she minds nothing else and if it were not for mary i dont know what the little ones would do and as to henry he is very good and patient but it is the way to prevent him from forming domestic tastes to have no mistress to his house  he will get into mischief or marry if she does not mind what she is about  that must come to an end when leonard is well and goes back to school  and that wont be till after the holidays  no some break there must be  when he is gone mary can put her into the way of doing things she is anxious to do right and we shall see them do very well  but this poor boyyou know he has been always living at home while the others were away he was very fond of his mother and the first coming out of his room was more than he could bear  i must have him taken from home till he is well again and able to turn to other things  and before ethels eyes came a vision of poor mrs ward leaning on her sons arm on saturday afternoon walks each looking fond and proud of the other  she felt her own hardness of heart and warmed to the desire of giving comfort  bankside was basking in summer sunshine with small patches of shade round its young shrubs and trees and a baking heat on the little porch  the maid believed miss ward was in the garden  mr leonard had been taken out today and the doctor moving on they found themselves in the cool pretty drawingroom rather overcrowded with furniture and decoration fresh and tasteful but too much of it and a contrast to the mays mixture of the shabby and the curious in the room that was so decidedly for use and not for show  what arrested the attention was however the very sweetest singing ethel had ever heard  the song was low and sad but so intensely sweet that dr may held up his hand to silence all sound and stood with restrained breath and moistened eyes  ethel far less sensitive to music was nevertheless touched as she had never before been by sound and the more as she looked through the window and saw in the shade of a walnuttree a sofa at the foot of which sat averil ward in her deep mourning her back to the window so that only her young figure and the braids of her fair hair were to be seen and beyond something prostrate covered with wrappers  the sweet notes ended dr may drew a deep sigh wiped his spectacles and went on ethel hung back not to startle the invalid by the sight of a stranger but as averil rose she saw him raising himself with a brightening smile on his pale face to hold out his hand to the doctor  in another minute averil had come to her shaken hands and seated herself where she could best command a view of her brother  i am glad to see him out of doors said ethel  henry was bent on it but i think the air and the glare of everything is too much for him he is so tired and oppressed  i am sure he must like your singing said ethel  it is almost the only thing that answers said averil her eyes wistfully turning to the sofa he cant read and doesnt like being read to  it is very difficult to manage a boys recovery said ethel  they dont know how to be ill  it is not that replied the sister as if she fancied censure implied but his spirits  every new room he goes into seems to beat him down and he lies and broods  if he could only talk  i know that so well said ethel  but to averil the may troubles were of old date involved in the mists of childhood  and ethel seeing that her words were not taken as sympathy continued do not the little girls amuse him  oh no they are too much for him and i am obliged to keep them in the nursery  poor little things  i dont know what we should do if your sister mary were not so kind  mary is very glad began ethel confusedly  then rushing into her subject next week i am to take aubrey to the seaside and we thought if leonard would join us the change might be good for him  thank you averil answered playing with her heavy jet watchguard you are very good but i am sure he could not move so soon  ave called leonard at that moment and ethel perceiving that she likewise was to advance came forth in time to hear o ave i am to go to the sea next week with aubrey may and his sister  wont it  then becoming aware of the visitor he stopped short threw his feet off the sofa and stood up to receive her  i cant let you come if you do like that she said shaking his long thin hand and he let himself down again not however resuming his recumbent posture and giving a slight but effective frown to silence his sisters entreaties that he would do so  he sat leaning back as though exceedingly feeble scarcely speaking but his eyes eloquent with eagerness  and very fine eyes they were  ethel remembered her own weariness some twelve or fourteen years back of the raptures of her babyloving sisters about those eyes and now in the absence of the florid colouring of health she was the more struck by the beauty of the deep liquid brown of the blue tinge of the white and of the lustrous light that resided in them but far more by their power of expression sometimes so soft and melancholy at other moments earnest pleading and almost flashing with eagerness  it was a good mouth too perhaps a little inclined to sternness of mould about the jaw and chin but that might have been partly from the absence of all softening roundness aging the countenance for the time just as illness had shrunk the usually sturdy figure  has ethel told you of our plan asked dr may of the sister  yes she hesitated in evident confusion and distress  you are all very kind but we must see what henry says  i have spoken to henry  he answers for our patching leonard up for next week and i have great faith in dr neptune  leonards looks were as bright as averils were disturbed  thank you thank you very much but can he possibly be well enough for the journey  leonards eyes said i shall  a week will do great things said dr may and it is a very easy journeyonly four hours railway and a ten miles drive  averils face was full of consternation and leonard leant forward with hope dancing in his eyes  you know the place continued dr may coombe hole  quite fresh and unhackneyed  it is just where devon and dorset meet  i am not sure in which county but theres a fine beach and beautiful country the riverses found it out and have been there every autumn besides sending their poor little girl and her governess down when london gets too hot  flora has written to the woman of the lodgings she always has and will lend them the maid she sends with little margaret so they will be in clover  is it not a very long way said averil thinking how long those ten yards of lawn had seemed  not as things go said dr may  you want dr spencer to reproach you with being a stoneborough fungus  there are places in wales nearer by the map but without railway privilege and as to a great gay place they would all be sick of it  do you feel equal to it as if you should like it leonard asked his sister in a trembling wouldbe grateful voice  of all things was the answer  ethel thought the poor girl had suffered constraint enough and that it was time to release the boy from his polite durance so she rose to take leave and again leonard pulled himself upright to shake hands  indeed said ethel when averil had followed them into the drawingroom i am sorry for you  it would go very hard with me to make aubrey over to any one but if you do trust him with me i must come and hear all you wish me to do for him  i cannot think that he will be able or glad to go when it comes to the point said averil with a shaken tone  dr may was nearer than she thought and spoke peremptorily  take care what you are about  you are not to worry him with discussions if he can go he will if not he will stay at home but pros and cons are prohibited  do you hear averil  yes very well  papa you really are very cruel to that poor girl were ethels first words outside  am i  i wouldnt be for worlds ethel  but somehow she always puts me in a rage  i wish i knew she was not worrying her brother at this moment  no averil was on the staircase struggling choking with the first tears she had shed  all this fortnight of unceasing vigilance and exertion her eyes had been dry for want of time to realize for want of time to weep and now she was ashamed that hurt feeling rather than grief had opened the fountain  she could not believe that it was not a cruel act of kindness to carry one so weak as leonard away from home to the care of a stranger  she apprehended all manner of ill consequences and then nursing him and regarding his progress as her own work had been the sedative to her grief which would come on her like an armed man in the dreariness of his absence  above all she felt herself ill requited by his manifest eagerness to leave her who had nursed him so devotedlyher his own sisterfor the stiff plain miss may whom he hardly knew  the blow from the favourite companion brother so passionately watched and tended seemed to knock her down and dr may with medical harshness forbidding her the one last hope of persuading him out of the wild fancy filled up the measure  oh those tears  how they would swell up at each throb of the wounded heart at each dismal foreboding of the desponding spirit but she had no time for them  leonard must not be left alone with no one to cover him up with his wrappers  the tears were strangled the eyes indignantly dried  she ran out at the garden door  the sofa was empty  had henry come home and helped him in  she hurried on to the window leonard was alone in the drawingroom resting breathlessly on an ottoman within the window  dear leonard  why didnt you wait for me  i thought id try what i could do  you see i am much stronger than we thought  and he smiled cheerfully as he helped himself by the furniture to another sofa  i say ave do just give me the mapthe one in bradshaw will do  i want to find this place  i dont think there is a bradshaw said averil reluctantly  oh yes there isbehind the candlestick on the study chimneypiece  very well there were more tears to be gulped downand perhaps they kept her from finding the book  wheres the bradshaw  i didnt see it  i tell you i know it was there  the lefthand candlestick close to the letterweight  ill get it myself  he was heaving himself up when averil prevented him by hastening to a more real search which speedily produced the book  eagerly leonard unfolded the map making her steady it for his shaking hand and tracing the black toothed lines  theres bridportten miles from there  can you see the name ave  no it is not marked  never mind  i see where it is and i can see it is a capital place just in that little jag with famous bathing  i wonder if they will stay long enough for me to learn to swim  you are a good way from that as yet said poor averil her heart sinking lower and lower  oh i shall be well at once when i get away from here  i hope so  why ave he cried now first struck with her tone dont you know i shall  i dont know she said from the soreness of her heart but i cant tell how to trust you with strangers  strangers  you ungrateful child exclaimed leonard indignantly why what have they been doing for you all this time  i am sure miss may at least never came near us till today  im very glad of it  im sick of everything and everybody i have seen  everybody  that was the climax  averil just held her tongue but she rushed to her own room and wept bitterly and angrily  sick of her after all her devotion  leonard the being she loved best in the world  and leonard distressed and hurt at the reception of his natural expression of the weariness of seven weeks sickness and sorrow felt above all the want of his mothers everready sympathy and soothing and as if the whole world here there and everywhere would be an equally dreary waste  his moment of bright anticipation passed into heavy despondency and turning his head from the light he dropped asleep with a tear on his cheek  when he awoke it was at the sound of movements in the room slow and cautious out of regard to his slumbersand voices likewise lowat least one was low the other that whisper of the inaudibility of which averil could not be disabused  he lay looking for a few moments through his eyelashes before exerting himself to move averil her face still showing signs of recent tears sat in a low chair a book in her lap talking to her brother henry  henry was of less robust frame than leonard promised to be and though on a smaller scale was more symmetrically made and had more regular features than either his brother or sister but his eyes were merely quick lively black beads without anything of the clear depths possessed by the others  his hair too was jet black whereas theirs was a pale nut brown and his whiskers long and curling so nearly met under his chin as to betray a strong desire that the hirsute movement should extend to the medical profession  always pointdevice in apparel the dust on his boot did not prevent its perfect make from being apparent and the entire sit of his black suit would have enabled a cursory glance to decide that it never came out of the same shop as dr mays  o henry were the words that he first heard distinctly  it will be much better for every onehimself and you included  yes if  ifnonsense  i tell you he will be quite well enough  see how well i am now how fast i got on as soon as i took to tonicsha leonard old fellow what awake  what do you say to this plan of old mays  it is very kind of him and i should be very glad if i am well enough but next week is very soon said leonard waking in the depression in which he had gone to sleep  oh next week  that is as good as next year in a matter like this as may agreed with me here let us have your pulse  you have let him get low averil  a basin of good soup will put more heart into you and you will feel ready for anything  i have got on today said leonard briskly raising himself as though the cheerful voice had been cordial in itself  of course you have now that you have something to look forward to and you will be in excellent hands the very thing i wanted for you though i could not see how to manage it  i am going to dress  i shall tell them to send in dinner and if i am not down i shall be in the nursery  you wont come in to dinner leonard  no said leonard with a shudder  i shall send you in some gravy soup that you may thank me for  ave never would order anything but boiled chickens for you and forgets that other people ever want to eat  there will be a chance of making a housekeeper of her now  how selfish thought averil to want to get rid of poor leonard that i may attend to his dinners  yet henry had spoken in perfect goodhumour  henry came down with a little sister in each hand they were his especial darlings and with a touch of fatherly fondness he tried to compensate to them for their sequestration from the drawingroom the consequence of averil not having established her authority enough to keep their spirits from growing too riotous for leonards weakness indeed their chatter was henrys sole enlivenment for averil was constantly making excursions to ask what her patient would eat and watch its success and but for his pleasure in the little girls popping about him he would have had a meal as dull as it was unsettled  as soon as the strawberries were eaten he walked out through the window with them clinging to him and averil returned to her post  some music ave said leonard with an instinctive dread of her conversation  she knew her voice was past singing and began one of her most renowned instrumental pieces which she could play as mechanically as a musicalbox  not that jingling airified thing cried leonard i want something quiet and refreshing  theres an evening hymn that the mays have  the mays know nothing of music said averil  stay this is it and he whistled a few bars  that old thing  of course i know that  we had it every sunday at brighton  she began it but her eyes were full of tears partly because she hated herself for the irritation she had betrayed  she was a sound good honesthearted girl but among all the good things she had learned at brighton had not been numbered the art of ruling her own spirit     chapter iv    griefs hidden in the mind like treasures   will turn with time to solemn pleasures   on the monday morning the two convalescents shook hands in the waitingroom at the station surveying each other rather curiously while ethel trying to conquer her trepidation gave manifold promises to averil of care and correspondence  dr spencer acted escort being far more serviceable on the railway than his untravelled friend whose lame arm heedless head and aptitude for missing trains and mistaking luggage made him a charge rather than an assistant  he was always happiest among his patients at home and the world was still ill enough to employ him so fully that ethel hoped to be less missed than usual  indeed she believed that her absence would be good in teaching him marys fullgrown worth and mary would be in the full glory of notability in the purification of the house  the change was likewise for dr spencers good  he had almost broken down in the height of the labour and still looked older and thinner for it and after one night at coombe he was going to refresh himself by one of his discursive tours  he was in high spirits and the pink of courtesy extremely flattered by the charge of ethel and making her the ostensible object of his attention to the relief of the boys who were glad to be spared the sense of prominent invalidism  the change was delightful to them aubrey was full of life and talk and sat gazing from the window as if the line from stoneborough to whitford presented a succession of novelties  whats that old place on the river there with crowstepped gables and steep roofs like a flemish picture  dont you know said leonard it is the vintry mill where my relative lives that wants to make a dusty miller of me  no fear of that old fellow said aubrey regarding him in some dismay youve got better things to grind at  ay even if i dont get the randall next time i shall be sure of it another  youll have it next  i dont know here is a quarter clean gone and the other fellows will have got before me  oh but most of them have had a spell of fever  yes but they have not had it so thoroughly said leonard  my memory is not properly come back yet and your father says i must not try it too soon  thats always his way said aubrey  he would not let ethel so much as pack up my little homer  leonards quick furtive glance at ethel was as if he suspected her of having been barely prevented from torturing him  oh it was not her doing said aubrey it was i  i thought tom would find me gone back and you know we must keep up together leonard and be entered at st johns at the same time  for aubrey devoutly believed in toms college at cambridge which had recovered all dr mays allegiance  the extra brightness was not of long duration  it was a very hot day such as exactly suited the salamander nature of dr spencer but the carriage became like an oven  aubrey curled himself up in a corner and went to sleep but leonards look of oppressed resignation grieved ethel and the blue blinds made him look so livid that she was always fancying him fainting and then his shyness was dreadfulit was impossible to elicit from him anything but no thank you  he did nearly faint when they left the train and while aubrey was eagerly devouring the produce of the refreshment room had to lie on a bench under dr spencers charge for ethels approach only brought on a dangerous spasm of politeness  how she should get on with him for a month passed her imagination  there was a fresher breeze when they drove out of the station up a dorset ridge of hill steep high terraced and bleak but it was slow climbing up and every one was baked and wearied before the summit was gained and the descent commenced  even then ethel sitting backwards could only see height develop above height all green and scattered with sheep or here and there an unfenced turnipfield the road stretching behind like a long white ribbon and now and then descending between steep chalk cuttings in slopes down which the carriage slowly scrooped on its drag leaving a broad blueflecked trail  dr spencer was asleep hat off and the wind lifting his snowy locks and she wished the others were but aubrey lamented on the heat and the length and leonard leant back in his corner past lamentation  down down  the cuttings were becoming precipitous cliffs the drag made dismal groans aubrey after a great slip forward looking injured anchored himself with his feet against the seat by ethel and dr spencer was effectually wakened by an involuntary forward plunge of his opposite neighbour  can this be safe quoth ethel should not some of us get out  much you know of hills you level landers was the answer and just then they were met and passed by four horses dragging up a stage coach after the fashion of a fly on a windowpanea stage coach delightful to the oldworld eyes of dr spencer recalling a faint memory to ethel and presenting a perfect novelty to aubrey  then came a sudden turn upon flat ground and a short cry of wonder broke from aubrey  ethel was sensible of a strange salt weedy smell new to her nostrils but only saw the whiteplastered grayroofed houses through which they were driving but with another turn the buildings were only on one sideon the other there was a wondrous sense of openness vastness freshnesssomething level gray but dazzling and before she could look again the horses stopped and close to her under the beetling weatherstained white cliff was a low fence and within it a verandah and a door where stood floras maid barbara in all her respectability  much wit had been expended by aubrey on being left to the tender mercy of cruel barbara allen in whom ethel herself anticipated a tyrant but at the moment she was invaluable  every room was ready and inviting and nothing but the low staircase between leonard and the white bed which was the only place fit for him while for the rest the table was speedily covered with tea and chickens abbotstoke eggs inscribed with yesterdays date and red mailclad prawns to prove to touch and taste that this was truly seaside the other senses knew it well the open window let in the indescribable salt fresh odour and the entire view from it was shore and sea there seemed nothing to hinder the tide from coming up the ridge of shingle and rushing straight into the cottage and the ear was constantly struck by the regular roll and dash of the waves aubrey though with the appetite of recovery and seaair combined could not help pausing to listen and when his meal was over leant back in his chair listened again and gave a sigh of content  it is one constant hush hushaby he said it would make one sleep pleasantly  his companions combined their advice to him so to use it and in less than half an hour ethel went to bid him good night in the whitest of beds and cleanest of tiny chambers where he looked the picture of sleepy satisfaction when she opened his window and admitted the swell and dash that fascinated his weary senses  my child is all right said ethel returning to dr spencer can you say the same of yours  he must rest himself into the power of sleeping  i must say it was a bold experiment but it will do very well when he has got over the journey  he was doing no good at home  i hope he will here  depend on it he will  and now what are you intending  i am thirsting to see those waves near  would it be against the manners and customs of seaplaces for me to run down to them so late  seaplaces have no manners and customs  ethel tossed on her hat with a feeling of delight and freedom  oh are you coming dr spencer   i did not mean to drag you out  you had rather rest and smoke  this is rest he answered  the next moment the ridge of the shingle was passed and ethels feet were sinking in the depth of pebbles her cheeks freshened by the breeze her lips salted by the spray tossed in by the wind from the wave crests  at the edge of the water she stoodas all others stand therewatching the heaving from far away come nearer nearer curl over in its pride of green glassy beauty fall into foam and draw back making the pebbles crash their accompanying frsch  the repetition the peaceful majesty the blue expanse the straight horizon so impressed her spirit as to rivet her eyes and chain her lips and she receded step by step before the tide unheeding anything else not even perceiving her companions eyes fixed on her half curiously half sadly  well ethel at last he said  i never guessed it she said with a gasp  no wonder harry cannot bear to be away from it  must we leave it as he moved back  only to smooth ground said dr spencer it is too dark to stay here among the stones and crabpots  the summer twilight was closing in lights shining in the village under the cliffs and looking mysterious on distant points of the coast stars were shining forth in the pale blue sky and the young moon shedding a silver rippled beam on the water  if papa were but here said ethel wakening from another gaze and recollecting that she was not making herself agreeable  so you like the expedition  the fit answer to that would be it is very pretty as the cockney said to coleridge at lodore  so i have converted a stoneborough fungus  what to say the sea is glorious  a grand conversion  to find anything superior to minster street  ah you are but half reclaimed  you are a living instance that there is no content unless one has begun life as a fungus  she was startled by his change of tone  true ethel  content might have been won if there had been resolution to begin without it  i beg your pardon she faltered i ought not to have said it  i forgot there was such a cause  causeyou know nothing about it  she was silent distressed dismayed fearing that she had spoken wrongly and had either mistaken or been misunderstood  tell me ethel he presently said what can you know of what made me a wanderer  only what papa told me  hehe was the last person to know  he told me said ethel hurrying it out in a fright that you went awayout of generositynot to interfere with his happiness  then she felt as if she had done a shocking thing and waited anxiously while dr spencer deliberately made a deep hole in the shingle with his stick  well at last he said i thought that matter was unknown to all menabove all to dick  it was only after you were gone that he put things together and made it out  didsheknow said dr spencer with a long breath  i cannot tell said ethel  and how or why did he tell you rather hurt  it was when first you came  i am sure no one else knows it  but he told me because he could not help it he was so sorry for you  they walked the whole length of the parade and had turned before dr spencer spoke again and then he said it is strange  my one vision was of walking on the seashore with her and that just doing so with you should have brought up the whole as fresh as fiveandthirty years ago  i wish i was more like her said ethel  no more was wanting to make him launch into the descriptions dear to a daughters heart of her mother in her sweet serious bloom of young womanhood giving new embellishments to the character already so closely enshrined in his hearers heart the more valuable that the stream of treasured recollection flowed on in partial oblivion of the person to whom it was addressed or at least that she was the child of his rival for from the portrait of the quiet bright maiden he passed to the sufferings that his own reserved nature had undergone from his friends outspoken enthusiasm  the professors visible preference for the youth of secure prospects had not so much discouraged as stung him and in a moment of irritation at the professors treatment and the exulting hopes of his unconscious friend he had sworn to himself that the first involuntary token of regard from the young lady towards one or the other should decide him whether to win name and position for her sake or to carry his slighted passion to the utmost parts of the earth and never again see her face  ethel he said stopping short never threaten providenceabove all never keep the threat  ethel scarcely durst speak in her anxiety to know what cast the die though with all dr spencers charms she could not but pity the delusion that could have made him hope to be preferred to her fatherabove all by her mother  nor could she clearly understand from him what had dispelled his hopes  something it was that took place at the picnic on arthurs seat of which she had previously heard as a period of untold bliss  that something still left in vague mystery had sealed the fate of the two friends  and so said dr spencer i took the first foreign appointment that offered  and my poor father who had spent his utmost on me and had been disappointed in all his sons was most of all disappointed in me i held myself bound to abide by my rash vow loathed tame english life without her and i left him to neglect in his age  you could not have known or expected exclaimed ethel  what right had i to expect anything else  it was only myself that i thought of  i pacified him by talk of travelling and extending my experience and silenced my conscience by intending to return when ordinary life should have become tolerable to mea time that never has come  at last in the height of that pestilential season in india came a letter warning me that my brothers widow had got the mastery over my poor father and was cruelly abusing it so that only my return could deliver him  it was when hundreds were perishing and i the only medical man near when to have left my post would have been both disgraceful and murderous  then i was laid low myself and while i was conquering the effects of cholera came tidings that made it nothing to me whether they or i conquered  this and he touched one of his white curling locks was not done by mere bodily exertion or ailment  you would have been too late any way said ethel  no not if i had gone immediately  i might have got him out of that womans hands and made his life happy for years  there was the sting but the crime had been long before  you know the rest  i had no health to remain no heart to come home and then came vagrancy indeed i drifted wherever restlessness or impulse took me till all my working years were over and till the day when the sight of your fathers weddingring showed me that i should not break my mad word by accepting the only welcome that any creature gave me  and oh surely you have been comforted by him  comforted  cut to the heart would be truer  one moment i could only look at him as having borne off my treasure to destroy it but then there rose on me his loving patient heartbroken humility and cheerfulness and i saw such a character such a course as showed me how much better he had deserved her and filled me with shame at having ever less esteemed him  and through all there was the same dear dick may that never since the day we first met at the pump in the school court had i been able to help loving with all my heartthe only being that was glad to see me again  when he begged me to stay and watch over your sister what could i do but remain while she lived  so he bound you down  oh you know how we thank you no you cant nor what you have been to him and to all of us through the worst of our sad days  and though it was a sacrifice i do not think it was bad for you  no ethel  when you implored me to give up my crimean notion to spare your father pain i did feel for once that you at least thought me of value to some one  i cannot bear you to speak so cried ethel  you to talk of having been of no use  no honest man of principle and education can be utterly useless but when three days ago i recollected that it was my sixtieth birthday i looked back and saw nothing but desultory broken efforts and restless changes  your father told me when i thought him unaware of the meaning of his words that if i had missed many joys i had missed many sorrows but i had taken the way to make my one sorrow a greater burden than his many  but you do not grieve for my mother still said ethel anxiously even his grief is a grave joy to him now and one is always told that such things as it was with you are but a very small part of a mans life  i am not one of the five hundred men whom any one of five hundred women might have equally pleased said dr spencer but it is so far true that the positive pain and envy wore out and would not have interfered with my after life but for my own folly  no ethel it was not the loss of her that embittered and threw away my existence it was my own rash vow and its headstrong fulfilment which has left me no right to your fathers peaceful spirit  how little we guessed said ethel  so cheerful and ready as you always are  i never trouble others he said abruptly  neither man nor woman ever heard a word of all this and you would not have heard it now but for that sea and you have got your mothers voice and some of her ways since you have grown older and more sedate  oh i am so glad said ethel who had been led to view her likeness to her father as natural that to her mother as acquired  those were the last words of the conversation but ethel leaning from her window to listen to the plash of the waves suspected that the slowly moving meteor she beheld denoted that a cigar was soothing the emotions excited by their dialogue  she mused long over that revelation of the motives of the life that had always been noble and generous in the midst of much that was eccentric and wayward and constantly the beat of the waves repeated to her the halfcomprehended words never threaten providence  after superintending aubreys first bath and duly installing the vicem d and her charges dr spencer departed and ethel was launched on an unknown ocean as pilot to an untried crew  she had been told to regard leonards bashfulness as a rare grace but it was very inconvenient to have the boy wretchedly drooping and owning nothing amiss apparently unacquainted with any english words except thank you and no thank you  indeed she doubted whether the shyness were genuine for stories were afloat of behaviour at stoneborough parties which savoured of audacity and she vainly consulted aubrey whether the cause of his discomfiture were her age or her youth her tutorship or her plain face  even aubrey could not elicit any like or dislike wish or complaint and shrugging up his shoulders decided that it was of no use to bother about it leonard would come to his senses in time  he was passive when taken out walking submissive when planted on a threecornered campstool that expanded from a gouty walkingstick but seemed so inadequately perched and made so forlorn a spectacle that they were forced to put him indoors out of the glare of sea and sky and hoping that he would condescend to the sofa when ethel was out of sight  punctilio broke down the next morning and in the midst of breakfast he was forced to lie down and allow ethel to bathe his face with vinegar and water while she repented of the makethebestofit letter of the yesterday and sent aubrey out on a secret commission of inquiry about medical men in case of need  aubrey was perfectly well and in such a state of desultory enjoyment and seaside active idleness that he was quite off her mind only enlivening her morning of nursing by his exits and entrances to tell of fresh discoveries or incidents wonderful to the inland mind  after dinner which had driven leonard to lie on his bed aubrey persuaded his sister to come to see his greatest prize a quaint old local naturalist a seafaring man with a cottage crammed with pans of live wonders of the deep in water and shelves of extinct ones done up in stane pies not a creature by sea or land that had haunted coombe for a few million of ages seemed to have escaped him such seaside sojourns as the present are the prime moments for coquetries with the lighter branches of natural science and the brother and sister had agreed to avail themselves of the geological facilities of their position the fascinations of hugh millers autobiography having entirely gained them during aubreys convalescence  ethel tore herself away from the discussion of localities with the old man who was guide as well as philosopher boatman as well as naturalist and returned to her patient whom she found less feverish though sadly low and languid  i wish i knew what to do for you she said sitting down by him what would your sister do for you  nothing he wearily said i mean a great deal too much  the tone so recalled normans dejected hopelessness that she could not help tenderly laying her cold hands on the hot brow and saying yes i know how little one can do as a sisterand the mockery it is to think that one place can ever be taken  the brown eyes looked at her with moist earnestness that she could hardly bear but closed with a look of relief and soothing as she held her hand on his forehead  presently however he said dont let me keep you in  i have been out thank you  i am so glad to try to do anything for you  thank you  what oclock is it please  ah then i ought to take that draught  i forgot it in the morning  he permitted her to fetch it and pour it out but as she recognized a powerful tonic she exclaimed is this what you are taking  may it not make you feverish  no doubt it does he said lying down again it was only henry  what did not my father know of it  of course he does not as it seems to be poison  not exactly that said ethel but i was surprised for it was talked of for aubrey but they said it wanted watching  just like henry observed leonard  well said ethel repressing her indignation i am glad at least to find a possible cause for your bad night  we shall see you refreshed tomorrow and not wishing yourself at home  dont think that i wish that  home is gone for ever  home may be gone higherup to the real home said ethel blushing with the effort at the hint and coming down to earthlier consolations but even the fragments will grow into home again here and you will feel very differently  leonard did not answer but after a pause said miss may is not it a horrid pity girls should go to school  i am no judge leonard  you see said the boy after the little girls were born my mother had no time for ave and sent her to brighton and there she begged to stay on one half after another learning all sorts of things but only coming home for short holidays like company for us to wonder at her and show her about thinking herself ever so much in advance of my poor mother and now she knows just nothing at all of her  you cannot tell leonard and i am sure she has been devoted to you  if she had stayed at home like you she might have known how to let one alone  oh you cant think what peace it was yesterday  was it peace  i feared it was desertion  it is much better to be by oneself than always worried  to have them always at me to get up my spirits when the house is miserable  ah said ethel i remember your mother rejoicing that she had not to send you from home and saying you were always so kind and gentle to her  did she cried the boy eagerly  oh but she forgot and he hid his face the features working with anguish  so pleased and proud she used to look walking with you on saturday afternoons  those saturdays  they were the only walks she ever would take but she would always come with me  more followed in the same strain and ethel began to gather more distinct impressions of the ward family  she saw that her present charge was warm and soundhearted and that the strength of his affections had been chiefly absorbed by the homely housewifely mother comparatively little esteemed by the modernized brother and sister  of the loss of his father he seemed to think less it seemed indeed rather to reconcile him to that of his mother by the grief it spared her and it confirmed ethels notion that mr ward a busy and dull man paid no great attention to his children between the plaything period and that of full development  the mother was the home and averil though leonard showed both love for and pride in her had hitherto been a poor substitute while as to henry there was something in each mention of him which gave ethel an undefined dread of the future of the young household and a doubt of the result of her fathers kind schemes of patronage  at any rate this conversation had the happy effect of banishing constraint and satisfying ethel that the letalone system was kindness not neglect  she was at ease in discussing fossils though he contributed no word and she let him sleep or wake as he best liked whilst aubrey read to her the cruise of the betsey  henrys prescription was sent to invigorate the fishes when its cessation was found to be followed by the recovery of sleep and appetite and in the cool of the evening by a disposition to stroll on the beach and lie under the lee of a rock upon a railway rug which ethel had substituted for the threelegged delusion  there he was left while his companions went fossilhunting and stayed so long as to excite their compunction and quicken their steps when they at length detached themselves from the enticing blue lias  what has he got there cried aubrey  hillo old fellow have you fallen a prey to a black cat  cat returned leonard indignantly dont you see it is the jolliest little dog in the world  you call that a dog said the other boy with redoubled contempt it is just big enough for little margarets noahs ark  it really is a beauty said ethel  i have known one of floras guests bring a bigger one in her muff  it is the most sensible little brute added leonard  see beg my man beg  and the beauteous little blackcoated king charles erected itself on its hind legs displaying its rich ruddy tan waistcoat and sleeves and beseeching with its black diamond eyes for the biscuit dropped and caught in midair  it was the first time leonard had looked bright  so you expect us to sanction your private dog stealing said aubrey  i have been watching for his mistress to come back said leonard but she must have passed an hour ago and she does not deserve to have him for she never looked back for him and he had run up to me frisking and making much of me as if he had found an old friend  perhaps it will run home when we move  no such thing it trotted close at leonards heels and entered the house with them  barbara was consulted and on leonards deposition that the dogs mistress was in deep mourning opined that she could be no other than the widow of an officer who during his lingering illness had been often laid upon the beach and had there played with his little dogs  this one evidently very young had probably in the confusion of its puppy memory taken the invalid for its lost master  stupid little thing said aubrey just like an undersized ladys toy  it knows its friends  these little things have twice the sense of overgrown dogs as big and as stupid as jackasses  a retort from leonard was welcome in ethels ears and she quite developed his conversational powers in an argument on the sagacity of all canine varieties  it was too late to send the little animal home and he fondled and played with it till bedtime when he lodged it in his own room and the attachment was so strong that it was with a deep sigh that at breakfast he accepted aubreys offer of conveying it home  there she is he exclaimed in the midst gazing from the window  and see the perfection of the animal added aubrey pointing to a broadbacked waddling caricature of the little black fairy  restitution must be made little as she deserves you you little jewel said leonard picking up the object of his admiration  ill take you out  no no i am not so infectious said ethel tying on her hat i had better do it  and after leonards parting embrace to his favourite she received it and quickly overtaking the pensive steps of the lady arrested her progress with i beg your pardon but i think this is your dog  poor little mab as the dog struggled to get to her and danced gladly round her  i missed her last night and was coming to look for her  she joined one of our party said ethel and he was not strong enough to follow you  indeed he has had scarlet fever so perhaps it was better not  but he has taken great care of the little dog and hopes it is not the worse  thank you  i wish poor mab may always meet such kind friends said the lady sadly  she secured her welcome said ethel  we were very grateful to her for it was the first thing that has seemed to interest him since his illness and he has just lost both his parents  ah  thank you  ethel wondered at herself for having been so communicative but the sweet sad face and look of interest had drawn her words out and on her return she made such a touching history of the adventure that leonard listened earnestly and aubrey looked subdued  when they went out leonard refused to spread his rug in that only bed of pulverized shingle and ethel respected his avoidance of it as delicacy to her whose husband had no doubt often occupied that spot  he is a thorough gentleman said she as she walked away with aubrey  he might be an eton fellow was the significant reply  i wonder what made him so said ethel musingly  looking at tom returned aubrey not in jest  even with that advantage i dont quite see where he learnt that refined consideration  pshaw ethel  the light of nature would show that to any one but a stupex  ethel was not sorry that such were aubreys views of courtesy but all thought of that subject was soon lost in the pursuit of ammonites  i wonder what leonard will have picked up now they speculated as they turned homewards with their weighty baskets but what was their amazement when leonard waved his hand pointing to the little black dog again at his feet  she is mine he exclaimed my own  mrs gisborne has given her to me and she is to be the happiest little mite going  given  yes  she came as soon as you were gone and sat by me and talked for an hour but she goes tomorrow to live with an old hag of an aunt  really you seem to have been on confidential terms  i mean that she must be a nuisance because she doesnt like dogs so that mrs gisborne can only take the old one which she could never part with  so she wanted to give mab to some one who would be kind to her and she has come to the right shop hasnt she my little queen  i thought she almost wished it this morning said ethel when she heard how you and mab had taken to each other but it is a very choice present the creature looks to me to be of a very fine sort  now miss may how could you know that  why by her own deportment  dont you know the aristocratic look that all highbred animals haveeven bantams  leonard looked as if this were the most convincing proof of ethels wisdom and proceeded  well she is descended from a real king charles that charles ii brought from france and gave to mrs jane lane and they have kept up the breed ever since  so that mab will have the longest pedigree in stoneborough and we must all respect her said ethel stroking the black head  i am only surprised at leonards forgetting his place said aubrey walking before her majesty indeed  oh attendants do come first sometimes  then it should be backwards  i have a mind to try lying on the beach tomorrow looking interesting to see what will descend upon me  a great yellow mongrel said ethel as always befalls imitators in the path of the hero  what  you mean that it was all the work of leonards beaux yeux  leonard gave a sort of growl intimating that aubrey was exciting his displeasure and ethel was glad to be at home and break off the conversation but in a few minutes aubrey knocked at her door and edging himself in mysteriously said  such fun  so it was your beaux yeux not leonards that made the conquest  i suppose she was touched with what i said of poor leonards circumstances and the pleasure the creature gave him  that is as prosy as mary ethel  at any rate the woman told leonard yours was the most irresistibly attractive countenance she ever saw short of beauty and thats not the best of it for he is absolutely angry  no wonder laughed ethel  no but its about the beauty  he cant conceive a face more beautiful than yours  except the gargoyle on the church tower said ethel gaping into as complete a model of that worthy as flesh and blood could perpetrate  but he means it persisted aubrey fixing his eyes critically on his sisters features but disturbed by the contortions into which she threw them  now dont dont  i never saw any fellow with a hundredth part of your gift for making faces he added between the unwilling paroxysms of mirth at each fresh grimace but i want to judge of you andoh that solemn one is worse than all it is like julius caesar if he had ever been photographedbut really when one comes to think about it you are not so very ugly after all and are much better looking than flora whom we were taught to believe in  poor flora  you were no judge in her blooming days before wear and tear came  and made her like our scotch grandfather  but blanche your own blanche aubrey  she might have extended leonards ideas of beauty  blanche has a pretty little visage of her own but its not so well worth looking at as yours said aubrey  one has seen to the end of it at once and it wont light up  hers is just the may blossom and yours thethei knowthe orchis  i have read of a woman with an orchidaceous face  teeth tongue lips eyes and nose were at once made to serve in hitting off an indescribable likeness to an orchis blossom which was rapturously applauded till ethel relaxing the strain and permitting herself to laugh triumphantly at her own achievement said  there i do pride myself on being of a high order of the grotesque  it is not the grotesque that he means said aubrey he is very cracked indeed  he declares that when you came and sat by him the day before yesterday you were perfectly lovely  oh then i understand and it is no matter said ethel     chapter v    they stwons they stwons they stwons they stwons                                 scouring of the white horse   so wrote ethel in her daily letter to her father mine is at present a maternal mission to leonard and it is highly gratifying i subscribe to all your praise of him and repent of my ungracious murmurs at his society  you had the virtue and i have the reward the usual course of this world for his revival is a very fresh and pleasant spectacle burning hot with enthusiasm  whatever we do he overdoes till i recollect how wilkes said he had never been a wilkite three days ago a portentouslooking ammonite attracted his attention and whereas he started from the notion that earth was dirt and stones were stones the same all over the world he has since so far outstripped his instructors that as i write this he is drawing a plan of the strata with the inhabitants dramatically arranged aubrey suggesting tragic scenes and uncomplimentary likenesses  his talent for drawing shows that averils was worth culture  if our geology alarm richard tell him that i think it safer to get it over young and to face apparent discrepancies with revelation rather than leave them to be discovered afterwards as if they had been timidly kept out of sight  and whether hugh millers theory be right or wrong his grand fervid language leaves the conviction that undoubting confidence in revelation consists with the clearest and most scientific mind                                  june 30thi consider my boys as returned to their normal relations i descended on them as they were sparring like lioncubs at play leonard desisted in confusion at my beholding such savage doings but cool and easy not having turned a hair aubrey panting done up railing at him as first cousin to hercules all as a delicate boast to me of his friends recovered strength  aubreys forte is certainly veneration  his first class of human beings is a large one though quizzing is his ordinary form of adoration  for instance he teases mab and her devoted slave some degrees more than the victim can bear and then relieves his feelings in my room by asseverations that the friendship with leonard will be on the may and spencer pattern  the sea is the elixir of life to both leonard looks quite himself again only more so and aubrey has a glow never seen since his full moon visage waned and not all tan though we are on the high road to be coffeeberries  aubrey daily entertains me with heroic tales of diving and floating till i tell them they will become enamoured of some lady of honour who lives in the sea grow fishes tails and come home no more  and really as the time wanes i feel that such a coast is elysiumabove all the boating  the lazy charm the fresh purity of air the sights and sounds the soft summer wave when one holds ones hand over the tide the excitement of seaweed catching and the nonsense we all talk are so delicious and such new sensations except the nonsense which loses by your absence o learned doctor that i fully perceive how pleasures untried cannot even be conceived  but ere the lotos food has entirely depraved my memory i give you warning to come and fetch us home now that the boys are in full repair  come yourself and be feasted on shrimps and mackerel and take one sail to the mouth of the bay  i wont say who shall bring you it would be fun to have daisy and mary ought to have a holiday but then richard would take better care of you and tom would keep you in the best order could you not all come only if you dont yourself i wont promise not to take up with a merman                                  july 4thvery well  if this is to make a strong man of aubrey tant mieux and even home and cocksmoor yearnings concern me little in this castle of indolence so dont flatter yourself that i shall grumble at having had to take our house on again  let us keep leonard we should both miss him extremely and aubrey would lose half the good without some one to swim scramble and fight with indeed for the poor fellows own sake he should stay for though he is physically as strong as a young megalosaur and in the water or on the rocks all day i dont think his head is come to application nor his health to bearing depression and i see he dreads the return so that he had better stay away till school begins again                                  july 7thoh you weakminded folks  now i know why you wanted to keep me awaythat you might yield yourselves a prey to flora  paper and chintz forsooth  all i have to say is this miss maryas to my room touch it if you dare  i leave papa to protect his own study but for the rest think mary what your feelings would be if harry were to come home and not know what room he was in  if i am to choose between the patterns of chintz i prefer the seaweed variety as in character with things in general and with the present occasion and as to the carpet i hope that flora touched with our submission will not send us anything distressing                                  july 17thcan you send me any more of the new zealand letters  i have copied out the whole provision i brought with me for the blank book and by the way have inoculated leonard with such a missionary fever as frightens me  to be sure he is cut out for such work  he is intended for a clergyman on grounds of gentility i fear and is too full of physical energy and enterprise to take readily to sober parochial life  his ardour is a gallant thing and his home ties not binding but it is not fair to take advantage of his present inflammable state of enthusiasm and the little we have said has been taken up so fervently that i have resolved on caution for the future it is foolish to make so much of a boys eagerness especially when circumstances have brought him into an unnatural dreamy mood and probably these aspirations will pass away with the sound of the waves but they are pretty and endearing while they last in their force and sincerity              just at the age twixt boy and youth               when thought is speech and speech is truth  and ones heart beats at the thought of what is possible to creatures of that age                                  july 21styou who taught us to love our walter scott next to our christian year and who gave us halfcrowns for rehearsing him when other children were learning the robins petition what think you of this poor boy leonard knowing few of the novels and none of the poems no wonder the taste of the day is grovelling lower and lower when people do not begin with the pure high air of his world  to take up one of his works after any of our present school of fiction is like getting up a mountain side after a feverish drawingroom or an offensive street  if it were possible to know the right moment for a book to be really tastednot thrust aside because crammed downno it would not be desirable as i was going to say we should only do double mischief  we are not sent into the world to mould people but to let them mould themselves and the internal elasticity will soon unmake all the shapes that just now seem to form under my fingers like clay  at any rate the introduction of such a congenial spirit to sir walter was a real treat leonard has the very nature to be fired by him and aubrey being excessively scandalized at his ignorance routed a cheap marmion out of the little bookshop and we beguiled a wet afternoon with it aubrey snatching it from me at all the critical passages for fear i should not do them justice and thundering out the battle which stirred the other boy like a trumpet sound  indeed leonard got mab into a corner and had a very bad cold in the head when de wilton was reknighted and when the hand of douglas was his own he jumped up and shouted out well done old fellow  then he took it to himself and read it all over again introductions and all and has raved ever since  i wish you could see aubrey singing out some profane couplet of midnight and not a nose or some more horrible original parody and then dodging apparently in the extremity of terror just as leonard furiously charges him  but you would have been struck with their discussions over it  last night at tea they began upon the woeful result of the wager of battle which seemed to oppress them as if it had really happened did i believe in it  was i of the lady abbesss opinion that               perchance some form was unobserved               perchance in prayer or faith he swerved   this from aubrey while leonard rejoined that even if de wilton had so done it was still injustice that he should be so cruelly ruined and marmions baseness succeed  it would be like a king wilfully giving wrong judgment because the right side failed in some respectful observance  he was sure such a thing could never be  did i ever know of a real case where heaven did not show the right  it was confusing and alarming for both those boys sat staring at me as if i could answer them and those wonderful searching eyes of leonards were fixed as if his whole acquiescence in the dealings of providence were going to depend on the reply that could but be unsatisfactory  i could only try plunging deep  i said it was jobs difficulty and it was a new light to leonard that job was about anything but patience he has been reading the book all this sunday evening and is not de wilton a curious introduction to it  but aubrey knew that i meant the bewilderment of having yet to discover that divine justice is longersighted than human justice and he cited the perplexities of highminded heathen  thence we came to the christian certainty that to do well and suffer for it is thankworthy and that though no mortal man can be so innocent as to feel any infliction wholly unmerited and disproportioned yet human injustice at its worst may be working for the sufferer an exceeding weight of glory or preparing him for some high commission below was not ralph de wilton far nobler and purer as the poor palmer than as henry the eighths courtier  and if you could but have heard our sequel arranging his orthodoxy his scripture reading and his guardianship of distressed monks and nuns you would have thought he had travelled to some purpose only he would certainly have been burnt by one party and beheaded by the other  on the whole i think leonard was a little comforted and i cannot help hoping that the first apparently cruel wrong that comes before him may be the less terrible shock to his faith from his having been set to think out the question by but half a robber and but half a knight                                  august 1styesterday afternoon we three were in our private geological treasury leonard making a spreadeagle of himself in an impossible place on the cliff side trying to disinter what hope springing eternal in the human breast pronounced to be the paddle of a saurian aubrey climbing as high as he durst directing operations and making discoveries i upon a ledge halfway up guarding mab and poking in the debris when one of the bridal pairs with whom the place is infested was seen questing about as if disposed to invade our premises  aubrey reconnoitring in high dudgeon sarcastically observed that all redhaired men are so much alike that he should have said yonder was hec  the rest ended in a view halloo from above and below and three bounds to the beach whereon i levelled my glass and perceived that in very deed it was mr and mrs ernescliffe who were hopping over the shingle  descending i was swung off the last rock in a huge embrace and hectors fiery moustache was scrubbing both my cheeks before my feet touched the ground and blanche with both arms round my waist  they were ready to devour us alive in their famine for a stoneborough face and as flora and mary are keeping home uninhabitable found themselves obliged to rush away from maplewood in the middle of their county welcomes for a little snatch of us and to join us in vituperating the new furniture  if mary could only hear hector talk of a new sofa that he cant put his boots uponhe says it is bad enough at maplewood but that he did hope to be still comfortable at home they have to get back to dine out tomorrow but meantime the fun is more fast and furious than ever and as soon as the tide serves we are to fulfil our longcherished desire of boating round to lyme  i wont answer for the quantity of discretion added to our freight but at least there is six feet more of valour and mrs blanche for my chaperon  bonnie blanche is little changed by her four months matrimony and only looks prettier and more stylish but she is painfully meek and youngersisterish asking my leave instead of her husbands and distressed at her smartness in her pretty shady hat and undyed silk because i was in trim for liasgrubbing  her appearance ought to be an example to all the brides in the place with skirts in the water and nothing on to keep off eyes sun or wind from their faces  i give flora infinite credit for it  blanche and aubrey walk arm in arm in unceasing talk and that good fellow hector has included leonard in the general fraternity  they are highly complimentary saying they should have taken aubrey for harry he is so much stouter and rosier and that leonard is hugely grown here come these three boys shouting that the boat is ready i really think hector is more boyish and noisy than ever                five precious souls and all agog               to dash through thick or thin   ill take the best care of them in my power  goodbye                                  august 2ndsafe back without adventure only a great deal of enjoyment for which i am doubly thankful as i almost fancied we were fey one of the many presentiments that come to nothing but perhaps do us rather good than harm for all that  i hope i did not show it in my letter and communicate it to you  even when safe landed i could not but think of the cobb and louisa musgrove as i suppose every one does we slept at the inn drove with the ernescliffes to the station this morning and came back to this place an hour ago after having been steeped in pleasure  i shall send the description of lyme to daisy tomorrow having no time for it now as i want an answer from you about our going to maplewood  the married babies are bent upon it and hector tries to demonstrate that it is the shortest way home to which i cant agree but as it may save another journey and it will be nice to see them in their glory i told them that if you could spare us we would go from the 29th to the 4th of september  this will bring leonard home four days before the end of the holidays for he has been most warmly invited hector adopting him into the brotherhood of papas pets  i am glad he is not left out and mary had better prove to averil that he will be much happier for having no time at home before the half year begins he still shrinks from the very name being brought before him  let me know if you please whether this arrangement will suit as i am to write to blanche  dear little woman i hope hector wont make a spoilt child of her they are so very young and their means seem so unlimited to them both hector wanting to make her and us presents of whatever we admired and when she civilly praised mab vehemently declaring that she should have just such another if money could purchase or if not he would find a way  thank you hector dear i had rather not placidly responds blanche making his vehemence fall so flat and leonards almost exulting alarm glide into such semimortification that i could have laughed though i remain in hopes that her rather not may always be as prudent for i believe it is the only limit to hectors gifts                                  29th 8 a mfarewell to the coombe of coombes  i write while waiting for the fly and shall post this at weymouth where we are to be met  we have been so happy here that i could be sentimental if leonard were not teteatete with me and on the verge of that predicament  never so happy in his life quoth he and never will be againwonders when he shall gee this white cliff again  but happily in tumbles aubrey with the big claw of a crab which he insists on leonards wearing next his heart as a souvenir of mrs gisborne he is requited with an attempt to pinch his nose therewith and  230 p m weymouththe result was the upset of my ink whereof you see the remains and our last moments were spent in reparations and apologies  my two squires are in different plight from what they were ten weeks ago racing up hills that it then half killed them to come down and lingering wistfully on the top for last glimpses of our bay i am overwhelmed with their courtesies and though each is lugging about twenty pounds weight of stones and mab besides in leonards pocket i am seldom allowed to carry my own travelling bag hector has been walking us about while his horses are resting after their twenty miles but we think the parade and pier soon seen and are tantalized by having no time for portland island only contenting ourselves with an inspection of shop fossils which in company with hector is a sort of land of the three wishes or worse for on my chancing to praise a beautiful lump of purbeck stone stuck as full of paludinae as a pudding with plums but as big as my head and much heavier he brought out his purse at once and when i told him he must either enchant it on to my nose or give me a negro slave as a means of transport leonard so earnestly volunteered to be the bearer that i was thankful for my old rule against collecting curiosities that i do not find and carry myself  august 30th maplewoodi wonder whether these good children can be happier unless it may be when they receive you  how much they do make of us and what a goodly sight at their own table they are they are capable in themselves of making any place charming though the man must have been enterprising who sat down fiveandtwenty years ago to reclaim this park from irreclaimable down  i asked where were the maples and where was the wood and was shown five stunted ones in a cage to defend them from the sheep the only things that thrive here except little white snails with purple lines round their shells there now isnt it awfully bleak says hector with a certain comical exultation  how was a man ever to live here without her and the best of it is that blanche thinks it beautifuldelicious free air open space view over five counties c inside one traces floras presiding genius hector would never have made the concern so perfect without her help and blanche is no child in her own house but is older and more at home than hector so that one would take her for the heiress making him welcome and at ease  not that it is like the grange blanche is furious if i remark any little unconscious imitation or similarityas if we could be like flora and george indeed  nor will they  if blanche rules it will be unawares to herself  and where hector is there will always be a genial house overflowing with goodhumour and goodnature  he has actually kept the 1st of september clear of shooting parties that he may take these two boys out and give them a thorough days sport in his turnipfields  license  nonsense he thought of that before and now aubrey may get some shooting out of george rivers after such goodnature my mouth is shut though ay di me all the world and his wife are coming here on monday evening and unless i borrow of blanche mrs ernescliffes sister will look like ane scrub                                  september 2ndtrain at stoneborough 630  thats the best news i have to give  oh it has been a weary while to be out of sight of you all though it has been pleasant enough and the finale is perfectly brilliant  blanche as lady of the house is a sight to make a sister proud she looks as if she were born to nothing else and is a model of prettiness and elegance  hector kept coming up to me at every opportunity to admire her  now old ethel look at her doesnt she look like a picture  i chose that gown you know then again after dinner well old ethel didnt it go off well  did you ever see anything like her  there just watch her among the old ladies  i cant think where she learnt it all can you  and it certainly was too perfect to have been learnt  it was not the oppression that poor dear flora gives one by doing everything so well as if she had perfectly balanced what was due to herself and everybody else it was just blanche simple and ready pleasing herself by doing what people liked and seeing what they did like it was particularly pretty to see how careful both she and hector were not to put leonard asideindeed they make more of him than of aubrey who is quite able to find his own level  even his tender feelings as to mab are respected and blanche always takes care to invite her to a safe seat on a fat scarlet cushion on the sofa mrs ledwichs wedding present when the footmen with the tea might be in danger of demolishing her  leonard and his fine eyes and his dog were rather in fashion yesterday evening  blanche put out his coombe sketches for a company trap and people talked to him about them and he was set to sing with blanche and then with some of the young ladies  he seemed to enjoy it and his nice modest gentlemanlike manner told  the party was not at all amiss in itself i had a very nice clerical neighbour and it is a very different thing to see and hear hector at the bottom of the table from having poor dear george there  but oh only one dinner more before we see our own table again and tom at the bottom of it  hurrah  i trust this is the last letter you will have for many a day from                          your loving and dutiful daughter                                                   etheldred may     chapter vi    the xii statute

for her sake and thinke it well besette   upon thy love for it maie not be bette                               chaucers court of love   goodbye leonard said ethel as the two families after mustering strong at the station parted at the head of minster street and as she felt the quivering lingering pressure of his hand she added with a smile remember any saturday afternoon  and you will come for the books  glad as she was to be anchored on her fathers arm and clustered round with rejoicing brothers and sisters she could not be devoid of a shade of regret for the cessation of the intimate intercourse of the last nine weeks and a certain desire for the continuance of the confidential terms that had arisen  the moments pang was lost in the eager interchange of tidings too minute for correspondence and in approval of the renovation of the drawingroom which was so skilful that her first glance would have detected no alteration in the subdued tones of paper carpet and chintz so complete was their loyalty to the spirit of perpetuity  flora told no one of the pains that among her many cares she had spent upon those tints not so much to gratify ethel as because her own wearied spirit craved the repose of home sameness nor how she had finally sent to paris for the paper that looked so quiet but was so exquisitely finished that the whole room had a new air of refinement  the most notable novelty was a watercoloured sketch a labour of love from the busy hands in new zealand which had stolen a few hours from their many tasks to send dr may the presentment of his namesake grandson  little dickie stood before them a true son of the hummingbird sprite delicately limbed and featured and with elastic springiness visible even in the pencilled outline  the dancing dark eyes were all metas though the sturdy clasp of the hands and the curl that hung over the brow brought back the reflection of harrys baby days  it would have been a charming picture even if it had not been by metas pencil and of normans child and it chained ethel for more than one interval of longing loving study  tom interrupted her in one of these contemplations  poor flora he said with more feeling than he usually allowed to affect his voice that picture is a hard trial to her  i caught her looking at it for full ten minutes and at last she turned away with her eyes full of tears  i do not wonder said ethel  there is a certain likeness to that poor little leonora and i think flora misses her more every year  such a child as margaret is just the thing to cause the other to be missed  what do you think of margaret this time said ethel for tom alone ever durst seriously touch on the undefined impression that all entertained of floras only child  if flora were only silly about her said tom one might have some hope but unluckily she is as judicious there as in everything else and the child gets more deplorable every year  she has got the look of deformity and yet she is not deformed and the queer sullen ways of deficiency but she has more wit than her father already and more cunning  as long as there is a mind to work on one hopes said ethel  i could stand her better if she were foolish exclaimed tom but i cant endure to see her come into the room to be courted by every one and be as cross as she dares before her mother  behind floras back i dont know which she uses worst her father or her grandfather  i came down upon little miss at last for her treatment of the doctor and neither he nor rivers have forgiven me  poor child  i dont believe she has ever known a moments thorough health or comfort  i always hope that with floras patience and management she may improve  pshaw ethel she will always be a misfortune to herself and everybody else  i have faith in good coming out of misfortunes  illustrated i suppose by ravings about your young ward  mary is crazy about his sister and the doctor lunatic as to the brother who will soon kick at him for his pains  i own to thinking leonard capable of great things  tom made a grimace equal to what ethel could do in that way thrust his hands deep into his pockets and philosophically observed behold the effects of patronage  blind cupid is nothing to him  ethel let it pass caring too much for leonard to set him up as a mark for toms satire which was as different from aubreys as quinine from orangepeel though properly used it was a bracing tonic such as she often found wholesome  a cynical younger brother is a most valuable possession to a woman who has taken a certain position in her own world  tom was a sterling character highly and deeply principled though not demonstrative and showing his scots descent  none of the brothers had been extravagant but tom with the income of his lately achieved fellowship performed feats of economy such as attaining to the purchase of an ultra perfect microscope and he was consistently industrious so exactly measuring his own powers that to undertake was with him to succeed and no one suffered anxiety on his account as dr spencer said he was as sure to fall on his legs as a sandy cat and so nobody cared for him  at home he was sufficient to himself properly behaved to his father civil to richard unmerciful in ridicule but merciful in dominion over the rest except ethel whom he treated as an equal able to retort in kind reserving for her his most highlyflavoured sallies and his few and distant approaches to such confidence as showed her how little she knew him his father esteemed but did not get on with him and his chief and devoted adherent was aubrey to whom he was always kind and helpful in person tom was tall and wellmade of intelligent face of which his spectacles seemed a natural feature wellmoulded finegrained hand and dress the perfection of correctness though the precision and dandyism had been pruned away  ethel would have preferred that leonard and averil should not have walked in on the saturday after her return just when tom had spread his microscope apparatus over the table and claimed marys assistance in setting up objects and she avoided his eye when mary and averil did what he poetically called rushing into each others arms whilst she bestowed her greetings on leonard and mab  then she may come in said leonard  henry has banished her from the drawingroom and we had much ado to get her allowed even in the schoolroom  it is so tiresome said his sister just one of henrys fancies ethel thinking this disloyal remarked that those who disliked dogs in the house could not bear them and did not wonder that tom muttered original  but such a little darling as this cried averil and after mrs ernescliffe had been so kind  mary you must see how clever she is leonard is teaching her to play on the piano  i congratulate you quietly said tom and somehow ethel felt that those three words were a satire on her capable of great things while leonard drew up and averil coloured deferring the exhibition of mabs accomplishments till another time evidently meaning out of toms presence  aubrey is gone to the grange with papa ethel said glad to lead away from mab  he told me he was going said leonard but he said you would be at home  ethel knew that the intonation of that you had curled toms lip with mischief and dreading that leonard should discover and resent his mood she said we think one of your sea eggs has got among ours will you come to the schoolroom and see  and leaving tom to tease and be bored by the young ladies she led the way to the schoolroom where aubreys fossils each in its private twist of paper lay in confusion on the floor whence they were in course of being transferred to the shelf of a cupboard  leonard looked at the disorder with astonished admiration  yes said ethel it is a great mess but they are to have a regular cabinet when richard has time or aubrey has money two equally unlikely chances  how much does a cabinet cost  jones would make a plain deal one for about fiveandtwenty shillings  i cant unpack mine properly said leonard disconsolately  ave is going to make a place for them but henry votes them rubbish  they are dreadful rubbish said ethel  it goes against my conscience to guard them from the housemaid and if my sister flora came in here i should be annihilated  of course one expects that in women  oh richard would be as much distracted  it is a provision of nature that there should be some tidy ones or what would the world come to  it would be a great deal less of a bore  not at all we should stifle ourselves at last if we had our own way never mind leonard we make them go through quite as much as they make us  i am sure i hope so  no no leonard she said becoming less playful we must not do it on purpose  even unconsciously we plague the spirits of order quite enough and they have the right on their side after all  i think a lady is the person to say what one may do or not in the drawingroom dont you said leonard  that depends  and you let your brother spread his things all over yours  so i do but i would not if papa minded it or even if this were richards house and he did not like it  dont begin with worries about trifles pray leonard  it is not i that care about trifles returned the boy  how was one to reckon on a man setting up a monomania about dogs paws in the hall  i have feared we were rather foolish i ought to have reminded you to ask whether mab would be welcome  i was not going to ask leave i have no one whose leave to ask said leonard in tones at first proud then sad  thats a bad beginning returned ethel  as master of the house your brother has a right to your compliance and if you do not all give way to each other you will have nothing but dissension and misery  all to each other yes that is fair  he must have given way to you in letting you keep the dog at all in the house said ethel  it is a real instance of kindness and you are bound to let her be as little in his way as possible  he does mean well i suppose said leonard but he is an awful bother and poor ave gets the worst of it  one has no patience with finikin ways in a man  theres no telling how much i owe to my finikin brother richard said ethel and if you teach ave to be loyal to the head of your family you will do her as much good as you will do harm by chafing against his ordinances  dont you hate such nonsense miss may  i cant love order as much as i honour it  set tastes aside  the point is that if you are to hold together leonard it must be by bearing and forbearing and above all to your elder brother  well it is a blessing that i shall be in school on monday  so it is said ethel but barring these fidgets leonard tell me and she looked kindly at him how is it at home  better than you expected i hope  blank enough said leonard i didnt think i should have minded the sound of the surgery door so much  you will have sunday to help you  yes ave and i have been down to the churchyard ave does care poor girl  she knows better what it is now and she was glad to have me to talk to again though miss mary has been so kind to her  oh nobody can be so much to her as you  poor ave said leonard tenderly  and look here this is my fathers watch and she made me this chain of my mothers hair  and they have given me a photograph of my mothers picture henry had it done long ago but thought it would upset me to give it before i went away  if he could but have guessed how i lay and wished for one  those are the things one never can guess even when one would give worlds to do so  youo miss may you always know the thing that is comfortable  well said ethel what will be comfortable now is that you should be the man above being affronted by other peoples nonsensethe only way to show we did not all spoil each other at coombe  now here is woodstock for you and tell me if this be not your cidaris  oh and we have found out the name of your funny spiked shell  ten minutes of palaeontology ensued and she was leading the way back to the drawingroom when he exclaimed have you heard about the match miss may  match  oh the cricket match  stoneborough against all england on st matthews day so i shall have got my hand in  all england meaning every one that can be scraped up that is not stoneborough returned ethel  george larkins has been over here canvassing tom and aubrey  but you cant be going to play leonard papa does not half like it for aubrey  perhaps not for aubrey said leonard but i am as well as ever and luckily they cant make up a decent eleven without me  you will come and see us miss may  ill find you the jolliest place between the old lime and the cloister door  as if i had not known the meads ages before your time said ethel  i thought you never came to the matches  ah you dont remember my brothers stoneborough days when norman was cricket mad and harry after him and my father was the best cricketer in stoneborough till his accident  yes dr may always comes to see the matches said leonard  you will wont you now miss may  i didnt think you knew anything about cricket but it will be all the better now  ethel laughed and half promised  cocksmoor existed without ethel on that holiday and indeed she was selfreproachful though pleased at finding her presence so great a treat to her father  leonard might do the honours of the limetree nook but she spent but little time there for dr may made her walk about with him as he exchanged greetings with each and all while gertrude led richard about at her will and mary consorted with the ward girls  with no one on her mind ethel could give free attention to the smoothlyshaven battlefield where within the gray walls shaded by the overhanging elms the young champions were throwing all the ardour and even the chivalry of their nature into the contest  the annual game had been delayed by the illness in the spring and the school had lost several good players at the end of the half year but on the other hand the holidays being over george larkins had been unable to collect an eleven either in full practice or with public school training and the veteran spectators were mourning the decay of cricket and talking of past triumphs  the school had the first innings which resulted in the discomfiture of fielder one of their crack champions and with no great honour to any one except folliot the dux and leonard ward who both acquitted themselves so creditably that it was allowed that if others had done as well stoneborough might have had a chance  but when all england went in the game seemed to be more equally balanced  aubrey may in spite of devoted practice under toms instructions was from nervous eagerness out almost as soon as in and in his misery of shame and despair felt like the betrayer of his cause  but in due time with the sun declining and the score still low tom may came forward as the last hope of all england lissom active and skilled walking up to his wicket with the easy confidence of one not greatly caring but willing to show the natives what play might be  and his play was admirable the fortunes of the day began to tremble in the balance every one spectators and all were in a state of eager excitement and aubrey out of tone and unable to watch for the crisis fairly fled from the sight rushed through the cloister door and threw himself with his face down upon the grass shivering with suspense there he lay till a sudden burst of voices and cheers showed that the battle was over  the result  he could not believe eyes or ears as he opened the door to behold the triumphant gestures of stoneborough and the crestfallen air of his own side and heard the words folliot missed two chances of longlegwardtremendous rushcaught him outwith only one run to tie  dr may was shaking hands with leonard in congratulation not solely generous for let his sons be where they would stoneborough triumphs were always the doctors and he was not devoid of gratitude to any one who would defeat tom  noting however the flitting colour fluttering breath and trembling limbs that showed the effect of the days fatigue and of the final exertion he signed back the boys and thrust leonard within the cloister door bidding aubrey fetch his coat and ethel keep guard over him and when he was rested and cooled to take him home to the high street where his sisters would meet him  butsirthesupper gasped leonard leaning against the doorpost unable to stand alone  i dare say  keep him safe ethel  and the doctor shut the door and offered himself to appease the lads who were clamouring for the hero of their cause while leonard sank back on the bench past words or looks for some moments  you have redeemed your pennon with your last gasp said ethel half reproachfully  i was determined panted the boy  i dont know how i did it  i couldnt fail with you looking on  you did it by coming  reply was spared by aubreys return with the coat in one hand and a glass of ale in the other  you are to go home with ethel at once he pronounced with the utmost zest that is as soon as you are rested my father says you must not think of the supper unless you particularly wish to be in bed for a week but well all drink your health and ill return thanksthe worst player for the best  this was the first time aubrey had been considered in condition for such festivities and the gratification of being superior to somebody might account for his glee in invaliding his friend  cricket suppers were no novelties to leonard and either this or his exhaustion must have made him resign himself to his fate and walk back with ethel as happily as at coombe  the sisters soon followed and were detained to drink tea  the cricketers mirth must have been fast and furious if it exceeded that at home for the doctor thought himself bound to make up for the loss to leonard put forth all his powers of entertainment and was comically confidential about these etonians that think so much of themselves  averil was lively and at ease showing herself the pleasant wellinformed girl whom ethel had hitherto only taken on trust and acting in a pretty motherly way towards the little sisters  she was more visibly triumphant than was leonard and had been much gratified by a request from the bankside curate that she would entirely undertake the harmonium at the chapel  she had been playing on it during the absence of the schoolmaster and with so much better effect than he could produce that it had been agreed that he would be best in his place among the boys  ah said the doctor two things in one are apt to be like aubreys compromise between walkingstick and campstoola little of neither  i dont mean it to be a little of neither with me dr may said averil  i shall have nothing to do with my choir on weekdays till i have sent these pupils of mine to bed  are you going to train the choir too asked leonard  i must practise with them or we shall not understand one another besides they have such a horrid set of tunes mr scudamour gave me leave to change them  he is going to have hymnals and get rid of tate and brady at once  ah poor nahum sighed the doctor with such a genuine sigh that averil turned round on him in amazement  yes said ethel im the only one conservative enough to sympathize with you papa  but does any one approve of the new version cried averil recovering from her speechless wonder  dont come down on me said the doctor holding up his hands  i know it all but the singing psalms are the singing psalms to meand i cant help my bad tasteim too old to change  oh but papa you do like those beautiful hymns that we have now cried gertrude  oh yes yes gertrude i acquiesce  they are a great improvement but then wasnt it a treat when i got over to woodside church the other day and found them singing no change of times shall ever shock and he began to hum it  that is the sicilian mariners hymn said averil  i can sing you that whenever you please  thank you on condition you sing the old tate and brady not your o sanctissma o purissima said the doctor a little mischievously  which is eldest i wonder said ave smiling pleased to comply with any whim of his though too young to understand the associations that entwine closely around all that has assisted or embodied devotion  the music went from the sacred to the secular and ethel owned that the perfectly pronounced words and admirable taste made her singing very different from that which adorned most dinnerparties  dr may intensely enjoyed and was between tears and bravos at the charge of the six hundred when the two brothers entered and stood silently listening  that return brought a change  aubrey was indeed open and bright bursting out with eager communications the moment the song ceased then turning round with winning apologies and hopes that he was not interrupting but tom looked so stiff and polite as to chill every one and averil began to talk of the childrens bedtime  the doctor and aubrey pressed for another song so earnestly that she consented but the spirit and animation were gone and she had no sooner finished than she made a decided move to depart and dr may accompanied the party home  is my father going to put that fellow to bed said tom yawning as if injured by the delay of bedtime thus occasioned  your courtesy does not equal his said ethel  nor ever will said tom  never said ethel so emphatically that she nettled him into adding  he is a standing warning against spoiling ones patients  i wouldnt have them and their whole tagrag and bobtail about my house for something  o tom for shame cried mary bursting out in the wrath he had intended to excite  ask him which is tag which rag and which bobtail suggested ethel  mab i suppose said gertrude happily closing the discussion but it was reanimated by her fathers arrival  thats a nice girl he said very nice but we must not have her too often in the evening mary without henry  it is not fair to break up peoples home party  bobber than bobtail murmured tom with a gesture only meant for ethel  ave said he would be out till quite late papa said mary in selfdefence  she ought to have been back before him said dr may  he didnt seem best pleased to have found her away and let me tell you young woman it is hard on a man who has been at work all day to come home and find a dark house and nobody to speak to  mary looked melancholy at this approach to reproof and tom observed in an undertone  never mind mary it is only to give papa the opportunity of improving his pupil while you exchange confidence with your bosom friend  i shall be gone in another month and there will be nothing to prevent the perfect fusion of families  no one was sorry that the evening here came to an end  i hope said dr may at the sundays dinner that the cricket match has not done for that boy i did not see him among the boys  no said mary but he has met with some accident and has the most terrible bruised face  ave cant make out how he did it  do you know aubrey  the doctor and his two sons burst out laughing  i thought said ethel rather grieved that those things had gone out of fashion  so ethels protege or prodigy which is it said tom is turning out a muscular christian on her hands  is a muscular christian one who has muscles or one who trusts in muscles asked ethel  or a better cricketer than an etonian added the doctor  tom and aubrey returned demonstrations that etons glory was untarnished and the defeat solely owing to such a set of sticks  aubrey said ethel in their first private moment was this a fight in a good cause for if so i will come down with you and see him  aubrey made a face of dissuasion ending in a whistle  do at least tell me it is nothing i should be sorry for she said anxiously  he screwed his face into an intended likeness of ethels imitation of an orchis winked one eye and looked comical  i see it cant be really bad said ethel so i will rest on your assurance and ask no indiscreet questions  you didnt see then said aubrey aggrieved at the failure of his imitation  you dont remember the beauty he met at coombe  beauty  none but mab  well they found it out and chaffed him  fielder said he would cut out as good a face out of an old knob of apple wood and the doctor in petticoats came up again he got into one of his rages and they had no end of a shindy better than any they say since lake and benson fifteen years ago but ward was in too great a passion or he would have done for fielder long before old hoxton was seen mooning that way so you see if any of the fellows should be about it would never do for you to be seen going to bind up his wounds but i can tell him you are much obliged and all that  obliged indeed said ethel  what for making me the laughingstock of the school  no indeed cried aubrey distressed  he said not a wordthey only found it outbecause he found that seat for you and papa sent him away with you  they only meant to poke fun and it was his caring that made it come home to him  i wonder you dont like to find that such a fellow stood up for you  i dont like to be made ridiculous  tom does not know it and shall not eagerly interposed aubrey  thank you said she with all her heart  then dont be savage  you know he cant help it if he does think you so handsome and it is very hard that you should be affronted with him just when he cant see out of one of his eyes  for that matter said ethel her voice trembling one likes generosity in any sort of a cause but as to this the only way is to laugh at it  aubrey thought this only way hardly taken by the cachinnation with which she left him for he was sure that her eyes were full of tears and after mature consideration he decided that he should only get into a fresh scrape by letting leonard know that she was aware of the combat and its motive  if i were ten years younger this might be serious meditated ethel happily it is only a droll adventure for me in my old age and i have heard say that a little raving for a grownup woman is a wholesome sort of delusion at his time of life  so i need not worry about it and it is pretty and touching while it lasts good fellow  ethel had in fact little occasion to worry herself for all special manifestations of leonards devotion ceased  whether it were that tom with his grave satirical manner contrived to render the house disagreeable to both brother and sister or whether leonards boyish bashfulness had taken alarm and his admiration expended itself in the battle for her charms there was no knowing  all that was certain was that the wards seldom appeared at dr mays although elsewhere mary and aubrey saw a great deal of their respective friends and through both ethel heard from time to time of leonard chiefly as working hard at school but finding that his illness had cost him not only the last half years learning but some memory and power of application  he was merging into the ordinary schoolboya very good thing for him no doubt though less beautiful than those coombe fancies  and what were they worth     chapter vii    little specks of daily trouble   petty grievance petty strife   filling up with drops incessant   to the brim the cup of life    deeper import have these trifles   than we think or care to know   in the air a feather floating   tells from whence the breezes blowrev g monsell   the first brightening of the orphaned house of bankside had been in leonards return  the weeks of his absence had been very sore ones to averil while she commenced the round of duties that were a heavy burthen for one so young and became instead of the petted favourite the responsible head of the house  she was willing and glad to accept the care of her little sistersdocile bright childrenwho were pleased to return to the orderly habits so long interrupted and were so intelligent that her task of teaching was a pleasant one and almost motherly love towards them grew up as she felt their dependence on her and enjoyed their caresses  with henry she had less in common  he expected of her what she had not learnt and was not willing to acquire  a man interfering in the womans province meets little toleration and henry was extremely precise in his requirements of exact order punctuality and excellence in all the arrangements of his house  while breaking her in to housekeeping he made himself appear almost in the light of a taskmasterand what was worse of a despised taskmaster  averil thought she could not respect a brother whose displeasure was manifested by petulance not sternness and who cared not only about his dinner but about the tidy appearance of the drawingroomnay who called that tasty which she thought vulgar made things stiff where she meant them to be easy and elegant and prepared the place to be the butt of tom mays satire  henry was not a companion to her  his intellect was lower his education had not been of the same order and he had not the manly force of character that makes up for everything in a womans eyes where she had talents he had pretensionsjust enough to make his judgments both conceited and irritating and where her deeper thoughts and higher aspirations were concerned she met either a blank or a growing jealousy of the influence of the clergy and of the may family  yet henry ward was really a good brother sacrificing much to his orphan sisters and living a moral and religious lifesuch as gained for him much credit and made mrs ledwich congratulate averil on the great excellence and kindness of her incomparable brother  averil assented and felt it a dreary thing to have an incomparable brother  but when leonard came home the face of the house was changed  now she had something to look forward to  now there was something to hear that stirred her deeper feelingssome one who would understand and respondsome one to make common cause with  little as she saw of the schoolboy there was life in her day for sympathy and comprehension had come home with him  after all there were recesses in leonards confidence to which ave did not penetrate but there was quite enough to be very happy upon especially those visions that had been built on the melanesian letters they were not near enough to terrify her with the thought of separation and she was sufficiently imbued with mary mays sentiments to regard missionwork as the highest ambition  leonards strong will and manly disposition would have obtained her homage and affection even without the lofty sentiments and the lesser graces that made the brother and sister thoroughly suited to one another and the bond of union was unfortunately cemented by equal annoyance at henrys peculiarities  it certainly was rather hard on a young head of a family to have a younger brother his superior in every respect and with an inseparable sister  that henry had not found out leonards superiority was no reason that it should not gall him and his selfassertions were apt to be extremely irritating  even in the first flush of welcome he had made it plain that he meant to be felt as master of the house and to enforce those petty regulations of exact order that might be easily borne from a mother or played with in a sisterwould be obeyed grudgingly from a father but could be intolerable in a brother  the reception of mab and the ammonites was but an earnest of similar ungracious acts on the one hand and aggressions on the other often unintentional  averil did indeed smooth matters but she shared leonards resentment and outward submission was compensated by murmur and mockery in private  still the household worked on fairly and mrs ledwich was heard to declare with tears in her eyes that it was beautiful to see such a happy family of love as those dear young wards  the happy familyin trafalgar square muttered dr spencer  the confidence of the happy family was on this wise  when leonard came home with his unpresentable face he baffled all aves anxious questions and she was only enlightened by henrys lamentations in his absence over the hopelessness of a brother who was so low and vulgar as to box  her defence being met by a sneer she flew to tell leonard of the calumny and was laughed at for her innocence but extorted that he had fought with a fellow that talked impudently of some of the mayscause fully sufficient in her eyes nor did henry utter any open reproof though he contrived to exasperate his brother into fierce retort and angry gesture by an unnecessary injunction not to show that ungentlemanly face  full consciousness of the difficulties presented by the characters of the two brothers would have been far too oppressive and perhaps it was better for averil that she had it not but had her own engrossing interests and employments drawing off her attention and enlivening her spirits  her church music was her object in lifethe dedication of the talent that had been cultivated at so much time and cost and the greatest honour and enjoyment she could imagine and she had full participation from leonard who had a hearty love for sacred music readily threw himself into her plans and offered voice and taste to assist her experiments  nor had her elder brother any objection to her being thus brought forward he was proud of her performance and gratified with the compliments it elicited and all went well till the new hymnals arrived and books upon books full of new tunes anthems and chants were accumulating on the musicstand  what are you about there all the evening not opening your lips  leonard is writing out his verses and i am copying music  i wonder you neither of you will remember that that table was never meant to be littered over with all sorts of rubbish  i thought tables were to put things on returned leonard coolly  drawingroom tables were not made to be inked  that cover will be ruined in a day or two  very wellthen well pay for it said leonard in the same aggravating tone  here are newspapers spread between it and the ink said averil displaying them with an air of injured innocence that made henry subside but he presently exclaimed  is that copying to go on all night  cant you speak nor play anything to send one off to sleep  with a martyr look yet a satirical glance averil opened the piano and henry settled himself in the masters armchair as one about to enjoy wellearned rest and entertainment after a hard days work  i say what doleful drone have you there  i am trying a new chant for the nunc dimittis  nothing but that day and night  give us something worth hearing  i thought you only wanted to go to sleep  i dont want to dream myself into church listening to scudamours proses ive quite enough of that on sunday  ave began to play one of her school waltzes and the touch of her fingers on the keys had so sharpedged and petulant a tone that leonard smiled to himself as he ran his fingers through his hair over his books  nor was it soothing to henry who instead of going to sleep began to survey the room and get food for annoyance  i say said he looking across at a little brassbarred bookcase of ornamental volumes on the opposite chiffonniere what book is out there  scotts lay said leonard it is up in my room  i told you ave not to let the drawingroom books be carried about the house to be spoilt said henry who seldom reproved his brother direct but generally through ave  youd better get some made of wood then said leonard  remember then ave i say i will not have my books taken out and left about over the house  leonard dashed out of the room passionately and presently came thundering down again every step audible the whole way and threw the book on the table bringing in a whirlwind and a flaring sloping candle dropping upon the precious cloth  henry started up and pointed  im glad of it exclaimed leonard it will be a little amusement for you  good night ave  im going to finish upstairs since one cant read write or touch a book without your being rowed  he was gone and averil though rather frightened gave him infinite credit for keeping his temper and perhaps he deserved it considering the annoyance and the nature of the provocation but she did not reflect how much might have been prevented by more forethought and less preoccupation  she said not a word but quietly returned to her copying and when henry came with paper and poker to remove the damage she only shoved back her chair and sat waiting pen in hand resigned and ironical  i declare grumbled henry as he examined the remaining amount of damage these dayschools are a great inconvenience theres no keeping a place fit to be seen with a great uncivilized lad always hanging about  leonard is considered particularly gentlemanlike said ave with lips compressed to keep back something about old bachelors  now i should have thought a lady would have some regard to her own drawingroom and object to slovenlinesselbows on table feet everywhere  nothing is in worse taste than constraint said ave from the corners of her mouthat least for those that can trust their manners without it  i tell you ave you are spoiling the boy  he is more conceited than ever since the mays noticed him  leonard conceited  yes he is getting as stuck up as tom may himselfyour model i believe  i thought he was yours  mine  yes you always seem to aim at a poor imitation of him  there was a blushing angry stammer in reply and she suppressed her smile but felt triumphant in having hit the mark  unready at retort he gathered himself up and said well ave i have only this to say that if you choose to support that boy in his impertinences there will be no bearing it and i shall see what i shall do  seeing what shall be done is a threat stimulating to some but appalling to others and averil was of the latter class with no desire for such a spectacle be it what it might  she did not apologize for the triflepossible ink a spot of wax a borrowed book were far beneath an apology but she made up her mind to humour henrys follies magnanimously and avoid collisions like an admirable peacemaker  as soon as bedtime came she repaired to leonards room and henry as he went along the passage heard the two young voices ringing with laughter  her retort had been particularly delightful to leonard thats right ave  im glad you set him down for i thought afterwards whether i ought not to have stood by you only his way of pitching into me through you puts me into such a rage i shall do something desperate some day  never mind it leonard it does not hurt me and if it did i should like to bear a great deal for you  thats all the wrong way said leonard smiling affectionately  no men do and women suffer  thats trite said leonard patting her fondly  i like you to doas you call itmiss may does and every one that is worth anything i say ave when i go out to the islands you are coming too  oh yes  i know i could do a great deal  if nothing else i could sing and they have a great aptitude for singing mary was telling me but that reminds me i must finish copying the hymn for next sunday henry hindered me and i have six copies more to do  ill do some of them said leonard  let us go down now the coast is clear if the fire is not out  they went down softly mab and all nursed up the fire that henry had raked out and if saturnalia could be held over the writing out of a hymn tune they did it  at any rate it had the charm of an assertion of independence and to averil it was something like a midnight meeting of persecuted christiansto leonard it was great fun  that evening was not a solitary specimen  averil and leonard intended to obviate causes of offence but they were young and heedless and did not feel bound to obedience  a very little temptation made them forget or defy henrys fancies and leonard was easily lashed into answers really unbecoming and violent for which he could not bring himself to be sorry when he thought over the petty interference and annoyance that had caused them  these small tyrannies and frets made averil the more devoted to the music which was her rest her delight and not only exalted her above cares but sanctioned her oblivion of them  the occupation grew upon her never ending still beginning with fresh occasions for practice and new lessons but though bankside boys were willing to be taught yet it was chiefly in hope of preferment as choristers at the minster and she soon found that a scholar no sooner proved his voice good for anything than he went off to be trained for the choir on the foundation which fed clothed and apprenticed its young singers  she found she must betake herself to an elder race if she wanted a reliable staff of voices and some young men and women showing themselves willing a practice with mr scudamour to keep order was organized for late evenings twice in the week  this was rather much  henry opposed at first on the ground that the evening would be broken up to which she answered that for such a purpose they ought to be willing to sacrifice a little domestic comfort and when he muttered a petulant pshaw looked at him in reproof for sacrilege  she was not going to be one of the womankind sitting up in a row till their lords and masters should be pleased to want them  next he insisted that he would not have her going about the place after dark but she was fortified by the curates promise to escort her safely and reduced him to a semiimprecation which she again viewed as extremely wicked  the existence of that meek little helpless mrs scudamour always shut up in a warm room with her delicate baby cut off henry from any other possible objection and he was obliged to submit  leonard would gladly have been his sisters companion on her expeditions but he must remain at home and prepare for the morrows schoolwork and endure the first hour of dreariness unenlivened by her smile and greeting and what was worse without the scanty infusion of peace produced by her presence  her rapid departure after dinner always discomposed henry and the usual vent for his illhumour was either a murmur against the clergy and all their measures or the discovery of some of leonards transgressions of his code  fretted and irritable at the destruction of evening comfort he in his turn teased the fiery temper of his brother  if there were nothing worse his grumbling remarks interrupted and too often they were that sort of censure that is expressively called nagging leonard would reply angrily and the flashes of his passion generally produced silence neither brother spoke to averil of these evening interludes which were becoming almost habitual but they kept leonard in a constant sore sense of injury yet of uneasy conscience he looked to the randall scholarship as his best hope of leaving home and its torments but his illness had thrown him back he had not only lost the last quarter but the acquirements of the one before it were obscured and the vexations themselves so harassed and interrupted his evening studies that he knew it was unreasonable to hope for it at the next examination which from various causes was to come after the christmas holidays and it would be well if he could even succeed in the summer  innocent as the mays were of the harmonium business henry included them in the annoyance it gave  it was the work of the curateand was not dr may one in everything with the clergy had he not been instrumental in building the chapel was it not the mays and the clergy who had made ave inconveniently religious and opinionative to say nothing of leonard the whole town was priestled and bigoted and dr may was the despot to whom all bowed down  this was an opinion henry would hardly have originated it was the shaft of an abler man than heno other than harvey anderson who had lately become known to the world by a book proving king john to have been the most enlightened and patriotic of english sovereigns enduring the interdict on a pure principle of national independence and devising magna charta from his own generous brainin fact presenting a magnificent and misunderstood anticipation of the most advanced theories of the nineteenth century  the book had made so much noise in the world that the author had been induced to quit his college tutorship and become editor of a popular magazine  he lived in london but often came down to spend sunday with his mother and had begun to be looked on as rather the lion of the place  henry took in his magazine and courted his notice often bringing him into averils way that she might hear her heroes treated with irony more effectual than homemade satire but ave was staunch  she hated the sight of mr anderson never cut the leaves of his magazine and if driven to sing to him took as little pains as her musical nature would let her do but the very strength of her dislike gave it an air of prejudice and it was set down less to principle than to party spirit and may influence  there was another cause for henrys being soured  he was not of the nature to be filial with dr may and therefore gratitude oppressed and patronage embittered him  the first months of warm feeling at an end the old spirit of independence revived and he avoided consulting the physician as much as possible  more than once his management of a case was not approved by dr may and the strong and hasty language and the sharp reproofs that ensued were not taken as the signs of the warm heart and friendly interest but as the greatest offencessullenly but not the less bitterly endured  moreover one of the whitford surgeons had been called in by a few of the outlying families who had hitherto been patients of the wards and worse than all mrs rivers took her child up to london for three days in november and it became knownthrough a chain of tonguesthat it was for the enlargement of tonsils on which mr ward had operated a year before  old may was playing him false was henrys cry  his professions were humbug  he would endure no one who did not submit to his dictation and he would bring in a stranger to ruin them all  little did henry know of dr mays near approach to untruth in denying that he had a house to let to the opposition surgeonof his attestations to his daughter that young ward was a skilful operatoror of his vexation when she professed herself ready to undergo anything for his pleasure but said that little margarets health was another thing  yet even this might have been forgiven but for that worst rub of alltom mays manners  his politeness was intensemost punctilious and condescending in formand yet provoking beyond measure to persons who like henry and averil had not playfulness enough to detect with certainty whether they were being made game of or not nor whether his smoothlyuttered compliments were not innuendoes henry was certain of being despised and naturally chafed against the prospect of the future connection between the two medical men of the town and though tom was gone back to cambridge it was the rankling remembrance of his supercilious looks that more than any present offence or independence of spirit made the young surgeon kick against direction from the physician  here too averil was of the same mind  she had heard tom may observe that his sister gertrude would play quite well enough for a lady for the mission of a ladys music was to put one to sleep at home and cover conversation at a party as to the restunprofessionals were a mistake  after that the civil speeches with which tom would approach the piano only added insult to injury     chapter viii    neer readier at alarmbells call   thy burghers rose to man thy wall   than now in danger shall be thine   thy dauntless voluntary linemarmion   drive fast will said dr may hastily stepping into his carriage in the early darkness of a december evening  five already and he is to be there by 525  he was no other than harry may and there was the station  with the tidings of the terrible fight of peiho had come a letter from a messmate of harrys with an account of his serious wound in the chest describing it as just short of immediately dangerous  another letter had notified his amendment and that he was invalided home a few cheery words from harry himself scrawled at the end showing that his power was far less than his goodwill and after two months waiting and suspense a telegram had come from plymouth with the words stoneborough 525  in ignorance as to the state of the traveller and expecting to find him in a condition requiring great care and watching dr may had laid his injunctions on the eager family not to rush up to the station en masse to excite and overwhelm but to leave the meeting there entirely to himself and his brougham  he had therefore been exceedingly annoyed that one of henry wards pieces of selfassertion had delayed him unnecessarily at a consultation and when at last he had escaped he spent most of his journey with his body half out of the window hurrying will adams and making noises of encouragement to the horse or else in a strange tumult of sensation between hope and fear pain and pleasure suspense and thankfulness the predominant feeling being vexation at not having provided against this contingency by sending richard to the station  after all the best efforts of the stout old chestnut he and the train were simultaneously at the station and the passengers were getting out on the opposite platform  the doctor made a dash to cross in the rear of the train but was caught and held fast by a porter with the angry exclamation shes backing sir and there he stood in an agony feeling all harrys blank disappointment and the guilt of it besides and straining his eyes through the narrow gaps between the blocks of carriages  the train rushed on and he was across the line the same instant but the blank was his  up and down the gaslighted platform he looked in vain among the crowd only his eye suddenly lit on a black case close to his feet with the three letters may and the next moment a huge chest appeared out of the darkness bearing the same letters and lifted on a truck by the joint strength of a green porter and a pair of broad blue shoulders  too ill to come ontelegraph mail trainrushed through the poor doctors brain as he stepped forward as if to interrogate the chest  the blue shoulders turned a ruddy sunburnt face lighted up and the inarticulate exclamation on either side was of the most intense relief and satisfaction  where are the rest said harry holding his fathers hand in no sick mans grasp  at home i told them not to come up i thought  well well walk down together  ive got you all to myself  i thought you had missed my telegram  hollo will how dye do what this thing to drive down in  i thought you were an invalid harry said dr may with a laughing yet tearful ring in his agitated tone as he packed himself and his son in  ay  i wished i could have let you know sooner how well i had got over it said harry in the deep full voice of strong healthy manhood  i am afraid you have been very anxious  we are used to it my boy said the doctor huskily stroking the great firm fingers that were lying lovingly on his knee and if it always ends in this way it ought to do us more good than harm  it has not done harm i hope said harry catching him up quick not to old mary  no mary works things off good girl  i flatter myself you will find us all in high preservation  allall at home  thats right  yes those infants from maplewood and all  you are sure you are all right harry  as sure as my own feelings can make me and the surgeon of the dexter to back them said harry  i dont believe my lungs were touched after all but you shall all sit upon me when you liketom and all it was a greater escape than i looked for he added in a lower voice i did not think to have had another christmas here  the silence lasted for the few moments till the carriage drew up behind the limes the doors were thrown open and the doctor shouted to the timid anxious figure that alone was allowed to appear in the hall come and lift him out mary  the drawingroom was a goodly sight that evening and the doctor as he sat leaning back in weary happiness might be well satisfied with the bright garland that still clustered round his hearth though the age of almost all forbade their old title of daisies  the only one who still asserted her right to that name was perched on the sailors knee insisting on establishing that there was as much room for her there as there had been three years ago though as he had seated himself on a low footstool her feet were sometimes on the ground and moreover her throne was subject to sudden earthquakes which made her nothing loth cling to his neck draw his arm closer round her and lean on his broad breast proud that universal consent declared her his likeness in the family and the two presenting a pleasant contrasting similaritythe open honest features blue eyes and smile expressive of hearty goodwill and simple happiness were so entirely of the same mould in the plump whiteskinned rosycheeked goldenhaired girl and in the large powerful bronzed ruddy sailor with the thick mass of curls at which tom looked with hostility as fixed though less declared than that of his eton days  those were the idle members upon the hearthrug  on the sofa with a small table to herself and a tall embroidery frame before her nearly hiding her slight person sat mrs ernescliffe her pretty head occasionally looking out over the top of her work to smile an answer and her artistically arranged hair and the crispness of her white dress and broad blue ribbons marking that there was a step in life between her and her sisters her husband sat beside her on the sofa with a red volume in his hand with orders the only word visible above the fingers one of which was keeping his place hector looked very happy and spirited though his visage was not greatly ornamented by a moustache sandier even than his hair giving effect to every freckle on his honest face  a little behind was mary winding one of blanches silks over the back of a chair and so often looking up to revel in the contemplation of harrys face that her skein was in a wild tangle which she studiously concealed lest the sight should compel richard to come and unravel it with those wonderful fingers of his  richard and ethel were arranging the sick albums which they had constructedone of cheap religious prints with texts and hymns to be lent in cases of lingering illness the other commonly called the profane of such scraps as might please a sick child pictures from wornout books or advertisements which ethel was colouringaubrey volunteering aid that was received rather distrustfully as his love of effect caused him to array the model schoolchildren in colours gaudy enough as gertrude complained to corrupt a saint  nor was his dilettante help more appreciated at a small stand well provided with tiny drawers and holding a shaded lamp according to gertrude burning something horrible ending in gen that would kill anybody but tom who managed it but which threw a beautiful light upon the various glass dishes tubes and slides and the tall brass microscope that tom was said to love better than all his kith and kin and which afforded him occupation for his leisure moments  i say harry he asked did you get my letter  your letterof what date  i got none since marys of the second of may when every one was down in the fever  poor old ward i never was more shocked what is become of the young ones  oh you must ask mary miss ward is a bosom friend of hers  what the girl that sang like the lark  i must hear her again  but she wont be in tune for singing now poor thing  what are they doing henry ward taken to the practice  he used to be the dirtiest little sneak going but i hope he is mended now  ask my father said mischievous tom and dr may answered not nor revealed his days annoyance with henry  he is doing his best to make a home for his brother and sisters said richard  my letter said tom was written in whitsun week i wish you had had it  ay it would have been precious from its rarity said harry  what commission did it contain may i ask  you have not by good luck brought me home a chinese flea  he has all the fleas in creation said daisy confidentially cats and dogs and hedgehogs and human and you would have been twice as welcome if you had brought one  ive brought no present to nobody  id got my eye on a splendid ivory junk for blanches wedding present at canton but i couldnt even speak to send any one after it  you have uncommon bad luck for a sailors relatives  as long as you bring yourself home we dont care said blanche treating the loss of the junk with far more resignation than did tom that of the flea  if you only had a morsel of river mud sticking anywhere added tom you dont know the value the infusoria might be  i had a good deal more than a morsel sticking to me once said harry it was owing to my boats crew that i am not ever so many feet deep in it now like many better men  they never lost sight of me and somehow hauled me out  gertrude gave him a hug and marys eyes got so misty that her skein fell into worse entanglements than ever  were you conscious asked ethel  i cant say  im clear of nothing but choking and gasping then and a good while after  it was a treacherous unlucky affair and im afraid i shall miss the licking of rascally john chinaman  if all i heard at plymouth is true we may have work handy to home  at home you may say said his father dulce et c is our motto didnt you know what a nest of heroes we have here to receive you let me introduce you to captain ernescliffe of the dorset volunteer rifle corps private thomas may of the cambridge university corps and mr aubrey spencer may for whom i have found a rifle and am expected to find a uniform as soon as the wise heads have settled what colour will be most becoming  becoming  no papa indignantly shouted aubrey it is the colour that will be most invisible in skirmishing  gray faced with scarlet said hector decidedly  yes that is the colour of the invincible dorsets said dr may there you see our great authority with his military instructions in his hand  no sir replied hector its not military instructions it is craufords general orders  and added the doctor theres his bride working the colours and mary wanting to emulate her  i dont think george will ever permit us to have colours said ethel he says that rifles have no business with them for that they are of no use to skirmishers  the matter has been taken out of georges hands said aubrey there would not have been a volunteer in the country if he had his way  yes explained ethel the real soldier cant believe in volunteers nor cavalry in infantry but he is thoroughly in for it now  owing to his roman matron quoth tom  it was a wonderful opening for public spirit when lady walkinghame insisted on sir henry refusing the use of the park for practice for fear we should make targets of the children  so the spartan mother at abbotstoke gallantly setting margaret aside sent for the committee at once to choose the very best place in the park  papa is chairman of the committee added aubrey he is mayor this year so we must encourage it  and aubrey hit four times at a hundred yards triumphantly declared gertrude when edward anderson and henry ward only got a ball in by accident  henry ward ought to be shot at himself was aubreys sentiment for not letting leonard be in the corps  the fellow that you brought to maplewood asked hector  i thought he was at school  didnt you know that old hoxton has given leave to any of the sixth form to drill and practise and that trumpery fellow henry says he cant afford the outfit though his sister would have given the uniform  let me tell you young folks said the doctor that you are not to suppose it always hails crack rifles on all sorts of improved systems as it does when captain hector is in the house  they are only on trial sir apologized hector  very odd then that they all have an eagle and h e on them observed the doctor dryly  oh theyll take them again or i shall find a use for them said hector  well if henry cant afford two said aubrey holding to his point he ought to give up to his brother he knows no more how to handle a rifle  thats the very reason muttered tom  and flora is going to give a great party proceeded gertrude as soon as the uniform is settled and they are enrolled  blanche and hector are to stay for it and youll have to wear your lieutenants uniform harry  i cant be going to balls till ive been up to report myself fit for service said harry  it is not to be a ball said blanches soft serious voice over her green silk banner it is to be a breakfast and concert ending in a dance such as we had at maplewood  hollo said harry starting now i begin to believe in mrs ernescliffe when i hear her drawing down herself as an example to flora  only a precedent said blanche blushing a little but still grave we have had some experience you know  our corps was one of the earliest enrolled and hector managed it almost entirely  it was the reason we have not been able to come here sooner but we thought it right to be foremost as the enemy are sure to attempt our coast first  i believe the enemy are expected on every coast at first was ethels aside but it was not heard for harry was declaring  your coast they will never get the length of that  i was talking to an old messmate of mine in the train who was telling me how we could burn their whole fleet before it could get out of cherbourg  if they should slip by began hector  slip by and harry had wellnigh dislodged daisy by his vehemence in demonstrating that they were welcome to volunteer but that the channel fleet would prevent the rifles from being seriously put to the proofa declaration highly satisfactory to the ladies and heartily backed up by the doctor though blanche looked rather discomfited and hector argued loud for the probability of active service  i say aubrey said tom rather tired of the land and sea debate do just reach me a card to take up some of this sand upon  aubrey obeyed and reading the blackedged card as he handed it said mrs pug  what  pug ought to have been calling upon mab  maybe she will in good earnest observed tom again in ethels ear while the whole room rang with the laughter that always befalls the unlucky wight guilty of a blunder in a name  you dont mean that you dont know who she is aubrey was the cry  ihow should i  what not mrs pugh exclaimed daisy  pew or pugi know nothing of either  is this edge as mourning for all the old pews that have been demolished in the church  for shame aubrey said mary seriously  you must know it is for her husband  aubrey set up his eyebrows in utter ignorance  how true it is that one half the world knows nothing of the other exclaimed ethel  do you really mean you have never found out the great mrs pugh mrs ledwichs dear suffering matilda  ive seen a black lady sitting with mrs ledwich in church  such is life said ethel  how little she thought herself living in such an unimpressible world  she is a pretty woman enough observed tom  and very desirous of being useful added richard  she and mrs ledwich came over to cocksmoor this morning and offered any kind of assistance  at cocksmoor cried ethel much as if it had been the french  every district is filled up here you know said richard and mrs ledwich begged me as a personal favour to give her some occupation that would interest her and cheer her spirits so i asked her to look after those new cottages at goulds end quite out of your beat ethel and she seemed to be going about energetically  tom looked unutterable things at ethel who replied with a glance between diversion and dismay  who is the lady said blanche  she assaulted me in the street with inquiries and congratulations about harry declaring she had known me as a child a thing i particularly dislike and mrs ernescliffe looked like a ruffled goldfinch  forgetting her has not been easy to the payers of duty calls said ethel  she was the daughter of mrs ledwichs brother the colonel of marines and used in old times to be with her aunt there used to be urgent invitations to flora and me to drink tea there because she was of our age  she married quite young something very prosperous and rather aged and the glories of dear matildas villa at bristol have been our staple subject but mr pugh died in the spring leaving his lady five hundred a year absolutely her own and she is come to stay with her aunt and look for a house  et cetera added tom  what in the buxom widow line asked harry  no no said richard rather indignantly  no in the pathetic line said ethel but that requires some selfdenial  our tongues dont lose their venom you see harry put in the doctor  no indeed papa said ethel really anxious to guard her brothers i was very sorry for her at first and perhaps i pity her more now than even then  i was taken with her pale face and dark eyes and i believe she was a good wife and really concerned for her husband but i cant help seeing that she knows her grief is an attraction  to simple parsons muttered tom along the tube of his microscope  the sound of her voice showed her to be full of pretension said blanche  besides mrs ledwichs trumpeting would fix my opinion in a moment  just so observed the doctor  no papa said ethel i was really pleased and touched in spite of mrs ledwichs devotion to her till i found out a certain manoeuvring to put herself in the foreground and not let her sorrow hinder her from any enjoyment or display  she cant bear any one to do what she does not  what  marys mouth open against her too cried dr may  well papa insisted mary nobody wanted her to insist on taking the harmonium at bankside last sunday just because averil had a cold in her head and she played so fast that every one was put out and then said she would come to the practice that they might understand one another  she is not even in the bankside district so it is no business of hers  there richard her favours are equally distributed said aubrey but if she would take that harmonium altogether one would not mindit makes henry ward as sulky as a bear to have his sister going out all the evening and he visits it on leonard  i dare say if she stayed at home he would not have been such a brute about the rifle  i should not wonder said dr may  i sometimes doubt if home is sweetened to my friend henry  o papa cried mary bristling up ave is very hard worked and she gives up everything in the world but her church music and that is her great duty and delight  miss wards music must be a sore trial to the pug said tom will it be at this affair at abbotstoke  thats the question said ethel  it never goes out yet is to be met everywhere just overpersuaded at the last moment  now flora you will see will think it absolutely improper to ask her and she will be greatly disappointed not to have the chance of refusing and then yielding at the last minute  flora must have her said harry  i trust not said blanche shrinking  flora will not ask her said tom but she will be there  and will dance with me said harry  no with richard said tom  what said richard looking up at the sound of his name  all laughed but were ashamed to explain and were relieved that their father rang the bell  at that unhappy skein still mary said mrs ernescliffe as the good nights were passing what a horrid state it is in  i shall do it in time said mary when there is nothing to distract my attention  i only hope i shall not hurt it for you  chuck it into the fire at once it is not worth the trouble said hector  each had a word of advice but mary held her purpose and persevered till all had left the room except richard who quietly took the crimson tangle on his wrists turned and twisted opened passages for the winder and by the magic of his dexterous hands had found the clue to the maze so that all was proceeding well though slowly when the study door opened and harrys voice was heard in a last good night to his father  marys eyes looked wistful and one misdirection of her winder tightened an obdurate loop once more  run after harry said richard taking possession of the ivory good night i can always do these things best alone  i had ratheryes reallygood night and his kiss had the elder brothers authority of dismissal  his maimouna was too glad and grateful for more than a summary thank you and flew upstairs in time to find harry turning baffled from her empty room  what only just done that interminable yarn he said  richard is doing it  i could not help letting him this first evening of you  good old richard he is not a bit altered since i first went to sea when i was so proud of that said harry taking up his midshipmans dirk which formed a trophy on marys mantelshelf  are we altered since you went last said mary  the younger ones of course  i was in hopes that aubrey would have been more like old june but hell never be so much of a fellow  he is a very dear good boy said mary warmly  of course he is said harry but somehow he will always have a womanbred way about him  cant be helped of course but what a pair of swells tom and blanche are come out and he laughed goodnaturedly  is not blanche a beautiful dear darling cried mary eagerly  it is so nice to have her  they could not come at first because of the infection and then because of the rifle corps and now it is delicious to have all at home  well molly im glad it wasnt you that have married  mind you mustnt marry till i do  and harry was really glad that marys laugh was perfectly fancy free as she answered im sure i hope not but i wont promise because that might be unreasonable you know  oh you prudent provident polly  but added harry recalled to a sense of time by a clock striking eleven i came to bring you something mary  you shall have it if you will give me another  mary recognized with some difficulty a prayerbook with limp covers that margaret had given him after his first voyage  not only was it worn by seven years use but it was soiled and stained with dark brownish red and a straight round hole perforated it from cover to cover  is it too bad to keep said harry  let me just cut out my name in margarets hand and the verse of the 107th psalm luckily the ball missed that  the ball said mary beginning to understand  yes  every one of those circles that you see cut out there was in here said harry laying his hand over his chest before the ball which i have given to my father  o harry was all mary could say pointing to her own name in a pencil scrawl on the flyleaf  yes i set that down because i could not speak to tell what was to be done with it when we didnt know that that book had really been the saving of my life  that hairsbreadth deviation of the bullet made all the difference  mary was kissing the bloodstained book and sobbing  why mary what is there to cry for  it is all over now i tell you i am as well as man would wish and theres no more about it but to thank god and try to deserve his goodness  yes yes i know harry but to think how little we knew or thought or feltgoing on in our own way when you were in such danger and suffering  wasnt i very glad you were going on in your own way said harry why mary it was that which did itit has been always that thought of you at the minster every day that kept me to reading the psalms and so having the book about me  and did not it do one good to lie and think of the snug room and my fathers spectacles and all as usual when they used to lay me on the deck of the dexter at night because i could not breathe below i used to watch old orion who was my great friend in the loyalty isles and wish the heathen name had not stuck to the old fellow he always seemed so like the christian warrior climbing up with his shield before him and his  a home like this is a shield to a man in more ways than one mary  hollo was that the street door  yes ritchie going home  fancy his being at the silk all this time i am so sorry  maugre her sorrow there were few happier maidens in england than mary may even though her service was distracted by the claims of three slaveowners at once bound as she was to ethel by habitual fidelity to harry by eager adoration to blanche by willing submission luckily their requisitions for the most part unconscious seldom clashed or if they did the two elders gave way and the bride asserted her supremacy in the plenitude of her youthful importance and prosperity  thus she carried off mary in her barouche to support her in the return of bridal calls while the others were organizing a walk to visit flora and the rifle target  gertrudes enthusiasm was not equal to walking with a weapon that might be loaded nor to being ordered out to admire the practice so she accompanied the sisters tom was reading hard and ethel found herself aubrey and the sailor the only ones ready to start  this was a decided treat for aubrey and she were so nearly one that it was almost a teteatete with harry though it was not his way to enter by daylight and without strong impulse on what regarded himself and there were no such confidences as those to mary on the previous night but in talking over home details it was easier to speak without toms ironical ears and caustic tongue  among other details the story of the summer that ethel and aubrey had spent at coombe was narrated and aubrey indulged himself by describing what he called ethels conquest  it is more a conquest of normans and of melanesia said ethel if it were not nonsense to build upon peoples generous visions at seventeen i should sometimes hope a spark had been lit that would shine some day in your islands harry  going up that hill was not the place for etheldred may to talk of the futility of youthful aspirations but it did not so strike either of the brothers to whom cocksmoor had long been a familiar fact  harry laughed to hear the old ethel so like herself and aubrey said by the bye what did you do the day you walked him to cocksmoor he was fuller of those islands than ever after it  i did not mean it said ethel but the first day of the holidays i came on him disconsolate in the street with nothing to do and very sore about henrys refusal to let him volunteer he walked on with me till we found ourselves close to cocksmoor and i found he had never seen the church and would like to stay for evening service so i put him into the parsonage while i was busy and told him to take a book  i know said aubrey the liveliest literature you can get in richards parlour are the missionary reports  exactly so and he got quite saturated with them and when we walked home i was so thankful that the rifle grievance should be a little displaced that i led him on to talk and build castles rather more than according to my resolutions  hollo ethel said harry  yes i think spontaneous castles are admirable but i mistrust all timber from other peoples woods  but isnt this a horrid shame of henry said aubrey  such a little prig as he is to take the place of such a fellow as leonard a capital shot already  i wish henry had been magnanimous said ethel  id as soon talk of a magnanimous weasel from what i recollect said harry  and he is worse now harry continued aubrey  so spruce and silky out of doors and such a regular old tyrannical bachelor indoors  he is jealous of leonard any one can see and thats the reason he wont give him his due  you observe said ethel that this boy thinks the youngest brothers due is always to come first  so it is in this family said harry  no one comes so last as old ritchie  but of course said aubrey rather taken aback if i were not youngest i should have to knock under to some one  ethel and harry both laughed heartily one congratulating him on not having carried the principle into the cockpit the other adding dont indoctrinate leonard with it there is enough already to breed bitterness between those brothers  leonard ought to be kept in mind that henry has so much to harass him that his temper should be borne patiently with  he  i dont think papas best endeavours have kept all his fathers practice for him and i am sure their rate of living must make him feel pinched this christmas  whew  he will be in a sweeter humour than ever  i have been trying to show leonard that theres room for magnanimity on his side at least and dont you go and upset it all by commonplace abuse of tutors and governors  i upset it cried aubrey i might as well try to upset the minster as a word from you to leonard  nonsense  whats that  for they were hailed from behind and looking round saw two tall figures weapon in hand in pursuit  they proved to be hector ernescliffe and leonard ward each bearing one of what dr may called the h e rifles but leonard looked half shy half grim and so decidedly growled off all aubreys attempts at inquiry or congratulation that ethel hazarded none and aubrey looked discomfited wearing an expression which harry took to mean that the weight of his rifle fatigued him and insisted on carrying it for him in spite of his rather insulted protests and declarations that the sailor was an invalid ethel had walked forwards and found leonard at her side with a darkening brow as he glanced back at the friendly contest  harry spoils aubrey as much as all the others do said ethel lightly deeming it best to draw out the sting of the rankling thought  ay  none of them would leave him to be pitied and offered favours by some chance person said leonard  you dont call my brother hector a chance person  did you say anything to him miss may said leonard turning on her a flushed face as if he could almost have been angered with her  i said not one word  nor aubrey  the volunteer politics were discussed last night and henry got abused among us but papa defended him and said it did not rain rifles thats allwhatever hector may have done was without a word to either of usvery likely on the moments impulse  did he go to bankside after you  no  i was looking in at shearmans window said leonard rather sheepishly at the locks of the new lot he has got in and he came and asked if i were going to choose one for he had got a couple down from london and the man had stupidly put his cipher on both so he would be glad if i would take one off his hands  i didnt accepti made that clearbut then he begged as if it was to oblige him that i would come out to abbotstoke and help him try the two for he didnt know which he should keep  very ingenious of him said ethel laughing  now miss may do tell me what i ought to do  it is such a beauty better than any shearman ever dreamt of just look at the finish of the lock  by the time you have shot with it  now dont pray said leonard i havent any one to trust for advice but you  indeed leonard i can see no objection  it is a great boon to you and no loss to hector and he is quite enough my fathers son for you to look on him as a friend  i cant but be very glad for the removal of this vexation ought to make you get on all the better with your brother  ave would be delighted said leonard but somehow  somehow was silenced by a coalescing of the party at a gate and hector and harry were found deep in an argument in which the lieutenants indian reminiscences of the naval brigade were at issue with the captains southdown practice and the experiences of the one meeting the technicalities of the other were so diverting that leonard forgot his scruples till at the entrance of the park he turned off towards the target with hector and aubrey while the other two walked up to the house  the grange atmosphere always had a strange weight of tedium in it such as was specially perceptible after the joyous ease of the house in the high street  no one was in the drawingroom and harry gazed round at the stiff almost petrified aspect of the correct and tasteful arrangement of the tables and furniture put his hands in his pockets and yawned twice asking ethel why she did not go in search of flora ethel shook her head and in another moment flora appeared in eager welcome she had been dressing for a drive to stoneborough to see her brother little expecting him to be in a state for walking to her with her came her little girl a child whose aspect was always a shock to those who connected her with the two margarets whose name she bore she had inherited her fathers heavy mould of feature and dark complexion and the black eyes had neither sparkle in themselves nor relief from the colour of the sallow cheek the pouting lips were fretful the whole appearance unhealthy and the dark bulletshaped head seemed too large for the thin bony little figure  worn fagged and aged as flora looked she had still so much beauty and far more of refinement and elegance as to be a painful foil and contrast to the child that clung to her waywardly refusing all response to her uncles advances  flora made a sign to him to discontinue them and talked of her husband who was hunting and heard the history of harrys return and recovery  in the midst little margaret took heart of grace crossed the room and stood by the sailor and holding up a great indiarubber ball as large as her own head asked uncle harry were you shot with a cannonball as big as this  thereupon she was on his knee and as he had all his fathers fascination for children he absolutely beguiled her into ten minutes of genuine childish mirth a sight so rare and precious to her mother that she could not keep up her feint of talking to ethel the elderly dame part nurse part nursery governess presently came to take miss rivers out but miss rivers with a whine in her voice insisted on going nowhere but to see the shooting and uncle harry must come with her and come he did the little bony fingers clasping tight hold of one of his large ones  dear harry said flora he wins every one  it is like a cool refreshing wind from the sea when he comes in  in floras whole air voice and manner there was apparent a relaxation and absence of constraint such as she never allowed herself except when alone with ethel  then only did she relieve the constant strain then only did the veritable woman show herself and the effort the toil the weariness the heartache of her life become visible but close together as the sisters lived such teteatetes were rare and perhaps were rather shunned than sought as perilous and doubtful indulgences  even now flora at once fixed a limit by ordering the carriage to meet her in a quarter of an hour at the nearest point to the rifleground saying she would walk there and then take home ethel and any brother who might be tired  and see that margaret does not come to harm said ethel  i am not afraid of that said flora something in her eye belying her but she might be troublesome to harry and i had rather he did not see one of her fights with miss morton  how has she been  i thought her looking clearer and better today said ethel kindly  yes she is pretty well just now said flora allowing herself in one of her long deep sighs before descending into the particulars of the childs anxiouslywatched health  if she had been describing them to her father there would have been the same minuteness but the tone would have implied cheerful hope whereas to ethel she took no pains to mask her dejection  one of the points of anxiety was whether one shoulder were not outgrowing the other but it was not easy to discover whether the appearance were not merely owing to the childs feeble and ungainly carriage  i cannot torment her about that said flora there are enough miseries for her already without making more and as long as it does not affect her health it matters little  no certainly not said ethel who had hardly expected this from flora  perhaps her sister guessed her thought for she said things are best as they are ethel i am not fit to have a beautiful admired daughter all the past would too easily come over again and my poor margarets troubles may be the best balance for her  yes said ethel it is bad enough to be an heiress but a beautiful heiress is in a worse predicament  health would improve her looks began the maternal instinct of defence but then breaking off  we met lord h yesterday and the uniform is to be like the northern division  papa will hear it officially tomorrow  the northern has gray and green facings  you are more up in it than i  all we begged for was that it might be inexpensive for the sake of the townspeople  i hear of little else said ethel laughing dr spencer is as hot on it as all the boys  now i suppose your party is to come off  yes it ought said flora languidly i waited to see how harry was he is a great element towards making it go off well  i will talk it over with blanche it will give somebody pleasure if she thinks she manages it  will it give george no pleasure  i dont know he calls it a great nuisance but he would not like not to come forward and it is quite right that he should  quite right said ethel it is every ones duty to try to keep it up  with these words the sisters came within sight of the targets and found margaret under harrys charge much interested and considerably in the way  the tidings of the colour of the uniform were highly appreciated aubrey observed that it would choke off the snobs who only wanted to be like the rifle brigade and leonard treated its inexpensiveness as a personal matter having apparently cast off his doubts under hectors complimentary tuition  indeed before it grew too dark for taking aim he and the weapon were so thoroughly united that no further difficulty remained but of getting out his thanks to mr ernescliffe  averil was sitting alone over the fire in the twilight in a somewhat forlorn mood when the door was pushed ajar and the muzzle of a gun entered causing her to start up in alarm scarcely diminished by the sight of an exultant visage though the words were your money or your life  leonard dont play with it pray  its not loaded  oh but one never can tell then half ashamed of her terror pray put it back or we shall have an uproar with henry  this is none of henrys  he will never own such a beauty as this  whose is it  not yours  is it really a rifle  h e  whats that  hector ernescliffe  didnt i tell you he was a princely fellow  given it to you  leonard dear i am so happy  now i dont care for anything  what a gallant volunteer you will make and she kissed him fondly  we will order the uniform as soon as ever it is settled and i hope it will be a very handsome one  it will be a cheap one which is more to the purpose  i could get part myself only theres the tax for mab and the subscription to the cricket club  i would not have you get any of it  you are my volunteer and ill not give up my right to any one except that minna and ella want to give your belt  where are those children he asked  henry has taken them to laburnum grove where i am afraid they are being crammed with cake and all sorts of nonsense  what could have made him take them there  oh some wish of mrs pughs to see the poor little dears said averil the cloud returning that had been for a moment dispelled  whats the row asked leonard kindly  has he been bothering you  he wants me to sound mary may about an invitation for mrs pugh to mrs riverss volunteer entertainment  i am glad i did not say no one in mourning ought to go for i must go now you are a volunteer  but you didnt consent to mention her  no indeed  i knew very well you would say it was a most improper use to make of the mays kindness and i cant see what business she has there  then he said no she was certain not to go but the attention would be gratifying and proper  that is mrs riverss lookout  so i said but henry never will hear reason  i did not tell you of our scene yesterday over the accounts he says that we must contract our expenses or he shall be ruined so i told him i was ready to give up the hothouse or the footman or the other horse or anything he would specify but he would not hear of ithe says it would be fatal to alter our style of living and that it is all my fault for not being economical  o leonard it is very hard to give up all one cared for to this housekeeping and then never to please  leonard felt his brother a tyrant  never mind ave dear said he go on doing right and then you need not care for his unreasonableness  you are a dear good girl and i cant think how he can have the heart to vex you  i dont care while i have you leonard she said clinging to him  at that moment the others were heard returning and an ironical look passed between the brother and sister at certain injunctions that were heard passing about the little indiarubber goloshes but henry had returned in high goodhumour was pleased to hear of his brothers good fortune pronounced it very handsome in mr ernescliffe and even offered to provide the rest of the equipment but this was proudly rejected by averil with some of the manifestations of exclusive partiality that naturally wounded the elder brother  he then announced an engagement that he had made with mrs ledwich for a musical evening the next week  averil had her harmonium at her tongues end but the evening was a free one chosen on purpose to accommodate her she had no excuse and must submit  and practise some of your best pieces ave said henry  mrs pugh was kind enough to offer to come and get up some duets with yon  i am greatly obliged said averil dryly but i do not play duets  you would do wisely to accept her kindness argued henry  it would be a great advantage to you to be intimate with a lady of her opportunities  i do not like patronage said averil  ave  ave cried the children who had been trying to attract her attention if you will let us go to laburnum grove by twelve oclock tomorrow mis pugh will show us her book of the pretty devices of letters and teach us to make one  you will have not finished lessons by twelve  but if we have  no certainly not i cant have you bothering every one about that nonsensical fashion  you shall go my dears said henry  i cant think why your sister should be so illnatured  averil felt that this was the way to destroy her authority and though she kept silence the tears were in her eyes and her champion broke forth how can you be such a brute henry  come away my dears said averil rising and holding out her hands to her sisters as she recollected how bad the scene was for them but it was only minna who obeyed the call ella hung about henry declaring that leonard was naughty and ave was cross  well shouted leonard i shant stay to see that child set against her sister  i wonder what you mean her to come to henry  it was no wonder that minna and ella squabbled together as to which was cross henry or averil and the spirit of party took up its fatal abode in the house of bankside     chapter ix    too oft my anxious eye has spied   that secret grief thou fain wouldst hide   the passing pang of humbled pridescott   the winter was gay between musical evenings childrens parties clerical feastings of district visitors soirees for sundayschool teachers and christmastrees for their scholars  such a universal favourite as harry with so keen a relish for amusement was sure to fall an easy prey to invitations but the rest of the family stood amazed to see him accompanied everywhere by tom to whom the secular and the religious dissipations of stoneborough had always hitherto been equally distasteful  yet be submitted to a christmas course of music carpetdances and jeux de societe on the one hand and on the other conferred inestimable obligations on the ecclesiastical staff by exhibitions of his microscope and of some of the ornamental sports of chemistry  the truth is was the explanation privately dropped out to ethel that some one really must see that those two dont make fools of themselves  ethel stared then coming to the perception who those two meant burst out laughing and said my dear tom i beg your pardon but on the whole i think that is more likely to befall some one else  tom held his head loftily and would not condescend to understand anything so foolish  he considered bankside as the most dangerous quarter for harry was enraptured with miss wards music extolled her dark eyes and openly avowed her attraction but there were far more subtle perils at laburnum grove  the fair widow was really pretty almost elegant her weeds becoming and her disposition so good so religious so charitable that with her activity intelligence and curateworship she was a dangerous snare to such of mankind as were not sensible of her touch of pretension  as to womankind it needed a great deal of submissiveness to endure her at all and this was not averil wards leading characteristic  in fact the ubiquity of mrs pugh was a sore trial to that young lady just so superior herself as to detect the flimsiness of the widows attainments  it was vexatious to find that by means of age assumption and position these shallow accomplishments made a prodigious show in the world while her own were entirely overlooked she thought she despised the admiration of the secondrate world of stoneborough but it nettled her to see it thus misplaced and there was something provoking in the species of semihomage paid in that quarter by the youths of the may family  as to the sailor averil frankly liked him very much he was the pleasantest young man of the most open and agreeable manners who had ever fallen in her way  he was worthy to be marys brother for he was friendly to leonard and to herself had a truthfully flattering way that was delightful  without any sentiment in the case she always felt disappointed and defrauded if she were prevented from having a conversation with him and when this happened it was generally either from his being seized upon by mrs pugh or from her being baited by his brother tom  averil was hard to please for she was as much annoyed by seeing tom may sitting courteous and deferential by the side of mrs pugh as by his attentions to herself  she knew that he was playing the widow off and that when most smooth and bland in look and tone he was inwardly chuckling and to find the identical politeness transferred to herself made her feel not only affronted but insulted by being placed on the same level  thus when at a reunion at laburnum grove she had been looking on with intense disgust while tom was admiring mrs pughs famous book of devices from letters translating the mottoes and promising contributions the offence was greatly increased by his coming up to her and that too just as harry was released by the buttonholding mr grey and saying  of course you are a collector too miss ward i can secure some duplicates for you  she hoard such fooleries  she have mrs pughs duplicates  no wonder she coldly answered my little sister has been slightly infected thank you but i do not care for such things  indeed  well i always preserve as many as i can as passports to a ladys favour  that depends on how much sense the lady has said averil trusting that this was a spirited set down  you do not consider  philosophically treated they become a perfect school in historical heraldry nay in languages in mathematical drawing in illumination said tom looking across to the album in which mrs pughs collection was enshrined each device appropriately framed in bright colours  his gravity was intolerable  was this mockery or not  however as answer she must she said  a very poor purpose for which to learn such things and a poor way of learning them  true said tom one pastime is as good as another and the less it pretends to the better  on the whole it may be a beneficial outlet for the revival of illumination  did this intolerable person know that there was an illuminators guide at home and a great deal of red blue and gold paint with grand designs for the ornamentation of bankside chapel  whether he knew it or not she could not help answering illumination is desecrated by being used on such subjects  and is not that better than the subjects being desecrated by illumination  mrs pugh came to insist on that sweet thing of mendelssohns from her dear miss ward and averil obeyed not so glad to escape as inflamed by vexation at being prevented from fighting it out and learning what he really meant though she was so far used to the slippery nature of his arguments as to know that it was highly improbable that she should get at anything in earnest  if his sisters were silly i should not mind said she to leonard then he might hold all women cheap from knowing no better but when they like sensible things why is every one else to be treated like an ape  never mind said leonard he sneers at everybody all alike  i cant think how dr may came to have such a son or how aubrey can run after him so  i should like to know whether they really think it irreverent to do illuminations  nonsense ave why should you trouble yourself about what he says to tease you bad luck to him  nevertheless averil was not at ease till she had asked marys opinion of illumination and mary had referred to ethel and brought back word that all depended on the spirit of the work that it was a dangerous thing for mere fashion to make playthings of texts of scripture but that no one could tell the blessing there might be in dwelling on them with loving decoration or having them placed where the eye and thought might be won by them  in fact ethel always hated fashion but feared prejudice  the crown of the whole carnival was to be the abbotstoke entertainment on the enrolment of the volunteers  preparations went on with great spirit and the drill sergeant had unremitting work the target little peace and aubrey and leonard were justly accused of making fetishes of their rifles  the town was frantic no clothes but uniforms could be had and the tradesmen forgot their customers in the excitement of electing officers  averil thought it very officious of mrs pugh to collect a romantic party of bannerworking young ladies before the members wife or the mayors family had authorized it and she refused to join both on the plea of want of time and because she heard that mr elvers a real dragoon declared colours to be inappropriate to riflemen  and so he did but his wife said the point was not martial correctness but popular feeling so mary gratified the party by bringing her needle dr spencer took care the blazonry of the arms of the old abbey was correct and flora asked the great lady of the county to present the banner and gave the invitation to mrs pugh who sighed shook her head dried her eyes and said something about goodness and spirits and mrs rivers professed to understand and hope mrs pugh would do exactly as best suited her  was this manoeuvring or only living in the present  mary accompanied harry for a long day of shopping in london when he went to report himself starting and returning in the clouds of night and transacting a prodigious amount of business with intense delight and no fatigue and she was considered to have fitted out the mayors daughters suitably with his municipal dignity of which ethel piqued herself on being proud  the entertainment was not easy to arrange at such a season and blanches experience being of early autumn was at fault but flora sent for all that could embellish her conservatories and by one of the charities by which she loved to kill two birds with one stone imported a young lady who gained her livelihood by singing at private concerts and with her for a star supported by the minster and cathedral choirs hoped to get up sufficient music to occupy people till it should be late enough to dance  she still had some diplomacy to exercise for mrs ledwich suggested asking dear ave ward to sing her own dearest matilda would not object on such an occasion to assist the sweet girl and mrs rivers after her usual prudent fashion giving neither denial nor assent mrs ledwich trotted off and put averil into an agony that raised a needless storm in the bankside house leonard declaring the request an insult and henry insisting that ave ought to have no scruples in doing anything mrs pugh thought proper to be done  and finally when ave rushed with her despair to mary may it was to be relieved at finding that mrs rivers had never dreamt of exposing her to such an ordeal  though it was the year 1860 the sun shone on the great day and there were exhilarating tokens of spring singing birds opening buds sparkling drops and a general sense of festivity as the gray and green began to flit about the streets and while mr mayor repaired to the town hall to administer the oaths to the corps his unmartial sons and his daughters started for the grange to assist flora in the reception of her guests  the lord lieutenants wife and daughters as well as the ernescliffes had slept there and ethel found them all with flora in the great hall which looked like a winter garden interspersed with tables covered with plate and glass where eating and drinking might go on all day long  but ethels heart sank within her at the sight of floras haggard face and sunken eyes  what is the matter she asked blanche an image of contented beauty  matter  oh they have been stupid in marking the ground and hector is gone to see about it  thats all  he is not at all tired  i never supposed he was said ethel but what makes flora look so ill  oh that tiresome child has got another cold and fretted half the night  it is all their fault for giving way to her and she has done nothing but whine this whole morning because she is not well enough to go out and see the practice  i am sure it is no misfortune that she is not to come down and be looked at  ethel crossed over to flora and asked whether she should go up and see little margaret  i should be so thankful said poor flora but dont excite her she is not at all well and has had very little sleep  ethel ran upstairs and found herself in the midst of a fight between the governess and margaret who wanted to go to the draughty passage window which she fancied had a better view than that of her nursery luckily aunt ethel was almost the only person whom margaret did not like to see her naughty and she subsided into a much less objectionable lamentation after uncle harry and his anchor buttons ethel promised to try whether he could be found and confident in his goodnature ran down and boldly captured him as he was setting out to see hectors operations  he came with a ready smile and the child was happy throughout his stay  flora presently stole a moments visit intending her sisters release as well as his but ethel in pity to governess as well as pupil declared the nursery window to be a prime post of observation and begged to be there left  margaret began to believe that they were very snug there and by the time the bugles were heard had forgotten her troubles in watching the arrivals  up came the gray files and ethels heart throbbed and her eye glistened at their regular tread and military bearing  quickly margaret made out papa but he was too real a soldier to evince consciousness of being at his own door before the eyes of his wife and daughter and aubreys young face was made up in imitation of his impassiveness  other eyes were less under control and of these were a brown pair that wandered restlessly till they were raised to the nursery window and there found satisfaction  the aunt and niece were too immediately above the terrace to see what passed upon it nor could they hear the words so they only beheld the approach of the ensign and after a brief interval his return with the tall green silk colours with the arms of the old abbey embroidered in the corner and heard the enthusiastic cheer that rang out from all the corps  then the colours led the way to the ground for practice for manoeuvres were as yet not ready for exhibition  almost all the gentlemen followed and such ladies as did not object to gunpowder or damp grass thither betook themselves guided by the ardent mrs ernescliffe having disposed of the others in the drawingrooms and gardens flora and her father came to the nursery and ethel was set at liberty to witness the prowess of her young champions being assured by flora that she would be of more use there in keeping the youthful population out of danger than in entertaining the more timid in the house  she slipped out and hurried down a narrow path towards the scene of action presently becoming aware of four figures before her which her glass resolved into harry and tom a lady in black and a child evidently the devoted tom was keeping guard over one of the enchantresses for the figure was that of averil ward though as ethel said shaking hands she was hardly to be known with only one sister  we have been delayed said averil poor little ella was in an agony about the firing and we could not leave her till your brotherindicating harrywas so kind as to take her to gertrude  true to the englishwomans boast of never having seen the smoke of an engagement said tom  a practising is not an engagement said ethel  there may be quite as many casualties quoth tom indulging in some of the current readymade wit on the dangers of volunteering for the pure purpose of teasing but he was vigorously fallen upon by harry and ethel and averil brightened as she heard him put to the rout the shots were already heard when two more black figures were seen in the distance going towards the gate  is that richard exclaimed tom  ay and i do believe the widow rejoined harry  oh yes said averil  i heard her talking about abbotstoke church and saying how much she wished to see it  she must have got mr may to show it to her  ethel who had no real fears for richard herself looked on amused to watch how the guardian spirit was going to act  he exclaimed by the bye miss ward would you not like to see it  they have a very nice brass to old mr rivers and have been doing up the chancel  thank you said ave i should prefer going to see how leonard is getting on  right miss ward said harry the church wont run away  well then said tom after a moments hesitation i think i shall just run down as the church is open and see what sort of work they have made of the chancel  ethel had the strongest fancy to try what he would do if she were to be seized with a desire to inspect the chancel but she did not wish to let harry and averil appear on the ground under no escort but minnas and so permitted tom to leave them to her keeping and watched him hasten to break up the teteatete  coming among the spectators who chiefly drawn up on the carriage drive were watching from a safe distance the gray figures in turn take aim and emit from their rifles the flash and cottonwoollike tuft of smoke ethels interest was somewhat diminished by hearing that all the other marksmen had been distanced by the head keepers of abbotstoke and drydale between whom the contest really lay  the rest is a study of character said dr spencer taking a turn up and down the road with her  i have been watching the various pairs of brothers and i doubt if any stand the test as well as the house of may  theres only one in the field today  yes but ive seen them together before now and i will say for even tom that he has no black looks when his junior shoots better than he does  oh yes  but then it is aubrey  dr spencer laughed  lucky household where that it is accounts for all favours to the youngest instead of for the countenance falling at his successes  i am afraid i know whom you mean  but he has no generosity in him  and his sister helps to make him jealous  i am afraid she does but though it is very sad one cant wonder at her preference of the great to the small  poor girl i wonder how she will get on when there is a new inmate in the happy family  ha you shocking old gossip what have you found out now  negotiation for the introduction of a pug dog from the best circleseh  well if he were alone in the world it would be a capital match  so she thinks i fancy but £600 a year might do better than purchase so many incumbrances  depend upon it the late lamented will remain in the ascendant till there are no breakers ahead  in process of time ladies volunteers and all were assembled in the great musicroom for the concert and ethel having worked hard in the service of the company thought her present duty lay with the sick child and quietly crept away taking however one full view of the entire scene partly for her own satisfaction partly in case margaret should be inclined to question her on what every one was doing  there was the orchestra whose erection richard had superintended there was the conductor in his station and the broad back of the cathedral organist at the piano the jolly red visages of the singing men in their ranks the fresh faces of the choristers full of elation the star from london looking quiet and ladylike courteously led to her place by george rivers himself  but for all his civility how bored and sullen he looked and how weary were poor floras smiles though her manner was so engaging and her universal attention so unremitting  what a contrast to the serene selfenfolded look of happiness and prosperity on the pretty youthful face of blanche her rich delicate silk spreading far beyond the sofa where she sat among the great ladies and her tall yellowhaired husband leaning against the wall behind her in wondering contemplation of his blanche taking her place in her own county  farther back among the more ordinary herd ethel perceived mrs pugh bridling demurely with tom on guard over her on one side and henry ward looking sulky on the other with his youngest sister in his charge  the other was looking very happy upon leonards knee close to averil and mary who were evidently highly satisfied to have coalesced averil was looking strikingly prettythe light fell favourably on her profuse glossy hair straight features and brilliant colouring her dark eyes were full of animation and her lips were apart with a smile as she listened to leonards eager narration and ethel glanced towards harry to see whether he were admiring  no harry was bringing in a hall armchair in the background for a vary large heavy vulgarlooking old man who seemed too ponderous and infirm for a place on the benches  richard made one of a black mass of clergy and aubrey and gertrude had asserted their independence by perching themselves on a windowseat as far as possible from all relations whence they nodded a merry saucy greeting to ethel and she smiled back again thinking her tall boy in his gray tunic and black belt and her plump girl in white with green ribbons were as goodly a pair as the room contained  but where was the doctor  ethel had a shrewd suspicion where she should find him and in the nursery he was playing at spillekens with his left hand  it was not easy to persuade him that the music would be wasted on her and that he ought to go down that it might receive justice but margaret settled the question you may go grandpapa  aunt ethel is best to play at spillekens for she has not got a left hand  theres honour for me who used to have two and therewith ethel turned him out in time for the overture  margaret respected her aunt sufficiently not to be extra wayward with her and between the spillekens and a long story about cousin dickie in new zealand all went well till bedtime  there was something in the childs nervous temperament that made the first hours of the night peculiarly painful to her and the sounds of the distant festivity added to her excitability  she fretted and tossed moaned and wailed sat up in bed and cried snapped off attempts at hymns would not listen to stories and received ethels attempts at calm grave commands with bursts of crying and calls for mamma and papa the music had ceased tuning of violins was heard and ethel dreaded the cries being heard downstairs  she was at her wits end and was thinking who would most avail and could be fetched with least sensation when there was a soft knock at the door and harrys voice said hollo whats the matter here  in he came with his white glove half on and perceiving the state of the case said cant go to sleep  oh uncle harry take me and the arms were stretched out and the tearstained face raised up  well put you to sleep as sound as if you were in a hammock just off middle watch said harry and the next moment he had her rolled up in her little blue dressinggown nestling on his broad shoulder while he walked up and down the room crooning out a nautical song not in firstrate style but the effect was perfect the struggles and sobs were over and when at the end of a quarter of an hour harry paused and looked at the little thin sharp face it was softened by peaceful sleep  ethel pointed to the door  there stood flora her eyes full of tears  harry laid the little sleeper on her bed and covered her up  flora laid her arm on his shoulder and gave him such a kiss as she had not given even when he had come back as from the dead  then she signed to them to come but sped away before them not trusting herself to speak ethel tarried with harry who was in difficulties with gloves too small for his broad hand and was pshawing at himself at having let tom get them for him at whitford  o harry said ethel you are the most really like papa of us all how did you come to think of it  id have given a good deal if any one would have walked quarterdeck with me some nights last summer said harry still intent on the glove  what is to be done ethel that rogue tom always snaps up all the beauty  i dare say he has engaged miss ward and the widow both  it was no time for sentiment so ethel suggested getting half into one glove and carrying the other  youll be quite irresistible enough harry  and if all the beauty is engaged ill dance with you myself  will you cried the lieutenant with sparkling eyes then you are a jolly old ethel  come along then and he took her on his arm ran downstairs with her and before she well knew where she was or what was going on she found herself in his great grasp passive as a doll dragged off into the midst of a vehement polka that took her breath away  she trusted to him and remained in a passive halffrightened state glad he was so happy but in the first pause heartily wishing he would let her go instead of which she only heard well done old ethel youll be a prime dancer yet youre as light as a feather and before she had recovered her breath off he led her with go it again  when at length panting and bewildered she was safely placed on a seat with youve had enough have you mind i shant let you off another time she found that her aberration had excited a good deal of sensation in her own family  blanche and gertrude could not repress their amusement and dr may with merry eyes declared that she was coming out in a new light  she had only time to confide to him the reason that she had let harry do what he pleased with her before two volunteers were at her side  miss may i did not think you ever danced  nor i said ethel but you see what sailors can do with one  now ethel said the other over his shoulder now you have danced with harry you must have this waltz with me  a dangerous precedent ethel said the doctor laughing  i couldnt waltz to save my life aubrey said ethel but if you can bear me through a polka as well as harry did you may try the next  and wont youwill youfor once dance with me said his companion imploringly  very well leonard if i can get through a quadrille and therewith ethel was seized upon by both boys to hear the story of every hit and miss and of each of the difficulties that their unpractised corps had encountered in getting round the corners between stoneborough and the grange  then came leonards quadrille which it might be hoped was gratifying to him but which he executed with as much solemn deference as if he had been treading a minuet with a princess plainly regarding it as the great event of the day  in due time he resigned her to aubrey but poor aubrey had been deluded by the facility with which the strong and practised sailor had swept his victim along and ethel grew terrified at the danger of collisions and released herself and pulled him aside by force just in time to avoid being borne down by the ponderous weight of miss boulder and her partner  you did not come to grief with harry muttered the discomfited boy  no more did the lamb damage the eagle but remember the fate of the jackdaw mr graycoat  i deserve some ice for my exertions so come into the hall and get some and tell me if you have had better luck elsewhere  i have had no partner but minna ward and she trips as if one was a dancingmaster  and how has tom been managing  stunningly civil  he began with ave ward in the lancers and it was such funhe chaffed her in his solemn way about music i believe it was and her harmonium  i could not quite hear but i could see she was in a tremendous taking and she wont recover it all the evening  what a shame it is of tom  oh but it is such fun  and since that he has been parading with pug  she has not danced  oh no  she got an audience into metas little sittingroomhenry ward harvey anderson and some of the curates they shut the door and had some music on their own hook  was richard there  at first but either he could not bear to see metas piano profaned or he thought it too strong when they got to the sacred line for he bolted and is gone home  theres harry dancing with fanny anderson  he has not got miss ward all this time  nor will said aubrey  tom had put her in such a rage that she did not choose to dance with that cousin of hers sam axworthy so she was obliged to refuse every one else and i had to put up with that child  sam axworthy  he does not belong to our corps  how does he come here  oh the old man has some houses in the borough and an omnium gatherum like this was a good time to do the civil thing to him there he is peep into the cardroom and youll see his great porpoise back the same old man that harry in his benevolence assisted to a chair  he shook hands with leonard and told him there was a snug desk at the vintry mill for him  i dare say  and when leonard thanked him and said he hoped to get off to cambridge he laughed that horrid fat laugh and told him learning would never put him in good case  where shall i find you a place to sit down  pug and her tail have taken up all the room whispered aubrey as by the chief of the glittering tables in the hall he saw mrs pugh drinking tea surrounded by her attendant gentlemen and with her aunt and ella ward like satellites a little way from her  here is a coign of vantage said ethel seating herself on a step a little way up the staircase  how those people have taken possession of that child all day  i fancy leonard is come to reclaim her said aubrey dont you see him trying to work through and get at her and miss ward told me she was going home early to put the children to bed  ha whats the row theres leonard flaring up in a regular rage  only look at his eyesand henry just like gertrudes java sparrow in a taking  it must not be cried ethel starting up to attempt she knew not what as she heard leonards words say it was a mistake henry you cannot be so base as to persist  there it became evident that ethel and aubrey were seen over the balusters leonards colour deepened but his eye did not flinch though henry quailed and backed and the widow gave a disconcerted laugh then leonard pounced on his little sister and carried her off to the cloakroom  what treason could it have been muttered aubrey we shall get it all from ward but when leonard reappeared it was with his sister cloaked and bonneted on his arm each leading a little one he took them to the entrance and was seen no more  nor was the true history of that explosion ever revealed in the may family though it had grave consequences at bankside  rumour had long declared at stoneborough that the members little daughter was carefully secluded on account of some deformity and mrs pugh had been one of many ladies who had hoped to satisfy their curiosity on this head upon the present occasion  she had asked henry ward whether it were so and he had replied with pique that he had no means of judging he had never been called in at the grange by way of salve to his feelings the sympathizing lady had suggested that the preference for london advice might be from the desire of secrecy and improbable as he knew this to be his vanity had forbidden him to argue against it  when no little miss rivers appeared the notion of her affliction gained ground and leonard whose gray back was undistinguishable from other gray backs heard mrs pugh citing his brother as an authority for the misfortune which mr and mrs rivers so carefully concealed as to employ no surgeon from their own neighbourhood  falsehood slander cruelty ingratitude breach of hospitality were the imputations that fired the hot brain of leonard and writhed his lips as he started round confronted the lady and assured her it was aaa gross mistake  his father had always attended the child and she must have misunderstood his brother  then seeing henry at a little distance leonard summoned him to contradict the allegation but at that moment the sudden appearance of the two mays put the whole conclave to silence  not aware that mrs pugh had confounded together his intelligence and her surmise and made him responsible for both henry was shocked and grieved at his brothers insulting and violent demeanour and exhausted himself in apologies and denunciations while the kindhearted lady interceded for the boy declaring that she doted on his generous spirit but not confessing the piece of female embroidery which had embroiled the matter probably not even aware of it though sincerely and kindly desirous to avert the brothers anger  her amiability therefore only strengthened henrys sense of his brothers outrage and his resolve to call him to account  it was impossible that night for leonard had gone home with the sisters and was in bed long before his brother returned  but at breakfast henry found the forces drawn up against him and his first attempt to remonstrate was retorted by the demand what he could mean by spreading such an abominable reportcruelunfoundedungratefulspiteful  averil indeed divined that it was mrs pughs invention but henry was not inclined to give up mrs pugh and continued in the belief that leonards fiery imagination had fabricated the sentence and then most improperly charged it on the lady and on himself  had it been as leonard stated said henry his conduct was shameful and required an apology whereupon leonard burst out in passion at being disbelieved and averil was no less indignant  the storm raged till the business of the day interrupted it and in henrys absence averil and her brother worked up their wrath again at the atrocity of the assertion regarding the child of their entertainers the granddaughter of their truest kindest friend  averil would have rushed to mary with the whole story but for leonards solemn asseveration that if ever it came to the ears of any one of the mays he should send back his rifle to mr ernescliffe and work his way out to one of the colonies rather than again look any of the family in the face  henry divided his opponents next time asking leonard in his sisters absence whether he had come to his senses and would apologize leonard hoped henry had come to his  on the whole the dispute had lost some asperity by the absence of averil and though leonard held his ground and maintained that he had every right to deny the statement and that it was henrys duty to make mrs pugh contradict it everywhere yet the two approached nearer together and there was less misunderstanding fewer personalities  but averil could not forget or forgive  she persisted in manifesting her displeasure and recurred to the subject till her pertinacity wore out leonard himself  nonsense ave he said at last it was a foolish womans gossip that henry ought to have quashed but that is no reason you should treat them like toads  would you have me sanction vile slander  as if you were sanctioning slander by being decently civil  is not it an intolerable thing that we three should never sit down to a meal in peace together  o leonard dont you think i feel the misery  put an end to it then and dont pit those poor children one against the other  just fancy minnas saying to me i love you and sister but ella loves mrs pugh and henry  yes they have set ella against me  she always appeals to henry and i can do nothing with her  leonard looked out of the window and whistled then said as if he had made a discovery ill tell you what ave something must be done to set things to rights between us and i believe the best thing will be to call on mrs pugh  not to apologize  o leonard  stuff and nonsense  only to show we dont bear malice  henry had been at you to call ever so long before this had he not  i cant see any reason for intimacy  i declare ave you are too bad  i only want you just to keep the peace with your own brother  you have led him the life of a dog these three days and now when i want you to be a little obliging you talk of intimacy  only because i know how it will be  if i give that woman an inch she will take an ell  let her then  it would be much better than always living at daggersdrawn with ones brother  then after waiting for her to say something he added if you wont go with me i shall go alone  averil rose subdued but not convinced reverencing her brother but afraid of his concessions  however the call turned out well  mrs pugh had a talent for making herself agreeable and probably had liked the boy for his outburst she would not let mab be excluded loaded her with admiration and was extremely interested in the volunteer practice so that both the young people were subjugated for the time by her pleasant manners and went away ashamed of their own rancour against one so friendly and goodnatured and considerably relieved of their burden of animosity  their greeting to their brother was so cordial that he perceived their goodwill and was sorry that the dread of an evening of warfare had induced him to accept an invitation to dine at the swan with sam axworthy and a party of his friends     chapter x    this night is my departing night     for here nae longer must i stay   theres neither friend nor foe of mine     but wishes me away   what i have done through lack of wit     i never never can recall   i hope yere all my friends as yet     good night and joy be with you all                                armstrongs good night   the storm had blown over but heavy flakes of cloud still cumbered the air and gusts of wind portended that it might gather again  henry ward took this opportunity of giving his first dinner party he said it was a necessary return for the civilities they had received and to averils representation that it transgressed the system of rigid economy that so much tormented her he replied by referring her to mrs pugh for lessons in the combination of style and inexpensiveness  averil had almost refused but the lady herself proffered her instructions and reluctance was of no avail nothing but demonstrations from which her conscience shrank could have served to defend her from the officious interference so eagerly and thankfully encouraged by the master of the house  vainly did she protest against pretension and quote the example of the grange she found herself compelled to sacrifice the childrens lessons to learn of mrs pugh to make the paper flowers that with bonbons and sweetmeats were to save the expense of good food on the dinnertable and which she feared would be despised by miss may nay perhaps laughed over with mr tom  she hated the whole concern even the invitation to dr and miss may knowing that it was sent in formal vanity accepted in pure goodnature would bring them into society they did not like and expose her brothers bad taste  only one thing could have added to her dislike namelythat which all stoneborough perceived excepting herself and leonardthat this dinner was intended as a step in henrys courtship and possibly as an encouragement of harvey andersons liking for herself  averil held her head so high and was so little popular that no one of less assurance than mrs ledwich herself would have dared approach her with personal gossip and even mrs ledwich was silent here so that averil too young and innocent to connect second marriages with recent widowhood drew no conclusions from henrys restless eagerness that his household should present the most imposing appearance  while the bill of fare was worrying averil leonard was told by aubrey that his father had brought home a fossil tower of babel dug up with some earth out of a new well three miles off with tidings of other unheardof treasures and a walk was projected in quest of them in which leonard was invited to join  he gladly came to the early dinner where he met reduced numbersthe ernescliffes being at maplewood tom at cambridge and harry in the channel fleet and as usual he felt the difference between the perfect understanding and friendship in the one home and the dread of dangerous subjects in the other  the expedition had all the charms of the coombe times and the geological discoveries were so numerous and precious that the load became sufficient to break down the finders and ethel engaged a marketwoman to bring the baskets in her cart the next morning  that morning a note from richard begged ethel to come early to cocksmoor to see granny hall who was dying  thus left to their own devices aubrey and gertrude conscientiously went through some of their studies then proceeded to unpack their treasury of fossils and endeavour to sort out leonards share as to which doubts arose daisy proposed to carry the specimens at once to bankside where she wanted to see leonards prime echinus and aubrey readily agreed neither of the young heads having learnt the undesirableness of a morning visit in a house preparing for a dinnerparty too big for it  however leonard made them extremely welcome  it was too foggy a day for rifle practice and all the best plate and china were in the schoolroom his only place of refuge ave was fluttering about in hopes of getting everything done before mrs pugh could take it out of her hands and the energies of the household were spent on laying out the diningtable  it was clearly impossible to take gertrude anywhere but into the drawingroom which was in demitoilette state the lustres released from their veils the gayer cushions taken out of their hidingplaces and the brown holland covers half off  this was the only tranquil spot and so poor little mab thought forbidden ground though it was  even in her own home the schoolroom a strange man had twice trod upon her toes so no wonder when she saw her own master and his friends in the drawingroom that she ventured in and leaping on a velvet cushion she had never seen before and had never been ordered off she there curled herself up and went to sleep unseen by leonard who was in eager controversy upon the specimens which gertrude as she unpacked set down on floor chair or ottoman unaware of the offence she was committing  so unmolested the young geologists talked named and sorted the specimens till the clock striking the halfhour warned the mays that they must return and leonard let them out at the window and crossed the lawn to the side gate with them to save the distance  he had just returned and was kneeling on the floor hastily collecting the fossils when the door opened and henry ward coming home to inspect the preparations beheld the drawingroom bestrewn with the rough stones that he had proscribed and mab not only in the room but reposing in the centre of the most magnificent cushion in the house  his first movement of indignation was to seize the dog with no gentle hand  she whined loudly and leonard whom he had not seen shouted angrily let her alone then at another cry from her finding his advance to her rescue impeded by a barricade of the crowded and disarranged furniture he grew mad with passion and launched the stone in his hand a long sharppointed belemnite  it did not strike henry but a sound proclaimed the mischief as it fell back from the surface of the mirror making a huge star of cracks unmarked by leonard who pushing sofa and ottoman to the right and left thundered up to his brother and with uplifted hand demanded what he meant by his cruelty  isis this defiance stammered henry pointing to the disordered room  look here averil as she appeared at the sounds do you defend this boy now he has very nearly killed me  killed you and leonard laughed angrily but when henry held up the elfbolt and he saw its sharp point he was shocked and he saw horror in averils face  i see he said gravely  it was a mercy i did not and he paused i did not know what i was about when you were misusing my dog henry shake hands i am sorry for it  but henry had been very much frightened as well as angered and thought perhaps it was a moment to pursue his advantage  you treat things lightly he said not accepting the hand  see what you have done  i am glad it was not your head said leonard  what does it cost ill pay  more than your keep for a year moaned henry as he sighed over the long limbs of the starfishlike fracture  well i will give up anything you like if you will only not be sulky about it henry  it was unlucky and im sorry for it i cant say more  but i can said henry with angry dignity reinforced by the sight of the seamed reflection of his visage in the shivered glass  i tell you leonard theres no having you in the house you defy my authority you insult my friends you waste and destroy more than you are worth and you are absolutely dangerous  i would as soon have a wild beast about the place  if you dont get the randall next week and get off to the university to old axworthys office you go at once  very well i will said leonard turning to collect the fossils as if he had done with the subject  henry henry what are you saying cried the sister  not a word ave said leonard  i had rather break stones on the road than live where my keep is grudged and theres not spirit enough to get over a moments fright  it is not any one individual thing began henry in a tone of annoyance but your whole course  there he paused perceiving that leonard paid no attention to his words continuing quietly to replace the furniture and collect the fossils as it no one else were in the room after which he carried the basket upstairs  averil hurried after him  leonard oh why dont you explain  why dont you tell him how the stones came there  leonard shook his head sternly  dont you mean to do anything  nothing  but you wanted another year before trying for the scholarship  yes i have no chance there  he will not do it  he cannot mean it  i do then  i will get my own living and not be a burthen where my brother cannot forgive a broken glass or a moments fright said leonard and she felt that his calm resentment was worse than his violence  he will be cooler and then  i will have no more said to him  it is plain that we cannot live together and theres an end of it  dont cry or you wont be fit to be seen  i wont come down to dinner  yes you will  let us have no more about it  some one wants you  please maam the fish is come  sister sister come and see how i have done up the macaroons in green leaves  sister sister do come and reach me down some calycanthus out of the greenhouse  i will said leonard descending and for the rest of the day he was an efficient assistant in the decorations and the past adventure was only apparent in the shattered glass and the stern ceremonious courtesy of the younger brother towards the elder  averil hurried about devoid of all her former interest in so doing things for herself as to save interference and when mrs ledwich and mrs pugh walked in overflowing with suggestions she let them have their way and toiled under them with the sensation of being like dumb driven cattle  if leonard were to be an exile what mattered it to her who ruled or what appearance things made  only when she went to her own room to dress had she a moment to realize the catastrophe its consequences and the means of averting them  so appalled was she that she sat with her hair on her shoulders as if spellbound till the first ring at the door aroused her to speed and consternation perhaps a little lessened by one of her sisters rushing in to say that it was mrs ledwich and mrs pugh and that henry was still in the cellar decanting the wine  long before the hosts were ready dr may and ethel had likewise arrived and became cognizant of the fracture of the mirror for though the nucleus was concealed by a large photograph stuck into the frame one long crack extended even to the opposite corner  the two ladies were not slow to relate all that they knew and while the aunt dismayed ethel by her story the niece with much anxiety asked dr may how it was that these dear nice superior young people should have such unfortunate temperswas it from any error in management so earnest was her manner so inquiring her look that dr may suspected that she was feeling for his opinion on personal grounds and tried to avert the danger by talking of the excellence of the parents but he was recalled from his eulogium on poor mrs ward  oh yes one felt for them so very much and they are so religious so well principled and all that one could wish but family dissension is so dreadful  i am very little used to young men or boys and i never knew anything like this  the lads are too nearly of an age said the doctor  and would such things be likely to happen among any brothers  i should trust not said the doctor emphatically  i should so like to know in confidence which you think likely to be most to blame  never was the doctor more glad that averil made her appearance  he carefully avoided getting near mrs pugh for the rest of the evening but he could not help observing that she was less gracious than usual to the master of the house while she summoned leonard to her side to ask about the volunteer proceedings and formed her immediate court of harvey anderson and mr scudamour  the dinner went on fairly though heavily  averil in her one great trouble lost the sense of the minor offences that would have distressed her pride and her taste had she been able to attend to them and forgot the dulness of the scene in her anxiety to seek sympathy and counsel in the only quarter where she cared for it  she went mechanically through her duties as lady of the house talking commonplace subjects dreamily to dr may and scarcely even giving herself the trouble to be brief with mr anderson who was on her other side at dinner  in the drawingroom she left the other ladies to their own devices in her eagerness to secure a few minutes with ethel may and disabuse her of whatever mrs ledwich or mrs pugh might have said  ethel had been more hopeful before she heard the true version she had hitherto allowed much for mrs ledwichs embellishments and she was shocked and took shame to her own guiltless head for gertrudes thoughtlessness  oh no said averil there was nothing that any one need have minded if henry had waited for explanation  and now will you get dr may to speak to him  if he only knew how people would think of his treating leonard so i am sure he would not do it  he cannot said ethel  dont you know what he thinks of it himself he said to papa last year that your father would as soon have sent leonard to the hulks as to the vintry mill  oh i am so glad some one heard him  he would care about having that cast up against him if he cared for nothing else  it must have been a mere threat  leonard surely has only to ask his pardon  no indeed not again miss may said averil  leonard asked once and was refused and cannot ask again  no the only difficulty is whether he ought not to keep to his word and go to the mill if he does not get the randall  did he say he would  of course he did when henry threatened him with it and talked of the burden of his maintenance  he said very well i will and he means it  he will not mean it when the spirit of repentance has had time to waken  he will take nothing that is grudged him said averil  oh is it not hard that i cannot get at my own money and send him at once to cambridge and never ask henry for another farthing  nay averil i think you can do a better part by trying to make them forgive one another  averil had no notion of leonards again abasing himself and though she might try to bring henry to reason by reproaches she would not persuade  she wished her guest had been the sympathizing mary rather than miss may who was sure to take the part of the elder and the authority  repentance  forgiveness  if miss may should work on leonard to sue for pardon and toleration and mrs pugh should intercede with henry to take him into favour she had rather he were at the vintry mill at once in his dignity and henry be left to his disgrace  ethel thought of dr spencers words on the beach at coombe never threaten providence  she longed to repeat them to leonard as she watched his stern determined face and the elaborately quiet motions that spoke of a fixed resentful purpose but to her disappointment and misgiving he gave her no opportunity and for the first time since their seaside intercourse held aloof from her  nor did she see him again during the week that intervened before the decision of the scholarship though three days of it were holidays aubrey whom she desired to bring him in after the rifle drill reported that he pronounced himself sorry to refuse but too busy to come in and he seemed to be cramming with fiery vehemence for the mere chance of success  the chance was small  the only hope lay in the possibility of some hindrance preventing the return of either forder or folliot and in the meantime the mays anxiously thought over leonards prospects his remaining at home was evidently too great a trial for both brothers and without a scholarship he could not go to the university  the evils of the alternative offered by his brother were duly weighed by the doctor and ethel with an attempt to be impartial  mr axworthy though the mill was the centre of his business was in fact a corn merchant of considerable wealth and with opportunities of extending his connection much farther  had his personal character been otherwise dr may thought a young man could not have a better opening than a seat in his office and the future power of taking shares in his trade there need be no loss of position and there was great likelihood both of prosperity and the means of extensive usefulness  ethel sighed at the thought of the higher aspirations that she had fostered till her own mind was set on them  nay said the doctor depend upon it the desk is admirable training for good soldiers of the church  see the fearful evil that befalls great schemes intrusted to people who cannot deal with money matters and see on the other hand what our merchants and men of business have done for the church and do not scorn the receipt of custom  but the man papa  yes there lies the hitch  if leonard fails i can lay things before henry such as perhaps he may be too young to know and which must change his purpose  mr axworthys career during his youth and early manhood was guessed at rather than known but even since his return and occupation of the vintry mill his vicious habits had scandalized the neighbourhood and though the more flagrant of these had been discontinued as he advanced in age there was no reason to hope that he had so much left off his sins as that his sins had left him off  his greatnephew who lived with him and assisted in his business was a dashing sporting young man of no good character known to be often intoxicated and concerned in much low dissipation and as dangerous an associate as could be conceived for a highspirited lad like leonard  dr may could not believe that any provocation of temper any motive of economy any desire to be rid of encumbrances to his courtship could induce a man with so much good in him as there certainly was in henry ward to expose his orphan brother to such temptations and he only reserved his remonstrance in the trust that it would not be needed and the desire to offer some better alternative of present relief  one of the examiners was normans old school and college friend charles cheviot now a clergyman and an undermaster at one of the great schools recently opened for the middle classes where he was meeting with great success and was considered a capital judge of boys characters  he was the guest of the mays during the examination and though his shy formal manner and convulsive efforts at young lady talk greatly affronted gertrude the brothers liked him  he was in consternation at the decline of stoneborough school since mr wilmot had ceased to be an undermaster the whole tone of the school had degenerated and it was no wonder that the government inquiries were ominously directed in that quarter  scholarship was at a low ebb dr hoxton seemed to have lost what power of teaching he had ever possessed and as dr may observed the poor old school was going to the dogs  but even in the present state of things leonard had no chance of excelling his competitors  his study like theirs had been mere taskwork and though he showed more native power than the rest yet perhaps this had made the mere learning by rote even more difficult to an active mind full of inquiry  he was a whole year younger than any other who touched the foremost ranks two years younger than several and though he now and then showed a feverish spark of genius reminding mr cheviot of norman in his famous examination it was not sustainedthere were will and force but not scholarshipand besides there was a wide blurred spot in his memory as though all the brainwork of the quarter before his illness had been confused and had not yet become clear  there was every likelihood that a few years would make him superior to the chosen randall scholar but at present his utmost efforts did not even place him among the seven whose names appeared honourably in the newspaper  it was a failure but mr cheviot had become much interested in the boy for his own sake as well as from what he heard from the mays and he strongly advised that leonard should at easter obtain employment for a couple of years at the school in which he himself was concerned  he would thus be maintaining himself and pursuing his own studies under good direction so as to have every probability of success in getting an open scholarship at one of the universities  nothing could be better and there was a perfect jubilee among the mays at the proposal  aubrey was despatched as soon as breakfast was over to bring leonard to talk it over and dr may undertook to propound it to henry on meeting him at the hospital but aubrey came back looking very blankleonard had started of his own accord that morning to announce to his uncle his acceptance of a clerks desk at the vintry mill  averil followed upon aubreys footsteps and arrived while the schoolroom was ringing with notes of vexation and consternation  she was all upon the defensive  she said that not a word had passed on the subject since the dinnerparty and there had not been a shadow of a dispute between the brothers in fact she evidently was delighted with leonards dignified position and strength of determination and thought this expedition to the vintry mill a signal victory  when she heard what the mays had to propose she was enchanted she had no doubt of henrys willing consent and felt that leonards triumph and independence were secured without the sacrifice of prospects which she had begun to regard as a considerable price for his dignity  but dr may was not so successful with henry ward  he did not want to disoblige his uncle who had taken a fancy to leonard and might do much for the family he thought his father would have changed his views of the uncle and nephew had he known them better he would not accept the opinion of a stranger against people of his own family and he had always understood the position of an usher to be most wretched nor would he perceive the vast difference between the staff of the middle school and of the private commercial academy  he evidently was pleased to stand upon his rights to disappoint dr may and perhaps to gratify his jealousy by denying his brother a superior education  yet in spite of this ebullition which had greatly exasperated dr may there was every probability that henrys consent might be wrung out or dispensed with and plans of attack were being arranged at the teatable when a new obstacle in the shape of a note from leonard himself   my dear aubrey  i am very much obliged to dr may and mr cheviot for their kind intentions but i have quite settled with mr axworthy and i enter on my new duties next week  i am sorry to leave our corps but it is too far off and i must enter the whitford one                                        yours                                           l a ward   the boy is mad with pride and temper said the doctor  and his sister has made him so added ethel  shall i run down to bankside and tell him it is all bosh said aubrey jumping up  i dont think that is quite possible under henrys very nose said ethel  perhaps they will all be tamer by tomorrow now they have blown their trumpets but i am very much vexed  and really added mr cheviot if he is so wrongheaded i begin to doubt if i could recommend him  you do not know how he has been galled and irritated said the general voice  i wonder what mrs pugh thinks of it presently observed the doctor  ah said ethel mrs pugh is reading john of anjou  indeed said the doctor i suspected the wind was getting into that quarter  master henry does not know his own interest she was sure to take part with a handsome lad  why have you never got mrs pugh to speak for him said mary  i am sure she would  o mary simple mary you to be aves friend and not know that her interposition is the only thing wanting to complete the frenzy of the other two  ethel said little more that evening she was too much grieved and too anxious  she was extremely disappointed in leonard and almost hopeless as to his future  she saw but one chance of preventing his seeking this place of temptation and that was in the exertion of her personal influence  his avoidance of her showed that he dreaded it but one attempt must be made  all night was spent in broken dreams of just failing to meet him or of being unable to utter what was on her tongue and in her waking moments she almost reproached herself for the discovery how near her heart he was and how much pleasure his devotion had given her  nothing but resolution on her own part could bring about a meeting and she was resolute  she stormed the castle in person and told averil she must speak to leonard  ave was on her side now and answered with tears in her eyes that she should be most grateful to have leonard persuaded out of this dreadful plan and put in the way of excelling as he ought to do she never thought it would come to this  no thought ethel people blow sparks without thinking they may burn a house down  ave conducted her to the summerhouse where leonard was packing up his fossils  he met them with a face resolutely bent on brightness i am to take all my household gods he said as he shook hands with ethel  i see said ethel gravely and as averil was already falling out of hearing she added i thought you were entirely breaking with your old life  no indeed said leonard turning to walk with her in the paths i am leaving the place where it is most impossible to live in  this has been a place of great overgreat trial i know said ethel but i do not ask you to stay in it  my word is my word said leonard snapping little boughs off the laurels as he walked  a hasty word ought not to be kept  his face looked rigid and he answered not  leonard she said i have been very unhappy about you for i see you doing wilfully wrong and entering a place of temptation in a dangerous spirit  i have given my word repeated leonard  o leonard it is pride that is speaking not the love of truth and constancy  i never defend myself said leonard  ethel felt deeply the obduracy and pride of these answers her eyes filled with tears and her hopes failed  perhaps leonard saw the pain he was giving for he softened and said miss may i have thought it over and i cannot go back  i know i was carried away by passion at the first moment and i was willing to make amends  i was rejected as you know  was it fit that we should go on living together  i do not ask you to live together  when he reproached me with the cost of my maintenance and threatened me with the mill if i lost the scholarship which he knew i could not get i said i would abide by those words  i do abide by them  there is no reason that you should  why should you give up all your best and highest hopes because you cannot forgive your brother  miss may if i lived with you and the doctor i could have such aims henry has taken care to make them sacrilege for me  i shall never be fit now and theres an end of it  you might  no no no  a school indeed  i should be dismissed for licking the boys before a week was out  besides i want the readiest way to get on in the world i must take care of my sisters i dont trust one moment to henrys affection for any of them  this is no home for me and it soon may be no home for them and the boys eyes were full of tears though his voice struggled for firmness and indifference  i am very sorry for you leonard said ethel much more affectionately as she felt herself nearer her friend of coombe i am glad you have some better motives but i do not see how you will be more able to help them in this way  i shall be near them said leonard i can watch over them  and ififit is true what they say about henry and mrs pughthen they could have a cottage near the mill and i could live with them dont you see miss may  yes but i question whether on further acquaintance you will wish for your sisters to be with their relations there  the other course would put you in the way of a better atmosphere for them  but not for six years said leonard  no miss may to show you it is not what you think in me i will tell you that i had resolved the last thing to ask henrys pardon for my share in this unhappy halfyear but this is the only resource for me or my sisters and my mind is made up  o leonard are you not deceiving yourself  are the grapes ever so sour or the nightshade below so sweet as when the fox has leapt too short and is too proud to climb  nightshade  why pray  my father would tell you i know he thinks your cousin no safe companion  i know that already but i can keep out of his way  then this is the end of it said ethel feeling only half justified in going so far the end of all we thought and talked of at coombe  there was a struggle in the boys face and she did not know whether she had touched or angered him  i cant help it he said as if he would have recalled his former hardness but then softening no miss may why should it be  a man can do his duty in any state of life  in any state of life where god has placed him but how when it is his own selfwill  there are times when one must judge for ones self  very well then i have done leonard  if you can conscientiously feel that you are acting for the best and not to gratify your pride then i can only say i hope you will be helped through the course you have chosen  goodbye  butmiss maythough i cannot take your advice he hesitated this is not giving me up  never while you let me esteem you  thank you he said brightening that is something to keep my head above water even if this place were all you think it  my father thinks said ethel  i am engaged now i cannot go back said leonard  thank you miss may  thank you for listening patiently said ethel  goodbye  andand he added earnestly following her back to the house you do not think the coombe days cancelled  if you mean my hopes of you said ethel with a swelling heart as long as you do your dutyforfor the highest reason they will only take another course and i will try to think it the right one  ethel had mentally made this interview the test of her regard for leonard  she had failed and so had her test her influence had not succeeded but it had not snapped the boy in all his wilfulness had been too much for her and she could no longer condemn and throw him off  oh why will not the rights and wrongs of this world be more clearly divided     chapter xi    the stream was deeper than i thought     when first i ventured here   i stood upon its sloping edge     without a rising fearh bonar   it was a comfort to find that the brothers parted on good terms  the elder was beholden to the younger for the acquiescence that removed the odium of tyranny from the expulsion and when the one great disturbance had silenced the ephemeral dissensions that had kept both minds in a constant state of irritation henry wanted by kindness and consideration to prove to himself and the world that leonards real interests were his sole object and leonard rejoiced in being at peace so long as his pride and resolution were not sacrificed  he went off as though his employment had been the unanimous choice of the family carrying with him his dog his rifle his fishingrod his fossils and all his other possessions but with the understanding that his sundays were to be passed at home by way of safeguard to his religion and morals bespeaking the care and consideration of his senior as henry assured himself and mrs pugh and tried to persuade his sister and dr may  but dr may was more implacable than all the rest  he called henrys action the deed of josephs brethren and viewed the matter as the responsible head of a family he had a more vivid contemporaneous knowledge of the axworthy antecedents and he had been a witness to henrys original indignant repudiation of such a destiny for his brother  he was in the mood of a man whose charity had endured long and refused to condemn but whose condemnation when forced from him was therefore doubly strong  the displeasure of a loving charitable man is indeed a grave misfortune  never had he known a more selfish and unprincipled measure deliberately flying in the face of his parents known wishes before they had been a year in their graves exposing his brother to ruinous temptation with his eyes open  the lad was destroyed body and soul as much as if he had been set down in satans own clutches and if they did not mind what they were about he would drag aubrey after him  as sure as his name was dick may he would sooner have cut his hand off than have sent the boys to coombe together could he have guessed that this was to be the result  such discourses did not tend to make ethel comfortable  if she had been silly enough to indulge in a dream of her influence availing to strengthen leonard against temptation she must still have refrained from exerting it through her wonted medium since it was her fathers express desire that aubrey for his own sake should be detached from his friend as much as possible  aubrey was the greatest present difficulty  long before their illness the boys had been the resource of each others leisure and coombe had made their intimacy a friendship of the warmest nature aubrey was at an age peculiarly dependent on equal companionship and in the absence of his brothers the loss of his daily intercourse with leonard took away all the zest of life  even the volunteer practice lost its charm without the rival with whom he chiefly contended yet whose success against others was hotter to him than his own his other occupations all wanted partnership and for the first time in his life he showed weariness and contempt of his sisters society and pursuits  he rushed off on sunday evenings for a walk with leonard and though dr may did not interfere the daughters saw that the abstinence was an effort of prudence and were proportionately disturbed when one day at dinner in his fathers absence aubrey who had been overlooking his fishingflies with some reviving interest refused all his sisters proposals for the afternoon and when they represented that it was not a good fishingday owned that it was not but that he was going over to consult leonard ward about some gray hackles  but you mustnt aubrey cried gertrude aghast  aubrey made her a low mocking bow  i am sure papa would be very much vexed added she conclusively  i believe it was luckless hal that the millwheel tore in your nursery rhymes eh daisy said aubrey  nursery rhymes indeed returned the offended young lady you know it is a very wicked place and papa would be very angry at your going there  she looked at ethel extremely shocked at her not having interfered and disregarding all signs to keep silence  axworthyworthy of the axe said aubrey well pleased to retort a little teasing by the way young axworthy baiting the trap and old axworthy sitting up in his den to grind the unwary limb from limb  ethel why dont you tell him not exclaimed gertrude  because he knows papas wishes as well as i do said ethel and it is to them that he must attend not to you or me  aubrey muttered something about his father having said nothing to him and ethel succeeded in preventing daisy from resenting this answer she herself hoped to catch him in private but he easily contrived to baffle this attempt and was soon marching out of stoneborough in a state of rampant independence manhood and resolute friendship which nevertheless chose the way where he was least likely to encounter a little brown brougham  otherwise he might have reckoned three and a half miles of ploughed field soppy lane and water meadow as more than equivalent to five miles of good turnpike road  be that as it might he was extremely glad when after forcing his way through a sticky clayey path through a hazel copse his eye fell on a wide reach of meadow land the railroad making a hard line across it at one end and in the midst about half a mile off the river meandering like a blue ribbon lying loosely across the green flat the handsome buildings of the vintry mill lying in its embrace  aubrey knew the outward aspect of the place for the foreman at the mill was a frequent patient of his fathers and he had often waited in the old gig at the cottage door at no great distance but he looked with more critical eyes at the home of his friend  it was a place with much capacity built like the grange by the monks of the convent which had been the germ of the cathedral and showing the grand old monastic style in the solidity of its stone barns and storehouses all arranged around a court whereof the dwellinghouse occupied one side the lawn behind it with fine old trees and sloping down to the water which was full of bright ripples after its agitation around the great millwheel  the house was of more recent date having been built by a wealthy yeoman of queen annes time and had long ranges of squareheaded sash windows surmounted by a pediment carved with emblems of ceres and bacchus and a very tall front door also with a pediment and with stone stops leading up to it  of the same era appeared to be the great gateway and the turret above it containing a clock the hands of which pointed to 340  aubrey had rather it had been four at which time the office closed he looked round the court which seemed very dean and rather emptystables barns buildings and dwellinghouse not showing much sign of life excepting the ceaseless hum and clack of the mill and the dash of the water which propelled it  the windows nearest to him were so large and low that he could look in and see that the first two or three belonged to living rooms and the next two showed him business fittings and a back that he took to be leonards but he paused in doubt how to present himself and whether this were a welcome moment and he was very glad to see in a doorway of the upper story of the mill buildings the honest floury face of his fathers old patientthe foreman  greeting him in the open cordial way common to all dr mays children aubrey was at once recognized and the old man came down a stepladder in the interior to welcome him and answer his question where he should find mr ward  he is in the office sir there to the left hand as you go in at the front door but and he looked up at the clock maybe you would not mind waiting a bit till it strikes four  i dont know whether master might be best pleased at young gentlemen coming to see him in office hours  thank you said aubrey  i did not mean to be too soon hardy but i did not know how long the walk would be  perhaps it would have been more true had he said that he had wanted to elude his sisters but he was glad to accept a seat on a bundle of sacks tremulous with the motion of the mill and to enter into a conversation with the old foreman one of those good old peasants whose integrity and skill render them privileged persons worth their weight in gold long after their bodily strength has given way  well hardy do you mean to make a thorough good miller of mr ward  bless you master may hell never stay here long enough  why not  no nor his friends didnt ought to let him stay added hardy  why said aubrey  do you think so badly of your own trade hardy  but he could not get an answer from the oracle on this head  hardy continued hes a nice young gentleman but hell never put up with it  put up with what asked aubrey anxiously but at that instant a carter appeared at the door with a question for master hardy and aubrey was left to his own devices and the hum and clatter of the mill till the clock had struck four and beginning to think that hardy had forgotten him he was about to set out and reconnoitre when to his great joy leonard himself came hurrying up and heartily shook him by the hand  hardy told me you were here he said  well done old fellow i didnt think they would have let you come and see me  the girls did make a great row about it said aubrey triumphantly but i was not going to stand any nonsense  leonard looked a little doubtful then said well will you see the place or come and sit in my room  there is the parlour but we shall not be so quiet there  aubrey decided for leonards room and was taken through the front door into a vestibule paved with white stone with black lozenges at the intersections  there said leonard the office is here you see and my uncles rooms beyond all on the ground floor he is too infirm to go upstairs  this way is the diningroom and sam has got a sittingroom beyond then there are the servants rooms  it is a great place and horridly empty  aubrey thought so as his footsteps echoed up the handsome but illkept stone staircase with its fanciful balusters half choked with dust and followed leonard along a corridor with deep windows overlooking the garden and river and great panelled doors opposite neither looking as if they were often either cleaned or opened and the passage smelling very fusty  pah said aubrey it puts me in mind of the wings of houses in books that get shut up because somebody has been murdered  are you sure it is not haunted leonard  only by the rats he answered laughing they make such an intolerable row that poor little mab is frightened out of her wits and i dont know whether they would not eat her up if she did not creep up close to me  im tired of going at them with the poker and would poison every man jack of them if it were not for the fear of her getting the dose by mistake  is that what hardy says you will never put up with asked aubrey but instead of answering leonard turned to one of the great windows saying  there now would not this be a charming place if it were properly kept and aubrey looked out at the great cedar spreading out its straight limbs and flakes of dark foliage over the sloping lawn one branch so near the window as to invite adventurous exits and a little boat lying moored in the dancing water below  perfect said aubrey  what fish there must lie in the mill tail  ay i mean to have a try at them some of these days i should like you to come and help but perhapsha little mab do you wonder what im after so long  heres a friend for you as the little dog danced delighted round him and paid aubrey her affectionate respects  her delicate drawingroom beauty did not match with the spacious but neglectedlooking room whence she issued  it had three great uncurtained windows looking into the court with deep windowseats olivecoloured painted walls the worse for damp and wear a small amount of oldfashioned solid furniture and all leonards individual goods chiefly disposed of in a cupboard in the wall but averils beautiful watercoloured drawings hung over the chimney  to aubreys petted homebred notions it was very bare and dreary and he could not help exclaiming well they dont lodge you sumptuously  i dont fancy many clerks in her majestys dominions have so big and airy an apartment to boast of said leonard  lets see these flies of yours  their mysteries occupied the boys for some space but aubrey returned to the charge  what is it that hardy says youll never put up with leonard  what did the old fellow say asked leonard laughing and as aubrey repeated the conversation ending with the oracular prediction he laughed again but said proudly hell see himself wrong then  ill put up with whatever ive undertaken  but what does he mean  serving ones apprenticeship i suppose said leonard they all think me a fine gentleman and above the work i know though ive never stuck at anything yet  if i take to the business i suppose it is capable of being raised up to meit need not pull me down to it eh  there need be no down in the case said aubrey  my father always says there is no down except in meanness and wrong  but as if that mention brought a recollection to his mind what oclock is it  i must not stay much longer  ill walk a bit of the way home with you said leonard but i must be back by five for dinner  i go to rifle practice two days in the week and i dont like to miss the others for sams often out and the poor old man does not like being left alone at meals  the two boys were at the room door when aubrey heard a step felt the fustiness enlivened by the odour of a cigar and saw a figure at the top of the stairs  i say ward observed mr sam in a rude domineering voice spelmans account must be all looked over tonight he says that there is a blunder  dye hear  very well  who have you got there  it is aubrey may  oh good morning to you making a kind of salutation have you been looking at the water  weve got some fine fish there if you like to throw a line any daywell that account must be done tonight and if you cant find the error youll only have to do it over again  leonards colour had risen a good deal but he said nothing and his cousin ran downstairs and drove off in his dogcart  is it much of a business said aubrey feeling extremely indignant  look here said leonard leading the way downstairs and into the office where he pointed to two huge account books  every page in that one must i turn over this blessed night and if he had only told me three hours ago i could have done the chief of it instead of kicking my heels all the afternoon  has he any right to order you about out of office hours and without a civil word either  why do you stand it  because i can stand anything better than being returned on henrys hands said leonard and he has spite enough for that  the thing must be done and if he wont do it i must thats all  come along  as they went out the unwieldy figure of the elder mr axworthy was seen leaning out of his open window smoking a clay pipe  he spoke in a much more friendly tone as he said going out eh  mind the dinnertime  yes sir said leonard coming nearer im not going far  who have you got there was again asked  one of the young mays sir  i was going to walk part of the way back  aubrey thought the grunt not very civil and as the boys and mab passed under the gateway leonard continued theres not much love lost between him and your father he hates the very name  i should expect he would said aubrey as if his hatred were an honour  i fancy theres some old grievance said leonard where he was wrong of course  not that that need hinder your coming over aubrey ive a right to my own friends but  and so have i to mine said aubrey eagerly  but you see added leonard i wouldnt have you do itifif it vexes your sister  i can see you every sunday you know and we can have some fun together on saturdays when the evenings get longer  aubreys face fell he had a strong inclination for leonards company and likewise for the trout in the mill tail and he did not like his independence to be unappreciated  you see said leonard laying his hand kindly on his shoulder it is very jolly of you but i know they would hate it in the high street if you were often here and it is not worth that  besides aubrey to tell the plain truth sams not fit company for any decent fellow  i cant think how he came to ask me to fish  just to show he is master because he knew the poor old man would not like it  it is one reason he is so savage with me because his uncle took me without his consent  but leonard it must be worse than the living at home ever was  leonard laughed  its different being jawed in the way of business and at ones own home  id go through a good deal more than i do here in the week to have home what it is now on sunday  why henry really seems glad to see me and we have not had the shadow of a row since i came over here  dont you tell ave all this mind and you may just as well not talk about it at home you know or they will think im going to cry off  aubrey was going to ask what he looked to but leonard saw or thought he saw a weasel in the hedge and the consequent charge and pursuit finished the dialogue the boys parted and aubrey walked home his satisfaction in his expedition oozing away at every step though his resolve to assert his liberty grew in proportion  of course it had not been possible to conceal from dr may where aubrey was gone and his annoyance had burst out vehemently the whole round of objurgations against the wards the vintry mill and his own folly in fostering the friendship were gone through and ethel had come in for more than she could easily bear for not having prevented the escapade  gertrude had hardly ever seen her father so angry and sat quaking for her brother and ethel meekly avoided answering again with the happy trustfulness of experienced love  at last as the tea was nearly over aubrey walked in quite ready for selfdefence  nobody spoke for a little while except to supply him with food but presently dr may said not at all in the tone in which he had talked of his sons journey you might as well have told me of your intentions aubrey  i didnt think they mattered to anybody said aubrey we generally go our own way in the afternoon  oh said dr may  interference with the liberty of the subject  aubrey coloured and felt he had not quite spoken truth  i could not give him up father he said less defiantly  no certainly not but i had rather you only saw him at home  it will be more for our peace of mind  well father said aubrey i am not going there any more  he told me not himself and then with laughing eyes he added he said you would not like it ethel  poor boy said ethel greatly touched  very right of him said dr may well pleased  he is a fine lad and full of proper feeling  what sort of a berth has the old rogue given him aubrey  much relieved that matters had taken this course aubrey tried to tell only as much as his friend would approve but the medium was not easily found and pretty nearly the whole came out  dr may was really delighted to hear how sam treated him  if that fellow takes the oppressive line there may be some hope he said  his friendship is the worse danger than his enmity  when the sisters had bidden good night the doctor detained aubrey to say very kindly my boy i do not like to hear of your running counter to your sister  im not going there again said aubrey willing to escape  wait a minute aubrey said dr may i want to tell you that i feel for you in this matter more than my way of talking may have made it seem to you  i have a great regard for your friend leonard and think he has been scandalously used and i dont want to lessen your attachment to him  far be it from me to think lightly of a friendship especially of one formed at your age  your very name my boy shows that i am not likely to do that  aubrey smiled frankly his offended selfassertion entirely melted  i know it is very hard on you but you can understand that the very reasons that made me so averse to leonards taking this situation would make me anxious to keep you away from his relations there not necessarily from him  as long as he is what he is now i would not lift a finger to keep you from him  have i ever done so aubrey  no papa  nor will i as long as he is what i see him now  after this aubrey is it too much to ask of you to keep out of the way of the persons with whom he is thrown  i will do so papa  he wishes it himself  then with an effort he added i am sorry i went today i ought not but and he looked a little foolish  you did not like taking orders from the girls  no wonder aubrey i have been very thankful to you for bearing it as you have done  it is the worst of home education that these spirits of manliness generally have no vent but mischief  but you are old enough now to be thankful for such a friend and adviser as ethel and i dont imagine that she orders you  no said aubrey smiling and mumbling but daisy  oh i can quite understand the aggravation of daisy happening to be right but you must really be man enough to mind your own conscience even if daisy is imprudent enough to enforce it  it was not only that said aubrey but i could not have ward thinking i turned up my nose at his having got into business  no aubrey he need never fancy it is the business that i object to but the men  make that clear to him and ask him to this house as much as you please  the more thorough he is in his business the more i shall respect him  aubrey smiled and thanked his father with a cleared brow wondering at himself for having gone without consulting him  good night my boy  may this friendship of yours be a lifelong stay and blessing to you both even though it may cost you some pain and selfcommand as all good things must aubrey  that evening ethel had been writing to cambridge  tom had passed his examination with great credit and taken an excellent degree after which he projected a tour in germany for which he had for some time been economizing as a wellearned holiday before commencing his course of hospitals and lectures  tom was no great correspondent and had drilled his sisters into putting nothing but the essential into their letters instead as he said of concealing it in flummery  this is a specimen of the way tom liked to be written to                                              stoneborough feb 20th my dear tom  dr spencer says nothing answers so well as a knapsack  get one at  the price is l s d  order extra fittings as required including a knife and fork  letters from n z of the 1st of november all well  i wish aubrey was going with you he misses leonard ward so sorely as to be tempted to follow him to the vintry mill  i suspect your words are coming true and the days of petticoat government ending  however even if he would not be in your way he could not afford to lose six months study before going into residence                                             your affectionate sister                                                     etheldred may   tom wrote that he should spend a night in london and come home  when he came the family exclaimed that his microscope whose handsome case he carried in his hand was much grown  and improved too i hope said tom proceeding to show off various new acquisitions and exchanges in the way of eyepieces lenses and other appliances of the most expensive order till his father exclaimed  really tom i wish i had the secret of your purse  the fact is said tom that i thought more would be gained by staying at home so i turned my travels into a binocular tube c  aubrey and gertrude shouted that tom certainly did love the microscope better than any earthly thing and he coolly accepted the inference  somewhat later he announced that he had decided that he should be better able to profit by the london lectures and hospitals if he first studied for half a year at the one at stoneborough under the direction of his father and dr spencer  dr may was extremely gratified and really esteemed this one of the greatest compliments his science had ever received dr spencer could not help observing i did not think it was in him to do such a wise thing  i never can fathom the rogue  i hope he was not bitten during his benevolent exertions last winter  meantime tom had observed that he had time to see that aubrey was decently prepared for cambridge and further promoted the boy to be his outofdoor companion removing all the tedium and perplexity of the last few weeks though apparently merely indulging his own inclinations  ethel recognized the fruit of her letter and could well forgive the extra care in housekeeping required for toms critical tastes nay the cool expulsion of herself and gertrude from her twenty years home the schoolroom and her final severance from aubreys studies though at the cost of a pang that reminded her of her girlhoods sorrow at letting norman shoot ahead of her  she gave no hint she knew that implicit reserve was the condition of his strange silent confidence in her and that it would be utterly forfeited unless she allowed his fraternal sacrifice to pass for mere longheaded prudence  aubreys saturday and sunday meetings with his friend were not yielded even to tom who endeavoured to interfere with them and would fain have cut the connection with the entire family treating miss ward with the most distant and supercilious bows on the unpleasantly numerous occasions of meeting her in the street and contriving to be markedly scornful in his punctilious civility to henry ward when they met at the hospital  his very look appeared a sarcasm to the fancy of the wards and he had a fashion of kindly inquiring after leonard that seemed to both a deliberate reproach and insult  disputes had become less frequent at bankside since leonards departure and few occasions of actual dissension arose but the spirit of party was not extinguished and the brother and sister had adopted lines that perhaps clashed less because they diverged more  averil had in reply to the constant exhortations to economize resolved to decline all invitations and this kept her constantly at home or with her harmonium whereas henry made such constant engagements that their dining together was the exception not the rule  after conscientiously teaching her sisters in the morning she devoted the rest of her day to their walk and to usefulness in the parish  she liked her tasks and would have been very happy in them but for the constant anxiety that hung over her lest her home should soon cease to be her home  henrys devotion to mrs pugh could no longer be mistaken  the conviction of his intentions grew upon his sister first from a mere absurd notion banished from her mind with derision then from a misgiving angrily silenced to a fixed expectation confirmed by the evident opinion of all around her and calling for decision and selfcommand on her own part  perhaps her feelings were unnecessarily strong and in some degree unjust to mrs pugh but she had the misfortune to be naturally proud and sensitive as well as by breeding too refined in tone for most of those who surrounded her  she had taken a personal dislike to mrs pugh from the first she regarded pretension as insincerity and officiousness as deliberate insult and she took the recoil of her taste for the judgment of principle  to see such a woman ruling in her mothers her own home would be bad enough but to be ruled by her and resign to her the management of the children would be intolerable beyond measure  too unhappy to speak of her anticipations even to leonard or to mary may she merely endeavoured to throw them off from day to day till one evening when the days had grown so long that she could linger in the twilight in the garden before her singing practice she was joined by henry with the long apprehended i want to speak to you ave  was it coming  her heart beat so fast that she could hardly hear his kind commencement about her excellent endeavours and the houses unhappy want of a mistress the childrens advantage and so on  she knew it could only tend to one point and longed to have it reached and passed  of course she would be prepared to hear who was the object of his choice and she could not but murmur yes and well  and ave you will i hope be gratified to hear that i am not entirely rejected  the fact is that i spoke too soon  averil could have jumped for joy and was glad it was too dusk for her face to be seen  i do not believe that her late husband could have had any strong hold on her affections but she has not recovered the shock of his loss and entreated as a favour granted to her sentiments of respect for his memory not to hear the subject mentioned for at least another year  i am permitted to visit at the house as usual and no difference is to be made in the terms on which we stand  now ave will youmay i ask of you to do what you can to remove any impression that she might not be welcome in the family  i never meant faltered averil checked by sincerity  you have always beensoso cold and backward in cultivating her acquaintance that i cannot wonder if she should think it disagreeable to you but ave when you consider my happiness and the immense advantage to all of you i am sure you will do what is in your power in my behalf  he spoke more affectionately and earnestly than he had done for months and averil was touched and felt that to hang back would be unkind  i will try she said  i do hope it may turn out for your happiness henry  for all our happiness said henry walking down to the gate and along the road with her proving all the way that he was acting solely for the good of the others and that averil and the children would find their home infinitely happier  a whole yeara years reprievewas the one thought in averils head that made her listen so graciously and answer so amiably that henry parted with her full of kind warm feeling  as the sage said who was to be beheaded if he could not in a year teach the kings ass to speakwhat might not happen in a year the king might die the ass might die or he might dieany way there was so much gained and averil for the time felt as lighthearted as if mrs pugh had vanished into empty air  to be sure her own life had of late been far from happy but this extension of it was bailed with suppressed ecstasyalmost as an answer to her prayers  ah ave little did you know what you wished in hoping for anything to prevent the marriage  she did obey her brother so far as to call upon mrs pugh whom she found in ordinary mourning and caplessa sign that dismayed her but on the other hand the lady though very goodnatured and patronizing entertained her with the praises of king john and showed her a copy of magna charta in process of illumination  also during her call tom may walked in with a little book on drops of water and averil found the lady had become inspired with a microscopic furore and was thinking of setting up a lens and preparing objects for herself under good tuition  though averil was very desirous that mrs pugh should refuse her brother yet this was the last service she wished the may family to render her  she was sure tom may must dislike and despise the widow as much as she did and since the whole town was unluckily aware of henrys intentions any interference with them was base and malicious if in the way of mere amusement and flirtation  she was resolved to see what the game was but only did see that her presence greatly disconcerted mr thomas may  henry was wretched and irritable in the velvet paws of the widow who encouraged him enough to give him hope and then held him aloof or was equally amiable to some one else  perhaps the real interpretation was that she loved attention  she was in all sincerity resolved to observe a proper period of widowhood and not determined whether when or how it should terminate courtship amused her and though attracted by henry and his good house the evidences of temper and harshness had made her unwilling to commit herself besides that she was afraid of averil and she was more flattered by the civilities of a lioncel like harvey anderson or if she could be sure of what mr thomas mays intentions were she would have preferred an embryo physician to a fullgrown surgeonat any rate it was right by her poor dear mr pugh to wait  she need not have feared having averil as an inmate  averil talked it over with leonard and determined that no power on earth should make her live with mrs pugh  if that were necessary to forward his suit she would make it plain that she was ready to depart  oh leonard if my uncle were but a nice sort of person how pleasant it would be for me and the children to live there and keep his house and i could make him so comfortable and nurse him  never ave cried leonard dont let the thing be talked of  oh no i know it would not do with samuel there but should we be too young for your old scheme of having a cottage together near  i did not know what the axworthys were like returned leonard  but need we see them much  ill tell you what ave ive heard them bothyes the old man the worst of the twosay things about women that made my blood boil leonard was quite red as he spoke  my father never let my mother see any of the concern and now i know why  ill never let you do so  then there is only one other thing to be done said averil and that is for me to go back to school as a parlour boarder and take the children with me  it would be very good for them and dear mrs wood would be very glad to have me  yes said leonard that is the only right thing ave and the mays will say so too  have you talked it over with them  no  i hate talking of this thing  well you had better get their advice  it is the best thing going said leonard with a sigh that sounded as if he wished he had taken it  but it was not to averil that he said so  to her he spoke brightly of serving the time for which he was bound to his uncle then of making a fresh engagement that would open a home to her or better still suppose sam did not wish to go on with the business he might take it and make the mill the lovely place it might be  it was to aubrey may that the boys real feelings came out as on the sunday evening they slowly wandered along the bank of the river  aubrey had seen a specimen of his life at the mill and had been kept up to the knowledge of its events and he well knew that leonard was heartily sick of it that the occupation was uncongenial and tedious in the extreme to a boy of good ability and superior educationnay that the drudgery was made unnecessarily oppressive was not the point he complained of though it was more trying than he had expected that was the bed that he had made and that he must lie upon  it was the suspicion of frauds and tricks of the trade and still worse the company that he lived in sam axworthy hated and tyrannized over him too much to make dissipation alluring and he was only disgusted by the foul language coarse manners and the remains of intemperance worked on in violent temper  the old man though helpless and past active vice was even more coarse in mind and conversation than his nephew and yet his feebleness and sams almost savage treatment of him enlisted leonards pity on his side  in general the old man was kind to leonard but would abuse him roundly when the evidences of his better principles and training or his allegiance to dr may came forward and leonard though greatly compassionating him could not always bear his reproaches with patience and was held back from more attention to him than common humanity required by an unlucky suggestion that he was currying favour in the hope of supplanting sam  old hardy is the only honest man in the place i do believe said leonard  ill tell you what aubrey i have made up my mind there is one thing i will not do  if ever they want to make me a party to any of their cheatings ill be off  that window and the cedartree stand very handy  ive been out there to bathe in the early summer mornings plenty of times already so never you be surprised if some fine day you hearnon est inventus  and where would you go  get up to london and see if my quarters salary would take me out in the steerage to some diggings or other  what would your brother say to me if i turned up at the grangenew zealand  say  mention ethel and see what he would not say  and the two boys proceeded to arrange the details of the evasion in such vivid colouring that they had nearly forgotten all present troubles above all when leonard proceeded to declare that new zealand was too tame and too settled for him he should certainly find something to do in the feejee isles where the high spirit of the natives their painted visages and marvellous headdresses as depicted in captain erskines voyage had greatly fired his fancy and they even settled how the gold fields should rebuild the market cross  and when im gone aubrey mind you see to mab he said laughing  oh  i thought mab was to act whittingtons cat  im afraid they would eat her up besides theres the voyage  no you must keep her till i come home even if she is to end like argus would you die of joy at seeing me eh little black neb     chapter xii                               let us meet   and question this most bloody piece of work   to know it farther                   macbeth   if you please sir master hardy from the vintry mill wants to see you said a voice at dr mays door early in the morning and the doctor completed his dressing in haste muttering to himself exclamations of concern that the old mans malady should have returned  on entering the study hardys appearance whiter than even the proverbial hue of his trade his agitation of feature confused eye and trembling lip inspired fears that the case was more alarming than had been apprehended but to cheer him the doctor began frightened about yourself master hardy eh  youve come out without breakfast and thats enough to put any man out of heart  no sir said the old man it is nothing about myself i wish it were no worse but ive not got the heart to go to tell the poor young gentleman and i thought  whatwhat has happened to the boy exclaimed dr may sharply standing as if ready to receive the rifle shot which he already believed had destroyed leonard  thats what we cant say sir returned hardy but he is gone no one knows where  and sir my poor master was found at five oclock this morning in his chair in his sittingroom stone dead from a blow on the head  mind what you are saying shouted the doctor passionately  you old scoundrel you dont mean to tell me that you are accusing the lad  i accuse nobody sir said the old man standing his ground and speaking steadily but respectfully i wouldnt say nothing to bring any one into trouble if i could help it and i came to ask you what was to be done  yes yes i beg your pardon hardy but it sounded enough to overset one  your poor master murdered you say  hardy nodded assent  and young ward missing  why the burglars must have hurt the poor fellow in defending his uncle  have you searched the place  i never thought of that sir said hardy his countenance much relieved it would be more like such a young gentleman as mr ward  then well get over to the mill as fast as we can and see what can be done said dr may snatching up his hat and gloves you come and walk with me to bankside and tell me by the way about this terrible business  good heavens theyll have thrown the boy into the river  and calling out that his carriage should follow to bankside the doctor dashed upstairs and knocked at ethels door  my dear he said there has been a robbery or something at the vintry mill  i must go and see henry ward about it  poor old axworthy is murdered and im terribly afraid leonard has met with some foul play  you or mary had better go and see about ave presently but dont believe a word of anything till you see me again  and shutting the door while ethel felt as if the room were reeling round with her dr may was in a few seconds more hastening along by hardys side extracting from him the little he had to tell  the old man had been unlocking the door of the mill at five oclock when he was summoned by loud shrieks from the window of mr axworthys sittingroom and found that the little maid had been appalled by the sight of her master sunk forward from his gouty chair upon the table his hair covered with blood  hardy had been the first to touch him and to perceive that he had long been dead  the housekeeper the only other servant who slept in the house had rushed in halfdressed but neither nephew appeared  young axworthy had gone the previous day to the county races leaving the time of his return doubtful and leonard ward did not answer when called  it was then found that his room was empty his bed untouched and the passage window outside his door left open  the terrified servants held confused consultation and while the groom had hurried off to give the alarm at whitford and ride on in search of sam axworthy hardy had taken another horse and started to inform henry ward but his heart failing him he had come to beg the doctor to break the intelligence to the family  dr may had few doubts that the robbers must have entered by the passage window and meeting resistance from leonard must have dragged him out and perhaps thrown him from it then having gone on to their murderous work in the old mans sittingroom  in that great rambling house where the maids slept afar off and the rats held nightly gambols strange noises were not likely to be observed and the thought of leonard lying stunned and insensible on the grass made the doctors pace almost a run as if he were hastening to the rescue  when mr ward sent down word that he was not up dr may replied that he must see him in bed and followed upon the very heels of the messenger encountering no amiable face for henry had armed himself for defence against any possible reproaches for his treatment of any patient  even when dr may began henry my poor fellow i have frightful news for you his month was opening to reply i knew we should lose that case let the patient be who he might when the few simple words put to flight all petulant jealousy and restored henry ward to what he had been when in his hour of sickness and affliction he had leant in full confidence on dr mays unfailing kindness  he was dressed by the time the brougham was at the door and would have hurried off without telling his sister of the alarm but dr may knowing that the town must soon be ringing with the news was sending him to averils room when both rejoiced to see mary enter the house charging her to keep averil quiet and believe nothing but what came from themselves they thrust on her the terrible commission and hastened away dwelling on the hope that every moment might be important  old hardy had already mounted his carthorse and for him farm roads so shortened the distance that he received them at the entrance of the courtyard which was crowded with excited gazers and important policemen  found him was the instantaneous question of both but hardy shook his head so sadly that the doctor hastily exclaimed what then  sir said hardy very low and with a deprecating look he did go up by the mail train to london last nightgot in at blewer station at 1215  they have telegraphed up sir  ill lay my life it is all a mistake said dr may grasping henrys arm as if to give him support and looking him in the face as though resolved that neither should be cast down  thats not all sir added hardy still addressing himself to the elder gentleman  theres his rifle sir  why he was not shot sharply cried dr may  you told me so yourself  no sir butyoull see for yourself presently  theres the blood and gray hairs on the stock sir  never fear henry we shall see said dr may pressing on and adding as soon as they were out of hearing  nothing those folks even the best of them like so well as laying on horrors thick enough  a policeman stood at the house door to keep off idlers but dr mays character and profession as well as his municipal rank caused way to be instantly made for them  they found a superintendent within and he at once began most unfortunate business mr mayorvery mysterious then as a sign from the doctor made him aware of henry wards near concern he added shall i inform young mr axworthy that you are here  is he come  yes sir  he had only slept at the three goblets not half a mile across the fields you know mr mayorcame home too late to disturb the house here slept there and was on the spot at the first intelligencebefore i was myself added the superintendent a little jealously  where is he  in his room sir  he was extremely overcome and retired to his room as soon as the necessary steps had been taken  would you wish to see the room sir  we are keeping it locked till the inquest takes place but  henry asked when his first word since his arrival and almost inarticulate  he was answered that it would probably be at two that afternoon the whitford coroner had intimated that he was ready and the down train would be in by one  a telegram had just arrived reporting that the electric message had anticipated the mail train and that young mr ward would be brought down in time  never mind never heed henry persisted dr may pressing the young mans arm as they proceeded to the door of the sittingroom he must be intensely shocked but he will explain the whole  nay ive no doubt we shall clear him  his rifle indeed  i could swear to his rifle anywhere  the superintendent had by this time opened the door of the sittingroom communicating on one side with the office on the other with the old mans bedroom  except that the body had been carried to the bed in the inner chamber all remained as it had been found  there were no signs of robberynot even of a struggle  the cushions of the easychair still bore the impress of the sitters weight the footstool was hardly pushed aside the massive library table was undisturbed the silver spoons and sugartongs beside the tumbler and plate on the supper tray the yellow light of the lamp still burnt not a paper was ruffled not a drawer pulled out  only a rifle stood leaning against the window shutter and towards it both friend and brother went at once hoping and trusting that it would be a stranger to their eyes  alas alas only too familiar were the rich brown mottlings of the stock the steel mountings the eagle crest and twisted h e cipher and in sickness of heart the doctor could not hide from himself the dark clot of gore and the few white hairs adhering to the wood and answering to the stain that dyed the leather of the desk  henry could not repress an agonized groan and averted his face but his companion undaunted met the superintendents eye and query you know it sir  i do  it was my soninlaws present to him  i wonder where he kept it for the ruffians to get hold of it  the superintendent remained civil and impassive and no one spoke to break the deathly hush of the silent room filled with the appliances of ordinary business life but tainted with the awful unexplained mark that there had been the foot of the shedder of blood in silence and at unawares  the man in authority at length continued his piteous exhibition  dr rankin of whitford had arrived on the first alarm but would not the gentlemen see the body  and he led them on dr mays eyes on the alert to seize on anything exculpatory but detecting nothing seeing only the unwieldy helpless form and aged feeble countenance of the deceased and receiving fresh impressions of the brutality and cowardice of the hand that could have struck the blow  he looked examined defined the injury and explained that it must have caused instant death thus hoping to divert attention from his pale horrorstricken companion whose too apparent despondency almost provoked him  at the doctors request they were taken up the staircase into the corridor and shown the window which had been found nearly closed but not fastened as though it had been partially shut down from the outside  the cedar bough almost brushed the glass and the slope of turf came so high up the wall that an active youth could easily swing himself down to it and the superintendent significantly remarked that the punt was on the farther side of the stream whereas the evening before it had been on the nearer  dr may leant out over the windowsill still in the lingering hope of seeinghe knew not what but he only became oppressed by the bright still summer beauty of the trees and grass and sparkling water insensible of the horror that brooded over all  he drew back his head and as the door hard by was opened leonards little dog sprang from her basket kennel wagging her tail in hopes of her master but in her disappointment greeting one whom dogs always hailed as a friend  poor little doggie good little mab  if only you could tell us and the creature fondly responded to his gentle hand though keeping aloof from henry in mindfulness of past passages between them while henry could evidently not bear to look at her  they gazed round the room but it conveyed no elucidation of the mystery  there were leonards books in their range on the drawers his fossils in his cupboard his mothers photograph on his mantelpiece his sisters drawings on the wall  his gray uniform lay on the bed as if recently taken off his ordinary office coat was folded on a chair and he seemed to have dressed and gone in his best clothes  while anxiously seeking some note of explanation they heard a step and sam axworthy entered speaking fast and low in apology for not having sooner appeared but he had been thoroughly upset as indeed he looked his whole appearance betraying the disorder of the evenings dissipation followed by the mornings shock  most unfortunate he said that he had not returned earlier  his friend blacktom black of edsall greenhad driven him home in his dogcart set him down at the turn to cross the fieldsmoon as light as dayno notion of the lateness till he got in sight of the great clock and saw it was halfpast twelve so knowing the early habits of the place he had thought it best to turn back and get a bed at the three goblets  if he had only come home he might have prevented mischief  there ensued a few commonplace words on the old mans infirm state yet his independent habits and reluctance to let any servant assist him or even sleep near him  sam spoke as if in a dream and was evidently so unwell that dr may thought it charitable to follow the dictates of his own disgust at breaking bread in that house of horrors and refuse offers of breakfast  he said he must go home but would return for the inquest and asked whether henry would remain to meet his brother  no no thank you said henry huskily as with the driest of throats and a perceptible shudder he turned to go away the doctor pausing to caress little mab and say i had better take home this poor little thing  she may come to harm here and may be a comfort to the sister  no objection came from sam but mab herself ran back to her house and even snarled at the attempt to detach her from it  you are a faithful little beast he said and your master will soon be here to set all straight so i will leave you for the present and therewith he signed farewell and breathed more freely as he gained the outer air  ill tell you what henry he said as they drove out of the courtyard well bring out bramshaw to watch the case  he will see through this horrible mystery and throw the suspicion in the right quarter whatever that may be depend upon it  henry had thrown himself back in the carriage with averted face and only answered by a groan  come dont be so downcast said dr may it is a frightful affair no doubt and leonard has chosen a most unlucky moment for this escapade but he will have a thorough warning against frolics  frolics indeed said henry bitterly  well ill be bound thats all he has attempted and it has got him into a horrid scrape and ten to one but the police have got the real ruffians in their hands by this time  i have no hope said henry  more shame for you not to feel a certain confidence that he who sees all will show the right  if said henry breaking off with a sound and look of such intense misery as almost to stagger the doctor himself by reminding him of leonards violent temper and the cause henry had to remember his promptness of hand but that ethels pupil aubreys friend the boy of ingenuous face could under any provocation strike helpless old age or having struck could abscond without calling aid actuated by terror not by pity or repentance was more than dr may could believe and after brief musing he broke out in indignant refutation  i should have thought so  i wish i still could believe so sighed henry but and there they lapsed into silence till as they came near the town dr may offered to set him down at bankside  no no thank you he cried in entreaty  i cannot see herave  then come home with me  you shall see no one and you will look up when you are not faint and fasting  you young men dont stand up against these things like us old stagers  as the carriage stopped several anxious faces were seen on the watch but the doctor signed them back till he had deposited henry in his study and then came among them  gertrude was the first to speak  o papa papa what is it  mrs pugh has been here to ask and ethel wont let me hear though tom and aubrey know  i took refuge in your order to believe nothing till you came said ethel with hands tightly clasped together  it is true then asked tom  true that it looks as bad as bad can be said the doctor sighing heavily and proceeding to state the aspect of the case  it is a tricka plot cried aubrey passionately i know it is he always said he would run away if they tried to teach him dishonesty and now they have done this and driven him away and laid the blame on him  ethel why dont you say you are sure of it  leonard would be changed indeed if this were so said ethel trembling as she stood and hardly able to speak articulately  aubrey broke out with a furious if very different from henry wards  it would not be the leonard we knew at coombe said ethel  he might be blind with rage but he would never be cowardly  no unless he own it nothing shall ever make me believe it  own it  for shame ethel cried aubrey and even the doctor exclaimed you are as bad as poor henry himself who has not got soul enough to be capable of trusting his brother  i do trust said ethel looking up  i shall trust his own word and she sat down without speaking and knitted fast but her needles clattered  and how about that poor girl at bankside said the doctor  i went down there said tom just to caution the servants against bringing in stories  she found out i was there and i had to go in and make the best of it  and what sort of a best said the doctor  why she knew he used to get out in the morning to bathe and was persuaded he had been drowned so i told her i knew he was alive and well and she would hear all about it when you came back  i brought the youngest child away with me and gertrude has got her upstairs the other would not come  poor thing  mary says she is very good and patient and i must say she was wonderfully reasonable when i talked to her  thank you tom said his father with warmth it was very kind of you  i wonder if ave knew anything of this runaway business it might be the saving of him  i did said aubrey eagerly at least i know he said he would not stay if they wanted to put him up to their dishonest tricks and he talked of that very window  yes you imprudent fellow and you were telling mrs pugh so if i hadnt stopped you said tom  youll be taken up for an accomplice next if you dont hold your tongue  what did he say asked the doctor impatiently and then declared that he must instantly go to bankside as soon as both he and henry had taken some food for he added we are both too much shaken to deal rationally with her  ethel started up in shame and dismay at having neglected to order anything  the doctor was served in the study alone with henry and after the briefest meal was on his way to bankside  he found averil with the crimson cheek and beseeching eye that he knew so well as she laid her trembling hand on his and mutely looked up like a dumb creature awaiting a blow  yes my dear he said tenderly your brother needs prayer such as when we watched him last year he is in peril of grave suspicion and as she stood waiting and watching for further explanation he continued my dear he told you everything  you do not know of any notion of his of going away or going out without leave  why is leonard to be always suspected of such things cried averil he never did them  do you know persisted dr may  but you are mayor cried averil indignantly withdrawing her hand you want me to accuse him  my dear if i were ten times mayor it would make no difference  my jurisdiction does not even cross the river here and if it did this is a graver case than i deal with  i am come as his friend to beg you to help me to account for his unhappy absence in any harmless way were it ever so foolish or wrong it would be the best news that ever i heard  butbut i cant said averil  i never knew he was going out i know he used to get out at the passage window to bathe and fish before the house was astirandyou know he is safe dr may  dr may would almost sooner have known that he was at the bottom of the deepest pool in the river than where he was  he is safe my poor child  he is well and i trust he will be able to prove his innocence but he must so account for his absence as to clear himself  averil there is a charge against himof being concerned in your uncles death  averils eyes dilated and she breathed short and fast standing like a statue  little minna whom the doctor had scarcely perceived standing in a dark corner sprang forward exclaiming o ave dont be afraid nobody can hurt him for what he did not do  the words roused averil and starting forward she cried dr may dr may you will save him  he is fatherless and motherless and his brother has always been harsh to him but you will not forsake him you said you would be a father to us  oh save leonard  my dear as i would try to save my own son i will do my utmost for him but little or nothing depends on me or on any man  by truth and justice he must stand or fall and you must depend on the father of the fatherless who seeth the truth as this dear child tells you with his hand on minnas head he cannot be really injured while he is innocent  awed into calm averil let him seat her beside him and put her in possession of the main facts of the case minna standing by him her hand in his evidently understanding and feeling all that passed  neither could throw light on anything  leonard had been less communicative to them than to aubrey and had kept his resolution of uncomplainingly drinking the brewst he had brewed for himself  all averil could tell was that her uncle had once spoken to henry in commendation of his steadiness and trustworthiness though at the same time abusing him for airs and puppyism  henry would tell you  where is henry she added  in my study  he could not bear to bring you these tidings  you must be ready to comfort him ave  dont let him come she cried  he never was kind to leonard  he drove him there  i shall always feel that it was his doing  averil said dr may gravely do you forget how much that increases his suffering  nothing but mutual charity can help you through this fiery trial  do not let anger and recrimination take from you the last shreds of comfort and poison your prayers promise me to be kind to henry for indeed he needs it  o dr may said minna looking up with her eyes full of tears indeed i will  i was cross to henry because he was cross to leonard but i wont be so any more  ave drooped her head as if it were almost impossible to her to speak  dr may patted minnas dark head caressingly and said to the elder sister i will not urge you more  perhaps you may have leonard back and then joy will open your hearts or if not my poor ave the sight of henry will do more than my words  mary looked greatly grieved but said nothing only following her father to take his last words and directions  keep her as quiet as you can  do not worry her but get out this root of bitterness if you can  poor poor things  that little minna is a dear child said mary  she is grown so much older than ella or than she was last year  she seems to understand and feel like a grownup person  i do think she may soften poor ave more than i can but papa there is excuse  mr ward must have made them more miserable than we guessed  the more reason she must forgive him  o mary i fear a grievous lesson is coming to them but i must do all i can  goodbye my dear do the best you can for them and he set forth again with a bleeding heart  at the attorneys office he found the principal from home but the partner edward anderson on the qui vive for a summons to attend on behalf of his fellowtownsman and confident that however bad were the present aspect of affairs his professional eye would instantly find a clue  aubrey was in an agony of excitement but unable to endure the notion of approaching the scene of action and his halfchoked surly dont was sufficient to deter his brother thomas who had never shown himself so kind considerate and free from sneer or assumption  in hours of ease he might seem selfish and exacting but a crisis evoked the latent good in him and drew him out of himself  nor would henry return to bankside  after many vacillations the moment for starting found him in a fit of despair about the family disgrace only able to beg that the unhappy boy should be assured that no expense should be spared in his defence or else that if he were cleared and returned home his welcome should be most joyful but there henry broke off groaned said they should never look up again and must leave the place  except for averils own sake dr may would almost have regretted his exhortations in favour of her eldest brother  in due time the doctor arrived at the mill where the inquest was to take place as the publichouse was small and inconveniently distant and there was ample accommodation in the large rambling building  so crowded was the courtyard that the doctor did not easily make his way to the steps of the hall door but there after one brief question to the policeman in charge he waited though several times invited in  before long all eyes turned one way as a closed fly with a policeman on the box drove in at the gateway stopped and between the two men on guard appeared a tall young figure  the doctors first glance showed him a flushed and weary set of features shocked and appalled but the eyes looking straight up in their anxiety encountered his with an earnest grateful appeal for sympathy answered at once by a step forward with outstretched hand the grip of the fingers was heated agitated convulsive but not tremulous and there was feeling not fear in the low husky voice that said thank you is henry here  no he is tootoo much overcome but he hopes to see you at home tonight and here is edward anderson whom he has sent to watch the proceedings for you  thank you said leonard acknowledging edwards greeting  as far as i am concerned i can explain all in a minute but my poor unclei little thought  there was no opportunity for further speech in private for the coroner had already arrived and the inquiry had been only deferred until leonard should have come  the jury had been viewing the body and the proceedings were to take place in the large low diningroom where the southern windows poured in a flood of light on the faces of the persons crowded together and the reflections from the rippling water danced on the ceiling  dr may had a chair given him near the coroner and keenly watched the two nephewsone seated next to him the other at some distance nearly opposite  both young men looked haggard shocked and oppressed the eye of axworthy was unceasingly fixed on an inkstand upon the table and never lifted his expression never varied and leonards glance flashed inquiringly from one speaker to another and his countenance altered with every phase of the evidence  the first witness was anne ellis the young maidservant who told of her coming down at ten minutes after five that morning the 6th of july and on going in to clean the rooms finding her master sunk forward on the table  supposing him to have had a fit she had run to the window and screamed for help when master hardy the foreman and mrs giles the housekeeper had come in  james hardy deposed to having heard the girls cry while he was unlocking the mill door  coming in by the low sashwindow which stood open he had gone up to his master and had seen the wound on the head and found the body quite cold mrs giles coming in they had carried it to the bed in the next room and he had gone to call the young gentlemen but neither was in his room  he knew that it had been left uncertain whether mr samuel would return to sleep at home between the two days of the county races but he did not expect mr ward to be out and had then observed that his bed had not been slept in and that the passage window outside his room was partly open  he had then thought it best to go into stoneborough to inform the family  rebecca giles the housekeeper an elderly woman crying violently repeated the evidence as to the discovery of the body  the last time she had seen her master alive was when she had carried in his supper at nine oclock when he had desired her to send mr ward to him and had seemed much vexed to hear that the young man had not returned from rifle practice little thinking poor old gentlemanbut here the housekeeper was recalled to her subject  the window was then open as it was a sultry night but the blind down  her master was a good deal crippled by gout and could not at that time move actively nor write but could dress himself and close a window  he disliked being assisted and the servants were not in the habit of seeing him from the time his supper was brought in till breakfast next morning she had seen mr ward come home at twenty minutes or half after nine in uniform carrying his rifle she had given the message and he had gone into the sittingroom without putting down the rifle  she believed it to be the one on the table but could not say so on oath he never let any one touch it and she never looked at such horrid murderous things and some remarks highly adverse to the volunteer movement were cut short  william andrews groom had been called by anne ellis had seen the wound and the blood on the desk and had gone to fetch a surgeon and the police from whitford  on his return saw the rifle leaning against the shutter believed it to be mr wards rifle  charles rankin surgeon had been called in to see mr axworthy and arrived at seven oclock a m  found him dead from a fracture of the skull over the left temple he should imagine from a blow from a heavy blunt instrument such as the stock of a gun  death must have been instantaneous and had probably taken place seven or eight hours before he was called in  the marks upon the rifle before him were probably blood but he could not say so upon oath till he had subjected them to microscopic examination  the hair was human and corresponded with that of the deceased  samuel axworthy had slept at the three goblets in consequence of finding himself too late for admission at home  he had been wakened at halfpast five and found all as had been stated by the previous witnesses and he corroborated the housekeepers account of his uncles habits  the rifle he believed to belong to his cousin leonard ward he could not account for leonard wards absence on that morning  no permission as far as he was aware had been given him to leave home and he had never known his uncle give him any commission at that hour  the different policemen gave their narrations of the state of thingsthe open window the position of the boat c  and the ticketclerk at the small blewer station stated that at about 1215 at night mr ward had walked in without baggage and asked for a secondclass ticket to london  leonard here interposed an inquiry whether he had not said a day ticket and the clerk recollected that he had done so and had spoken of returning by four oclock but the train being reckoned as belonging to the previous day no return tickets were issued for it and he had therefore taken an ordinary one and started by the mail train  the london policeman who had come down with leonard stated that in consequence of a telegraphic message he had been at the paddington station at 630 that morning had seen a young gentleman answering to the description sent to him asked if his name were leonard ward and receiving a reply in the affirmative had informed him of the charge and taken him into custody  the bag that he placed on the table he had found on the young mans person  every one was startled at this unexpected corroboration of the suspicion  it was a heavylooking bag of reddish canvas marked with a black circle containing the letters f a gold the neck tied with a string the contents were sovereigns and a note or two  dr may looked piteously despairingly at leonard but the brow was still open and unclouded the eye glanced back reassurance and confidence  the policeman added that he had cautioned the young man to take care what he said but that he had declared at once that his uncle had sent him to lodge the sum in drummonds bank and that he would show a receipt for it on his return  the coroner then proceeded to examine leonard but still as a witness edward anderson spoke to him in an undertone advising him to be cautious and not commit himself but leonard rather impatiently thanking him shook him off and spoke with freedom and openness  i have nothing to keep back he said  of course i know nothing of this frightful murder nor what villain could have got hold of the rifle which i am sorry to say is really mine  last evening i used it at drill and practice on blewer heath and came home when it grew dusk getting in at about halfpast nine  i was then told by mrs giles that my uncle wished to speak to me and was displeased at my staying out so late  i went into his room as i was and put my rifle down in a corner by the window when he desired me to sit down and listen to him  he then told me that he wished to send me to town by the mail train to take some cash to drummonds bank and to return by todays four oclock train  he said he had reasons for wishing no one to be aware of his opening an account there and he undertook to explain my absence  he took the sum from the private drawer of his desk and made me count it before him £124 12s in sovereigns and banknotes  the odd money he gave me for my expenses the rest i put in the bag that i fetched out of the office  he could not hold a pen and could therefore give me no letter to messrs drummond but he made me write a receipt for the amount in his memorandum book  i wished him good night and left him still sitting in his easychair with the window open and the blind down i found that i had forgotten my rifle but i did not go back for it because he disliked the disturbance of opening and shutting doors  while i was changing my dress i saw from the window that some one was still about in the court and knowing that my uncle wished me to avoid notice i thought it best to let myself out by the passage window as i had sometimes done in early mornings to bathe or fish and go across the fields to blewer station  i got down into the garden crossed in the punt and went slowly by barnards hatch i believe i stopped a good many times as it was too soon and a beautiful moonlight night but i came to blewer soon after twelve and took my ticket  at paddington i met this terrible news  as the boy spoke his bright eyes turned from one listener to another as though expecting to read satisfaction on their faces but as doubt and disbelief clouded all his looks became almost constantly directed to dr may and his voice unconsciously passed from a sound of justification to one of pleading  when he ceased he glanced round as if feeling his innocence established  you gave a receipt mr ward said the coroner  will you tell us where it is likely to be  it must be either on or in my uncles desk or in his pocket  will some one look for it  i wrote it in his memorandum booka curious old black shagreen book with a silver clasp  i left it open on the desk to dry  a policeman went to search for it and the coroner asked what the entry had been  july 5th 1860  received £120  l a wardwas the answer you will find it about the middle of the book or rather past it  at what time did this take place  it must have been towards ten  i cannot tell exactly but it was later than halfpast nine when i came in and he was a good while bringing out the money  the policeman returned saying he could not find the book and leonard begging to show where he had left it the coroner and jury accompanied him to the room  at the sight of the red stain on the desk a shuddering came over the boy and a whiteness on his heated brow nor could he at once recover himself so as to proceed with the search which was still in vain though with a voice lowered by the sickness of horror he pointed out the place where he had laid it and the pen he had used and desk table drawer and the dead mans dress were carefully examined  you must know it sam said leonard  dont you remember his putting in the chequeold bilsons cheque for his years renttwentyfive pounds  i brought it in and he put it away one day last week  you were sitting there  sam stammered something of yes he did recollect something of it  inquiries were made of the other persons concerned with mr axworthy hardy thought his master used such a book but had never seen it near mrs giles altogether disbelieved its existence and sam could not be positivehis uncle never allowed any one to touch his private memorandums  as with deepened anxiety dr may returned to the diningroom he caught a glimpse of henry wards desponding face but received a sign not to disclose his presence  edward anderson wrote and considered and the coroner looking at his notes again recurred to leonards statement that he had seen some one in the yard  i thought it was one of the men waiting to take my cousin axworthys horse  i did not know whether he had ridden or gone by train and i supposed that some one would be looking out for him  questions were asked whether any of the servants had been in the yard but it was denied by all and on a more particular description of the person being demanded leonard replied that the figure had been in the dark shade of the stables and that he only knew that it was a young manwhether a stranger or not he did not know he supposed now that it must have been thethe murderer but at the time he had thought it one of the stablemen and as his uncle had particularly wished that his journey should be a secret the sight had only made him hasten to put out his light and depart unseen  it was most unfortunate that he had done so  others ironically whispered most unfortunate  the coroner asked mr anderson whether he had anything to ask or observe and on his reply in the negative proceeded to sum up the evidence for the consideration of the jury  it seemed as if it were only here that leonard perceived the real gist of the evidence  his brow grew hotter his eyes indignant his hands clenched as if he with difficulty restrained himself from breaking in on the coroners speech and when at length the question was put to the jury he stood the colour fading from his cheek his eyes set and glassy his lip fallen the dew breaking out on his brow every limb as it were petrified by the shock of what was thus first fully revealed to him  so he stood while the jury deliberated in low gruff sorrowful murmurs and after a few minutes turned round to announce with much sadness that they could do no otherwise than return a verdict of wilful murder against leonard ward  mr leonard ward said the coroner a gentleman who had well known his father and who spoke with scarcely concealed emotion it becomes my painful duty to commit you to whitford gaol for trial at the next assizes  dr may eagerly offered bail rather as the readiest form of kindness than in the hope of its acceptance and it was of course refused but he made his way to the prisoner and wrung his chill hand with all his might  the pressure seemed to waken the poor lad from his frozen rigidity the warmth came flowing back into his fingers as his friend held them he raised his head shut and reopened his eyes and pushed back his hair as though trying to shake himself loose from a too horrible dream  his face softened and quivered as he met the doctors kind eyes but bracing himself again he looked up answered the coroners questionthat his christian name was leonard axworthy his age within a few weeks of eighteen and asked permission to fetch what he should want from his room  the policeman in whose charge he was consented both to this and to dr may being there alone with him for a short time  then it was that the boy relaxed the strain on his features and said in a low and strangled voice o dr may if you had only let me die with them last year  it was not i who saved you  he who sent that ordeal will bring you throughthis said dr may with a great sob in his throat that belied his words of cheer  i thank him at least for having taken her said leonard resting his head on the mantelshelf beneath his mothers picture while his little dog sat at his foot looking up at him cowed and wistful  dr may strove for words of comfort but broke utterly down and could only cover his face with his hands and struggle with his emotion unable to utter a word  yet perhaps none would have been so comforting as his genuine sympathy although it was in a voice of extreme distress that leonard exclaimed dr may dr may pray dont you ought not to grieve for me  im a fool said dr may after some space fighting hard with himself  nonsense we shall see you out of this  we have only to keep up a good heart and we shall see it explained  i dont know i cant understand said leonard passing his hand over his weary forehead  why could they not believe when i told them just how it was  at that moment the policeman opened the door saying here sir and henry hurried in pale and breathless not looking in his brothers face as he spoke fast and low  ned anderson says theres nothing at all to be made of this defence of yours it is of no use to try it  the only thing is to own that he found fault with you and in one of your ragesyou know  you too henry said leonard in dejected reproach  whywhy it is impossible it could have been otherwiseopen window absconding and all  we all know you never meant it but your story wont stand and the only chance anderson says is to go in for manslaughter  if you could only tell anything that would give him a clue to pick up evidence while the people are on the spot  leonards face was convulsed for a moment while his brother was speaking but he recovered calmness of voice as he mournfully answered i have no right to wonder at your suspicion of me  henry for the first time really looked at him and instinctively faltered i beg your pardon  indeed said leonard with the same subdued manner i cannot believe that any provocation could make me strike a person like that old man and here there was none at all  except that he was vexed at first at my being late he had never been so near kindness  then is this extraordinary story the truth  why should i not tell the truth was the answer too mournful for indignation  henry again cast down his eyes leonard moved about making preparations dr may leant against the wallall too much oppressed for speech till as leonard stooped poor little mab thrusting her black head into his hand drew from him the words my doggie what is to become of you  a sort of hoarse explosion of ave from henry was simultaneous with the doctors i tried to get her home with me in the morning but she waited your orders  miss may would not have her now  after all prussic acid would be the truest mercy said leonard holding the little creature up to his face and laying his cheek against her silken coat with almost passionate affection  not while there are those who trust your word leonard as ethel said this morning  he raised the face which he had hidden against the dog and looked earnestly at the doctor as if hardly venturing to understand him then a ray of real gladness and comfort darted into his eyes which so enlivened dr may that he was able to say cheerfully we will take good care of her till you come for her  then henry said leonard it is not unkindness nor that i remember things but indeed i think it will be better for you all since dr may is soso the word kind was so inadequate that it stuck in his throat  take this to ave putting his mothers likeness in his hand and tell her i will write  poor ave  leonard imploringly shook his head the mention of his sister shook him more than he could bear and he asked the time  nearly six  only six  what an endless day  there i am ready  there is no use in delaying  i suppose i must show what i am taking with me  wait said his brother  cannot you say anything to put us on the track of the man in the yard  i did not see him plain  youve no notion said henry with a movement of annoyance  no  i only looked for a moment for i was much more anxious to get off quietly than to make any one out  if i had only waited ten minutes it might have been the saving of his life but my commission was so like fun and so important too that i thought of nothing else can it be not twentyfour hours ago  and why dont you explain why he sent you  i cannot say it so certainly as to be of the slightest use said leonard  he never expressed it either and i have no right to talk of my suspicions  eh was it to put it out of sams way  so i suppose  sam used to get all he chose out of the poor old man and i believe he thought this the only chance of keeping anything for himself but he never told me so  stay  bilsons cheque might be tracked  i took it myself and gave the receipt you will find it entered in the bookspaid on either the twentythird or fourth  then theres something to do at any rate cried henry invigorated anderson shall hunt out the balance and sams draughts on it  ill spare no expense leonard if it is to my last farthing and you shall have the best counsel that can be retained  leonard signed thanks with some heartiness and was going to the door when henry detained him  tell me leonard have you no suspicion  it must have been the person i saw in the court and like a fool did not watch  the window was open and he could have easily got in and come out  cant they see that if it had been me i should have made off at once that way  if you could only tell what the fellow was like  i told you he was in the dark said leonard and without giving time for more he called in the man outside showed the clothes and books he had selected put them into his bag and declared himself ready giving his hand to the doctor who drew him near and kissed his brow as if he had been harry setting forth on a voyage  goodbye my dear fellow god bless you ill soon come to see you  and i said henry will bring bramshaw to see what is to be done  leonard wrung his brothers hand murmuring something of love to his sisters then put mab into dr mays arms with injunctions that the little creature understood and obeyed for though trembling and whining under her breath she was not resisting  it might be to shorten her distress as well as his own that leonard passed quickly downstairs and entered the carriage that was to take him to the county gaol     chapter xiii    tears are not always fruitful their hot drops     sometimes but scorch the cheek and dim the eye   despairing murmurs over blackened hopes     not the meek spirits calm and chastened cry   oh better not to weep than weep amiss     for hard it is to learn to weep aright   to weep wise tears the tears that heal and bless     the tears which their own bitterness requiteh bonar   to one of the most tenderhearted of human beings had the office of conveying ill tidings been most often committed and again dr may found himself compelled to precede henry ward into the sisters presence and to break to her the result of the inquest  he was no believer in the efficacy of broken news but he could not refuse when henry in his wretchedness entreated not to be the first in the infliction of such agony so he left the carriage outside and walked up to the door and there stood averil with ethel a few steps behind her  his presence was enough revelation  had things gone well he would not have been the forerunner and averil meaning perhaps to speak gave a hoarse hysterical shriek so frightful as to drive away other anxieties and summon henry in from his watch outside  all day the poor girl had kept up an unnatural strain on her powers vehemently talking of other things and with burning cheeks and shining eyes moving incessantly from one employment to another now her needle now her pencilroaming round the garden gathering flowers or playing rattling polkas that half stunned ethel in her intense listening for tidings  ethel who had relieved guard and sent mary home in the afternoon had vainly striven to make ave rest or take food the attempt had brought on such choking that she could only desist and wait for the crisis  the attack was worse than any ordinary hysterics almost amounting to convulsions and all that could be done was to prevent her from hurting herself and try to believe dr mays assurance that there was no real cause for alarm and that the paroxysms would exhaust themselves  in time they were spent and ave lay on her bed half torpid feebly moaning but with an instinctive dread of being disturbed  henry anxiously watched over her and dr may thought it best to leave the brother and sister to one another  absolute quiet was best for her and he had skill and tenderness enough to deal with her and was evidently somewhat relieved by the necessity of waiting on her  it was the best means perhaps of uniting them that they should be thus left together and dr may would have taken home little pale frightened minna who had been very helpful all the time  oh please not dr may she said earnestly  indeed i will not be troublesome and i can give henry his tea and carry aves cup please henry dont send me and she took hold of his hand and laid it against her cheek  he bent down over her and fondled her and there were tears that he could not hide as he tried both to thank dr may and tell her that she need not leave him  no said dr may it would be cruel to both of yougoodbye little minna i never wanted to carry away a little comforter  i believe you are right papa said ethel as she went out with him to the carriage but i long to stay it is like doing something for that boy  the best you did for him poor dear boy was the saying you trusted his word  the moment i told him that he took comfort and energy  ethels lips moved into a strange half smile and she took mab on her lap and fondled her  yes she said i believe i stand for a good deal in his imagination  i was afraid he would have been wrecked upon that horrid place but after all this may be the saving of him  ah if that story of his would only be more vraisemblable  there was only time briefly to narrate it before coming home where the first person they met was aubrey exceeding pale and in great distress  papa i must tell you he said drawing him into the study  i have done terrible harm i am afraid  and he explained that in the morning when mrs pugh had come down full of inquiries and conjectures and had spoken of the possibility of leonards having been drowned while bathing he had unguardedly answered that it could be no such thing leonard had always meant to run away and by that very window if the axworthys grew too bad  prudent tom had silenced him at the time but had since found that it had got abroad that the evasion had long been meditated with aubreys privity and had been asked by one of the constabulary force if his brother would not be an important witness  tom had replied that he knew nothing about it but aubrey was in great misery furious with mrs pugh and only wanting his father to set off at once to assure them it was all nonsense  no aubrey they neither would nor ought to take my word  just hear papa and you would know the chaff it was  i cannot hear aubrey  if we were to discuss it we might give it an unconscious colouring  you must calm your mind and exactly recall what passed but do not talk about it to me or to any one else  you must do nothing to impair the power of perfect truth and accuracy which is a thing to be prayed for  if any oneeven the lawyer who may have to get up the case against himasks you about it you must refuse to answer till the trial and thenwhy the issue is in the hands of him that judgeth righteously  i shall never remember nor speak with his eyes on me seeing me betray him  you will be no worse off than i my boy for i see i am in for identifying hectors rifle the mill people cant swear to it and my doing it will save his brother something  no it is not like me  o i wish i had stayed at eton even if i had died of it  tom says it all comes of living with women that i cant keep my mouth shut and leonard will be so hurt that i  nay any tolerable counsel will make a capital defence out of the mere fact of his rodomontading  what is that no comfort to you  what to be the means of making a fool of him before all the courtseeing him hear our talk by the riverside sifted by those horrid lawyers  the doctor looked even graver and his eye fixed as on a thought far away as the boys grief brought to his mind the great assize when all that is spoken in the ear shall indeed be proclaimed on the housetops  there was something almost childish in this despair of aubrey for he had not become alarmed for the result of the trial  his misery was chiefly shame at his supposed treason to friendship and failure in manly reserve and he could not hold up his head all the evening but silently devoted himself to mab endeavouring to make her at home and meeting with tolerable success  tom was no less devoted to ella ward  it was he who had brought her home and he considered her therefore as his charge  it was curious to see the difference that a year had made between her and minna they had the last summer been like one child and had taken the stroke that had orphaned them in the same childish manner but whether the year from eight to nine had been of especial growth to minna or whether there had been a stimulus in her constant association with averil the present sorrow fell on her as on one able to enter into it think and feel and assume her sweet mission of comfort whilst ella though neither hard nor insensible was still child enough to close her mind to what she dreaded and flee willingly from the pain and tedium of affliction  she had willingly accepted mr toms invitation and as willingly responded to his attentions  gertrude did not like people in the little girl stage and the elder sisters had their hands and hearts full and could only care for her in essentials but tom undertook her amusement treated her to an exhibition of his microscope and played at french billiards with her the rest of the evening till she was carried off to bed in marys room when he pronounced her a very intelligent child  i think her a very unfeeling little thing said gertrude  very unbecoming behaviour under the circumstances  what would you think becoming behaviour asked tom  i wont encourage it returned daisy with dignified decision that gave her father his first approach to a laugh on that day but nobody was in spirits to desire miss daisy to define from what her important sanction was withdrawn  mary gave up her sundayschool class to see how averil was and found henry much perturbed  he had seen her fast asleep at night and in the morning minna had carried up her breakfast and he was about to follow it as soon as his own was finished when he found that she had slipped out of the house leaving a message that she was gone to practise on the harmonium  he was of the mind that none of the family could or ought to be seen at church and though mary could not agree with him she willingly consented to go to the chapel and try what she could do with his sister  she met mrs ledwich on the way coming to inquire and see whether she or dear matilda could do anything for the sweet sufferer even mary could not help thinking that this was not the epithet most befitting poor ave and perhaps mrs ledwichs companionship made her the less regret that ave had locked herself in so that there was no making her hear though the solemn chants played with great fervour reached them as they waited in the porch they had their own seats in the minster and therefore could not wait till the sexton should come to open the church  there was no time for another visit till after the second service and then dr may and mary going to bankside found that instead of returning home ave had again locked herself up between the services and that minna who had ventured on a mission of recall had come home crying heartily both at the dreary disappointment of knocking in vain and at the grand mournful sounds of funeral marches that had fallen on her ear  every one who had been at the chapel that day was speaking of the wonderful music the force and the melody of the voluntary at the dismissal of the congregation no one had believed that such power resided in the harmonium  mr scudamour had spoken to miss ward most kindly both before and after evening service but his attempt to take her home had been unavailing she had answered that she was going presently and he was obliged to leave her  evening was coming on and she had not come so the other keys were fetched from the sextons and dr may and his daughter set off to storm her fortress  like minna the doctor was almost overpowered by the wonderful plaintive sweetness of the notes that were floating through the atmosphere like a wailing voice of supplication  they had almost unnerved him as he waited while mary unlocked the door  the sound of its opening hushed the music averil turned her head and recognizing them came to them very pale and with sunken eyes you are coming home dear ave said mary and she made no resistance or objection only saying yes  it has been so nice here  you must come now though said the doctor  your brother is very much grieved at your leaving him  i did not mean to be unkind to him said averil in a low subdued voice he was very good to me last night  onlythis is peacethis pointing to her instrument is such a soothing friend  and surely this is the place to wait in  the place to wait in indeed my poor child if you are not increasing the distress of others by staying here  besides you must not exhaust yourself or how are you to go and cheer leonard  oh there is no fear but that i shall go tomorrow said averil i mean to do it the last words being spoken in a resolute tone unlike the weariness of her former replies  and with this purpose before her she consented to be taken back by mary to rest on the sofa and even to try to eat and drink  her brother and sister hung over her and waited on her with a tender assiduous attention that showed how they had missed her all day and she received their kindness gratefully as far as her broken wearied state permitted  several inquiries had come throughout the day from the neighbours and while mary was still with ave a message was brought in to ask whether miss ward would like to see mrs pugh  oh no no thank her but indeed i cannot said averil shivering uncontrollably as she lay  mary felt herself blushing in the wonder what would be kindest to do and her dread of seeing henrys face  she was sure that he too shrank and she ventured to ask shall i go and speak to her  oh do do said averil shuddering with eagerness  thank you miss mary said henry slowly  she is most kindbutunder the circumstances  mary went finding that he only hesitated  she had little opportunity for saying anything mrs pugh was full of interest and eagerness and poured out her sympathy and perfect understanding of dear averils feelings and in the midst henry came out of the room with a stronger version of their gratitude but in terrible confusion  mary would fain have retreated but could not and was witness to the ladys urgent entreaties to take minna home and henrys thankfulness but he fearedand retreated to ask the opinion of his sisters while mrs pugh told mary that it was so very bad for the poor child to remain and begged to have ella if she were a moments inconvenience to the may family  henry came back with repeated thanks but minna could not bear to leave home and in fact he owned with a half smile that gave sweetness to his face she was too great a comfort to be parted with so mrs pugh departed with doubled and trebled offers of service and entreaties to be sent for at any hour of the day or night when she could be of use to averil  mary could not but be pleased with her officious as she was  it looked as if she had more genuine feeling for henry than had been suspected and the kindness was certain though some of it might be the busy activity of a not very delicate nature eager for the importance conferred by intimacy with the subjects of a great calamity  probably she would have been gratified by the eclat of being the beloved of the brother of the youth whose name was in every mouth and her real goodness and benevolent heart would have committed her affections and interest beyond recall to the ward family had averil leant upon her or had henry exerted himself to take advantage of her advances  but henrys attachment had probably not been love for it seemed utterly crushed out of him by his shame and despair  everything connected with his past life was hateful to him he declared that he could never show his face at stoneborough again let the result be what it mightthat he could never visit another patient and that he should change his name and leave the country beginning on that very sunday afternoon to write a letter to his principal rival to negotiate the sale of his practice  in fact his first impression had returned on him and though he never disclaimed belief in leonards statement the entire failure of all confirmation convinced him that the blow had been struck by his brother in sudden anger and that defend him as he might and would the stain was on his house and the guilt would be brought home  resolved however to do his utmost he went with mr bramshaw for a consultation with leonard on the monday  averil could not go  she rose and dressed and remained resolute till nearly the last minute when her feverish faint giddiness overpowered her and she was forced to submit to lie on the sofa under minnas care and there she lay restless and wretched till wise little minna sent a message up to the high street which brought down mary and dr spencer  they found her in a state of nervous fever that sentenced her to her bed where mary deposited her and watched over her till her brothers return more desponding than ever  dr may with all henrys patients on his hands as well as his own had been forced to devote this entire day to his profession but on the next leaving henry to watch over averil who continued very feeble and feverish he went to whitford almost infected by henrys forebodings and mr bramshaws misgivings  it is a bad case the attorney had said to him confidentially  but that there is always a great reluctance to convict upon circumstantial evidence i should have very little hope that story of his is so utterly impracticable and yet he looks so innocent and earnest all the time and sticks to it so consistently that i dont know what to make of it  i cant do anything with him nor can his brother either but perhaps you might make him understand that we could bring him clear off for manslaughteryouth and character and all  i should not doubt of a verdict for a moment  it is awkward about the money but the alarm would be considered in the sentence  you dont attend to his account of the person he saw in the courtyard  the less said about that the better returned mr bramshaw  it would only go for an awkward attempt to shift off the suspicion unless he would give any description and that he cant or wont do or even if he did the case would be all the stronger against his storysetting off and leaving a stranger to maraud about the place no dr may the only thing for it is to persuade the lad to own to having struck the old man in a passion every one knows old axworthy could be intolerably abusive and the boy always was passionate dont you remember his flying out at mr riverss the night of the party and that affair which was the means of his going to the mill at all  i dont mind saying so to you in confidence because i know you wont repeat it and i see his brother thinks so too but nothing is likely to turn out so well for him as that line of defence as things stand now the present one is good for nothing  dr may was almost as much grieved at the notion of the youths persistence in denying such a crime as at the danger in which it involved him and felt that if he were to be brought to confession it should be from repentance not expediency  in this mood he drove to whitford gaol made application at the gates and was conducted up the stairs to the cell  the three days of nearly entire solitude and of awful expectation had told like double the number of years and there was a stamp of grave earnest collectedness on the young brow and a calm resolution of aspect and movement free from all excitement or embarrassment as leonard ward stood up with a warm grateful greeting so full of ingenuous reliance that every doubt vanished at the same moment  his first question was for averil and dr may made the best of her state  she slept a little more last night and her pulse is lower this morning but we keep her in bed half to hinder her from trying to come here before she is fit  i believe this ailment is the best thing for her and henry both added the doctor seeing how much pain his words were giving  henry is a very good nurse it occupies him and it is good for her to feel his kindness  then minna has come out in the prettiest way she never fails in some sweet little tender word or caress just when it is wanted  leonard tried to smile but only succeeded in keeping back a sob and the doctor discharged his memory of the messages of love of which he had been the depositary  leonard recovered his composure during these and was able to return a smile on hearing of ellas conquest of tom of their bible prints on sunday and their unwearied french billiards in the week  then he asked after little mab  she is all a dog should be said dr may  aubrey is her chief friend except when she is lying at her ease on ethels dress  the old test of doglove perhaps occurred to leonard for his lips trembled and his eyes were dewy even while they beamed with gladness  she is a great comfort to aubrey the doctor added  i must beg you to send that poor fellow your forgiveness for he is exceedingly unhappy about something he repeated in the first unguarded moment  mr bramshaw told me said leonard with brow contracted  i cannot believe said dr may that it can do you any real harm i do not think the prosecution ought to take notice of it but if they do it will be easy to sift it and make it tell rather in your favour  maybe so said leonard still coldly  then you will cheer him with some kind message  to be sure  it is the time for me to be forgiving every one he answered with a long tightlydrawn breath  much distressed the doctor paused in uncertainty whether leonard were actuated by dread of the disclosure or resentment at the breach of confidence but ere he spoke the struggle had been fought out and a sweet sad face was turned round to him with the words poor old aubrey  tell him not to mind  there will be worse to be told out than our romancings together and he will feel it more than i shall  dont let him vex himself  thank you said the father warmly  i call that pardon  not that there is anything to forgive said leonard only it is odd that one cares for it more thanno no dont tell him that but that i know it does not signify  it must not come between us if this is to be the end and it will make no difference  nothing can do that but the finding my receipt  i see that book night and day before my eyes with the very blot that i made in the top of my l  you know they are searching the garden and fields and advertising a reward in case of its having been thrown away when rifled or found to contain no valuables  yes and he rested on the word as though much lay behind  do you think it contained anything worth keeping  only by one person  ha said the doctor with a start  instead of answering leonard leant down on the narrow bed on which he was seated and shut in his face between his hands  the doctor waited guessed and grew impatient  you dont mean that fellow sam  do you think he has it  i should like to throttle him as sure as my names dick may this in soliloquy between his teeth speak up leonard if you have any suspicion  the lad lifted himself with grave resolution that gave him dignity dr may he said i know that what i say is safe with you and it seems disrespectful to ask your word and honour beforehand but i think it will be better for us both if you will give them not to make use of what i tell you  it weighs on me so that i shall be saying it to the wrong person unless i have it out with you  you promise me  to make no use of it without your consent repeated the doctor with rising hope but this is no case for scruplestoo much is at stake  you need not tell me that leonard replied with a shudder but i have no proof  i have thought again and again and again but can find no possible witness  he was always cautious and drink made him savage but not noisy  then you believe  the silence told the rest  if i did not see how easy people find it to believe the same of me on the mere evidence of circumstances i should have no doubt said leonard deliberately  then it was he that you saw in the yard  remember all i saw was that a man was there  i concluded it was andrews waiting to take the horse and as he is a great hangeron of sam i wished to avoid him and not keep my candle alight to attract his attention  that was the whole reason of my getting out of window and starting so soon as unlucky a thing as i could have done  you are sure it was not andrews  now i am  you see sam had sent home his horse from the station though i did not know it and if you remember andrews was shown to have been at his fathers long before  if he had been the man he could speak to the time my light was put out  the putting out of your light must have been the signal for the deed to be done  my poor uncle  well might he stare round as if he thought the walls would betray him and start at every chinking of that unhappy gold in his helpless hands  if we had only known who was nearperhaps behind the blinds and leonard gasped  but this secrecy leonard i cannot understand it  do you mean that the poor old man durst not do what he would with his own  just so  whenever sam knew that he had a sum of money he laid hands on it  nothing was safe from him that mr axworthy had in the whitford bank  that can be proved from the accounts  you recollect the little parlour between the office and my uncles sittingroom  there i used to sit in the evening and to feel rather than hear the way sam used to bully the poor old man  oncea fortnight ago just after that talk with aubreyi knew he had been drinking and watched and came in upon them when there was no bearing it any longer  i was sworn at for my pains and almost kicked out again but after that mr axworthy made me sit in the room as if i were a protection and i made up my mind to bear it as long as he lived  surely the servants would bear witness to this state of things  i think not  their rooms are too far off for overhearing and my uncle saw as little of them as possible  mrs giles was sams nurse and cares for him more than any other creature she would not say a word against him even if she knew anything and my uncle would never have complained  he was fond of sam to the last proud of his steeplechases and his cleverness and desperately afraid of him in a sort of bondage entirely past daring to speak  i know said dr may remembering how his own tom had been fettered and tonguetied by that same tyrant in boyhood  but he spoke to you  no said leonard  after that scene much was implied between us but nothing mentioned  i cannot even tell whether he trusted me or only made me serve as a protector  i believe that row was about this money which he had got together in secret and that sam suspected and wanted to extort but it was exactly as i said at the inquest he gave no reason for sending me up to town with it  he knew that i knew why and so said no more than that it was to be private  it was pitiful to see that man so fierce and bold as they say he once was trembling as if doing something by stealth and the great hard knotty hands so crumpled and shaky that he had to leave all to me  and that they should fancy i could go and hurt him said leonard stretching his broad chest and shoulders in conscious strength  yes considering who it was i do not wonder that you feel the passiontheory as insulting as the accusation  i ought not said leonard reddening  every one knows what my temper can do  i do not think that a poor old feeble man like that could have provoked me to be so cowardly but i see it is no wonder they think so  only they might suppose i would not have been a robber and go on lying now when they take good care to tell me that it is ruinous  it is an intolerable shame that they can look you in the face and imagine it for a moment said the doctor with all his native warmth  after all said leonard recalled by his sympathy it is my own fault from beginning to end that i am in this case  i see now that it was only gods mercy that prevented my brothers blood being on me and it was my unrepenting obstinacy that brought me to the mill so there will be no real injustice in my dying and i expect nothing else  hush leonard depend upon it while there is justice in heaven the true criminal cannot go free cried the doctor much agitated  leonard shook his head  boyish hastiness is not murder added the doctor  so i thought  but it might have been and i never repented  i brought all this on myself and while i cannot feel guiltless in gods sight i cannot expect it to turn out well  turn out well repeated the doctor  we want ethel to tell us that this very repentance and owning of the sin is turning out wellbetter than going on in it  i can see that said leonard  i do hope that ifif i can take this patiently it may show i am sorry for the real thingand i may be forgiven  oh i am glad prisoners are not cut off from church  dr may pressed his hand in much emotion and there was a silence before another questionwhether there were nothing that could be of service  one chance there is that sam might relent enough to put that receipt where it could be found without implicating him  he must know what it would do for me  you are convinced that he has it  there must be papers in the book valuable to him perhaps some that he had rather were not seen  most likely he secured it in the morning you remember he was there before the police  ay ay ay the scoundrel  but leonard what possessed you not to speak out at the inquest when we might have searched every soul on the premises  i did not see it then  i was stunned by the horror of the thingthe room where i had been so lately and that blood on my own rifle too it was all i could do at one time not to faint and i had no notion they would not take my explanation then when i found it rejected and everything closing in on me i was in a complete maze it was not till yesterday when i was alone again after having gone over my defence with mr bramshaw and shown what i could prove that i saw exactly how it must have been as clear as a somnambulist  i sometimes could fancy i had seen sam listening at the window and have to struggle not to think i knew him under the stable wall  and you are not such asuch aso absurd as to sacrifice yourself to any scruple and let the earth be cumbered with a rascal who if he be withholding the receipt is committing a second murder  it is not generosity it is suicide  it is not generosity said the boy for if there were any hope that would not stop me but no one heard nor saw but myself and i neither recognized himno i did notnor heard anything definite from my uncle  even if i had no oneno one but you believes a word i speak nay even my own case shows what probabilities are worth and that i may be doing him the same wrong that i am suffering  i should only bring on myself the shame and disgrace of accusing another  the steady low voice and unboyish language showed him to be speaking from reflection not impulse  the only tremulous moment was when he spoke of the one friend who trusted him and whom his words were filling with a tumult of hope and alarm admiration indignation and perplexity  well well the doctor said almost stammering i am glad you have been open with me  it may be a clue  can there be any excuse for overhauling his papers  or cant we pick a hole in that alibi of his now i recollect he had it very pat and unnecessarily prominent  ill find some way of going to work without compromising you  yes you may trust me  ill watch but say not a word without your leave  thank you said leonard  i am glad it is youyou who would never think a vague hope of saving me better than disgrace and dishonour  we will save you said the doctor becoming eager to escape to that favourite counsellor the lining of his brougham which had inspired him with the right theory of many a perplexing symptom and he trusted would show him how to defend without betraying leonard  i must go and see about it  is there anything i can do for youbooks or anything  no thank youexcepti suppose there would be no objection to my having a few finer steel pens  and to explain his wants he took up his prayerbook which his sister had decorated with several small devotional prints  copying these minutely line by line in pen and ink was the solace of his prison hours and though the work was hardly after drawingmasters rules the hand was not untaught and there was talent and soul enough in the work to strike the doctor  it suits me best said leonard  i should go distracted with nothing to do and i cant read muchat least not common books and my sisters may like to have them  will you let me do one for you  the speaking expression of those hazel eyes almost overcame the doctor and his answer was by bending head and grasping hand leonard turned to the collects and mutely opened at the print of the son of consolation which he had already outlined looked up at his friend and turned away only saying two or three of the sort with elastic nibs they have them at the postoffice  yes ill take care said dr may afraid to trust his selfcommand any longer  goodbye leonard  tom says i adopt every one who gets through a bad enough fever so what will you be to me after this second attack  the result of the doctors consultation with his brougham was his stopping it at mr bramshaws door to ascertain whether the search for the receipt had extended to young axworthys papers but he found that they had been thoroughly examined every facility having been given by their owner who was his uncles executor and residuary legatee by a will dated five years back leaving a thousand pounds to the late mrs ward and a few other legacies but the mass of the property to the nephew  sams facilities not satisfying the doctor it was further explained that every endeavour was being made to discover what other documents were likely to have been kept in the missing memorandumbook so as to lead to the detection of any person who might present any such at a bank and it was made evident that everything was being done short of the impracticability of searching an unaccused man but he could not but perceive that mr bramshaws ifs indicated great doubt of the existence of receipt and of pocketbook  throwing out a hint that the time of sams return should be investigated he learnt that this had been edward andersons first measure and that it was clear from the independent testimony of the ostler at whitford the friend who had driven sam and the landlord of the three goblets that there was not more than time for the return exactly as described at the inquest and though the horse was swift and powerful and might probably have been driven at drunken speed this was too entirely conjectural for anything to be founded on it nor had the cheque by bilson on the whitford bank come in  something must assuredly happen to exonerate the guiltless it would be profane to doubt said dr may continually to himself and to the wards but leonards secret was a painful burthen that he could scarcely have borne without sharing it with that daughter who was his other self and well proved to be a safe repository  thats my leonard said ethel  i know him much better now than any time since the elfbolt affair  they have not managed to ruin him among them  what do you call this said dr may understanding her indeed but willing to hear her thought expressed  thankworthy she answered with a twitching of the corners of her mouth  you will suffer for this exaltation he said sadly you know you have a tender heart for all your flights  and you know you have a soul as well as a heart said ethel as well as the swelling in her throat would allow  to be sure this world would be a poor place to live in if admiration did not make pity bearable said the doctor butbut dont ask me ethel you have not had that fine fellow in his manly patience before your eyes  talk of your knowing him  you knew a boy  i tell you this has made him a man and one of a thousandso highminded and so simple so clearheaded and wellbalanced so entirely resigned and free from bitterness  what could he not be it would be grievous to see him cut off by a direct dispensationsickness accident battle but for him to come to such an end for the sake of a double murdererethelit would almost stagger ones faith  almost repeated ethel with the smile of a conqueror  i know i know said the doctor  if it be so it will be right one will try to believe it good for him  nay theres proof enough in what it has done for him already  if you could only see him  i mean to see him if it should go against him said ethel if you will let me  i would go to him as i would if he were in a decline and with more reverence  dont talk of it cried her father  for truths sake for justices sake for the countrys sake i can not will not believe it will go wrong  there is a providence after all ethel  and the doctor went away afraid alike of hope and despondency and ethel thought of the bright young face of de wilton of job and of the martyrs and when she was not encouraging aubrey or soothing averil her heart would sink and the tears that would not come would have been very comfortable  it was well for all that the assizes were so near that the suspense was not long protracted for it told upon all concerned  leonard when the doctor saw him again was of the same way of thinking but his manner was more agitated he could not sleep or if he slept the anticipations chased away in the daytime revenged themselves in his dreams and he was very unhappy also about his sister whose illness continued day after day  she was not acutely ill but in a constant state of low fever every faculty in the most painful state of tension convinced that she was quite able to get up and go to leonard and that her detention was mere cruelty and then on trying to rise refused by fainting  her searching questions and ardent eyes made it impossible to keep any feature in the case from her knowledge  sleep was impossible to her and once when henry tried the effect of an anodyne it produced a semidelirium which made him heartily repent of his independent measure  at all times she was talkingnothing but the being left with a very stolid maidservant ever closed her lips and she so greatly resented being thus treated that the measure was seldom possible  henry seldom left her  he was convinced that leonards sentence would be hers likewise and he watched over her with the utmost tenderness and patience with her fretfulness and waywardness never quitting her except on their brothers behalf when ethel or mary would take his place  little minna was always to be found on her small chair by the bedside or moving about like a mouse sometimes whispering her one note they cant hurt him if he has not done it and still quietly working at the pair of slippers that had been begun for his birthday present mary used to bring ella and take them out walking in the leastfrequented path but though the little sisters kissed eagerly and went fondly hand in hand they never were sorry to part  ellas spirits oppressed minna and minnas depression vexed the more volatile sister moreover minna always dreaded marys desire to carry her awayas poor child she looked paler and her eyes heavier and darker every day  no one else except of course dr may was admitted  henry would not let his sister see mr scudamour or mr wilmot lest she should be excited and averils no one was vehement as a defence against mrs pugh or mrs ledwich whom she suspected of wanting to see her though she never heard of more than their daily inquiries  mrs pugh was in spite of her exclusion the great authority with the neighbourhood for all the tidings of the poor wards of whom she talked with the warmest commiseration relating every touching detail of their previous and present history and continually enduring the great shock of meeting people in shops or in the streets whom she knew to be reporters or photographers  in fact the catastrophe had taken a strong hold on the public mind and murder of an uncle by his nephew the blewer tragedy figured everywhere in the largest type newsboys on the railway shouted todays paperaccount of inquest and the illustrated press sent down artists whose threelegged cameras stared in all directions from the vintry mill to bankside and who aimed at the school the minster the volunteers and dr hoxton himself  tom advised ethel to guard mab carefully from appearing stuffed in the chamber of horrors at madame tussauds and the furniture at the mill would have commanded any price  nay mrs pugh was almost certain she had seen one of the horrid men bargaining with the local photographer for her own portrait in her weeds and was resolved the interesting injury should never be forgiven  she really had the trying scenes of two interviews with both mr bramshaw and the attorney from whitford who was getting up the prosecution each having been told that she was in possession of important intelligence  mr bramshaw was not sanguine as to what he might obtain from her but flattered her with the attempt and ended by assuring her like his opponent that there was no need to expose her to the unpleasantness of appearing in court  aubrey was not to have the same relief but was like his father subpoenaed as a witness for the prosecution  he had followed his fathers advice and took care not to disclose his evidence to the enemy as he regarded the whitford lawyer  he was very miserable and it was as much for his sake as that of the immediate family that ethel rejoiced that the suspense was to be short  counsel of high reputation had been retained but as the day came nearer without bringing any of the disclosures on which the doctor had so securely reckoned more and more stress was laid on the dislike to convict on circumstantial evidence and on the saying that the english law had rather acquit ten criminals than condemn one innocent man     chapter xiv    ah i mind me now of thronging faces     mocking eyed and eager as for sport   hundreds looking up and in high places     men arrayed for judgment and a court    and i heard or seemed to hear one seeking     answer back from one he doomed to die   pitifully sadly sternly speaking     unto oneand oh that one twas irev g e monsell   the blewer murder was the case of the assize week and the court was so crowded that but for the favour of the sheriff mr and mrs rivers with tom and gertrude could hardly have obtained seats  no others of the family could endure to behold the scene except from necessity and indeed ethel and mary had taken charge of the sisters at home for henry could not remain at a distance from his brother though unable to bear the sight of the proceedings he remained in a house at hand  nearly the whole population of stoneborough whitford and blewer was striving to press into court but before the days work began edward anderson had piloted mrs pugh to a commodious place under the escort of his brother harvey who was collecting materials for an article on criminal jurisprudence  some of those who like the widow and little gertrude had been wild to be present felt their hearts fail them when the last previous case had been disposed of and there was a brief pause of grave and solemn suspense and silent breathless expectation within the court unbroken except by increased sounds of crowding in all the avenues without  every one except the mere loungers who craved nothing but excitement looked awed and anxious and the impression was deepened by the perception that the same feeling though restrained affected the judge himself and was visible in the anxious attention with which he looked at the papers before him and the stern sadness that had come over the features naturally full of kindness and benevolence  the prisoner appeared in the dock  he had become paler and perhaps thinner for his square determined jaw and the resolute mould of his lips were more than usually remarkable and were noted in the physiognomical brain of harvey anderson as well as the keen light of his full dark hazel eye the breadth of his brow with his shining light brown hair brushed back from it the strong build of his frame and the determined force apparent even in the perfect quiescence of his attitude  leonard axworthy ward was arraigned for the wilful murder of francis axworthy and asked whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty  his voice was earnest distinct and firm and his eyes were raised upwards as though he were making the plea of not guilty not to man alone but to the judge of all the earth  the officer of the court informed him of his right to challenge any of the jury as they were called over by name and as each came to be sworn he looked full and steadily at each face more than one of which was known to him by sight as if he were committing his cause into their hands  he declined to challenge and then crossing his arms on his breast cast down his eyes and thus retained them through the greater part of the trial  the jurymen were then sworn in and charged with the issue and the counsel for the prosecution opened the case speaking more as if in pity than indignation as he sketched the history which it was his painful duty to establish  he described how mr axworthy having spent the more active years of his life in foreign trade had finally returned to pass his old age among his relatives and had taken to assist him in his business a greatnephew and latterly another youth in the same degree of relation the son of his late niecethe prisoner who on leaving school had been taken into his uncles office lodged in the house and became one of the family  it would however be shown by witnesses that the situation had been extremely irksome to the young man and that he had not been in it many months before he had expressed his intention of absconding provided he could obtain the means of making his way in one of the colonies then followed a summary of the deductions resulting from the evidence about to be adduced and which carried upon its face the inference that the absence of the cousin the remoteness of the room the sight of a large sum of money and the helplessness of the old man had proved temptations too strong for a fiery and impatient youth long fretted by the restraints of his situation and had conducted him to violence robbery and flight  it was a case that could not be regarded without great regret and compassion but the gentlemen of the jury must bear in mind in their investigation that pity must not be permitted to distort the facts which he feared were only too obvious  the speech was infinitely more telling from its fair and commiserating tone towards the prisoner and the impression that it carried not that he was to be persecuted by having the crime fastened on him but that truth must be sought out at all hazards  even he is sorry for leonard  i dont hate him as i thought i should whispered gertrude may to her elder sister the first witness was as before the young maidservant anne ellis who described her first discovery of the body and on farther interrogation the situation of the room distant from those of the servants and out of hearingalso her masters ordinary condition of feebleness  she had observed nothing in the room or on the table but knew the window was open since she had run to it and screamed for help upon which master hardy had come to her aid  leonards counsel then elicited from her how low the window was and how easily it could be entered from without  james hardy corroborated all this giving a more minute account of the state of the room and telling of his going to call the young gentlemen and finding the open passage window and empty bedroom the passage window would naturally be closed at night and there was no reason to suppose that mr ward would be absent  the bag shown to him was one that had originally been made for the keeping of cash but latterly had been used for samples of grain and he had last seen it in the office  the counsel for the prisoner inquired what had been on the table at hardys first entrance but to this the witness could not swear except that the lamp was burning and that there were no signs of disorder nor was the dress of the deceased disarranged  he had seen his master put receipts and make memorandums in a large black silverclasped pocketbook but had never handled it and could not swear to it he had seen nothing like it since his masters death he was further asked how long the prisoner had been at the mill his duties there and the amount of trust reposed in him to which last the answer was that about a month since mr axworthy had exclaimed that if ever he wanted a thing to be done he must set ward about it saving this speech made in irritation at some omission on sams part nothing was adduced to show that leonard was likely to have been employed without his cousins knowledge though hardy volunteered the addition that mr ward was always respectful and attentive and that his uncle had lately thought much more of him than at first  rebekah giles gave her account of the scene in the sittingroom  she had been in the service of the deceased for the last four years and before in that of his sisterinlaw mr samuels mother  she had herself closed the passage window at seven oclock in the evening as usual  she had several times previously found it partly open in the morning after having thus shut it overnight but never before mr wards bed unslept in  her last interview with mr axworthy was then narrated with his wordsan imprecation against rifle practice as an excuse for idle young rascals to be always out of the way  then followed her communication to the prisoner at halfpast nine when she saw him go into the parlour in his volunteer uniform rifle in hand heard him turn the lock of the sittingroom door and then herself retired to bed  crossexamination did not do much with her only showing that when she brought in the supper one window had been open and the blinds common calico ones drawn down thus rendering it possible for a person to lurk unseen in the court and enter by the window  her master had assigned no reason for sending for mr ward  she did not know whether mr axworthy had any memorandumbook she had seen none on the table nor found any when she undressed the body though his purse watch and seals were on his person  mr rankins medical evidence came next both as to the cause of death the probable instrument and the nature of the stains on the desk and rifle  when crossexamined he declared that he had looked at the volunteer uniform without finding any mark of blood but from the nature of the injury it was not likely that there would be any  he had attended mr axworthy for several years and had been visiting him professionally during a fit of the gout in the last fortnight of june when he had observed that the prisoner was very attentive to his uncle  mr axworthy was always unwilling to be waited on but was unusually tolerant of this nephews exertions on his behalf and had seemed of late to place much reliance on him  doctor richard may was the next witness called  the sound of that name caused the first visible change in the prisoners demeanour if that could be called change which was only a slight relaxation of the firm closing of the lips and one sparkle of the dark eyes ere they were again bent down as before though not without a quiver of the lids  dr may had brought tone look and manner to the grave impartiality which even the most sensitive man is drilled into assuming in public but he durst not cast one glance in the direction of the prisoner  in answer to the counsel for the prosecution he stated that he was at the vintry mill at seven oclock on the morning of the 6th of july not professionally but as taking interest in the ward family he had seen the body of the deceased and considered death to have been occasioned by fracture of the skull from a blow with a blunt heavy instrument the superintendent had shown him a rifle which he considered from the marks on it as well as from the appearance of the body to have produced the injury  the rifle was the one shown to him it was the property of leonard ward  he recognized it by the crest and cipher h e  it had belonged to his soninlaw hector ernescliffe by whom it had been given to leonard ward  poor doctor  that was a cruel piece of evidence and his son and daughters opposite wondered how he could utter it in that steady matteroffact way but they knew him to be sustained by hopes of the crossexamination and he soon had the opportunity of declaring that he had known leonard ward from infancy without being aware of any imputation against him but had always seen him highly principled and trustworthy truthful and honourable kindhearted and humanethe last person to injure the infirm or aged  perhaps the good doctor less afraid of the sound of his own voice and not so much in awe as some of the other witnesses here in his eagerness overstepped the bounds of prudence  his words indeed brought a tremulous flicker of grateful emotion over the prisoners face but by carrying the inquiry into the region of character and opinion he opened the door to a dangerous reexamination by the crown lawyer who required the exact meaning of his unqualified commendation especially in the matter of humanity demanding whether he had never known of any act of violence on the prisoners part the colour flushed suddenly into leonards face though he moved neither eye nor lip but his counsel appealed to the judge and the pursuit of this branch of the subject was quashed as irrelevant but the doctor went down in very low spirits feeling that his evidence had been damaging and his hopes of any ray of light becoming fainter  after this the village policeman repeated the former statements as to the state of the various rooms the desk locked and untouched the rifle boat c further explaining that the distance from the mill to blewer station by the road was an hour and halfs walk by the fields not more than half an hours  the stationmaster proved the prisoners arrival at midnight his demand of a dayticket his being without luggage and in a black suit and the london policeman proved the finding of the money on his person and repeated his own explanation of it  the money was all in sovereigns except one five and one tenpound note and edward hazlitt the clerk of the whitford bank was called to prove the having given the latter in change to mr axworthy for a fiftypound cheque on the 10th of may last  this same clerk had been at the volunteer drill on the evening of the 5th of july had there seen the prisoner had parted with him at dusk towards nine oclock making an engagement with him to meet on blewer heath for some private practice at seven oclock on monday evening thought mr axworthy did sometimes employ young ward on his commissions mr axworthy had once sent him into whitford to pay in a large sum and another time with an order to be cashed the dates of these transactions were shown in the books and hazlitt added on further interrogation that samuel axworthy could not have been aware of the sum being sent to the bank since he had shortly after come and desired to see the account which had been laid before him as confidential manager when he had shown surprise and annoyance at the recent deposit asking through whom it had been made  not ten days subsequently an order for nearly the entire amount had been cashed signed by the deceased but filled up in samuels handwriting  this had taken place in april and another witness a baker proved the having paid the fivepound note to old mr axworthy himself on the 2nd of may  samuel axworthy himself was next called  his florid face wore something of the puffed stupefied look it had had at the inquest but his words were ready and always to the point  he identified the bag in which the money had been found giving an account of it similar to hardys and adding that he had last seen it lying by his cousins desk  his uncle had no account with any london bank all transactions had of late passed through his own hands and he had never known the prisoner employed in any business of importancehe could not have been kept in ignorance of it if it had previously been the case  the deceased had a black shagreen pocketbook with a silver clasp which he occasionally used but the witness had never known him give it out of his own hand nor take a receipt in it  had not seen it on the morning of the 6th nor subsequently could not account for the sum found on the person of the prisoner whose salary was £50 per annum and who had no private resources except the interest of £2000 which he being a minor was not in his own hands deceased was fond of amassing sovereigns and would often keep them for a longtime in the drawer of his desk as much as from £50 to £100  there was none there when the desk was opened on the 6th of july though there had certainly been gold there two days previously it was kept locked  it had a small bramah key which his uncle wore on his watchchain in his waistcoat pocket  the drawer was locked when he saw it on the morning of the 6th  the doctor who had joined his children gave a deep respiration and relaxed the clenching of his hand as this witness went down  then it came to the turn of aubrey spencer may  the long waiting after his nerves had been wound up had been a severe ordeal and his delicacy of constitution and home breeding had rendered him peculiarly susceptible  with his resemblance to his father in form and expression it was like seeing the doctor denuded of that shell of endurance with which he had contrived to conceal his feelings the boy was indeed braced to resolution bat the resolution was equally visible with the agitation in the awestricken brow varying colour tightened breath and involuntary shiver as he took the oath  again leonard looked up with one of his clear bright glances and perhaps a shade of anxiety but aubrey for his own comfort was too shortsighted for meeting of eyes from that distance  seeing his agitation and reckoning on his evidence the counsel gave him time by minutely asking if his double christian name were correctly given his age and if he were not the son of dr may  you were the prisoners schoolfellow i believe  no faltered aubrey  but you live near him  we are friends said aubrey with sudden firmness and precision and from the utterance of that emphatic are his spirit returned  did you often see him  on most sundays after church  did you ever hear him say he had any thoughts of the means of leaving the mill privately  something like it said aubrey turning very red  can you tell me the words  he said if things went on that i was not to be surprised if i heard non est inventus said aubrey speaking as if rapidity would conceal the meaning of the words but taken aback by being made to repeat and translate them to the jury  and did he mention any way of escaping  he said the window and cedartree were made for it and that he often went out that way to bathe said aubrey  when did this conversation take place  on sunday the 22nd of june said aubrey in despair as the crown lawyer thanked him and sat down  he felt himself betrayed into having made their talk wear the air of deliberate purpose and having said not one word of what mr bramshaw had hailed as hopeful  however the defending barrister rose up to ask him what he meant by having answered something like it  because said aubrey promptly though we did make the scheme we were neither of us in earnest  how do you know the prisoner was not in earnest  we often made plans of what we should like to do  and had you any reason for thinking this one of such plans  yes said aubrey for he talked of getting gold enough to build up the marketcross or else of going to see the feejee islands  then you understood the prisoner not to express a deliberate purpose so much as a vague design  just so said aubrey  a design that depended on how things went on at the mill  and being desired to explain his words he added that leonard had said he could not bear the sight of sam axworthys tyranny over the old man and was resolved not to stay if he were made a party to any of the dishonest tricks of the trade  in that case did he say where he would have gone  first to new zealand to my brother the reverend norman may  leonards counsel was satisfied with the colour the conversation had now assumed but the perils of reexamination were not over yet for the adverse lawyer requested to know whence the funds were to have come for this adventurous voyage  we laughed a little about that and he said he should have to try how far his quarters salary would go towards a passage in the steerage  if your friend expressed so strong a distaste to his employers and their business what induced him to enter it  leonards counsel again objected to this inquiry and it was not permitted  aubrey was dismissed and flushed and giddy was met by his brother tom who almost took him in his arms as he emerged from the passage  o tom what have i done  famously provided theres no miller in the jury  come as he felt the weight on his arm flora says i am to take you down and make you take something  no no no i cant  i must go back  i tell you theres nothing going on  every one is breathing and baiting  and he got him safe to a pastrycooks and administered brandy cherries which aubrey bolted whole like pills only entreating to return and wanting to know how he thought the case going  excellently  hazlitts evidence and yours ought to carry him through and anderson says they have made so much out of the witnesses for the prosecution that they need call none for the defence and so the enemy will be balked of their reply and we shall have the last word  i vow i have missed my vocation  i know i was born for a barrister  now may we come back said the boy overwhelmed by his brothers cheeriness and they squeezed into court again tom inserting aubrey into his own former seat and standing behind him on half a foot at the angle of the passage  they were in time for the opening of the defence and to hear leonard described as a youth of spirit and promise of a disposition that had won him general affection and esteem and recommended to universal sympathy by the bereavement which was recent in the memory of his fellowtownsmen and there was a glance at the mourning which the boy still wore  they had heard indeed that he was quicktempered and impulsive but the gentlemen of the jury were some of them fathers and he put it to them whether a ready and generous spirit of indignation in a lad were compatible with cowardly designs against helpless old age whether one whose recreations were natural science and manly exercise showed tokens of vicious tendencies above all whether a youth whose friendship they had seen so touchingly claimed by a son of one of the most highly respected gentlemen in the county were evincing the propensities that lead to the perpetration of deeds of darkness  tom patted aubrey on the shoulder and aubrey though muttering humbug was by some degrees less wretched  men did not change their nature on a sudden the counsel continued and where was the probability that a youth of character entirely unblemished and of a disposition particularly humane and generous should at once rush into a crime of the deep and deadly description to which a long course of dissipation leading to perplexity distress and despair would be the only inducement  he then went on to speak of leonards position at the mill as junior clerk  he had been there for six months without a flaw being detected either in his integrity his diligence or his regularity indeed it was evident that he had been gradually acquiring a greater degree of esteem and confidence than he had at first enjoyed and had been latterly more employed by his uncle  that a young man of superior education should find the daily drudgery tedious and distasteful and that one of sensitive honour should be startled at the ordinary he might almost say proverbial customs of the millers trade was surprising to no one and that he should unbosom himself to a friend of his own age and indulge together with him in romantic visions of adventure was to all who remembered their own boyhood an illustration of the freshness and ingenuousness of the character that thus unfolded itself  where there were daydreams there was no room for plots of crime  then ensued a species of apology for the necessity of entering into particulars that did not redound to the credit of a gentleman who had appeared before the court under such distressing circumstances as mr samuel axworthy but it was needful that the condition of the family should be well understood in order to comprehend the unhappy train of events which had conducted the prisoner into his present situation  he then went through what had been traceable through the evidencethat samuel axworthy was a man of expensive habits and accustomed to drain his uncles resources to supply his own needs showing how the sum which had been intrusted to the prisoner to be paid into the local bank had been drawn out by the elder nephew as soon as he became aware of the deposit and how shortly after the prisoner had expressed to aubrey may his indignation at the tyranny exercised on his uncle  by and by another sum is amassed continued leonards advocate how dispose of it  the local bank is evidently no security from the rapacity of the elder nephew  once aware of its existence he knows how to use means for compelling its surrender and the feeble old man can no longer call his hardearned gains his own except on sufferance the only means of guarding it is to lodge it secretly in a distant bank without the suspicion of his nephew samuel but the invalid is too infirm to leave his apartment his fingers crippled by gout refuse even to guide the pen  he can only watch for an opportunity and this is at length afforded by the absence of the elder nephew for two days at the county races  this will afford time for a trustworthy and intelligent messenger to convey the sum to town deposit it in messrs drummonds bank and return unobserved when therefore supper is brought in mr axworthy sends for the lad on whom he has learnt to depend and shows much disappointment at his absence  where is he  is he engaged with low companions in the haunts of vice that are the declivity towards crime  is he gaming or betting or drinking  no he has obeyed the summons of his country he is a zealous volunteer and is eagerly using a weapon presented to him by a highly respected gentleman of large fortune in a neighbouring county nay so far is he from any sinister purpose that he is making an appointment with a fellowrifleman for the ensuing monday  on his return at dark he receives a pressing summons to his uncles room and hastens to obey it without pausing to lay aside his rifle  the commission is explained and well understanding the painfulness of the cause he discreetly asks no questions but prepares to execute it  the sum of £124 12s is taken from the drawer of the desk the odd money assigned to travelling expenses the £120 placed in a bag brought in from the office for the purpose bearing the initials of the owner and a receipt in a private pocketbook was signed by him for the amount and left open on the table for the ink to dry  who that has ever been young can doubt the zest and elevation of receiving for the first time a confidential mission  who can doubt that even the favourite weapon would be forgotten where it stood and that it would only be accordant to accredited rules that the window should be preferable to the door  had it not already figured in the visions of adventure in the sunday evenings walk was it not a favourite mode of exit in the mornings when bathing and fishing were more attractive than the pillow  moreover the moonlight disclosed what appeared like a figure in the courtyard and there was reason at the time to suppose it a person likely to observe and report upon the expedition  the opening of the front door might likewise attract notice and if the cousin should as was possible return that night the direct road was the way to meet him  the hour was too early for the train which was to be met but a lighted candle would reveal the vigil and moonlight on the meadows was attractive at eighteen gentlemen of soberer and maturer years might be incredulous but surely it was not so strange or unusual for a lad who indulged in visions of adventure to find a moonlight walk by the riverside more inviting than a bedroom  shortly after perhaps as soon as the light was extinguished the murder must have been committed  the very presence of that light had been guardianship to the helpless old man below  when it was quenched nothing remained astir the way from without was open the weapon stood only too ready to hand the memorandumbook gave promise of booty and was secured though nothing else was apparently touched it was this very book that contained the signature that would have exonerated the prisoner and to which he fearlessly appealed upon his arrest at the paddington station before for his additional misfortune he had time to discharge himself of his commission and establish his innocence by the deposit of the money at the bank  he has thus for a while become the victim of a web of suspicious circumstances  but look at these very circumstances more closely and they will be found perfectly consistent with the prisoners statement never varying be it remembered from the explanation given to the policeman in first surprise and horror of the tidings of the crime  it might have been perhaps thought that there was another alternative between entire innocence and a deliberate purpose of robbery and murdernamely that reproof from the old man had provoked a blow and that the means of flight had been hastily seized upon in the moment of confusion and alarm  this might have been a plausible line of defence and secure of a favourable hearing but i beg to state that the prisoner has distinctly refused any such defence and my instructions are to contend for his perfect innocence  a nature such as we have already traced is as we cannot but perceive revolted by the bare idea of violence to the aged and infirm and recoils as strongly from the one accusation as from the other  the prisoner made his statement at the first moment and has adhered to it in every detail without confusion or selfcontradiction  it does not attempt to explain all the circumstances but they all tally exactly with his story he is unable to show by whom the crime could have been committed nor is he bound in law or justice so to do nay his own story shows the absolute impossibility of his being able to explain what took place in his absence  but mark how completely the established facts corroborate his narrative  observe first the position in which the body was found the head on the desk the stain of blood corresponding with the wound the dress undisturbed all manifestly untouched since the fatal stroke was dealt  could this have been the case had the key of the drawer of gold been taken from the waistcoat pocket the chain from about the neck of the deceased and both replaced after the removal of the money and relocking the drawer can any one doubt that the drawer was opened the money taken out and the lock secured while mr axworthy was alive and consenting  again what robber would convey away the spoil in a bag bearing the initials of the owner and that not caught up in haste but fetched in for the purpose from the office  or would so telltale a weapon as the rifle have been left conspicuously close at hand  there was no guilty precipitation for the uniform had been taken off and folded up and with a whole night before him it would have been easy to reach a more distant station where his person would not have been recognized  why too if this were the beginning of a flight and exile should no preparation have been made for passing a single night from home why should a dayticket have been asked for  no the prisoners own straightforward unvarnished statement is the only consistent interpretation of the facts otherwise conflicting and incomprehensible  that a murder has been committed is unhappily too certain  i make no attempt to unravel the mystery  i confine myself to the far more grateful task of demonstrating that to fasten the imputation on the accused would be to overlook a complication of inconsistencies all explained by his own account of himself but utterly inexplicable on the hypothesis of his guilt  circumstantial evidence is universally acknowledged to be perilous ground for a conviction and i never saw a case in which it was more manifestly delusive than in the present bearing at first an imposing and formidable aspect but on examination confuted in every detail most assuredly continued the counsel his voice becoming doubly earnest while there is even the possibility of innocence it becomes incumbent on you gentlemen of the jury to consider well the fearful consequences of a decision in a matter of life or deatha decision for which there can be no reversal  the facts that have come to light are manifestly incomplete  another link in the chain has yet to be added and when it shall come forth how will it be if it should establish the guiltlessness of the prisoner too late  too late when a young life of high promise and linked by close family ties and by bonds of ardent friendship with so many has been quenched in shame and disgrace for a crime to which he may be an utter stranger  the extinction of the light in that upper window was the sign for darkness and horror to descend on the mill  here is the light of life still burning but a breath of yours can extinguish it in utter gloom and then who may rekindle it  nay the revelation of events that would make the transactions of that fatal night clear as the noonday would never avail to rekindle the lamp that may yet i trust shine forth to the worldthe clearer it may be from the unmerited imputations which it has been my part to combat and of which his entire life is a confutation  mrs pugh was sobbing under her veil gertrude felt the cause won tom noiselessly clapped the orator behind his brothers back and nodded his approval to his father  even leonard lifted up his face and shot across a look as if he felt deliverance near after the weary day that seemed to have been a lifetime already though the sunbeams were only beginning to fall high and yellow on the ceiling through the heated stifling atmosphere heavy with anxiety and suspense  doctor may was thinking of the meeting after the acquittal of the telegram to stoneborough of the sisters revival and of ethels greeting  still the judge had to sum up and all eyes turned on him knowing that the fate of the accused would probably depend on the colouring that the facts adduced would assume in his hands  flora who met him in society was struck by the grave and melancholy bracing as it were of the countenance that she had seen as kindly and bright as her fathers and the deep full voice sad rather than stern the very tone of which conveyed to every mind how heavy was the responsibility of justice and impartiality  in effect the very force of the persuasions made for the defence unanswered by the prosecution rendered it needful for him to give full weight to the evidence for the other side namely the prisoners evident impatience of his position and premeditated flight the coincidence of the times the being the last person seen to enter the room and with the very weapon that had been the instrument of the crime the probability that the deceased had himself opened the drawer the open window the flight and the missing sum being found on his person the allegation that the receipt would be found in the pocketbook unsupported by any testimony as to the practice of the deceased the strangeness of leaving the premises so much too early for the train and by his own account leaving a person prowling in the court close to his uncles window  no opinion was given but there was something that gave a sense that the judge felt it a crushing weight of evidence  yet so minutely was every point examined so carefully was every indication weighed which could tend to establish the prisoners innocence that to those among his audience who believed that innocence indubitable it seemed as if his arguments proved it even more triumphantly than the pleading of the counsel as vibrating between hope and fear anxiety and gratitude they followed him from point to point of the unhappy incident hanging upon every word as though each were decisive  when at length he ceased and the jury retired the breathless stillness continued  with some indeed there was the relaxation of longstrained attention eyes unbent and heads turned but flora had to pass her arm round her little sister to steady the childs nervous trembling aubrey sat rigid and upright the throbs of his heart wellnigh audible and dr may leant forward and covered his eyes with his hand tom who alone dared glance to the dock saw that leonard too had retired  those were the most terrible minutes they had ever spent in their lives but they were minutes of hopeof hope of relief from a burthen becoming more intolerable with every seconds delay ere the rebound  long as it seemed to them it was not in reality more than a quarter of an hour before the jury returned and with slow grave movements and serious countenances resumed their places leonard was already in his his cheek paler his fingers locked together and his eyes scanning each as they came forward and one by one their names were called over his head was erect and his bearing had something undaunted though intensely anxious  the question was put by the clerk of the court how find you guilty or not guilty  firmly though sadly the foreman rose and his answer was we find the prisoner guilty but we earnestly recommend him to mercy  whether tom felt or not that aubrey was in a dead faint and rested against him as a senseless weight he paid no visible attention to aught but one face on which his eyes were riveted as though nothing would ever detach themand that face was not the prisoners  others saw leonards face raised upwards and a deep red flush spread over brow and cheek though neither lip nor eye wavered  then came the question whether the prisoner had anything to say wherefore judgment should not be passed upon him  leonard made a step forward and his clear steady tone did not shake for a moment as he spoke  no  i see that appearances are so much against me that man can hardly decide otherwise  i have known from the first that nothing could show my innocence but the finding of the receipt  in the absence of that one testimony i feel that i have had a fair trial and that all has been done for me that could be done and i thank you for it my lord and you gentlemen as he bent his head then added i should like to say one thing more  my lord you would not let the question be asked how i brought all this upon myself  i wish to say it myself for it is that which makes my sentence just in the sight of god  it is true that though i never lifted my hand against my poor uncle i did in a moment of passion fling a stone at my brother which but for gods mercy might indeed have made me a murderer  it was for this and other like outbreaks that i was sent to the mill and it may be just that for it i should diethough indeed i never hurt my uncle  perhaps there was something in the tone of that one word indeed which by recalling his extreme youth touched all hearts more than even the manly tone of his answer and his confession  there was a universal weeping and sobbing throughout the court mrs pugh was on the verge of hysterics and obliged to be supported away and gertrude was choking between the agony of contagious feeling and dread of floras displeasure and all the time leonard stood calm with his brave head and lofty bearing wound up for the awful moment of the sentence  the weeping was hushed when the crier of the court made proclamation commanding all persons on pain of imprisonment to be silent  then the judge placed on his head the black cap and it was with trembling hands that he did so the blood had entirely left his face and his lips were purple with the struggle to contend with and suppress his emotion  he paused as though he were girding himself up to the most terrible of duties and when he spoke his voice was hollow as he began  leonard axworthy ward you have been found guilty of a crime that would have appeared impossible in one removed from temptation by birth and education such as yours have been  what the steps may have been that led to such guilt must lie between your own conscience and that god whose justice you have acknowledged  to him you have evidently been taught to look and may you use the short time that still remains to you in seeking his forgiveness by sincere repentance  i will forward the recommendation to mercy but it is my duty to warn you that there are no such palliating circumstances in the evidence as to warrant any expectation of a remission of the sentence  and therewith followed the customary form of sentence ending with the solemn and may god almighty have mercy on your soul  full and open and never quailing had the dark eyes been fixed upon the judge all the time and at those last words the head bent low and the lips moved for amen  then tom relieved to find instant occupation for his father drew his attention to aubreys state and the boy between tom and george rivers was as best they could carried through the narrow outlets and laid down in a room opened to them by the sheriff where his father and flora attended him while tom flew for remedies and gertrude sobbed and wept as she had never done in her life  it was some time before the swoon yielded or dr may could leave his son and then he was bent on at once going to the prisoner but he was so shaken and tremulous that tom insisted on giving him his arm and held an umbrella over him in the driving rain  father he said as soon as they were in the street i can swear who did it  dr may just hindered himself from uttering the name but tom answered as if it had been spoken  yes  i saw the face of fiendish barbarity that once was over me when i was a miserable little schoolboy  he did it and he has the receipt  dr may squeezed his arm  i have not betrayed the secret have i  you knew that he knew it  not knewsuspectedgenerosity  i saw him  i saw him cast those imploring earnest eyes of his on the scoundrel as he spoke of the receiptand the villain try to make himself of stone  well if i have one wish in life it is to see that fellow come to the fate he deserves  ill never lose sight of him ill dog him like a bloodhound  and what good will that do whentom tom we must move heaven and earth for petitions  ill take them up myself and get george rivers to take me to the home secretary  never fear while theres justice in heaven  heres henry exclaimed tom withholding his father who had almost ran against the brother as they encountered round a corner  he was pale and bewildered and hardly seemed to hear the doctors hasty asseverations that he would get a reprieve  he sent me to meet you said henry  he wants you to go hometo ave i mean  he says that is what he wants mostfor you to go to her now and to come to him tomorrow or when you can and he wants to hear how aubrey is continued henry as if dreamily repeating a lesson  he saw then  yes and that seems to trouble him most  dr may was past speaking and tom was obliged to answer for himthat aubrey was pretty well again and had desired his dearest dearest love then asked how leonard was  calm and firm as ever said henry half choked  nothing seems to upset him but speaking ofof you and aubrey dr mayand poor ave butbut theyll be together before long  no such thing said dr may  you will see that certainty cures when suspense kills and for him ill never believe but that all will be right yet  are you going home  i shall try to be withwith the dear unhappy boy as long as i can and then ill come home  dr may grasped henrys hand gave a promise of coming and a message of love to the prisoner tried to say something more but broke down and let tom lead him away     chapter xv        under the shroud       of his thundercloud   lie we still when his voice is loud       and our hearts shall feel       the love notes steal   as a bird sings after the thunder pealc f a   not till dusk could dr may get back to stoneborough and then in an evening gleam of that stormy day he was met at the gate of bankside by richard and ethel  you need not come in papa said ethel  she is asleep  she knows  dr may sighed with unspeakable relief  mr bramshaw telegraphed and his clerk came down  it was not so very bad  she saw it in our faces and she was so worn out with talking and watching thatthat the very turning her face to the wall with hope over became sleep almost directly  that is well murmured the doctor  and can you be spared my dear if you could come i should be glad for poor aubrey is quite done up  i can come  mary is with her and richard will stay to meet henry if he is coming home or to send up if they want you but i think she will not wake for many hours and thenoh what can any one do  so richard turned back to the sorrowful house and dr may tenderly drawing ethels arm into his own told her as they walked back the few incidents that she most wanted to hear as best he could narrate them  you have had a heartrending day my dear he said you and mary as well as the rest of us  there was one comfort said ethel and that was his own notes ave has all that he has written to her from whitford under her pillow and she kept spreading them out and making us read them andoh their braveness and cheerinessthey did quite seem to hold one up  and then poor little minnas constant little robinchirp of faith god will not let them hurt him  one could not bear to tell the child that though indeed they cannot hurt him it may not be in her sense  look here these are her slippers  she has worked on all day to finish them that they might be done and out of sight when he came home this evening the last stitch was done as richard came in and now i thought i could only take them out of every ones sight  poor things poor things  and how was it with the child when she heard  the old sweet note said ethel less steadily than she had yet spoken nothing could hurt him for what he had not done  i dont know whether she knows whatwhat is in store  at least she is not shaken yet dear child  and avehow did you manage with her through all the day  oh we did as we could  we tried reading the things mr wilmot had marked but she was too restless her hands would wander off to the letters caressing them and she would go back to talk of himall his ways from a baby upwards  i hope there was no harm in letting her do it for if there is anything to do one good it is his noble spirit  if you had only seen his face today exclaimed the doctor half angrily you would not feel much comfort in the cutting off such a fellow  no no it wont be  well petitionpetitionpetitionand save him we will  minna will be right yet  they shall not hurt him  is there really hope in that way said ethel and a quiver of relief agitated her whole frame  every hope  every one i have seen or tom either says so  we have only to draw up a strong enough representation of the facts his character and all that and theres his whole conduct before and since to speak for itself  why when it was all over george heard every one saying either he was a consummate hypocrite or he must be innocent harvey anderson declares the press will take it up  we shall certainly get him off  you dont mean pardoned  commutation of the penalty  come on said the doctor hurrying at his headlong pace theres no time to be lost in getting it drawn up  ethel was dragged on so fast that she could not speak but it was with willing haste for this was the sort of suspense in which motion and purpose were a great relief after the days weary waiting gertrude quite spent with excitement and tears had wisely betaken herself to bed and it would have been well had aubrey followed her example instead of wandering up and down the room in his misery flushed though wan impetuously talking treason against trial by jury and abusing dignitaries  they let him have it out in all its fury and violence till he had tired out his first vehemence and could be persuaded to lie on the sofa while the rough draught of the petition was drawn up tom writing and every one suggesting or discussing till the doctor getting thorough mastery over the subject dictated so fluently and admirably that even tom had not a word to gainsay but observed to ethel when his father had gone up to bed and carried aubrey off what an exceedingly able man my father is  is this the first time you have found that out said ethel  why you know it is not his nature to make the most of himself  but studying under him brings it out more and theres a readiness about him that i wish was catching  but i say ethel whats this  i no more doubt who did the deed than i do who killed abel but i had once seen cains face and i knew it again  is it true that the boy was aware and told my father  did he tell you so  only asked if he had betrayed the secret  if they both know itwhy if it be leonards taste i suppose i must say nothing to the contrary but he might as well consider his sister  what do you know tom said she perplexed  only that theres some secret and if it be as i am given to understand then it is a frenzy that no lucid person should permit  no tom said ethel feeling that the whole must be told it is no certaintyonly unsupported suspicion which he could not help telling papa after binding him on honour to make no use of it putting things together he was sure who the man in the yard was but it was not recognition and he could not have proved it  what quixotry moved my father not to put the lawyers on the scent  ethel explained and for her pains tom fell upon her for her folly in not having told him all when he could have gone to blewer and gathered information as no professional person could do then lamented that he had let aubrey keep him from the inquest when the fellows hangdog look would have been sure to suggest to him to set anderson to get him searched  even now he would go to the mill and try to hunt up something  tom remember papas promise  do you think a man can do nothing without committing himself like poor aubrey  no ethel the doctor may be clever but thats no use if a man is soft and he is uncommonly soft and you should not encourage him in it  ethel was prevented from expressing useless indignation by the arrival of mary asking where papa was  gone to bed  he said he must go off at six tomorrow there are so many patients to see  ave does not want him i hope  no she is still asleep i was only waiting for richard and he had dreadful work with that poor henry  what kind of work  oh i believe it has all come on him now that it was his faultdriving leonard to that place and he was in such misery that richard could not leave him  i am glad he has the grace to feel it at last said tom  it must be very terrible said mary  he says he cannot stay in that house for every room reproaches him and he groaned as if he was in tremendous bodily pain  what you assisted at this scene said tom looking at her rather sharply  no but richard told me and i heard the groans as i sat on the stairs  sat on the stairs  yes  i could not go back to aves room for fear of waking her  and how long  towards an hour i believe  i did all that piece said mary displaying a couple of inches of a stocking leg and i think it was pretty well in the dark  sitting on the stairs for an hour in the dark said tom as he gave mary the candle he had been lighting for her  that may be called unappreciated devotion  i never can tell what tom means said mary as she went upstairs with ethel  it was a very comfortable rest  i wish you had had the same dear ethel you look so tired and worn out  let me stay and help you  it has been such a sad long day and oh how terrible this is and you know him better than any of us except aubrey  mary stopped almost in dismay for her sister usually so firm broke down entirely and sitting down on a low chair threw an arm round her and resting her weary brow against her gave way to long tearless sobs or rather catches of breath  oh mary mary she said between her gasps to think of last yearand coombeand the two bright boysand the visionsand the light in those glorious eyesand that this should be the end  dear dear ethel said mary with fastflowing tears and tender caresses you have kept us all up you have always shown us it was for the best  it is it is cried ethel  i do i will believe it  if i had only seen his face as papa tells of it i could keep hold of the glory of it and the martyr spirit  now i only see his earnest shy confiding lookandand i dont know how to bear it  and ethels grasp of mary in both arms was tightened as if to support herself under her deep labouring sobs of anguish  ah he was very fond of you  there never was any one beyond our own selves that loved me so well i always knew it would not lastthat it ought not but oh it was endearing and i did think to have seen him a shining light  and dont you tell us he is a shining light now said mary among the tears that really almost seemed to be a relief as if her sister herself had shed them and as she knelt down ethel laid her head on her shoulder and spoke more calmly  he is she said and i ought to be thankful for it  i think i am generallybut nowit makes it the more piteousthe hopesthe spiritthe determinationall to be quenched and so quenchedand to have nothingnothing to do for him  but ethel papa says your messages do him more good than anything and papa will let you go and see him and that will comfort him  ethels lips gave a strange sort of smile she thought it was at simple marys trust in her power but it would hardly have been there but for the species of hope thus excited and the sense of sympathy mary was not one to place any misconstruction on what had passed she well knew that leonard had almost taken a brothers place in ethels heart and she prized him at the rate of her sisters esteem perhaps her prominent thought was how cruel were those who fancied that ethels lofty faith was unfeeling and how very good leonard must be to be thus mourned  at any rate she was an excellent comforter in the sympathy that was neither too acute nor too obtuse and purely to oblige her ethel for the first time submitted to her favourite panacea of hair brushing and found that in very truth those soft and steady manipulations were almost mesmeric in soothing away the hard oppressive excitement and bringing on a gentle and slumberous resignation  the sisters were early astir next morning to inflict on their father a cup of cocoa which he rebelled against but swallowed and to receive his last orders chiefly consisting of messages to tom about taking the petition to be approved of by dr spencer and others and then having it properly drawn out  mary asked if women might sign it and was answered with an impatient pshaw  but ladies do have petitions of their own said mary with some diffidence  could not we have one  his lips were compressed for another pshaw when he bethought himself  well i dont knowthe more the better  only it wont do for you to set it going  flora must be the woman for that  oh then cried mary eagerly might not i walk over to breakfast at the grange and talk to flora  ethel you would not mind going to ave instead  or will you go to flora  you had better said ethel  i must stay on aubreys account and this is your doing mary she added looking at her warmly  then put on your hat mary and take a biscuit said the doctor and you shall have a lift as far as the cross roads  thus the morning began with action and with hope  mary found herself very welcome at the grange where there was much anxiety to hear of aubrey as well as the more immediate sufferers  the riverses had dined at drydale and had met the judges as well as a good many of the county gentlemen who had been on the grand jury and attended on the trial  they had found every one most deeply touched by the conduct of the prisoner  the judge had talked to flora about her young brother and the friendship so bravely avouched had asked the particulars of the action to which leonard had alluded and shown himself much interested in all that she related  she said that the universal impression was that the evidence was dead against leonard and taken apart led to such conviction of his guilt that no one could wonder at the verdict but that his appearance and manner were such that it was almost impossible under their influence not to credit his innocence  she had reason to believe that petitions were already in hand both from the county and the assize town and she eagerly caught at marys proposal of one from the ladies of stoneborough  ill drive in at once before luncheon and take you home mary she said  and first of all we will begin with the two widows and half the battle will be won  nay more than half the battle proved to be already gained in that quarter  the writingtable was covered with sheets of foolscap and mrs pugh was hard at work copying the petition which mr harvey anderson had kindly assisted in composing and which the aunt and niece had intended to have brought to the grange for mrs riverss approval that very day  harvey anderson had spent the evening at mrs ledwichs in drawing it up and giving his advice and flora going over it word for word with mrs pugh felt that it could hardly have been better worded  he is a very clever a very rising young man and so feeling said mrs ledwich to mary while this was going on  in fact he is a perfect knighterrant on this subject  he is gone to london this morning to see what can be done by means of the press  i tell matilda it is quite a romance of modern life and indeed the sweet girl is very romantic stillvery young even after all she has gone through  not understanding this mary let it pass in calculations on the number of possible signatures which the two ladies undertook to collect  that is well said flora as they went away  it could not be in better hands  it will thrive the better for our doing nothing but writing our names  they met tom on the like errand but not very sanguine for he said there had of late been an outcry against the number of reprieves granted and the public had begun to think itself not sufficiently protected  he thought the best chance was the discovery of some additional fact that might tell in favour of leonard and confident in his own sagacity was going to make perquisitions at the mill every one had been visiting of late and now that he knew more if he and his microscope could detect one drop of human blood in an unexpected place they would do better service to the prisoner than all the petitions that could be signed  averil was somewhat better the feverishness had been removed by her long sleep of despair and her energy revived under the bodily relief and the fixed purpose of recovering in time to see her brother again but the improvement was not yet trusted by henry who feared her doing too much unless he was himself watching over her and therefore only paid leonard a short visit in the forenoon going and returning by early trains  he reported that leonard was very pale and owned to want of sleep adding however it does not matter  why should i wish to lose any time  calm and brave as ever he had conversed as cheerfully as henrys misery would permit inquiring into the plans of the family which he knew were to depend on his fate and acquiescing in his brothers intention of quitting the country nay even suggesting that it might be better for his sisters to be taken away before all was over though he as well as henry knew that to this averil would never have consented  he had always been a great reader of travels and he became absolutely eager in planning their life in the wild as if where they were he must be till the casual mention of the word rifle brought him to sudden silence and the consciousness of the condemned cell but even then it was only to be urgent in consoling his brother and crowding message on message for his sisters begging henry not to stay not to consider him for a moment but only whatever might be best for ave  in this frame henry had left him and late in the afternoon dr may had contrived to despatch his work and make his way to the jail where as he entered he encountered the chaplain mr reeve a very worthy but not a very acute man  pausing to inquire for the prisoner he was met by a look of oppression and perplexity  the chaplain had been with young ward yesterday evening and was only just leaving him but then instead of the admiring words the doctor expected there only came a complaint of the difficulty of dealing with him so well instructed so respectful in manner and yet there was a coldness a hardness about him amounting to sullenness rejecting all attempts to gain his confidence or bring him to confession  dr may had almost been angry but he bethought himself in time that the chaplain was bound to believe the verdict of the court and besides the good man looked so grieved and pitiful that it was impossible to be displeased with him especially when he began to hope that the poor youth might be less reserved with a person who knew him better and to consult dr may which of the stoneborough clergy had better be written to as likely to be influential with him dr may recommended mr wilmot as having visited the boy in his illness as well as prepared him for confirmation and then with a heavier load of sadness on his heart followed the turnkey on his melancholy way  when the door was opened he saw leonard sitting listlessly on the side of his bed resting his head on his hand entirely unoccupied but at the first perception who his visitor was he sprang to his feet and coming within the arms held out to him rested his head on the kind shoulder  my dear boymy brave fellow said dr may you got through yesterday nobly  there was none either of the calmness or the reserve of which dr may had been told in the hot hands that were wringing his own nor in the choking struggling voice that tried to make the words clearthank you for what you saidand dear aubreyhow is he  i came away at six before he was awake said the doctor but he will not be the worse for it never fear  i hope his evidence was less trying than you and he expected  leonard half smiled  i had forgotten that he said it was so long ago  no indeedthe dear fellow waslike a bright spot in that dayonlyonly it brought back all we wereall that is gone for ever  the tenderness of one whom he did not feel bound to uphold like his brother had produced the outbreak that could not fail to come to so warm open and sensitive a nature and at such an age  he was bold and full of fortitude in the front of the ordeal and solitude pent up his feelings but the fatherly sympathy and perfect confidence drew forth expression and a vent once opened the rush of emotion and anguish long repressed was utterly overpowering  his youthful manhood struggled hard but the strangled sobs only shook his frame the more convulsively and the tears burnt like drops of fire as they fell among the fingers that he spread over his face in the agony of weeping for his young vigorous life his blasted hopes the wretchedness he caused the disgrace of his name  dont dont fight against it said dr may affectionately drawing him to his seat on the bed as indeed the violence of the paroxysm made him scarcely able to stand  let it have its way you will be all the better for it  it ought to be soit must  and in tears himself the doctor turned his back and went as far away as the cell would permit turning towards the books that lay on a narrow ledge that served for a table  how long o lord how long were the words that caught his eye in the open psalms and startled as if at unauthorized prying he looked up at the dull screened and spiked window above his head till he knew by the sounds that the worst of the uncontrollable passion had spent itself and then he came back with the towel dipped in water and cooled the flushed heated face as a sister might have done  ohthank youi am ashamed gasped the still sobbing boy  ashamed  no i like you the better for it said the doctor earnestly  there is no need that we should not grieve together in this great affliction and say out all that is in our hearts  all exclaimed leonard  nono words can say that  oh was it for such as this that my poor mother made so much of meand i got through the feverand i hopedand i strovewhywhy should i be cut offfor a disgrace and a misery to all and again came the heartbroken sobs though less violently  not to those who look within and honour you leonard  within  why how bad i have been since this is the reckoning  i deserve it i knowbut and his voice again sank in tears  ethel says that your so feeling comforts her the most to know that you have not the terrible struggle of faith disturbed by injustice  ifi have not said leonard it is her doing  in those happy days when we read marmion and could not believe that god would not always show the right she showed me how we only see bits and scraps of his justice here and it works round in the end  nay if i had not done that thing to henry i should not be here now  it is right it is right he exclaimed between the heaving sobs that still recurred  i do try to keep before me what she said about jobwhen it comes burning before me why should that man be at large and i here or when i think how his serpenteye fell under mine when i tried that one word about the receipt that would save my life  oh that receipt  better to be here than in his place after all  id rather be a streetsweeper bitterly began leonardoh dr may do let me have that he cried suddenly changing his tone and holding out his hand as he perceived in the doctors buttonhole a dovepink presented at a cottage door by a grateful patient  for a space he was entirely occupied with gazing into its crimson depths inhaling the fragrance and caressingly spreading the cool damask petals against his hot cheeks and eyelids  it is so long since i saw anything but walls he said  three weeks sadly replied the doctor  there was a gleam of sunshine when i got out of the van yesterday i never knew before what sunshine was  i hope it will be a sunny day when i go out for the last time  my dear boy i have good hopes of saving you  theres not a creature in stoneborough or round it that is not going to petition for youand at your age  leonard shook his head in dejection  it has all gone against me he said  they all say theres no chance  the chaplain says it is of no use unsettling my mind  the chaplain is an old began dr may catching himself up only just in time and asking how do you get on with him  i can hear him read said leonard with the look that had been thought sullen  but you cannot talk to him  not while he thinks me guilty  then at a sound of warm sympathy from his friend he added i suppose it is his duty but i wish he would keep away  i cant stand his aiming at making me confess and i dont want to be disrespectful  i see i see  it cannot be otherwise  but how would it be if wilmot came to you  would mr may said leonard with a beseeching look  richard  he would with all his heart but i think you would find more support and comfort in a man of mr wilmots age and experience and that mr reeve would have more trust in him but it shall be exactly as will be most comforting to you  if mr wilmot would be so good then said leonard meekly indeed i want help to bear it patiently  i dont know how to die and yet it seemed not near so hard a year ago when they thought i did not notice and i heard ave go away crying and my mother murmuring again and again thy will be donethe last time i heard her voice  oh well that she has not to say it now  well that her son can say it  i want to be able to say it said the boy fervently but this seems so hardlife is so sweet  then after a minutes thought dr may that morning when i awoke and asked you for thempapa and mammayou knelt down and said the lords prayer  wont you now  and when those words had been said and they both stood up again leonard added it always seems to mean more and more  but oh dr may that forgivingi cant ask any one but you if and he paused  if you forgive my poor boy  nay are not your very silence and forbearance signs of practical forgiveness  besides i have always observed that you have never used one of the epithets that i cant think of him without  some feelings are too strong for common words of abuse said leonard almost smiling but i hope i may be helped to put away what is wrongoh must you go  i fear i must my dear i have a patient to see again on my way back and one that will be the worse for waiting  henry has not been able to practise  i want to ask one thing dr may before you go  could not you persuade them since home is poisoned to them at any rate to go at once  it would be better for my sisters than being herewhenand they would only remember that last sunday at home  do you shrink from another meeting with averil  his face was forced into calmness  i will do without it if it would hurt her  it may for the time but to be withheld would give her a worse heartache through life  oh thank you cried leonard his face lighting up it is something still to hope for  nay ive not given you up yet said the doctor trying for a cheerful smile  ive got a prescription that will bring you through yetlondon advice you know  ive great faith in the consulting surgeon at the home office  by the help of that smile and augury the doctor got away terribly beaten down but living on his fragment of hope though obliged to perceive that every one who merely saw the newspaper report in black and white without coming into personal contact with the prisoner could not understand how the slightest question of the justice of the verdict could arise  even mr wilmot was so convinced by the papers that the doctor almost repented of the mission to which he had invited him and would if he could have revoked what had been said but the vicar of stoneborough painful as was the duty felt his post to be by the side of his unhappy young parishioner equally whether the gaol chaplain or dr may were right and if he had to bring him to confession or to strengthen him to endure grief suffering wrongfully  and after the first interview no more doubts on that score were expressed but the vicars tone of pitying reverence in speaking of the prisoner was like that of his friends in the high street  tom may spared neither time nor pains in beating up for signatures for the petition but he had a more defined hope namely that of detecting something that might throw the suspicion into the right quarter  the least contradiction of the evidence might raise a doubt that would save leonards life and bring the true criminal in peril of the fate he so richly deserved  the vintry mill was the lion of the neighbourhood and the crowds of visitors had been a reason for its new masters vacating it and going into lodgings in whitford so that tom when he found it convenient to forget his contempt of the gazers and curiosity hunters who thronged there and to march off on a secret expedition of investigation found no obstacle in his way and at the cost of a fee to mrs giles who was making a fortune was free to roam and search wherever he pleased  even his careful examination of the cotton blind and his scraping of the windowsill with a knife were not remarked for had not the great chair been hacked into fragmentary relics and the loose paper of the walls of leonards room been made mincemeat of as memorials of the murderer ward  one long white hair picked out of a mat below the window and these scrapings of the windowsill tom carried off and also the scrapings of the top bar of a stile between the mill and the three goblets that evening all were submitted to the microscope  dr may was waked from a doze by a very deferential i beg your pardon sir and a sudden tweak which abstracted a silver thread from his head and mab showed somewhat greater displeasure at a similar act of plunder upon her white chemisette  but the spying was followed by a sigh and in dumb show ethel was made to perceive that the vintry hair had more affinity with the canine than the human  as to the scrapings of the window nothing but vegetable fibre could there be detected but on the stile there was undoubtedly a mark containing human blooddisks tom proved that both by comparison with his books and by pricking his own finger and kept ethel to see it after every one else was gone up to bed  but as one persons blood was like anothers who could tell whether some one with a cut finger had not been through the stile  tom shook his head there was not yet enough on which to commit himself  but ill have himill have him yet said he  ill never rest while that villain walks the earth unpunished  meantime harvey anderson did yeomans service by a really powerful article in a leading paper written from the very heart of an able man who had been strongly affected himself and was well practised in feeling in pen and ink  every word rang home to the soul and all the more because there was no defence nor declamation against the justice of the verdict which was acknowledged to be unavoidable it was merely a pathetic delineation of a terrible mystery with a little meditative philosophy upon it the moral of which was that nothing is more delusive than fact more untrue than truth  however it was copied everywhere and had the great effect of making it the cue of more than half the press to mourn over rather than condemn the unfortunate young gentleman  mrs pugh showed every one the article and confided to most that she had absolutely ventured to suggest two or three of the sentences but a great deal might be borne from mrs pugh in consideration of her indefatigable exertions with the ladies petition and it was a decided success  the last census had rated market stoneborough at 7561 inhabitants and mrs pughs petition bore no less than 3024 female names in which she fairly beat that of the mayor but then she had been less scrupulous as to the age at which people should be asked to sign as long as the name could be written at all she was not particular whose it was  dr may made his patients agree to accept as his substitute dr spencer or mr wright to whom henry ward intended to resign practice and house  he himself was to go to london for a couple of nights with george rivers who was exceedingly gratified at having the charge of him all to himself and considered that the united influence of member and mayor must prevail  dr spencer on the contrary probably by way of warning represented mr mayor as ruining everything by his headlong way of setting about it declaring that he would abuse everybody all round and assure the home secretary that as sure as his name was dick may it was quite impossible the boy could have hurt a fly though a strict sense of truth would lead him to add the next moment that he was terribly passionate and had nearly demolished his brother  dr may talked of his caution and good behaviour which maybe were somewhat increased by this caricature but he ended by very hearty wishes that these were the times of jeanie deans if the pardon depended on our own good queen he should not doubt of it a moment why was not the boy just the age of her own son  and verily there was no one in the whole world whom poor averil envied like jeanie deans  so member and mayor went to london together and intense were the prayers that speeded them and followed them  the case was laid before the home secretary the petitions presented and dr may said all that man might say on ground where he felt as if overpartisanship might be perilous  the matter was to have due consideration nothing more definite or hopeful could be obtained but there could be no doubt that this meant a real and calm reweighing of the evidence with a consideration of all the circumstances  it was something for the doctor that a second dispassionate study should be given to the case but his heart sank as he thought of that cold hard statement of evidence without the counter testimony of the honest tearless eyes and simple good faith of the voice and tone  and when he entered the railway carriage on his road home the newspaper that george rivers attentively pressed upon him bore the information that wednesday the 21st would be the day according to usage for the execution of the condemned criminal leonard axworthy ward  if it had been for the execution of richard may the doctor could hardly have given a deeper groan  he left the train at the county town  he had so arranged that he might see the prisoner on his way home but he had hardly the heart to go except that he knew he was expected and no disappointment that he could help must add to the pangs of these last days  leonard was alone but was not as before sitting unemployed he carefully laid down his etching work ere he came forward to meet his friend and there was not the bowed and broken look about him but a fixed calmness and resolution as he claimed the fatherly embrace and blessing with which the doctor now always met him  i bring you no certainty leonard  it is under consideration  thank you  you have done everything returned leonard quietly and then pausing he added i know the day nowthe day after my birthday  let uslet us hope said the doctor greatly agitated  thank you again said leonard and there was a pause during which dr may anxiously studied the face which had become as pale and almost as thin as when the lad had been sent off to coombe and infinitely older in the calm steadfastness of every feature  you do not look well leonard  no i am not quite well but it matters very little he said with a smile  i am well enough to make it hard to believe how soon all sense and motion will be gone out of these fingers and he held up his hand and studied the minutiae of its movements with a strange grave sort of curiosity  dontdont leonard exclaimed the doctor  you may be able to bear it but i cannot  i thought you would not mind you have so often watched death  yes but and he covered his face with his hands  i wish it did not pain you all so much said leonard quietly but for that i can feel it to be better than if i had gone in the fever when i had no sense to think or repent or if i hadi hardly knew my own faults  you seem much happier now my boy  yes said leonard  i am more used to the notion and mr wilmot has been so kind  then i am to see ave tomorrow if she is well enough henry has promised to bring her and leave her alone with me and i do hopethat i shall be able to convince her that it is not so very bad for meand then she may be able to take comfort you know she would if she were nursing me now in my bed at bankside so why should she not when she sees that i dont think this any worse but rather better  the doctor was in no mood to think any comfort possible in thus losing one like leonard and he did not commit himself to an untruth there was a silence again and leonard opened his book and took out his etchings one which he had already promised the doctor another for aubrey and at the third the doctor exclaimed inarticulately with surprise and admiration  it was a copy of the wellknown crossbearing form in the magdalen college chapel altarpiece drawn in pen and ink on a halfsheet of thick notepaper but somehow into the entire face and figure there was infused such an expression as now and then comes direct from the soul of the draughtsmanan inspiration entirely independent of manual dexterity and that copies however exact fail to render nay which the artist himself fails to renew  the beauty the meekness the hidden majesty of the countenance were conveyed in a marvellous manner and were such as would bring a tear to the eye of the gazer even had the drawing been there alone to speak for itself  this is your doing leonard  i have just finished it  it has been one of my greatest comforts  ah  doing those lines and he pointed to the thorny crown i seem to get ashamed of thinking this hardness  only think dr may from the very first moment the policeman took me in charge nobody has said a rough word to me  i have never felt otherwise than that they meant justice to have its way as far as they knew but they were all consideration for me  to think of that and then go over the scoffs and scourgingsthere was a bright glistening tear in leonards eye nowit seems like childs play to go through such a trial as mine  yes you have found the secret of willingness  and added the boy hesitating between the words but feeling that he must speak them as the best balm for the sorrow he was causing even my little touch of the shame and scorn of this does make me know better what it must have been and yetso thankful when i remember why it wasthat i think i could gladly bear a great deal more than this is likely to be  oh my boy i have no fears for you now  yes yeshave fears cried leonard hastily  pray for me  you dont know what it is to wake up at night and know something is coming nearer and nearerand then thisbefore one can remember all that blesses itor the night of that agonyand that he knows what it is  do we not pray for you said dr may fervently in church and at home and is not this an answer  am i to take this drawing leonard that speaks so much  ifif you think miss maywould let me send it to her  thank you it will be very kind of her  and please tell her if it had not been for that time at coombe i dont know how i could ever have felt the ground under my feet  if i have one wish that never can be  what wish my dear dear boy  dont be afraid to say  is it to see her  it was said leonard but i did not mean to say it  i know it cannot be  but leonard she has said that if you wished it she would come as if you were lying on your bed at home and with more reverence  large tears of gratitude were swelling in leonards eyes and he pressed the doctors hand but still said almost inarticulately ought she  i will bring her my boy  it will do her good to see howhow her pupil as they have always called you in joke leonard can be willing to bear the cross after his master  she has never let go for a moment the trust that it was well with you  oh dr may it was the one thingand when i had gone against all her wishes  it is so good of her  it is the one thing and there was no doubt from his face that he was indeed happy  and dr may went home that day softened and almost cheered wellnigh as though he had had a promise of leonards life and convinced that in the region to which the spirits of ethel and her pupil could mount resignation would silence the wailings of grief and sorrow the things invisible were more than a remedy for the things visible  that ethel should see leonard before the last he was quite resolved and ethel finding that so it was left the when in his hands knowing the concession to be so great that it must be met by grateful patience on her own side treasuring the drawing meanwhile with feelings beyond speech  dr may did not wish the meeting to take place till he was really sure that all hope was at an end he knew it would be a strong measure and though he did not greatly care for the world in general he did not want to offend flora unnecessarily in matters of propriety she was a little bit of a conscience to him and though he would brave her or any one else when a thing was right especially if it were to give one last moment of joy to leonard she was not to be set at naught till the utmost extremity  and for one day the sight of averil would be enough  she had struggled into something sufficiently like recovery to be able to maintain her fitness for the exertion and henry had recognized that the unsatisfied pining was so preying on her as to hurt her more than the meeting and parting could do since little as he could understand how it was he perceived that leonard could be depended on for support and comfort  with him indeed leonard had ever shown himself cheerful and resolute speaking of anything rather than of himself and never grieving him with the sight of those failings of flesh and heart that would break forth where there was more congenial sympathy yet where they were not a reproach  so averil with many a promise to be good and strongly impressed with warnings that the chance of another meeting depended on the effects of this one was laid back in the carriage leaving poor little minna to marys consolation  minna was longing to go too but henry had forbidden it and not even an appeal to dr may had prevailed so she was taken home by mary and with a childs touching patience was helped through the weary hours giving wandering though gentle attention to ellas eager display of the curiosities of the place and explanations of the curious games and puzzles taught by mr tom ethel watching the sweet wistful face and hearing the subdued voice felt a reverence towards the child as though somewhat of the shadow of her brothers cross had fallen on her  the elder brother and sister meanwhile arrived at the building now only too familiar to one of them and under her thick veil unconscious of the pitying looks of the officials averil was led leaning on henrys arm along the whitewashed passages with their slate floors and up the iron stairs the clear hard light coldness chilling her heart with a sense of the stern relentless inevitable grasp in which the victim was held  the narrow iron door flew open at the touch of the turnkey a hand was on her arm but all swam round with her and she only knew it was the wellknown voice she did not follow the words between her brothers and the turnkey about the time she was to be left there but she gave a start and shudder when the door sprung fast again behind her and at the same instant she felt herself upheld by an arm round her waist  take off your bonnet ave let me see you he said himself undoing the strings and removing it then bending his face to hers for a long almost insatiable kiss as they stood strained in one intense embrace all in perfect silence on the sisters part  i have been making ready for you he said at length partly releasing her you are to sit here and he deposited her still perfectly passive in his hands upon his bed her back against the wall  put up your feet  there  and having settled her to his satisfaction he knelt down on the floor one arm round her waist one hand in hers looking earnestly up into her face with his soul in his eyes her other hand resting on his shoulder  how are the little ones ave  very well  minna so longed to come  better not said leonard she is so little and these white walls might distress her fancy  they will remember our singing on the last sunday evening instead  do you remember ave how they begged to stay on and on till it grew so dark that we could not see a word or a note and went on from memory and he very softly hummed the restful cadence dying away into    till in the ocean of thy love   we lose ourselves in heaven above   how can you bear to think of those dear happy days  because you will be glad of them by and by said leonard and i am very glad of them now though they might have been so much better if only we had known  they were the only happy days of all my life  i hope noti trust not dearest  you may and ought to have much better and happier days to come  she shook her head with a look of inexpressible anguish almost of reproach  indeed i mean it ave he said i have thought it over many times and i see that the discomfort and evil of our home was in the spirit of pride and rebellion that i helped you to nurse  it was like a wedge driving us farther and farther apart and now that it is gone and you will close up again when you are kind and yielding to henrywhat a happy peaceful home you may make out in the prairie land  as if we could ever  nay averil could not you recover it if i were dying now of sickness i know you would though you might not think so at the time  believe me then when i say that i am quite willing to have it as it isto be my own man to the lastto meet with such precious inestimable kindness from so many  of course i should like to live longer and do something worth doing but if i am to die young there is so much blessing even in this way that nothing really grieves me but the thought of you and henry and if it makes you one together even that is made up  awestruck and as if dreaming she did not answer only smoothing caressingly the long waves of bright brown hair on his forehead  she was surprised by his next question  ave how has mrs pugh behaved  oh the woman  i have hardly thought of her  she has been very active about the petition somebody said but i dont believe henry can bear to hear of her any more than i can  what made you think of her  because i wanted to know how it was with henry and i could not ask him  poor fellow  well ave you see he will depend on you entirely for comfort and you must promise me that shall be your great business and care  how you do think of henry she said half jealously  of course ave  you and i have no past to grieve over together but poor henry will never feel free of having left me to my selfwilled obstinacy and let me go to that place  besides the disgrace in the sight of the world touches him more and you can tread that down more easily than he  then in answer to a wondering look yes you can when you recollect that it is crime not the appearance of it that is shame  i do not mean that i do not deserve all thisbutbut and his eye glistened ave dear if i could only bring out the words to tell you how much peace and joy there is in knowing thatwith that vast differenceit is like in some degree what was borne to save us i really dont think you could go on grieving over me any more at least not more than for the loss he added tenderly and youll not miss me so much in a new country you know with henry and the children to take care of  only promise me to be kind to henry  and having drawn forth a faint promise that he knew would have more force by and by leonard went on in his low quiet voice into reminiscences that sounded like random of the happy days of childhood and early youth sometimes almost laughing over them sometimes linking his memory as it were to tune or flower sport or study but always for joy and never for pain and thus passed the time with long intervals of silent thought and recollection on his part and of a sort of dreamy stupor on his sisters during which the strange peaceful hush seemed to have taken away her power of recalling the bitter complaints of cruel injustice and the brokenhearted lamentations she had imagined herself pouring out in sympathy with her victim brother  instead of being wrung with anguish her heart was lulled and quelled by wondering reverence and she seemed to herself scarcely awake and only dimly conscious of the palecheeked brighteyed face upturned to her so calm and undaunted yet so full of awe and love the low steady tender voice and the warm upholding arm  a great clock struck and leonard said there they were to come at four and then the chaplain is coming  he is grown so very kind now ave if they would let you be with me at my last communion  will you could you bear it  i think then you would know all the peace of it  oh yes make them let me come  then it is not goodbye he said as he fetched her bonnet and cloak and put them on with tender hands as if she were a child in readiness as steps approached and her escort reappeared  here she is henry he said with a smile  she has been very good she may come again  and then holding her in his arms once more he resigned her to henry saying not goodbye ave we will keep my birthday together     chapter xvi                           the captives went   to their own places to their separate glooms   uncheered by glance or hand or hope to brood   on those impossible glories of the past   when they might touch the grass and see the sky   and do the works of men  but manly work   is sometimes in a prisons m queen isabel   commutation of punishment to penal servitude for life  such were the tidings that ran through stoneborough on sunday morning making all feel as if a heavy oppression had been taken from the air in gratitude to the merciful authorities and thankfulness for the exemption from death the first impressions were that justice was at last speaking that innocence could not suffer and that right was reasserting itself  even when the more sober and sad remembered that leniency was not pardon nor life liberty they were hastily answered that life was everythinglife was hope life was time and time would show truth  averils first tears dropped freely as she laid her head on marys shoulder and with her hand in dr mays essayed to utter the words it is your doingyou have twice saved him for me and minna stood calmly glad but without surprise  i knew they could not hurt him god would not let them  the joy and relief were so great as to absorb all thought or realization of what this mercy was to the prisoner himself until dr may was able to pay him a visit on monday afternoon  it was at a moment when the first effects of the tidings of life had subsided and there had been time to look forth on the future with a spirit more steadfast than buoyant  the strain of the previous weeks was reacting on the bodily frame and indisposition unhinged the spirits so that when dr may entered beaming with congratulations he was met with the same patient glance of endurance endeavouring at resignation that he knew so well but without the victorious peace that had of late gained the ascendant expression  there was instead an almost painful endeavour to manifest gratitude by cheerfulness and the smile was far less natural than those of the last interview as fervently returning the pressure of the hand he said you were right dr may you have brought me past the crisis  a sure sign of ultimate recovery my boy  remember dum spiro spero  leonard attempted a responsive smile but it was a hopeless business from the moment when at the inquest he found himself entangled in the meshes of circumstance his mind had braced itself to endure rather than hope and his present depressed state both mental and bodily rendered even that endurance almost beyond his powers  he could only say you have been very good to me  my dear fellow you are sadly knocked down i wish and the doctor looked at him anxiously  i wish you had been here yesterday said leonard then you would not have found me so  no not thankless indeed  no indeed butyes i see it was follynay harshness to expect you to be glad of what lies before you my poor boy  i amam thankful said leonard struggling to make the words truth wednesday is off my mindyes it is more than i deservei knew i was not fit to die and those at home are spared  but i am as much cut off from themperhaps morethan by death  and it is the same disgrace to them the same exile  i suppose henry still goes  yes he does  ah then one thing dr mayif you had a knife or scissorsi do not know how soon they may cut my hair and i want to secure a bit for poor ave  dr may was too handless to have implements of the first order but a knife he had and was rather dismayed at leonards reckless hacking at his bright shining wavy hair pulling out more than he cut with perfect indifference to the pain  the doctor stroked the chestnut head as tenderly as if it had been gertrudes sunny curls but leonard started aside and dashing away the tears that were overflowing his eyes under the influence of the gentle action asked vigorously have you heard what they will do with me  i do not know thoroughly  a year or six months maybe at one of the great model establishments then probably you will be sent to some of the public works said the doctor sadly  yes it is a small boon to give you life and take away all that makes life happy  if it were only transportation  yes  in a new world you could live it down and begin afresh  and even here leonard i look to finding you like joseph in his prison  the iron entering into his soul said leonard with a mournful smile  no in the trustworthiness that made him honoured and blessed even there  leonard leonard conduct will tell  even there you can live this down and will  eighteen tomorrow replied the boy  fifty years of it perhaps i know god can help me through with it but it is a long time to be patient  by way of answer the doctor launched into brilliant auguries of the impression the prisoners conduct would produce uttering assurances highly extravagant in his worship the mayor of the charms of the modern system of prison discipline but they fell flat there could be no disguising that penal servitude for life was penal servitude for life and might well be bitterer than death itself  sympathy might indeed be balm to the captive but the good doctor pierced his own breast to afford it so that his heart sank even more than when he had left the young man under sentence of death  his least unavailing consolations were his own promises of frequent visits and aubreys of correspondence but they produced more of dejected gratitude than of exhilaration  yet it was not in the way of murmur or repining but rather of suffering and being strong and only to this one friend was the suffering permitted to be apparent  to all the officials he was simply submissive and gravely resolute impassive if he encountered sharpness or sternness but alert and grateful towards kindliness of which he met more and more as the difference between dealing with him and the ordinary prisoners made itself felt  to dr may alone was the depth of pain betrayed but another comforter proved more efficient in cheering the prisoner namely mr wilmot who learning from the doctor the depression of their young friend hastened to endeavour at imparting a new spring of life on this melancholy birthday  physically the boy was better and perhaps the new day had worn off somewhat of the burthen of anticipation for mr wilmot found him already less downcast and open to consolation  it might be too that the sense that the present was to have been his last day upon earth had made him more conscious of the relief from the immediate shadow of death for he expressed his thankfulness far more freely and without the effort of the previous day  and depend on it said mr wilmot you are spared because there is something for you to do  to bear said leonard  no to do  perhaps not immediately but try to look on whatever you have to bear not only as carrying the cross as i think you already feel it  or there would be no standing it at all  true said mr wilmot and your so feeling it convinces me the more that whatever may follow is likewise to be looked upon as discipline to train you for something beyond  who knows what work may be in store for which this fiery trial may be meant to prepare you  the head was raised and the eyes brightened with something like hope in their fixed interrogative glance  even as things are now who knows what good may be done by the presence of a man educated religious unstained by crime yet in the same case as those around him  i do not mean by quitting your natural place but by merely living as you must live  you were willing to have followed your master in his death  you now have to follow him by living as one under punishment and be sure it is for some purpose for others as well as yourself  if there is any work to be done for him it is all right said leonard cheerily and as mr wilmot paused he added it would be like working for a friendif i may dare say soafter the hours when this place has been made happy to me  i should not mind anything if i might only feel it working for him  feel it  be certain of it  as you have realized the support of that friend in a way that is hardly granted save in great troubles so now realize that every task is for him  do not look on the labour as hardship inflicted by mistaken authority  oh i only want to get to that  i have been so long with nothing to do  and your hearty doing of it be it what it may as unto the lord can be as acceptable as dr mays labours of love among the pooras entirely a note in the great concord in heaven and earth as the work of the ministry itselfas completely in unison  nay further such obedient and hearty work will form you for whatever may yet be awaiting you and what that may be will show itself in good time when you are ready for it  the right chord was touched the spirit of energy was roused and leonard was content to be a prisoner of hope not the restless hope of liberation but the restful hope that he might yet render faithful service even in his present circumstances  not much passed his lips in this interview but its effect was apparent when dr may again saw him and this time in company with aubrey  most urgent had been the boys entreaties to be taken to see his friend and dr may had only hesitated because leonards depression had made himself so unhappy that he feared its effect on his susceptible son whose health had already suffered from the long course of grief and suspense  but it was plain that if aubrey were to go at all it must be at once since the day was fixed for the prisoners removal and the still nearer and dearer claims must not clash with those of the friend flora shook her head and reminded her father that leonard would not be out of reach in future and that the meeting now might seriously damage aubreys already uncertain health  i cannot help it flora said the doctor it may do him some temporary harm but i had rather see him knocked down for a day or two than breed him up to be such a poor creature as to sacrifice his friendship to his health  and mrs rivers who knew what the neighbourhood thought of the good doctors infatuation felt that there was not much use in suggesting how shocked the world would be at his encouragement of the intimacy between the convict and his young son  people did look surprised when the doctor asked admission to the cell for his son as well as himself and truly aubrey who in silence had worked himself into an agony of nervous agitation looked far from fit for anything trying  dr may saw that he must not ask to leave the young friends alone together but in his reverence for the rights of their friendship he withdrew himself as far as the limits of the cell would allow turned his back and endeavoured to read the thirtynine articles in leonards prayerbook but in spite of all his abstraction he could not avoid a complete consciousness that the two lads sat on the bed clinging with arms round one another like young children and that it was leonards that was the upright sustaining figure his own aubreys the prone and leaning one  and of the low whispering murmurs that reached his wouldbe deafened ear the gasping almost sobbing tones were aubreys  the first distinct words that he could not help hearing were no such thing  there cant be slavery where one works with a will and again in reply to something unheard yes one can why how did one do ones greekvery differenthowohyes but you are a clever chap and had her to teach you but i only liked it because id got it to do  just the same with the deskwork down at the mill so it may be the same now  then came fragments of what poor aubrey had expressed more than once at homethat his interest in life in study in sport was all gone with his friend  come aubrey thats stuff  youd have had to go to cambridge you know without me after i doggedly put myself at that place  theres just as much for you to do as ever there was  how you keep on with your do cried ethels spoilt child with a touch of petulance  why what are we come here forinto this world i meanbut to do returned leonard and i take it if we do it right it does not much matter what or where it is  i shant have any heart for it sighed aubrey  nonsense  not with all your people at home and though the voice fell again the doctors ears distinguished the murmur why just the little things she let drop are the greatest help to me here and you always have her  then ensued much that was quite inaudible and at last leonard said no old fellow as long as you dont get ashamed of me thinking about you and knowing what you are about will be one of the best pleasures i shall have  and look here aubrey if we only consider it right you and i will be just as really working together when you are at your books and i am making mats as if we were both at cambridge side by side  it is quite true is it not dr may he added since the doctor finding it time to depart had turned round to close the interview  quite true my boy said the doctor and i hope aubrey will try to take comfort and spirit from it  as if i could said aubrey impatiently when it only makes me more mad to see what a fellow they have shut up in here  not mad i hope said dr may but ill tell you what it should do for both of us aubrey  it should make us very careful to be worthy to remain his friends  o dr may broke in leonard distressed  yes returned dr may i mean what i say however you break in master leonard  as long as this boy of mine is doing his best for the right motives he will care for you as he does nownot quite in the same despairing way of course for holes in ones daily life do close themselves up with timebut if he slacks off in his respect or affection for you then i shall begin to have fears of him  now come away aubrey and remember for your comfort it is not the goodbye it might have been he added as he watched the mute intensity of the boys farewell clasp of the hands but even then had some difficulty in getting aubrey away from the friend so much stronger as the consoler than as the consoled and unconsciously showing how in the last twentyfour hours his mind had acted on the topics presented to him by mr wilmot  changed as he was from the impetuous boyish lad of a few weeks since a change even more noticeable when with his contemporary than in intercourse with elder men yet the nature was the same  obstinacy had softened into constancy pride into resolution generosity made pardon less difficult and elevation of temper bore him through many a humiliation that through him bitterly galled his brother  whatever he might feel prison regulations were accepted by him as matters of course not worth being treated as separate grievances he never showed any shrinking from the assumption of the convict dress whilst henry was fretting and wincing over the very notion of his wearing it and trying to arrange that the farewell interview should precede its adoption     chapter xvii    scorn of me recoils on you                  e b browning   after the first relief the relaxation of his brothers sentence had by no means mitigated henry wards sense of disgrace but had rather deepened it by keeping poor leonard a living not a dead sorrow  he was determined to leave england as soon as possible that his sisters might never feel that they were the relative of a convict and bringing ella home he promulgated a decree that leonard was never to be mentioned hoping that his existence might be forgotten by the little ones  to hurry from old scenes and sever former connections was his sole thought as if he could thus break the tie of brotherhood  there was a halfformed link that had more easily snapped  his courtship had been one of prudence and convenience and in the overwhelming period of horror and suspense had been almost forgotten  the ladys attempts at sympathy had been rejected by averil without obstruction from him for he had no such love as could have prevented her good offices from becoming oppressive to his wounded spirit and he had not sufficient energy or inclination to rouse himself to a response  and when the grant of life enabled him to raise his head and look around him he felt the failure of his plans an aggravation of his calamity though he did not perceive that his impatience to rid himself of an encumbrance and clear the way for his marriage had been the real origin of the misfortune  still he was glad that matters had gone no further and that there was no involvement beyond what could be handsomely disposed of by a letter resigning his pretensions and rejoicing that innate delicacy and prudence had prevented what might have involved the ladys feelings more deeply in the misfortune of his family representing himself in all good faith as having retreated from her proffered sympathy out of devoted consideration for her and closing with elaborate thanks for her exertions on behalf of his unhappy brother  the letter had the honour of being infinitely lauded by mrs ledwich who dwelt on its nobleness and tenderness in many a teteatete and declared her surprise and thankfulness at the immunity of her dear matildas heart  in strict confidence too dr spencer among others learnt thatthough it was not to be breathed till the year was out above all till the poor wards were gonethe dear romantic girl had made her hand the guerdon for obtaining leonards life  so theres your fate dick concluded his friend  you forget the influence of the press returned dr may  people dont propose such guerdons without knowing who is to earn them  yes she has long believed in king john said ethel  meantime averil ward was acquiescing in all henrys projects with calm desperate passiveness  she told mary that she had resolved that she would never again contend with henry but would let him do what he would with herself and her sisters  nor had his tenderness during her illness been in vain it had inspired reliance and affection such as to give her the instinct of adherence to him as the one stay left to her  with leonard shut up all places were the same to her except that she was in haste to escape from the scenes connected with her lost brother and she looked forward with dull despairing acquiescence to the new life with which henry hoped to shake off the past  a colony was not change enough for henrys wishes even there he made sure of being recognized as the convicts brother and was resolved to seek his new home in the wide field of america disguising his very name as warden and keeping up no communication with the prisoner except under cover to dr may  to this unfailing friend was committed the charge of the brother  he undertook to watch over the boy visit him from time to time take care of his health and obtain for him any alleviations permitted by the prison rules and as henry reiterated to averil it was absolutely certain that everything possible from external kindness was thus secured  what more could they themselves have done but show him their faces at the permitted intervals which would be mere wear and tear of feeling very bad for both parties  averil drooped and disputed notguessing though not yet understanding the heart hunger she should feel even for such a dreary glimpse  every hour seemed to be another turn of the wheel that hurried on the departure  the successor wished to take house and furniture as they stood and to enter into possession as soon as possible as he already had taken the practice  this coincided with henrys burning impatience to be quit of everything and to try to drown the sense of his own identity in the crowds of london  he was his sisters only guardian their property was entirely in his hands and no one had the power of offering any obstacle so that no delay could be interposed and the vague design passed with startling suddenness to a fixed decision to be carried into execution immediately  it came in one burst upon the may household that averil and her sisters were coming to spend a last evening before their absolute packing to go on the saturday to london where they would provide their outfit and start in a month for america  the tidings were brought by mary who had as usual been spending part of the morning with averil  no one seemed to be so much taken by surprise as tom whose first movement was to fall on his sisters for not having made him aware of such a preposterous scheme  they thought he knew  he knew that all the five quarters of the world had been talked of in a wild sort of a way but how could he suppose that any man could be crazed enough to prefer to be an american citizen when he might remain a british subject  repugnance to america was naturally strong in tom and had of late been enhanced by conversations with an eton friend who while quartered in canada had made excursions into the states and acquired such impressions as highbred young officers were apt to bring home from a superficial view of them  thus fortified he demanded whether any reasonable person had tried to bring henry ward to his senses  ethel believed that papa had advised otherwise  advised  it should have been enforced  if he is fool enough to alter his name and throw up all his certificates what is to become of him he will get no practice in any civilized place and will have to betake himself to some pestilential swamp will slave his sisters to death spend their money and destroy them with ague  how can you sit still and look on ethel  but what could i do  stir up my father to interfere  i thought you always warned us against interfering with henry ward  he treated this speech as maliciously designed to enrage him ethel he stammered in a case like thiswhere the welfarethe very lifeof oneof your dearest friendof marys i meani did think you would have been above  but tom i would do my utmost and so would papa if it were possible to do anything but it is quite in vain  henry is resolved against remaining under british rule and america seems to be the only field for him  much you know or care cried tom  well if no one else will i must  with which words he departed leaving his sister surprised at his solicitude and dubious of the efficacy of his remonstrance though she knew by experience that tom was very different in a great matter from what he was in a small one  tom betook himself to bankside and the first person he encountered there was his little friend ella who ran up to him at once  oh mr tom we are going to america  shall you be sorry  very sorry said tom as the little hand was confidingly thrust into his  i should not mind it if you were coming too mr tom  what to play at french billiards  no indeed  to find objects for the microscope  i shall save all the objects i meet and send them home in a letter  an alligator or two or a branch of the mississippi said tom in a young mans absent way of halfanswering a pet child but the reply so struck ellas fancy that springing through the open french window she cried  oh ave ave here is mr tom saying i am to send him a branch of the mississippi in a letter as an object for his microscope  i beg your pardon said tom shocked at averils nervous start and still more shocked at her appearance  she looked like one shattered by long and severe illness her eyes were restless and distressed her hair thrust back as if it oppressed her temples her manner startled and overwrought her hand hot and unsteadyher whole air that of one totally unequal to the task before her  he apologized for having taken her by surprise and asked for her brother  she answered that he was busy at mr bramshaws and she did not know when he would come in but still tom lingered he could not bear to leave her to exertions beyond her strength  you are tiring yourself he said can i do nothing to help you  no no thank you i am only looking over things  minna is helping me and i am making an inventory  then you must let me be of use to you  you must be as quiet as possible  you need rest  i cant rest im better busy she said hastily with quick aimless bustling movements  but tom had his fathers tone as he gently arrested the trembling hand that was pulling open a drawer and with his fathers sweet convincing smile said whats that for then drew up a large armchair placed her in it and taking pen and list began to writesometimes at her suggestion sometimes at his owngiving businesslike and efficient aid  the work was so grave and regular that ella soon found the room tedious and crept out calling minna to aid in some of their own personal matters  slowly enumerating the articles they came to the piano  averil went up to it leant fondly against it and softly touched the keys  my own she said bought for a surprise to me when i came home from school and oh how he loved it  every one had reason to love it said tom in a low voice but she did not heed or hear  i cannotcannot part with it  when i sit here i can almost feel him leaning over me  you must goi will pay your expenses myself i wonder if we should have such rough roads as would hurt you she added caressingly toying with the notes and bringing soft replies from them as if she were conversing with a living thing  ah said tom coming nearer you will i hope take care to what your brothers impetuosity might expose either this or yourself  we shall all fare alike she said carelessly  but how said tom  henry will take care of that  do you know miss ward i came down here with the purpose of setting some matters before your brother that might dissuade him from making the united states his home  you have justly more influence than i will you object to hear them from me  ave could not imagine why tom may of all people in the world should thrust himself into the discussion of her plans but she could only submit to listen or more truly to lean back with wandering thoughts and mechanical signs of assent as he urged his numerous objections finally she uttered a meek thank you in the trust that it was over  and will you try to make your brother consider these things  poor ave could not have stood an examination on these things and feeling inadequate to undertake the subject merely said something of very kind but she feared it would be of no use  i assure you if you would persuade him to talk it over with me that i could show him that he would involve you all in what would be most distasteful  thank you but his mind is made up  no other course is open  could he not at least go and see what he thinks of it before taking you and your sisters  impossible said averil  we must all keep together we have no one else  no indeed you must not say that cried tom with a fire that startled averil in the midst of her languid dreary indifference  i did not mean she said to be ungrateful for the kindness of your familythe doctor and dear mary above all but you must know  i know he interrupted that i cannot see you exiling yourself with your brother because you think you have no one else to turn toyou who are so infinitely dear  this is no time for satire she said drawing aside with offence but still wearily and as if she had not given attention enough to understand him  you mistake me he exclaimed i mean that no words can tell how strong the feeling is thatthatno i never knew its force till now but averil i cannot part with youyou who are all the world to me  lifting her heavy eyelids for a moment she looked bewildered and then moving towards the door said i dont know whether this is jest or earnestany way it is equally unsuitable  what do you see in me cried tom throwing himself before her that you should suppose me capable of jesting on such a subject at such a moment  i never saw anything but supercilious irony she answered in the same dreamy indifferent way as if hardly aware what she was saying and still moving on  i cannot let you go thus  you must hear me he cried and he wheeled round an easychair with a gesture of entreaty which she obeyed partly because she was hardly alive to understand his drift partly because she could scarcely stand and there she sat in the same drowsy resignation with which she had listened to his former expostulation  calm collected tom was almost beside himself  averil  averil he cried as he sat down opposite and bent as close to her as possible if i could only make you listen or believe me  what shall i say it is only the honest truth that you are the dearest thing in the whole world to me  the very things that have given you most offence arose from my struggles with my own feelings  i tried to crush what would have its way in spite of me and now you see its force  he saw greater life and comprehension in her eye as he spoke but the look was not encouraging and he continued how can i make you understand  oh if i had but more timebutbut it was only the misery of those moments that showed me why it was that i was always irresistibly drawn to you and yet made instinctive efforts to break the spell and now you will not understand  i do understand said averil at length entirely roused but chiefly by resentment  i understand how much a country surgeons daughter is beneath an m ds attention and how needful it was to preserve the distance by marks of contempt  as a convicts sister the distance is so much widened that it is well for both that we shall never meet again  therewith she had risen and moved to the door  nay nay he cried it is for that very reason that all my past absurdity is trampled on i should glory in a connection with such as leonard yes averil as he fancied he saw her touched you have never known me yet but trust yourself and him to me and you will give him a true brother proud of his nobleness  you shall see him constantlyyou shall keep your sisters with you  only put yourself in my hands and you shall know what devotion is  he would have said more but averil recalled herself and said this is mere folly you would be very sorry were i to take you at your word  it would be unworthy in me towards your father towards henry towards you for me to listen to you even if i liked you and that you have taken good care to prevent me from doing  and she opened the door and made her way into the hall  but averilmiss ward he continued pursuing her if as i swear i will i track out the real offender bring him to justice proclaim leonards innocence  then  she was halfway up the stairs  he had no alternative but to take his hat and stride off in a tumult of dismay first of all at the rejection and next at his own betrayal of himself  had he guessed what it would come to would he ever have trusted himself in that drawingroom  this was the meaning of it all was it  he the sensible man of the family not only to be such an egregious ass but to have made such a fool of himself  for he was as furious at having committed himself to himself as he was at his avowal to averilhe who had always been certain of loving so wisely and so well choosing an example of the true feminine balance of excellence well born but not too grand for the may pretensions soundly religious but not philanthropically pious of good sense and ability enough for his comfort but not of overgrown genius for his discomfort of good looks enough for satisfaction but not for dangerous admiration of useful but not overwhelming wealth of creditable and not troublesome kindredthat he should find himself plunged headlong into love by those brown eyes and straight features by the musical genius talents anything but domestic illregulated enthusiasm nay dislike to himself in the very girl whose station and family he contemned at the best and at the very time when her brother was a convict and her sisters dependent  was he crazed  was he transformed  what frenzy had come over him to endear her the more for being the reverse of his ideal  and through all his very heart was bursting at the thought of the wounds he had given her in his struggles against the net of fascination  he had never imagined the extent of the provocation he gave and in truth his habitual manner was such that it was hard to distinguish between irony and genuine interest  and now it was too late  what should he be henceforth to her  what would stoneborough and his future be to him  he would he believed have taught himself to acquiesce had he seen any chance of happiness before her but the picture he drew of her prospects justified his misery at being only able to goad her on instead of drawing her back  he was absolutely amazed at himself  he had spoken only the literal truth when he said that he had been unconscious of the true nature of the feelings that always drew him towards her though only to assert his independence and make experiments by teasing in his ironically courteous way  not until the desolate indifference of her tone had incited him to show her that henry was not all that remained to her had he arrived at the perception that in the late weeks of anxiety she had grown into his heart and that it was of no use to argue the point with himself or think what he would do the fact was accomplishedhis first love was a direct contradiction to his fixed opinions he had offended her irrevocably and made a fool of himself and she was going away to dreariness  at first he had rushed off into the melancholy meadows among the sodden haycocks still standing among the green growth of grass but a shower increasing the damp forlornness of the ungenial day made him turn homewards  when late in the afternoon ethel came into the schoolroom for some cocksmoor stores she found him leaning over his books on the table  this was his usual place for study and she did not at once perceive that the attitude was only assumed on her entrance so kneeling in front of her cupboard she asked what success  i have not seen him  oh i thought i saw you going  never mind  i mean he added with some confusion i wish for a little peace  i have a horrid headache  you exclaimed ethel and turning round she saw him leaning back in his chair a defenceless animal without his spectacles his eyes small and purpled ringed his hair tossed about his spruceness gone i am sure you are not well she said  quite well  nonsense i only want quiet  let me give you some of aubreys camphor liniment  thank you submitting to a burning application to his brow but as she lingered in anxiety i really want nothing but quiet  how like norman he looks thought ethel as she cast her last glance and departed  can he be going to be ill  if he would only tell when anything is the matter  i know papa says that some of us feel with our bodies and some with our minds but then i never knew tom much affected any way and what is all this to him  and a sigh betrayed the suppressed heartache that underlaid all her sensations  i am afraid it must be illness but any way he will neither tell nor bear to have it noticed so i can only watch  enter the two little wards with a message that ave was sorry but that she was too much tired to come that evening and when mary regretted not having been able to come and help her ella answered that mr tom had come and helped her for a long time  yes said minna but i think he must have done it all wrong for do you know i found the list he had made torn up into little bits  ethel almost visibly started almost audibly exclaimed  at teatime tom appeared his trimness restored but not his usual colouring and ella hailed him with reproaches for having gone away without telling her  the soft attention of which the child had a monopoly did not fail though he bent down trying to keep her to himself and prevent their colloquy from attracting notice but they were so close behind ethels chair that she could not help hearing we were only gone to dig up the violets that you are to have and if you had only stayed you would have seen henry for he came in by the little gate and when i went to tell you you were gone  ethel wondered whether the blushes she felt burning all over her face and neck would be remarked by those before her or would reveal to tom behind her that the child was giving her the key to his mystery marvelling at the exemplary gentleness and patience of his replies to his little coquettish tormentor she next set herself to relieve him by a summons to ella to tea and cherries  fortunately the fruit suggested dr mays reminiscences of old raids on cherry orchards now a mere name and he thus engrossed all the younger audience not entirely preoccupied  he set himself to make the little guests forget all their sorrows as if he could not help warming them for the last time in the magic of his own sunshine but ethel heard and saw little but one figure in the quietest corner of the room a figure at which she scarcely dared to look  and there you are so went her thoughts  it is true then  fairly caught  your lofty crest vailed at lastand at such a time  o tom generous and truehearted in spite of all your nonsense  how could she help being touched  in the net and against his will  oh triumph of womanhood  i am so glad  no im not it is best this way for what an awkward mess it would have been  she is dear leonards sister to be sure and there is stuff in her but papa does not take to her and i dont know whether she would fit in with tom himself  but oh the fun it would have been to see floras horror at finding her one prudent brother no better than the rest of us  dear old tom  the may heart has been too strong for the old professor nature  what a retribution for his high mightiness  harry and richard to be guarded from making fools of themselves  what a nice cloak for jealousy  but it is no laughing matter  how miserable how thoroughly upset he is poor dear tom  if i could only go and kiss you and tell you that i never loved you half so well but you would rather die than let out one word i know  why any one of the others would have had it all out long ago  and i dont know whether it is quite safe to screen the lamp from those aching eyes that are bearing it like a martyr  there well maybe he will just stand the knowing that i know provided i dont say a word but i wish people would not be so selfcontained  selfcontained tom still continued in the morning though looking sallow and wan but in a political argument with his father he was snappish and overbearing and in the course of the day gave another indication of being thrown off his balance which was even harder for ethel to endure  throughout the suspense on leonards account aubrey had been a source of anxiety to all especially to tom  the boys sensitive frame had been so much affected that tender dealings with him were needful and all compulsion had been avoided his father had caused him to be put on the sicklist of the volunteers and as for his studies though the books were daily brought out it was only to prevent the vacuum of idleness and tom had made it his business to nurse his brothers powers avoid all strain on the attention and occupy without exciting bearing with his fitful moods of despondence or of hope whether they took the form of talking or of dreaming  but now that all was over every one knew that it was time to turn over a new leaf and tom with his sore heart did it with a vengeance and on the first instance of carelessness fell on the poor family pet as a younger brother and legitimate souffre douleur with vehemence proportioned to his own annoyance  it was a fierce lecture upon general listlessness want of manliness spirit and perseverance indifference to duties he had assumed  nonsense about feelingsa fellow was not worth the snap of a finger who could not subdue his feelingstrash  the sisters heard the storm from the drawingroom and gertrude grew hotly indignant and wanted ethel to rush in to the rescue but ethel though greatly moved knew that female interposition only aggravated such matters and restrained herself and her sister till she heard tom stride off  then creeping in on tiptoe she found the boy sitting stunned and confounded by the novelty of the thing  what can it be all about ethel  i never had such a slanging in my life  i dont think tom is quite well  he had a bad headache last night  then i hopei mean i thinkhe must have made it worse  i know mine aches as if i had been next door to the great bell and he leant against his sister  i am afraid you really were inattentive  no worse than since the heart has gone out of everything  but that was not all  ethel can it really be a disgrace and desertion and all that if i dont go on with those volunteers when it makes me sick to think of touching my rifle and his eyes filled with tears  it would be a great effort i know said ethel smoothing his hair but after all you volunteered not for pleasure but because your country wanted defence  the country  i dont care for it since it condemned him when he was serving it  he would not say that aubrey  he would only be vexed to hear that you gave in and were fickle to your undertaking  indeed if i were the volunteer i should think it due to him not to shrink as if i were ashamed of what he was connected with  aubrey tried to answer her sweet highspirited smile but he had been greatly hurt and distressed and the late reproach to his manhood embittered his tears without making it easier to repress them and pushing away his chair he darted upstairs  poor dear fellow  ive been very hard on him and only blamed instead of comforting thought ethel sadly as she slowly entered the passage what shall i think of to make a break for both of those two  so you have been cockering your infant said tom meeting her you mean to keep him a baby all his life  tom i want to talk to you said she  in expectation of her displeasure he met it half way setting his back against the passage wall and dogmatically declaring youll be the ruin of him if you go on in this way  how is he ever to go through the world if you are to be always wiping his tears with an embroidered pockethandkerchief and cossetting him up like a blessed little sucking lamb  of course he must rough it said ethel setting her back against the opposite wall i only want him to be hardened but after a shock like this one cannot go on as if one was a stock or stake  even a machine would have its wheels out of order  well well but it is time that should be over  so it is and as the sudden thought flashed on her tom i want you to reconsider your journey that you gave up in the spring and take him  i dont want to go anywhere he wearily said  only it would be so good for him said ethel earnestly he really ought to see something taller than the minster tower and you are the only right person to take him you are so kind to him  for instance he said smiling  accidents will happen in the best regulated families besides he did want shaking up  i dare say he will be the better for it theres the dinnerbell  to her surprise she found his arm round her waist and a kiss on her brow  i thought i should have caught it he said you are not half a fool of a sister after all  aubrey was not in the diningroom and after having carved tom in some compunction was going to look for him when he made his appearance in his uniform  oho said the doctor surprised  theres to be a grand parade with the whitford division he answered and no more was said  not till the eight oclock twilight of the dripping august evening did the family reassemble  ethel had been preparing for a journey that mary and gertrude were to make to maplewood and she did not come down till her father had returned when following him into the drawingroom she heard his exclamation winter again  for the fire was burning tom was sitting crumpled over it with his feet on the fender and his elbows on his knees and aubrey in his fathers armchair his feet over the side so fast asleep that neither entrance nor exclamation roused him the room was pervaded with an odour of nutmeg and port wine and a kettle a decanter and empty tumblers told tales  now the doctor was a hardy and abstemious man of a waterdrinking generation and his wifes influence had further tended to make himindulgent as he wasscornful of whatever savoured of effeminacy or dissipation so his look and tone were sharp and disregardful of aubreys slumbers  we got wet through said tom he was done up had a shivering fit and i tried to prevent mischief  hm said the doctor not mollified  cold is always the excuse but another time dont teach your brother to make this place like a fast mans rooms  ethel was amazed at toms bearing this so well  with the slightest possible wrinkle of the skin of his forehead he took up the decanter and carried it off to the cellaret  how that boy sleeps said his father looking at him  he has had such bad nights said ethel  dont be hard on tom he is very good about such things and would not have done it without need he is so careful of aubrey  too careful by half said the doctor smiling placably as his son returned  you are all in a league to spoil that youngster  he would be better if you would not try your hand on his ailments but would knock him about  i never do that without repenting it said tom then after a pause it is not spirit that is wanting but you would have been frightened yourself at his state of exhaustion  of collapse dont you mean said the doctor with a little lurking smile  however it is vexatious enough he had been gaining ground all the year and now he is regularly beaten down again  suppose i was to take him for a run on the continent  what tired of the hospital  a run now and then is duty not pleasure replied tom quietly while ethel burnt to avert from him these consequences of his peculiar preference for appearing selfish  so much for railway days  that will be a new doctrine at stoneborough  well where do you want to go  i dont want to go anywhere  ethel would not have wondered to see him more sullen than he looked at that moment  it was lamentable that those two never could understand each other and that either from toms childish faults his resemblance to his grandfather or his habitual reserve dr may was never free from a certain suspicion of ulterior motives on his part  she was relieved at the influx of the rest of the party including richard and aubrey wakening was hailed with congratulations on the soundness of his sleep whilst she looked at tom with a meaning smile as she saw her father quietly feel the boys hand and brow  the whole family were always nursing the lad and scolding one another for it  tom had put himself beside ethel under the shade of her urn and she perceived that he was ill at ease probably uncertain whether any confidences had been bestowed on her or mary from the other side there was no hope that the topic would be avoided for richard began with inquiries for averil  she is working herself to death said mary sadly but she says it suits her  and it does said the doctor she is stronger every day  there is nothing really the matter with her  contrary blasts keep a ship upright said gertrude and she has them in abundance  we found her in the midst of six people all giving diametrically opposite advice  dr spencer was really helping and mr wright was there about his own affairs said ethel in a tone of repression  and mrs ledwich wanted her to settle on the ohio to assist the runaway slaves continued gertrude  it does not tease her as if she heard it said mary  no said the doctor she moves about like one in a dream and has no instinct but to obey her brother  well i am glad to be going said daisy it will be flat when all the excitement is over and we have not the fun of seeing tom getting rises out of ave ward  this time tom could not repress a sudden jerk and ethel silenced her sister by a hint that such references were not nice when people were in trouble  by the bye said aubrey speaking of going away what were you saying while i was asleep or was it a dream that i was looking through toms microscope at a rifle bullet in the tyrol  an inspiration from toms brew said the doctor  werent you saying anything said aubrey eagerly  im sure there was something about duty and pleasure  were you really talking of it  tom was and if it is to put some substance into those long useless legs i dont care if you do start off  aubrey flashed into a fresh being  he had just been reading a book about the tyrol and tom not caring at all where they were to go this gave the direction  aubrey rushed to borrow a continental bradshaw from dr spencer and the plan rapidly took form with eager suggestions thrown in by every one ending with the determination to start on the next monday morning  thats settled said tom wearily when he and ethel as often happened had lingered behind the rest only ethel theres one thing  you must keep your eye on the vintry mill and fire off a letter to me if the fellow shows any disposition to bolt  if i can possibly find out  keep your eyes open and then hazlitt has promised to let me know if that cheque of bilsons is cashed  if i am away telegraph and meantime set my father on the scent  it may not hang that dog himself but it may save leonard  oh if it would come  and meantimesilence you know  very well then lingering tom i am sure you did the right thing by aubrey and so was papa afterwards  his brow darkened for a moment but shaking it off he said ill do my best for your cosset lamb and bring him back in condition  thank you i had rather trust him with you than any one  and how is it that no one proposes a lark for you old ethel said tom holding her so as to study her face  you look awfully elderly and ragged  oh im going to be left alone with the doctor and that will be the greatest holiday i ever had  i suppose it is to you said tom with a deep heavy sigh perhaps glad to have some ostensible cause for sighing  dear tom when you are living here and working with him  ahh he said almost with disgust dont talk of slavery to me before my time  how i hate it and everything else  good night  poor tom thought ethel  i wish papa knew him better and would not goad him  will averil ever wake to see what she has done and feel for him  though i dont know why i should wish two people to be unhappy instead of one and there is weight enough already  o leonard i wonder if your one bitter affliction will shield you from the others that may be as trying and more tempting     chapter xviii    all bright hopes and hues of day   have faded into twilight graychristian year   no fear of aubreys failing said tom he has a better foundation than ninetenths of the lads that go up and he is working like a man  he always did work heartily said ethel and with pleasure in his work  ay like a woman  like a scholar  a scholar is a kind of woman  a man when hes a boy only works because he cant help it and afterwards for what he can get by it  for what he can do with it would have a worthier sound  sound or sense it is all the same  scaffolding granted what is the building  tom apparently thought it would be working like a woman to give himself the trouble of answering and ethel went on in her own mind for the works own sakefor what can be got by itfor what can be done with itbecause it cant be helpedarethese all the springs of labour here  then how is work done in that solitary cell  is it because it cant be helped or is it as the lords freeman  and when he can hear of aubreys change will he take it as out of his love or grieve for having been the cause  for the change had been working in aubrey ever since leonard had altered his career  the boy was at a sentimental age and had the susceptibility inseparable from home breeding his desire to become a clergyman had been closely connected with the bright visions of the happy days at coombe and had begun to wane with the first thwarting of leonards plans and when the terrible catastrophe of the one friends life occurred the other became alienated from all that they had hoped to share together  nor could even dr mays household be so wholly exempt from the spirit of the age that aubrey was not aware of the strivings and trials of faith at the university  he saw what harvey anderson was and knew what was passing in the world and while free from all doubts shrank boyishly from the investigations that he fancied might excite them  or perhaps these fears of possible scruples were merely his selfjustification for gratifying his reluctance  at any rate he came home from his two months tour brown robust with revived spirits but bent on standing an examination for the academy at woolwich  he had written about it several times before his return and his letters were as his father said so appallingly sensible that perhaps he would change his mind  but it was not changed when he came home and ethel though sorely disappointed was convinced by her own sense as well as by richards prudence that interference was dangerous  no one in israel was to go forth to the wars of the lord save those who willingly offered themselves and though grieved that her own young knight should be one of the many champions unwilling to come forth in the churchs cause she remembered the ordeal to normans faith and felt that the exertion of her influence was too great a responsibility  you dont like this said tom after a pause  it is not my doing you know  no i did not suppose it was said ethel  you would not withhold any one in these days of exceeding want of able clergymen  i told him it would be a grief at home added tom but when a lad gets into that desperate mood he always may be a worse grief if you thwart him and i give you credit ethel you have not pulled the curb  richard told me not  richard represents the common sense of the family when i am not at home  tom was going the next day to his course of study at the london hospitals and thisthe late afternoonwas the first time that he and his sister had been alone together  he had been for some little time having these short jerks of conversation beginning and breaking off rather absently  at last he said do those people ever write  prisoners do you mean  not for three months  noexiles  mary has heard twice  he held out marys little leathern writingcase to her  o tom  it is only mary  ethel accepted the plea aware that there could be no treason between herself and mary and moreover that the letters had been read by all the family  she turned the key looked them out and standing by the window to catch the light began to read  you need not be afraid kind mary wrote averil on the first days of her voyage i am quite well as well as a thing can be whose heart is dried up  i am hardened past all feeling and seem to be made of indiarubber  even my colour has returnedhow i hate to see it and to hear people say my roses will surprise the delicate americans fancy in a shop in london i met an old schoolfellow who was delighted to see me talked like old times and insisted on knowing where we were staying  i used to be very fond of her but it was as if i had been dead and was afraid she would find out i was a ghost yet i talked quite indifferently and never faltered in my excuses  when we embarked it was no use to know it was the last of england where he and you and home and life were left  how i envied the poor girl who was crying as if her heart would break  on those very words broke the announcement of mr cheviot  tom coolly held out his hand for the letters so much as a matter of course that ethel complied with his gesture and he composedly pocketed them while she felt desperately guilty  marys own entrance would have excited no compunction ethel would have said that tom wanted to hear of the voyage but in the present case she could only blush conscious that the guest recognized her sisters property and was wondering what business she had with it and she was unwilling to explain not only on toms account but because she knew that mr cheviot greatly disapproved of petitioning against the remission of capital sentences and thought her father under a delusion  after toms departure the next day she found the letters in her workbasket and restored them to mary laughing over mr cheviots evident resentment at the detection of her doings  i think it looked rather funny said mary  i beg your pardon said ethel much astonished but i thought as every one else had seen them  tom always laughed at poor ave  he is very different now but indeed mary i am sorry since you did not like it  oh cried mary discomfited by ethels apology indeed i did not mean that i wish i had not said anything  you know you are welcome to do what you please with all i have  only she recurred you cant wonder that mr cheviot thought it funny  if he had any call to think at all said ethel who was one of those who thought that charles cheviot had put a liberal interpretation on dr mays welcome to stoneborough  he had arrived after the summer holidays as second master of the school and at christmas was to succeed dr hoxton who had been absolutely frightened from his chair by the commissions of inquiry that had beset the whichcote foundation and in compensation was at present perched on the highest niche sacred to conservative martyrdom in dr mays loyal heart  charles cheviot was a very superior man who had great influence with young boys and was admirably fitted to bring about the much required reformation in the school  he came frequently to discuss his intentions with dr may and his conversation was well worth being listened to but even the doctor found three evenings in a week a large allowance for good sense and good behaviourthe evenings treated as inviolable even by old friends like dr spencer and mr wilmot the fast waning evenings of aubreys home life  the rest were reduced to silence chess books and mischief except when a treat of facetious small talk was got up for their benefit any attempt of the ladies to join in the conversation was replied to with a condescending levity that reduced ethel to her girlhoods awkward sense of forwardness and presumption mary was less disconcerted because her remarks were never so aspiring and harrys wristbands sufficed her but the neverdaunted daisy rebelled openly related the days events to her papa fearless of any presence and when she had grown tired of the guests regular formula of expecting to meet richard she told him that the adult school always kept richard away in the winter evenings but if you want to see him he is always to be found at cocksmoor and he would be very glad of help  did he express any such wish said mr cheviot looking rather puzzled  oh dear no only i thought you had so much time on your hands  oh nooh no exclaimed mary in great confusion gertrude did not meani am sure i dont know what she was thinking of  and at the first opportunity mary for once in her life administered to gertrude a richlydeserved reproof for sauciness and contempt of improving conversation but the consequence was a fancy of the idle younglings to make mary accountable for the infesting of their evenings and as she was always ready to afford sport to the household they thus obtained a happy outlet for their drollery and discontent and the imputation was the more comical from his apparent indifference and her serene composure until one evening when as the bell rung and mutterings passed between aubrey and gertrude of day set and cheviots mountains lone the head of the family for the first time showed cognizance of the joke and wearily taking down his slippered feet from their repose said lone yes theres the rub  i shall have to fix days of reception if mary will insist on being so attractive  mary with an instinct that she was blamed began to be very sorry but broke off amid peals of merriment and blushes that were less easily extinguished and which caused ethel to tell each of the young ones privately that their sport was becoming boy and frog work and she would have no more of it  the daisy was inclined to be restive but ethel told her that many people thought this kind of fun could never be safe or delicate  i have always said that it might be quite harmless if people knew where to stopnow show me that i am right  and to aubrey she put the question whether he would like to encourage daisy in being a nineteenthcentury young lady without reticence  however as mary heard no more of their mischievous wit ethel was quite willing to let them impute to herself a delusion that the schoolmaster was smitten with mary and to laugh with them in private over all the ridiculous things they chose to say  at last flora insisted on ethels coming with her to make a distant call and as soon as they were in the carriage said it was not only for the sake of mrs copeland though it is highly necessary you should go but it is the only way of ever speaking to you and i want to know what all this is about mary  the children have not been talking their nonsense to you  no one ever talks nonsense to meintentionally i meannot even you ethel i wish you did  but i hear it is all over the town george has been congratulated and so have i and one does not like contradicting only to eat it up again  you always did hear everything before it was true flora  then is it going to be true  o flora can it be possible said ethel with a startled astonished look  possible  highly obvious and proper as it seems to me  the only doubt in my mind was whether it were not too obvious to happen  he is always coming in said ethel but i never thought it was really for that mischief  the children only laugh about it as the most preposterous thing they can think of for he never speaks to a woman if he can help it  that may not prevent him from wanting a good wife  wanting a wifeay as he would want a housekeeper just because he has got to the proper position for it but is he to go and get our bonny mary in that way just for an appendage to the mastership  well done old ethel  im glad to see you so like yourself  i remember when we thought mrs hoxtons position very sublime  i never thought of positions  never  i know that very well and i am not thinking of it now except as an adjunct to a very worthy man whom mary will admire to the depths of her honest heart and who will make her very happy  yes i suppose if she once begins to like him that he will said ethel slowly but i cant bring myself to swallow it yet  she has never given in to his being a bore but i thought that was her universal benevolence and he says less to her than to any one  depend upon it he thinks he is proceeding selon les regles  then he ought to be flogged  has he any business to think of my mary without falling redhot in love with her  why hector was regularly crazy that last halfyear and dear old polly is worth ever so much more than blanche  i must say you have fulfilled my desire of hearing you talk nonsense ethel  mary would never think of those transports  she deserves them all the more  well she is the party most concerned though she will be a cruel loss to all of us  she will not go far if  yes but she will be the worse loss  you simple ethel you dont think that charles cheviot will let her be the dear family fag we have always made of her  oh nothat always was wrong  and living close by she will not come on a visit all festal to resume home habits  no you must make up your mind ethelif as you say ifhe will be a man for monopolies and he will resent anything that he thinks management from you  i suspect it is a real sign of the love that you deny that he has ventured on the sister of a clever woman living close by and a good deal looked up to  flora flora you should not make one wicked  if she is to be happy why cant you let me rejoice freely and only have her drawn off from me bit by bit in the right way of nature  i did not tell you to make you dislike itof course not  only i thought that a little tact a little dexterity might prevent charles cheviot from being so much afraid of you as if he saw at once how really the head of the family you are  nonsense flora i am no such thing  if i am domineering the sooner any one sees it and takes me down the better  if this does come i will try to behave as i ought and not to mind so mary is happy but i cant act except just as the moment leads me  i hope it will soon be over now you have made me begin to believe in it i am afraid it will spoil harrys pleasure at home  poor dear harry what will he do  when does he come  any day now he could not quite tell when he could get away  when they came back and dr may ran out to say can you come in flora we want you the sisters doubted whether his excitement were due to the crisis or to the arrival  he hurried them into the study and shut the door exulting and perplexed  you girls leave one no rest he said  here i have had this young cheviot telling me that the object of his attentions has been apparent  im sure i did not know if it were mab or one of you  i thought he avoided all alike and poor mary was so taken by surprise that she will do nothing but cry and say no never and when i tell her she shall do as she pleases she cries the more or if i ask her if i am to say yes she goes into ecstasies of crying  i wish one of you would go up and see if you can do anything with her  is he about the house asked flora preparing to obey  noi was obliged to tell him that she must have time and he is gone home  i am glad he should have a little suspensehe seemed to make so certain of her  did he think he was making love all the time he was boring me with his gas in the dormitories  i hope she will serve him out  he will not be the worse for not being a ladys man said flora at the door  but in ten minutes flora returned with the same report of nothing but tears and she was obliged to leave the party to their perplexity and drive home while ethel went in her turn to use all manner of pleas to her sister to cheer up know her own mind and be sure that they only wished to guess what would make her happiest  to console or to scold were equally unsuccessful and after attempting all varieties of treatment bracing or tender ethel found that the only approach to calm was produced by the promise that she should be teased no more that evening but be left quite alone to recover and cool her burning eyes and aching head  so lighting her fire shaking up a muchneglected easychair bathing her eves desiring her not to come down to tea and engaging both that gertrude should not behold her and that papa would not be angry provided that she tried to know what she really wished and be wiser on the morrow ethel left her  the present concern was absolutely more to persuade her to give an answer of some sort than what that answer should be ethel would not wish dr may had very little doubt and gertrude from whom there was no concealing the state of affairs observed if she cries so much the first time she has to know her own mind it shows she cant do without some one to do it for her  the evening passed in expeditions of ethels to look after her patient and in desultory talk on all that was probable and improbable between dr may and the younger ones until just as ethel was coming down at nine oclock with the report that she had persuaded mary to go to bed she was startled by the street door being opened as far as the chain would allow and a voice calling i say is any one there to let me in  harry  o harry im coming and she had scarcely had time to shut the door previous to taking down the chain before the three others were in the hall the tumult of greetings breaking forth  but wheres polly he asked as soon as he was free to look round them all  going to bed with a bad headache was the answer with which daisy had sense enough not to interfere and the sailor had been brought into the drawingroom examined on his journey and offered supper before he returned to the charge  nothing really the matter with mary i hope  oh nonothing  cant i go up and see her  not just at present said ethel  i will see how she is when she is in bed but if she is going to sleep we had better not disturb her  harry thinks she must sleep better for the sight of him said the doctor but it is a melancholy businessharry your nose is out of joint  who is it said harry gravely  ah you have chosen a bad time to come home  we shall know no comfort till it is over  who cried harry no nonsense gertrude i cant stand guessing  this was directed to gertrude who was only offending by pursed lips and twinkling eyes because he could not fall foul of his father dr may took pity and answered at once  cheviot cried harry  excellent  he always did know how to get the best of everything  polly turning into a mrs hoxton  ha ha well that is a relief to my mind  you did look rather dismayed certainly  what were you afraid of  why when that poor young leonard wards business was in the papers a messmate of mine was asked if we were not all very much interested because of some attachment between some of us  i thought he must mean me or tom for i was tremendously smitten with that sweet pretty girl and i used to be awfully jealous of tom but when i heard of mary going to bed with a headache and that style of thing i began to doubt and i couldnt stand her taking up with such a dirty little nigger as henry ward was at school  i think you might have known mary better exclaimed gertrude  and its not tom either he asked  exactly the reverse laughed his father  well tom is a sly fellow and he had a knack of turning up whenever one wanted to do a civil thing by that poor girl  where is she now  at new york  theyd better take care how they send me to watch the yankees then  your passion does not alarm me greatly laughed the doctor  i dont think it ever equalled that for the reigning ship  i hope theres a vacancy in that department for the present and that we may have you at home a little  indeed sir im afraid not said harry  i saw captain gordon at portsmouth this morning and he tells me he is to go out in the clio to the pacific station and would apply for me as his first lieutenant if i liked to look up the islands again  so if you have any commissions for norman im your man  and how soon  uncertainbut cheviot and mary must settle their affairs in good time ive missed all the weddings in the family hitherto and wont be balked of pollys  i say ethel you cant mean me not to go and wish her joy  we are by no means come to joy yet said ethel poor mary is overset by the suddenness of the thing  why i thought it was all fixed  nothing less so said the doctor  one would think it was a naiad that had had an offer from the mountains next for she has been shedding a perfect river of tears ever since and all that the united discernment of the family has yet gathered is that she cries rather more when we tell her she is right to say no than when we tell her she is right to say yes  i declare ethel you must let me go up to her  but harry i promised she should hear no more about it tonight you must say nothing unless she begins  and thinking a quiet nights rest free from further excitement the best chance of a rational day ethel was glad that her mission resulted in the report far too nearly asleep to be disturbed but on the way up to bed soft as harrys footfalls always were a voice came down the stairs thats harry  oh come and with a face of triumph turned back to meet ethels glance of discomfited warning he bounded up to be met by mary in her dressinggown  o harry why didnt you come as she threw her arms round his neck  they wouldnt let me  i did think i heard you but when no one came i thought it was only richard till i heard the dear old step and then i knew  o harry and still she gasped with her head on his shoulder  they said you must be quiet  o harry did you hear  yes indeed holding her closer and heartily glad i am i know him as well as if i had sailed with him and i could not wish you in better hands  buto harry dear and there was a struggle with a sob between each word indeedi wontmind if you had rather not  do you mean that you dont like him  i should see him you know and perhaps he would not mindhe could always come and talk to papa in the evenings  and is that what you want to put a poor man off with mary  onlyonlyif you dont want me to  i not want you to  why mary isnt it the very best thing i could want for you  what are you thinking about  dont you remember when you came home after your wound you said ii mustnt and she fell into such a paroxysm of crying that he had quite to hold her up in his arms and though his voice was merry there was a moisture on his eyelashes  oh you polly  youre a caution against deluding the infant mind  was that all  was that what made you distract them all  why not have said so  oh never  they would have said you were foolish  as i was for not knowing that you wouldnt understand that i only meant you were to wait till the right one turned up  why if i had been at auckland would you have cried till i came home  oh im sorry i was silly  but im glad you didnt mean it dear harry squeezing him convulsively  there  and now youll sleep sound and meet them as fresh as a fair wind tomorrow  eh  only please tell papa im sorry i worried him  and how about somebody else mary whom youve kept on tenterhooks ever so long  are you sure he is not walking up and down under the limes on the brink of despair  oh do you think but he would not be so foolish  there now go to sleep  ill settle it all for you and i shant let any one say you are a goose but myself  only sleep and get those horrid red spots away from under your eyes or perhaps hell repent his bargain said harry kissing each red spot  promise youll go to bed the instant im gone  well said dr may looking out of his room i augur that the spirit of the flood has something to say to the spirit of the fell  i should think so  genuine articleno mistake  then what was all this about  all my fault  some rhodomontade of mine about not letting her marry had cast anchor in her dear little ridiculous heart and it is well i turned up before she had quite dissolved herself away  is that really all  the sum total of the whole as sure as said harry pausing for an asseveration and ending with as sure as your name is dick may whereat they both fell alaughing though they were hardly drops of laughter that harry brushed from the weathermarked pucker in the comer of his eyes and dr may gave a sigh of relief and said well thats right  wheres the latchkey  i must run down and put cheviot out of his misery  it is eleven oclock hell be gone to bed  then i would forbid the banns  where does he hang out  has he got into old hoxtons  no it is being revivified  he is at daviss lodgings  but i advise you not a little suspense will do him good  one would think you had never been in love said harry indignantly at least i cant sleep till ive shaken hands with the old fellow good night father  ill not be long  he kept his word and the same voice greeted him out of the dressingroom how was the spirit of the fell  sleepst thou brother  brother nay answered harry he was only looking over latin verses he always was a cool hand  the spirit of the felldr fell with a vengeance said dr may i say harry is this going to be a mere business transaction on his part  young folks have not a bit of romance in these days and one does not know where to have them but if i thought  you may be sure of him sir said harry speaking the more eagerly because he suspected the impression his own manner had made he is thoroughly worthy and feels marys merits pretty nearly as much as i do  more perhaps i ought to say  theres more warmth in him than shows  i dont know that norman ever could have gone through that terrible time after the accident but for the care he took of him and that little brother of his that sailed with me in the eurydice and died at singaporei know how he looked to his brother charles and i do assure you father you could not put the dear mary into safer sounder hands or where she could be more prized or happier he is coming up tomorrow morning and youll see he is in earnest in spite of all his set speeches  good night father i am glad to be in time for the last of my polly  this was almost the only moment at which harry betrayed a consciousness that his polly was less completely his own  and yet it seemed as if it must have been borne in on him again and again for mary awoke the next morning as thoroughly foolishly deeply in love as woman could be and went about comporting herself in the most comically commonplace style forgetting and neglecting everything not hearing nor seeing making absurd mistakes restless whenever mr cheviot was not present and then perfectly content if he came to sit by her as he always did for his courtshipnow it had fairly begunwas equally exclusive and determined  every day they walked or rode together almost every evening he came and sat by her and on each holiday they engrossed the drawingroom mary looking prettier than she had ever been seen before aubrey and gertrude both bored and critical harry treating the whole as a pantomime got up for his special delectation and never betokening any sense that mary was neglecting him  it was the greatest help to ethel in keeping up the like spirit under the same innocent unconscious neglect from the hitherto devoted mary who was only helpful in an occasional revival of mechanical instinct in lucid intervals and then could not be depended on  to laugh goodnaturedly and not bitterly to think the lovemaking pretty and not foolish to repress gertrudes saucy scorn instead of encouraging it would have been far harder without the bright face of the brother who generously surrendered instead of repining  she never told herself that there was no proportion between the trials not only because her spirits still suffered from the everpresent load of pity at her heart nor because the loss would be hourly to her but also because charles cheviot drew harry towards him but kept her at a distance or more truly laughed her down  she was used to be laughed at her ways had always been a matter of amusement to her brothers and perhaps it was the natural assumption of brotherhood to reply to any suggestion or remark of hers with something intended for drollery and followed with a laugh which instead of as usual stirring her up to goodhumoured repartee suppressed her and made her feel foolish and awkward  as to floras advice to behave with tact she could not if she would she would not if she could in principle she tried to acquiesce in a mans desire to show that he meant to have his wife to himself and in practice she accepted his extinguisher because she could not help it  mr cheviot was uneasy about the chances of aubreys success in the examination at woolwich and offered assistance in the final preparation but though aubrey willingly accepted the proposal two or three violent headaches from overstudy and anxiety made dr may insist on his old regimen of entire holiday and absence of work for the last week to secure which repose aubrey was sent to london with harry for a weeks idleness and the society of tom who professed to be too busy to come home even for christmas  mr cheviots opinion transpired through mary that it was throwing away aubreys only chance  in due time came the tidings that aubrey had the second largest number of marks and had been highly commended for the thoroughness of his knowledge so different from what had been only crammed for the occasion  he had been asked who had been his tutor and had answered his brother fully meaning to spare ethel publicity and she was genuinely thankful for having been shielded under toms six months of teaching  she heartily wished the same shield would have availed at home when charles cheviot gave that horrible laugh and asked her if she meant to stand for a professors chair  she faltered something about tom and mathematics  ay ay said charles and these military examinations are in nothing but foreign languages and trash and again he laughed his laugh and mary followed his example  ethel would fain have seen the fun  eh cheviot what two of a trade never agree asked dr may in high glory and glee  not my trade papa said ethel restored by his face and voice only the peculiarity of examiners so long ago remarked by norman of only setting questions that one can answer  not your trade but your amateur work said mr cheviot again exploding and leaving ethel to feel demolished  why she wondered presently had she not held up her knitting and merrily owned it for her tradewhy but because those laughs took away all merriment all presence of mind all but the endeavour not to be as cross as she felt was this systematic or was it only bad taste  the wedding was fixed for whitsuntide the repairs and drainage necessitating early and long holidays and the arrangements gave full occupation  mary was the first daughter who had needed a portion since mr cheviot was one of a large family and had little of his own dr may had inherited a fair private competence chiefly in land in and about the town and his professional gains under his wifes prudent management had been for the most part invested in the like property the chief of his accumulation of ready money had been made over to establish richard at cocksmoor and though living in an inexpensive style such as that none of the family knew what it was to find means lacking for aught that was right or reasonable there was no large amount of capital available  the may custom had always been that the physician should inherit the landed estate and though this was disproportionately increased by the doctors own acquisitions yet the hold it gave over the town was so important that he was unwilling it should be broken up at his death and wished to provide for his other children by charges on the rents instead of by sale and division  all this he caused richard to write to tom for though there was no absolute need of the young mans concurrence in arranging marys settlements it was a good opportunity for distinctly stating his prospects and a compliment to consult him  feeling that tom had thus been handsomely dealt with his letter to his father was the greater shock when after saying that he doubted whether he could come home for the wedding he expressed gratitude for the opening held out to him but begged that precedents applicable to very different circumstances might not be regarded as binding  he was distressed at supplanting richard and would greatly prefer the property taking its natural course  it would be so many years he trusted before there would be room for his services even as an assistant at stoneborough that he thought it would be far more advisable to seek some other field and his own desire would be at once to receive a younger sons share if it were but a few hundreds and be free to cut out his own line  what is he driving at ethel asked the doctor much vexed  i offer him what any lad should jump at and he only says give me the portion of goods that falleth to me  what does that mean  not prodigality said ethel  remember what sir matthew fleet said to dr spencerdicks ability and common sense besides  exactly what makes me suspicious of his coming the disinterested over me  theres something behind  he is running into debt and destruction among that precious crew about the hospitals  harry saw nothing wrong and thought his friends in good style  every one is in good style with harry happy fellow  he is no more a judge than a child of six years oldcarries too much sunshine to see shades  a lieutenant in the navy can hardly be the capital officer that our harry is without some knowledge of men and discipline  i grant you on his own element but on shore he goes about in his holiday spectacles and sees a bird of paradise in every cocksparrow  isnt there a glass house that can sometimes make a swan said ethel slyly touching her fathers spectacles but with you both theres always a something to attract the embellishing process and between harry and aubrey dr spencer and sir matthew we could hardly fail to have heard of anything amiss  i dont like it  then it is hard said ethel with spirit  so steady as he has always been he ought to have the benefit of a little trust  he was never like the others i dont know what to be at with him i should not have minded but for that palaver about elder brothers  defend as ethel might it was still with a misgiving lest disappointment should have taken a wrong course  it was hard to trust where correspondence was the merest business scrap and neither christmas nor the sisters marriage availed to call tom home and though she had few fears as to dissipation she did dread hardening and ambition all the more since she had learnt that sir matthew fleet was affording to him a patronage unprecedented from that quarter  no year of etheldred mays life had been so trying as this last  it seemed like her first step away from the aspirations of youth into the graver fears of womanhood  with all the selfrestraint that she had striven to exercise at coombe it had been a time of glorious dreams over the two young spirits who seemed to be growing up by her side to be faithful workers destined to carry out her highest visions and the boyish devotion of the one the fraternal reverence of the other had made her very happy  and now  the first disappointment in leonard had lednot indeed to less esteem for him but to that pitying veneration that could only be yielded by a sharing in spirit of the like martyrdom a continued thankfulness and admiration but a continual wringing of the heart  and her own child and pupil aubrey had turned aside from the highest path and in the unavowed consciousness that he was failing in the course he had so often traced out with her and that all her aid and ready participation in his present interests were but from her outward not her inward heart he had never argued the point with her never consulted her on his destination  he had talked only to his father of his alteration of purpose and had at least paid her the compliment of not trying to make her profess that she was gratified by the change  in minor matters he depended on her as much as ever but harry was naturally his chief companion and the prime of his full and perfect confidence had departed partly in the step from boy to man but more from the sense that he was not fulfilling the soldiership he had dreamt of with her and that he had once led her to think his talents otherwise dedicated  she had few fears for his steadiness but she had some for his health and he was something taken away from hera brightness had faded from his image  and this marriagewith every effort at rejoicing and certainty of marys present bliss and probability of future happiness it was the loss of a sister and not the gain of a brother and mr cheviot did his utmost to render the absence of repining a great effort of unselfishness  and even with her father her possession of toms halfrevealed secret seemed an impairing of absolute confidence she could not but hope that her father did her brother injustice and in her tenderness towards them both this was a new and painful sensation her manner was bright and quaint as ever her sayings perhaps less edged than usual because the pain at her heart made her guard her tongue but she had begun to feel middleaged and strangely lonely richard though always a comfort would not have entered into her troubles harry in his atmosphere of sailor on shore had nothing of the confidant and engrossed his father mary and aubrey were both gone from her and gertrude was still a child she had never so longed after margaret or norman  but at least her corner in the minster her table at home with her bible and prayerbook were still the same and witnessed many an outpouring of her anxiety many a confession of the words or gestures that she had felt to have been petulant whether others had so viewed them or not     chapter xix    long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wondered   lowly and meek in spirit and patiently suffering all things   fair was she and young but alas before her extended   dreary and vast and silent the desert of lifeevangeline                                                     longfellow   sister sister who is it  going to be married  oh do tell us cried ella wardenas she now was calledcapering round her elder sister who stood beneath a gasburner in a wellfurnished bedroom reading a letter its enclosure clasped within a very trembling hand  mary may dear mary answered averil still half absently  and who  mr cheviot said averil thoroughly rousing herself and with a quick movement concealing the enclosure in her bosom  i remember him he was very good when  and there she paused while ella chattered on oh sister if you were but at home you would be a bridesmaid now and perhaps we should little miss rivers was mrs ernescliffes bridesmaid  dont you remember minna how we saw her in her little cashmere cloak  oh dont ella escaped from minna like a cry of pain as she leant back in a rockingchair and recollected who had held her up in his arms to watch blanche mays wedding procession  and how soon will she be married sister and where will she live asked the muchexcited ella  she will be married in whitsun week and as he is headmaster they will live in dr hoxtons house  dear good mary how glad i am that she is so full of happinessher letter quite brims over with it  i wonder if i may work anything to send her  i should like to send her some very beautiful thing indeed cried ella with emphasis and eyes dilating at some visionary magnificence  ah i have nothing to send her but my love  and i may send her that still said minna looking up wistfully at averil who bent down and kissed her  and ave wont let me send mine to mr tom though im sure i do love him the best of them all said ella  that wasnt half whispered minna but turned her head away with a sigh of oppression and look of resignation sad in so young a child though indeed the infantine form was fast shooting into tall lank girlhood  ella went on i shall send him the objects for his microscope when i get into the country for i promised so sister cant prevent me  oh the countrywhen shall we go there sighed minna  your head aches tonight my dear said averil looking anxiously at her listless attitude halfopened eyes and the deep hollows above her collarbones  it always does after the gas is lighted said the child patiently it is always so hot here  it is just like being always in the conservatory at the grange added ella  i do hate this boardinghouse  it is very unkind of henry to keep us herefifteen weeks now  oh ella remonstrated minna you mustnt say that  but i shall say it retorted ella rosa willis says what she pleases and so shall i  i dont see the sense of being made a baby of when every one else of our age eats all they like and is consulted about arrangements and attends classes  and sister owns she does not know half so much as cora  this regular declaration of american independence confounded the two sisters and made averil recall the thoughts that had been wandering no ella in some things i have not learnt so much as cora but i believe i know enough to teach you and it has been a comfort to me to keep my two little sisters with me and not send them to be mixed up among strange girls  besides i have constantly hoped that our present way of life would soon be over and that we should have a home of our own again  and why cant we asked ella in a much more humble and subdued voice  because henry cannot hear of anything to do  he thought he should soon find an opening in this new country but there seem to be so many medical men everywhere that no one will employ or take into partnership a man that nothing is known about and he cannot produce any of his testimonials because they are all made out in his old name except one letter that dr may gave him  it is worse for henry than for us ella and all we can do for him is not to vex him with our grievances  poor averil her dejected patient voice sad soft eyes and gentle persuasive manner were greatly changed from those of the handsome accomplished girl who had come home to be the family pride and pet still more perhaps from the wilful mistress of the house and the wayward sufferer of last summer  and shant we go to live in the dear beautiful forest as cora muller wishes  there was a tap at the door and the childrens faces brightened though a shade passed over averils face as if everything at that moment were oppressive but she recovered a smile of greeting for the pretty creature who flew up to her with a fervent embracea girl a few years her junior with a fair delicate face and figure in a hothouse rose style of beauty  fathers come she cried  how glad you must be  and now whispered the children we shall know about going to indiana  he says mordaunt is as tall as he is and that the house is quite fixed for me but i told him i must have one more term and then i will take you with me  ah i am glad to see the children in white if you would only change that plain black silk you would receive so much more consideration  i dont want it cora thank you said averil indifferently and indeed the simple mourning she still wore was a contrast to her friends delicate expensive silk  but i want it for you pleaded cora  i dont want to hear my averil censured for english hauteur and offend my countrys feelings so that she keeps herself from seeing the best side  i see a very good very dear side of one said averil pressing the eager hand that was held out to her and that is enough for me  i was not a favourite in my own town and i have not spirits to make friends here  ah you will have spirits in our woods she said  you shall show me how you go gipsying in england  the dear dear woods  oh we must go cried the little girls  but it is going to be a town said minna gravely  cora laughed  ah there will be plenty of bush this many a day minna  no lack of butternuts and hickories i promise you nor of maples to paint the woods gloriously  you have never been there said averil anxiously  no i have been boarding here these two years since father and brothers located there but we had such a good time when we lived at my grandfathers farm in ohio while father was off on the railway business  a gong resounded through the house and averil suppressing a disappointed sigh allowed cora to take possession of her arm and followed by the two children became parts of a cataract of people who descended the great staircase and flowed into a saloon where the dinner was prepared  henry with a tall thin wirylooking gentleman was entering at the same time and averil found herself shaking hands with her brothers companion and hearing him say good evening miss warden im glad to meet my daughters friend  i hope you feel at home in our great country  it was so exactly the ordinary secondrate american style that averil who had expected something more in accordance with the refinement of everything about cora except a few of her tones was a little disappointed and responded with difficulty then while mr muller greeted her sisters she hastily laid her hand on henrys arm and said under her breath ive a letter from him  hush henry looked about with a startled eye and repressing gesture averil drew back and one hand on her bosom pressing the letter and almost holding down a sob she took her accustomed seat at the meal minna too languid for the rapidity of the movements hardly made the exertion of tasting food  ella alert and brisk took care of herself as effectually as did rosa willis on the opposite side of the table averil all one throb of agitation with the unread letter lying at her heart directed all her efforts to look eat and drink as usual happily talking was the last thing that was needed  averil had been greatly indebted to miss muller who had taken pity on the helpless strangersinterested partly by her own romance about england partly by their mourning dresses dark melancholy eyes and retiring bewildered manner  a beautiful motherless girl under seventeenleft to all intents and purposes alone in new yorkattending a great educational establishment far more independent and irresponsible than a young man at an english university yet perfectly trustworthynever subject to the bevues of the unprotected female but selfreliant modest and graceful in the heterogeneous society of the boardinghouseshe was a constant marvel to averil and a warm friendship soon sprang up  the advances were indeed all on one side for ave was too sad and oppressed with too heavy a secret to be readily accessible but there was an attraction to the younger fresher freer nature even in the mystery of her mournful reserve and the two drew nearer together from gratitude and many congenial feelings that rendered cora the one element of comfort in the boardinghouse life while henry in vain sought for occupation  cora had been left under the charge of the lady of the boardinghouse a distant connection while her father who had been engaged in more various professions than averil could ever conceive of or remember had been founding a new city in indiana at once as farmer and landagent and he had stolen a little time in the dead season to hurry up to new york partly on business and partly to see his daughter who had communicated to him her earnest desire that her new friends might be induced to settle near their future abode  american meals were too serious affairs for conversation but such as there was was political in all the fervid heat of the first commencements of disunion and threatenings of civil war  after the ladies had repaired to their saloon with its grand ottomans sofas rockingchairs and piano the discussion continued among them cora talking with the utmost eagerness of the tariff and of slavery and the other topics of the day intensely interesting and of terrible moment to her country but that country averil had not yet learnt to feel her own and to her all was one dreary whirl of words in which she longed to escape to her room and read her letter  ella had joined rosa willis and the other children but minna as usual kept under her sisters wing and averil could not bear to shake herself free of the gentle child  the ladies of the boardinghousesome resident in order to avoid the arduous duties of housekeeping others temporarily brought thither in an interregnum of servants others spending a winter in the cityhad grown tired of asking questions that met with the scantiest response took melancholy for disdain and were all neglectful some uncivil to the grave silent english girl and she was sitting alone with minnas hand in hers as she had sat for many a weary evening when her brother and mr muller came up together and sitting down on either side of her began to talk of the rising city of massissaugaadmirably situatedexcellent water privilege communicating with lake michiganglorious primeval foresthealthy situationfertile landwhere a colossal fortune might be realized in maize eighties sections speculations  it was all addressed to her and it was a hard task to give attention so as to return a rational answer while her soul would fain have been clairvoyante to read the letter in her breast  she did perceive at last though not till long after the children had gone to bed that the project was that the family should become the purchasers of shares which would give them a right to a portion of the soil excellent at present for growing corn and certain hereafter to be multiplied in value for building that henry might in the meantime find an opening for practice but might speedily be independent of it  it sounded promising and it was escapeescape from forced inaction from an uncongenial life from injury to the children and it would be with cora her one friend what was the demur and why were they consulting her who as henry knew was ready to follow him wherever he chose to carry her  at last came a gleam of understanding then doctor you will talk it over with your sister and give me your ultimatum and therewith mr muller walked away to mingle in other conversation and henry coming closer to his sister she again eagerly said i have it here you shall see it tomorrow when i have read it  it  the letter  how can you be so unguarded  you have not let the children know take care then i will not have the subject revived with them  but minna  it is this heated stove atmosphere  she will soon forget if you dont keep it up and she will be herself when we leave this place and it depends on you when we do that ave  on me she said with bewildered face  and henry marvelling at her slowness of comprehension made her understand that the advance of money for the purchase at massissauga must come from her means  his own had been heavily drained by the removal the long period of inaction and moreover what remained had been embarked in shares in a company absolutely certain to succeed but where they were not at once available for sale  averil was now of age her property was in her own power and could not her brother assured her be better invested than on ground certain to increase in value  she looked at him confused and distressed aware that it was too important a step to be taken without consideration yet unable to compose her thoughts or recollect objections  must i answer tonight she said  no there is no need for that  but we must close tomorrow with muller for it is not a chance that will long go begging  then let me go please henry she said imploringly  i will tell you tomorrow but i cant now  i dont seem to understand anything  it was late and he released her with a kind good night though still with a sign of caution  cora however hastened to join her and walk up the stairs with her eagerly inquiring into the success of the negotiation and detailing what she had gathered from her father as to the improvements he had been making  she would fain have made averil come into her bedroom to build castles there but this was more than could be borne and breaking from her at last averil reached her own room not to think of mr mullers project but to cast an anxious glance at each of the little beds to judge whether the moment had come when that famishing hunger might be appeased by the crumb which for these mortal hours had lain upon her craving heartthe very first since the one on the arrival at milbank  each brown head was shrouded in the coverings the long dark fringes rested safely on the cheeks and averil at length drew out the treasure and laid it on her hand to dwell on its very sight  the address needed to be looked at with lingering earnestness as if it had indeed been a missive from another world she looked and was tardy to unfold it as though now the moment was come the sense of being in communication with her brother must be tasted to the utmost ere entering on the utterances that must give pain and when she did open the envelope perhaps the first sensation was disappointmentthe lines were not near enough together the writing not small enough to satisfy even the first glance of the yearning eye  it was cheerful it spoke of good health and full occupation with the use of books daily exercise the chaplains visits schooling and attendance at chapel and of the great pleasure of having heard from her  and that good dr may inclosed your letter in one written to me with his own hand a kindness i never dared to think of as possible but which he promises to repeat  your letter and his are the continual food of my thoughts and are valued beyond all power of words  i only hope you knew that i have not been allowed to write sooner and have not expected letters then came a few brief comments on her last inquiries and entreaties that she would give him full information of all details of their present life it will carry me along with you and i shall live with you both as i read and as i dwell on it afterwards  do not indulge in a moments uneasiness about me for i am well and busy every one is as kind to me as duty permits and dr may is always ready to do all in his power for me  there were a few affectionate words for henry and i long to send a message to the children but i know it is better for them to let me drop from their minds only you must tell me all about them i want to know that the dear little minna is bright and happy again  no confidences only generalities not even any reference to the one unbroken bond of union the one support except in the three scanty final words the simplest of blessings  it was not satisfying but averil recalled with a start that no wonder the letter was meagre since it was necessarily subject to inspection and how could the inner soul be expressed when all must pass under strangers eyes who would think such feelings plausible hypocrisy in a convicted felon again she took it up to suck to the utmost all that might be conveyed in the short commonplace sentences and to gaze at them as if intensity of study could reveal whether the cheerfulness were real or only assumed be they what they might the words had only three weeks back been formed by leonards hand and she pressed her lips upon them in a fervent agony of affection  when she roused herself and turned her head she perceived on minnas pillow two eyes above the bedclothes intently fixed on her  should she see or should she not see  she believed that the loving heart was suffering a cruel wrong she yearned to share all with the child but she was chained by the command of one brother and by that acquiescence of the other which to her was more than a command  she would not see she turned away and made her preparations for the night without betraying that she knew that the little one was awake resuming the tedious guard on the expression of her face  but when her long kneeling had ended and with it that which was scarcely so much conscious intercession as the resting an intolerable load on one who alone knew its weight just as she darkened the room for the night the low voice whispered ave is it  and averil crept up to the little bed yes minna he is well  he hopes you are bright and happy but he says it is best you should forget him  the brow was cold and clammy the little frame chill and trembling the arms clasped her neck convulsively  she lifted the child into her own bed pressed tight to her own bosom and though no other word passed between the sisters that contact seemed to soothe away the worst bitterness and averil slept from the stillness enforced on her by the heed of not disturbing minnas sleep  little that night had she recked of the plan needing so much deliberation  when she awoke it was to the consciousness that besides the arrival of leonards letter something had happenedthere was some perplexitywhat was it  and when it came back she was bewildered her own fortune had always appeared to her something to fall back on in case of want of success and to expend it thus was binding the whole family down at a perilous moment to judge by the rumours of battle and resistance  and all she had ever heard at home much that she daily heard at new york inclined her to distrust and dislike of american speculations  it was coras father  her heart smote her for including him in english prejudice when henry liked and trusted him  and she had disobeyed and struggled against henry too long  she had promised to be submissive and yielding  but was this the time  and the boardinghouse lifeproverbially the worst for childrenwas fast americanizing ella while minna drooped like a snowdrop in a hothouse and idleness might be mischievous to henry  oh for some one to consult for some one to tell her whether the risk was a foolish venture or if the terms were safe  but not a creature did she know well enough to seek advice from  even the clergyman whose church she attended was personally unknown to her cora muller was her sole intimate there was a mutual repulsion between her and the other ladies and still more with the gentlemen a boardinghouse was not the scene in which to find such as would inspire confidence and they had no introductions  there was no one to turn to and in the dreary indifference that had grown over her she did not even feel capable of exerting her own judgment to the utmost even if she had been able to gather certain facts or to know prudent caution from blind prejudiceoften womans grievous difficulty  what could a helpless girl of oneandtwenty in a land of strangers do but try to think that by laying aside the use of her own judgment she was trusting all to providence and that by leaving all to her brother she was proving her repentance for her former conduct  there too were her sisters clamorous with hopes of the forest life and there was cora urging the scheme with all the fervour of girlish friendship and in herself no small element in its favour engaging for everything adducing precedents for every kind of comfort and success and making aves consent a test of her love one question averil asked of herwhether they should be utterly out of reach of their church cora herself had been bred up to liberal religious ways and was ready to attend whatever denomination of public worship came first to hand though that which had descended from the pilgrim fathers came most naturally  she had been at various sunday schools and was a good conscientious girl but had never gone through the process of conversion so that rosa willis had horrified ella by pronouncing her not a christian  she had no objection to show her english friends the way to the favourite episcopal church especially as it was esteemed fashionable and her passion for averil had retained her there with growing interest drawn on by averils greater precision of religious knowledge and the beauty of the church system displayed to her as the one joy and relief left to one evidently crushed with suffering  the use of averils books conversations with her and the teaching she heard disposed her more and more to profess herself a member of the episcopal church and she was unable to enter into averils scruples at leading her to so decided a step without her fathers sanction father would be satisfied whatever profession she made  did people in england try to force their childrens consciences  cora at averils desire ascertained that massissauga had as yet no place of worship of its own but there was a choice of chapels within a circuit of five miles and an episcopal church seven miles off at the chief town of the county  moreover her father declared that the city of massissauga would soon be considerable enough to invite every variety of minister to please every denomination of inhabitant averil felt that the seven miles off church was all she could reasonably hope for and her mind was clear on that score when henry came to take her out walking for the sake of being able to talk more freely  no longer afraid of being overheard he gave kind attention to leonards letter and though he turned away from the subject sooner than she wished she was not exacting  again he laid before her the advantages of their migration and assured her that if there were the slightest risk he would be the last to make the proposal  she asked if it were safe to invest money in a country apparently on the eve of civil war  he laughed the idea to scorn  how could the rebel states make war with a population of negroes sure to rise against their masters where should their forces come from  faction would soon be put down and the union be stronger than ever  it was what averil had been hearing morning noon and night so no wonder she believed it and was ashamed of a futile girlish fear  and was henry sure it was a healthy place  had she not heard of feverish swamps in indiana  oh yes in new unsettled places but there had hardly been an ailment in the muller family since they had settled at massissauga  and averils last murmur wascould he find out anything about other peoples opinion of the speculation did they know enough about mr muller to trust themselves entirely in his hands  henry was almost angrycould not his sister trust him to take all reasonable precaution  it was the old story of prejudice against whatever he took up  poor averil was disarmed directly  the combats of will and their consequences rose up before her and with them leonards charges to devote herself to henry  she could but avow herself willing to do whatever he pleased  she only hoped he would be careful  all thenceforth was pleasant anticipation and hope  averils property had to be transferred to america and invested in shares of the land at massissauga but this was to cause no delay in arranging for the removal they were only to wait until the winter had broken up and the roads become passable after the melting of the snows and meantime mr muller was to have their house prepared  cora would remain and accompany them and in the intervening time promised to assist averil with her judgment in making the necessary purchases for stepping westward  when averil wrote their plans to her english friends she felt the difficulty of pleading for them  she was sensible that at stoneborough the risking of her property would be regarded as folly on her part and something worse on that of her brother and she therefore wrote with every effort to make the whole appear her own voluntary actthough the very effort made her doubly conscious that the sole cause for her passive acquiescence was that her past selfwill in trifles had left her no power to contend for her own opinion in greater mattersthe common retribution on an opinionative woman of principle  moreover it was always with an effort that she wrote to mary may  a rejected offer from a brother is a rock in a correspondence with a sister and averil had begun to feel greatly ashamed of the manner of her own response  acceptance would have been impossible but irritating as had been tom mays behaviour insulting as had been his explanation and provoking his pertinacity she had begun to feel that the impulse had been too generous and disinterested to deserve such treatment and that bitterness and illtemper had made her lose all softness and dignity so that he must think that his pitying affection had been bestowed on an ungrateful vixen and be as much disgusted with the interview as she was herself  she did not wish him to love her but she regretted the form of the antidote above all since he was of the few who appreciated leonard and the more she heard of ellas narrations of his kindness the more ashamed she grew  every letter to or from mary renewed the uncomfortable sense and she would have dropped the correspondence had it not been her sole medium of communication with her imprisoned brother since henry would not permit letters to be posted with the milbank address     chapter xx    a little hint to solace woe   a hint a whisper breathing low   i may not speak of what i knowtennyson   at the pace at which rapid people walk alone when they wish to devour both the way and their own sensations ethel may was mounting the hill out of the town in the premature heat assumed by may in compliment to whitsun week when a prolonged shout made her turn  at first she thought it was her father but her glass showed her that it was the brother so like him in figure that the londonmade coat and the hair partaking of the sand instead of the salt were often said to be the chief distinction  moreover the dainty steps over the puddles were little like the strides of the doctor and left no doubt that it was the one wedding guest who had been despaired of  o tom i am glad you are come  what a rate you were running away at  i thought you had done with your hurricane pace  hurricane because of desperate hurry  im afraid i cant turn back with you  where is all the world  blanche is helping mary arrange the hoxtoni mean her own drawingroom  hector has brought a dogcart to drive papa about in daisy is gone with harry and aubrey to the grange for some camellias  and ethel rushing to cocksmoor  i cant help it tom she said humbly i wish i could  whats this immense pannier you are carrying  it is quite light  it is twelve of the hats for the children tomorrow  mary was bent on trimming them all as usual and i was deluded enough to believe she would till last evening i found just one and a half done  i did as many as i could at night till papa heard me rustling about and thumped  those went early this morning and these are the rest which i have just finished  was there no one to send  my dear tom is your experience of weddings so slight as to suppose there is an available being in the family the day before  im sure i dont desire such experience  why could not they be content without ferreting me down  i am very glad you have come  it would have been a great mortification if you had stayed away  i never quite believed you would  i had much rather see the operation i shall miss tomorrow morning i shall go back by the two oclock train  to study their happiness all the way up to town  then by the mail  i wont torment you to stay but i think papa will want a talk with you  the very thing i dont want  why cant he dispose of his property like other people and give richard his rights  you know richard would only be encumbered  no such thing richard is a reasonable beinghe will marry some of these daysget the living after wilmot and  but you know how papa would be grieved to separate the practice from the house  because he and his fathers were content to bury themselves in a hole he expects me to do the same  why what should i do  the place is overdoctored already  every third person is a pet patient sending for him for a gnatbite gratis taking the bread out of wrights mouth no wonder henry ward kicked  if i came here i must practise on the lapdogs  heres my father stronger than any of us with fifteen good years work in him at the least  he would be wretched at giving up to me a tenth part of his lambs and that tenth would keep us always in hot water  his oldworld practice would not go down with me and he would think everything murder that was fresher than the year 1830  i thought he was remarkable for having gone on with the world said ethel repressing some indignation  so he has in a way but always against the grain  he has a tough lot of prejudices and you may depend upon it they would be more obstinate against me than any one else and i should be looked on as an undutiful dog for questioning them besides getting the whole credit of every case that went wrong  i think you are unjust said ethel flushing with displeasure  i wish i were not ethel but when there is one son in a family who can do nothing that is not taken amiss it is hard that he should be the one picked out to be pinned down and maybe goaded into doing something to be really sorry for  there was truth enough in this to seal ethels lips from replying that it was toms own fault since his whole nature and constitution were far more the cause than his conduct and she answered you might get some appointment for the present till he really wants you  to be ordered home just as i am making something of it and see as many cases in ten years as i could in a month in town  things are altered since his time if he could only see it  what was the use of giving me a firstrate education if he meant to stick me down here  at least i hope you will think long before you inflict the cruel disappointment of knowing that not one of his five sons will succeed to the old practice  the throne you mean ethel  pish  the pish was as injurious to her hereditary love for the old practice and for the old town as to her reverence for her father one angry tom burst from her lips and only the experience that scolding made him worse restrained her from desiring him to turn back if this was the best he had to say  indeed she wondered to find him still by her side holding the gate of the plantation open for her  he peered under her hat as she went through  how hot you look he said laying hold of the handles of the basket  thank you but it is more cumbrous than heavy she said not letting go it is not that  an elision which answered better than words to show that his speech rather than hill or load had made her cheeks flame but he only drew the great basket more decisively from her hand put his stick into the handle and threw it over his shoulder and no doubt it was a much greater act of goodnature from him than it would have been from richard or harry  this path always reminds me of this very matter he said i talked it over with meta here on the way to lay the foundationstone at cocksmoor till norman overtook us and monopolized her for good poor little thing  she was all in the high romantic strain making a sort of knight hospitaller of my father  i wonder what she is like by this time and how much of that she has left  of the high romantic strain  i should think it was as much as ever the salt of life to her  her last letter described her contrivances to make a knapsack for norman on his visitation tour  oh fancy old june a venerable archdeacon  you dont think a colonial archdeacon is like one of your great portly swells in a shovel hat  it must be something remarkable that made norman portly  but as for the shovel hat mrs meta has insisted on having it sent out  i was going to tell you that she says i do like such a good tough bit of stitchery to fit my knight out for the cause  marriage and distance have not frozen up her effusions  no when people carry souls in their pens they are worth a great deal more if they are to go to a distance  ah by the bye i suppose cheviot has put a fresh lock on marys writingcase  i suspect some of marys correspondence will devolve on me  harry has asked me already  i wished you had mentioned more about the letters of late  leonard wanted to know more than i could tell him  you dont mean that you have seen him  o tom how kind of you papa has been trying hard to get a day now that these first six months are up but there are two or three cases that wanted so much watching that he has not been able to stir  i know how he lets himself be made a prisoner and that it was a chance whether any one saw the poor fellow at all  i am so gladand ethel turned on him a face still flushed but now with gratitude  how was he looking  the costume is not becoming and he has lost colour and grown holloweyed but i saw no reason for being uneasy about him he looked clear and in health and has not got to slouch yet  it is shocking to see such a grand face and head behind a grating  could he talk  why the presence of a warder is against conversation and six months of shoemaking in a cell does not give much range of ideas there was nothing to be done but to talk on right ahead and judge by his eyes if he liked it  i suppose you could find out nothing about himself  he said he got on very well but one does not know that means  i asked if he got books and he said there was a very good library and he could get what gave him something to think of and he says they give interesting lectures in school  you could not gather what is thought of him  no i saw but a couple of officers of the place and could only get out of them good health and good conduct  i do not expect even his conduct makes much impression as to his innocence for i saw it stated the other day that the worst prisoners are those that are always getting convicted for petty offences those that have committed one great crime are not so depraved and are much more amenable  however he has only three months more at pentonville and then he will go to portland chatham or gibraltar  oh i hope it will not be gibraltar  but at least that terrible solitude will be over  at any rate his spirit is not broken  i could see his eye light up after i had talked a little while and he fell into his natural tone again  he would not try to put out his hand to me when he came down but when i went away he put it through and we had a good hearty shake somehow it made one feel quite small  ethel could have pledged herself for the soundness of toms nature after those words but all she did was in an unwonted tone to utter the unwonted exclamationdear tom  if my father does not come up i shall see him once more before he leaves pentonville added tom and so you must mind and let me know all about his people in america  i found he had no notion of the row that is beginning there so i said not a word of it  but what is all this about going to indiana  they are going at the end of april to settle in a place called massissauga where henry is to farm till practice comes to him  it is towards the north of the state in the county of pulaski  ay in one of the pestilential swamps that run up out of lake michigan  all the fertile ground there breeds as many fevers and agues as it does stalks of corn  indeed how did you hear that  i looked up the place after leonard told me of it  it is as unlucky a location as the ill luck of that fellow henry could have pitched on some friend leonard spoke ofa yankee i suppose meaning to make a prey of them  the father of their young lady friend at the boardinghouse  oh a yankee edition of mrs pugh  and the worst of it is that this is to be done with poor averils fortune  she has written to mr bramshaw to sell out for her and send her the amount and he is terribly vexed but she is of age and there are no trustees nor any one to stop it  all of a piece muttered tom then presently he swung the basket round on the ground with a vehement exclamationif any man on this earth deserved to be among the robbers and murderers i know who it is  then he shouldered his load again and walked on in silence by his sisters side to the school door  richard had been obliged to go to a benefit club entertainment and ethel knowing the limited literary resources of the parsonage was surprised to find tom still waiting for her when the distribution and fitting of the blueribboned hats was over and matters arranged for the march of the children to see the wedding and to dine afterwards at the grammarschool hall  o tom i did not expect to find you here  it is not fit for you to be walking about alone on a whit monday  i am very glad to have you but i am past that  dont talk nonsense girls are girls till long past your age said tom  it is not so much age as living past things said ethel  it was not only that added tom but ive more to say to you while one can be sure of a quiet moment  have you heard anything about that place and he pointed in the direction of the vintry mill  i heard something of an intention to part with it and have been watching for an advertisement but i can see none in the courant or on the walls  mind he does not slip off unawares  i dont know what to do now that old hardy is cut off from us  i tried to stir up dr spencer to go and investigate but i could not tell him why and he has not the same interest in going questing about as he used to have  people never will do the one thing one wants particularly  toms look and gesture made her ask if he knew of anything wrong with their old friend and in return she was told that dr spencers recent visit to london had been to consult sir matthew fleet  the foundations of mortal disease had been laid in india and though it might long remain in abeyance there were from time to time symptoms of activity and tedious lingering infirmity was likely to commence long before the end  and what do you think the strange old fellow charged me as we walked away from dining at fleets  secrecy of course returned the muchshocked ethel  one does keep a secret by telling you  it was to have my eye on some lodging with a decent landlady where when it is coming to that he can go up to be alone out of the way of troubling dick and of all of you  tom how dreadful  i fancy it is something of the animal instinct of creeping away alone and partly his law to himself not to trouble dick  an odd idea of what would trouble dick  so i told him but he said after seeing what it cost my father to watch dear margarets long decay he would never entail the like on him  it is queer and it is beautiful the tender way he has about my father treating him like a pet to be shielded and guardeda man that has five times the force and vigour of body and mind that he has now whatever they may have been  very beautiful and i cannot help telling you how beautiful said ethel greatly moved only remember it is not to be mentioned  ha did he ever make you an offer  i have sometimes suspected it  no indeed  it was muchmuch more beautiful than that  our mother then  i had thought of that too and it accounts for his having always taken to you the most of us  why im the least like her of us all  so they say i know and i cant recollect enough to judge except thatand toms voice was less clear for a momentthere was something in being with her that ive never found again except now and then with you ethel  well he never got over it i suppose  and ethel briefly told of the rash resolution the unsettled life the neglect of the fathers wishes the grievous remorse the broken health and restless aimless wanderings ending at last in loving tendance of the bereaved rival  it had been a life never wanting in generosity or benevolence yet falling far short of what it might have beena gallant voyage made by a wreckand yet the injury had been less from the disappointment than from the manner of bearing it suddenly it struck her that tom might suspect her of intending a personal application of the history and she faltered but he kept her to it by his warm interest and many questions  and oh tom he must not be allowed to go away in this manner nothing would so cut papa to the heart  i dont believe he ever will ethel  he may go on for years as he is and he said in the midst that he meant to live to carry out the drainage  besides if it comes gradually on him he may feel dependent and lose the energy to move  oh what a sorrow for papa  but i know that not to watch over him would make it all the worse  they walked on gravely till on the top of the hill tom exclaimed theyve mounted the flag on the minster steeple already  it went up yesterday for harvey anderson and mrs pugh  there was a proposal to join forces and have a double weddingso interesting the two schoolfellows and two young friends  the cheviot girls much regretted it was not to be  cheviot girls  heavens and earth  at home  not sleeping but we shall have them all day tomorrow for they cannot get home the same day by setting off after the wedding  there will be no one else for even our own people are going for harry is to go to maplewood with blanche and aubrey has to be at woolwich but we shall all be at home tonight  last time was in the volunteer days two or three centuries ago  it was strange how with this naturally least congenial of all the family ethel had a certain understanding and fellowfeeling that gave her a sense of rest and relief in his company only impaired by the dread of rubs between him and his father  none however happened dr may had been too much hurt to press the question of the inheritance and took little notice of tom being much occupied with the final business about the wedding and engrossed by hector and harry who always absorbed him in their short intervals of his company  tom went to see dr spencer and brought him in so cheerful and full of life that what ethel had been hearing seemed like a dream excepting when she recognized toms unobtrusive gentleness and attention towards him  she was surprised and touched through all the harass and hurry of that evening and morning to find the must be dones that had of late devolved on her alone now lightened and aided by tom who appeared to have come for the sole purpose of being always ready to give a helping hand where she wanted it with all richards manual dexterity and more resource and quickness  the refreshment of spirits was the more valuable as this was a very unexciting wedding even gertrude not yet fourteen had been surfeited with weddings and replied to harrys old wit of three times a bridesmaid and never a bride that she hoped so her experience of married life was extremely flat and a glance at blanches monotonous dignity and floras worn face showed what that experience was  harry was the only one to whom there was the freshness of novelty and he was the great element of animation but as the time came near honest harry had been seized with a mortal dread of the tears he imagined an indispensable adjunct of the ceremony and went about privately consulting every one how much weeping was inevitable flora told him she saw no reason for any tears and ethel that when people felt very much they couldnt cry but on the other hand blanche said she felt extremely nervous and knew she should be overcome gertrude assured him that on all former occasions mary did all the crying herself and aubrey told him that each bridesmaid carried six handkerchiefs half for herself and half for the bride  the result was that the last speech made by harry to his favourite sister in her maiden days was thuswell mary you do look uncommonly nice and pretty but nowmost persuasivelyyoull be a good girl and not cry will you and as mary fluttered tried to smile and looked out through very moist eyes he continued i feel horribly softhearted today and if you howl i must you know so mind if i see you beginning i shall come out with my fathers old story of the spirit of the flood and the spirit of the fell and that will stop it if anything can  the comicality of harrys alarm was nearly enough to stop it coupled with the great desire of daisy that he should be betrayed into tears and mary did behave extremely well and looked all that a bride should look  admirable daughter and sister she would be still more in her place as wife hers was the truly feminine nature that happily for mankind is the most commonplace and that she was a thoroughly generic bride is perhaps a testimony to her perfection in the part as in all others where quiet unselfish womanhood was the essential  never had she been so sweet in every tone word and caress never had ethel so fully felt how much she loved her or how entirely they had been one from a time almost too far back for memory  there had not been intellectual equality but perhaps it was better fuller affection than if there had been for mary had filled up a part that had been in some measure wanting in ethel  she had been a sort of wife to her sister and thus was the better prepared for her new life but was all the sorer loss at home  the bridegroom  how many times had ethel to remind herself of her esteem and security of marys happiness besides frowning down gertrudes saucy comments and trying to laugh away toms low growl that good things always fell to the share of poor hearts and narrow minds  mr cheviot did in fact cut a worse figure than george rivers of old having a great fund of natural bashfulness and selfconsciousness which did not much damage his dignity but made his attempts at gaiety and ease extremely awkward not to say sheepish perhaps the most trying moment was the last when hearing a few words between ethel and mary about posting a mere scrap if only an empty envelope from the first restingplace he turned round with his laugh to object to rash promises and remind his dear sister ethel that postoffices were not always near at hand  after that when mary in her bright tenderness hung round her sister it was as if that was the last fond grasp from the substanceas if only the shadow would come back and live in minster street  perhaps it was because ethel had tried to rule it otherwise mr cheviot had insisted that the cocksmoor childrens share in the festivity should be a dinner in the whichcote hall early in the day after which they had to be sent home since no one chose to have the responsibility of turning them loose to play in the grammarschool precincts even in the absence of the boys  richard was much afraid of their getting into mischief and was off immediately after church to superintend the dinner and marshal them home and the rest of the world lost the resource that entertaining them generally afforded the survivors after a marriage and which was specially needed with the two cheviot sisters to be disposed of  by the time the riverses were gone home and the ernescliffes and harry off by the train there were still four mortal hours of daylight and oh for marys power of making every one happy  caroline and annie cheviot were ladylike nicelooking girls but when they found no croquet mallets in the garden they seemed at a loss what life had to offer at stoneborough  gertrude pronounced that she played at it sometimes at maplewood where she had nothing better to do and then retreated to her own devices  ethels heart sank both with dread of the afternoon and with selfreproach at her spoilt childs discourtesy whence she knew there would be no rousing her without an incapacitating discussion and on she wandered in the garden with the guests receiving instruction where the hoops might be planted and hearing how nice it would be for her sister to have such an object such a pleasant opportunity of meeting ones friendsan interest for every day  no wonder they think i want an object in life thought ethel how awfully tiresome i must be  poor things what can i say to make it pleasanterdo you know this dielytra  i think it is the prettiest of modern flowers but i wish we might call it japan fumitory or by some english name  i used to garden once but we have no flowerbeds now they spoilt the lawn for croquet  and here comes tom thought ethel poor tom he will certainly be off to london this evening  tom however joined the listless promenade and the first time croquet was again mentioned observed that he had seen the andersons knocking about the balls in the new gardens by the river and proposed to go down and try to get up a match  there was an instant brightening and tom stepped into the drawingroom and told daisy to come with them  to play at croquet with the andersons in the teagardens she exclaimed  no i thank you thomas  he laid his hand on her shouldergertrude he said it is time to have done being a spoilt baby  if you let ethel fag herself ill you will rue it all your life  frightened but without clear comprehension she turned two scared eyes on him and replaced the hat that she had thrown on the table just as ethel and the others came in  not you ethel said tom you dont know the game  i can learn said ethel desperately bent on her duty  we would teach you volunteered the cheviots  you would not undertake it if you knew better said tom smiling ethels hands are not her strong point  ethel would just have to be croqued all through by her partner said gertrude  besides my father will be coming in and wanting you added tom he is only at the hospital or somewhere about the town  ill look after this child  and the two sisters delighted that poor little gertrude should have such a holiday treat as croquet in the public gardens away from her governess elder sister walked off glorious while ethel breathing forth a heavy sigh let herself sink into a chair feeling as if the silence were in itself invaluable and as if tom could not be enough thanked for having gained it for her  she was first roused by the inquiry shall i take in this letter maam it is charged four shillings overweight  and it is for mr thomas maam impressively concluded the parlourmaid as one penetrated by mr thomass regard to small economies  ethel beheld a letter bloated beyond the capacities of the two bewigged washingtons that kept guard in its corner and addressed in a cramped hand unknown to her but while she hesitated her eye fell on another american letter directed to miss mary may in averil wards wellknown writing and turning both round she found they had the same postmark and thereupon paid the extra charge and placed the letter where tom was most likely to light naturally on it without public comment  the other letter renewed the pang at common property being at an end  no mab she said taking the little dog into her lap we shall none of us hear a bit of it  but at least it is a comfort that this business is over  you neednt creep under sofas now theres nobody to tread upon your dainty little paws  what is to be done mab to get out of a savage humourexcept thinking how goodnatured poor tom is  there was not much sign of savage humour in the face that was lifted up as dr may came in from the hospital and sitting down by his daughter put his arm round her  so theres another bird flown he said  we shall soon have the old nest to ourselves ethel  the daisy is not going just yet said ethel stroking back the thin flying flakes over his temples  if we may believe her never  ah she will be off before we can look round said the doctor when once the trick of marrying gets among ones girls theres no end to it as long as they last out  nor to ones boys going out into the world said ethel both of them talking as if she had been his wife rather than one of these flyaway younglings herself  ah well he said its very pretty while it lasts and one keeps the creatures but after all one doesnt rear them for ones own pleasure  that only comes by the way of their chance goodwill to one  for shame doctor said ethel pretending to shake him by the collar  i was thinking he added that we must not require too much people must have their day and in their own fashion and i wish you would tell tomive no patience to do it myselfthat i dont mean to hamper him  as long as it is a right line he may take whichever he pleases and ill do my best to set him forward in it but it is a pity  perhaps a few years of travelling or of a professorship might give him time to think differently said ethel  not he said the doctor the more a man lives in the world the more he depends on it  where is the boy is he gone without vouchsafing a goodbye  oh no he has taken pity on annie and caroline cheviots famine of croquet and gone with them to the gardens  a spice of flirtation never comes amiss to him  there thats the way said ethel halfsaucily halfcaressingly that poor fellow never can do right  isnt it the very thing to keep him away from home that we all may steal a horse and he cant look over the wall no not with a telescope  i cant help it ethel  it may be very wrong and unkind of meheaven forgive me if it is and prevent me from doing the boy any harm but i never can rid myself of a feeling of there being something behind when he seems the most straightforward  if he had only not got his grandfathers mouth and nose  and smiling after alli dont know what i said to be so scolded all lads flirt and you cant deny that master tom divided his attentions pretty freely last year between mrs pugh and poor ave ward  this time i believe it was out of pure kindness to me said ethel so i am bound to his defence  he dragged off poor daisy to chaperon them that i might have a little peace  ah he came down on us this morning said the doctor on richard and flora and me and gave us a lecture on letting you grow old ethelsaid you were getting overtasked and no one heeding it and lookinglets lookand he took off his spectacles put his hand on her shoulder and studied her face  old enough to be a respectable lady of the house i hope said ethel  wiry enough for most things said the doctor patting her shoulder reassured but we must take care ethel if you dont fatten yourself up we shall have flora coming and carrying you off to london for a change and for tom to practise on  that is a threat  i expected he had been prescribing for me already never to go near cocksmoor for thats what people always begin by  nothing worse than pale ale  at which ethel made one of her faces and to make a mary of that chit of a daisy  well you may do as you pleaseonly take care or flora will be down upon us  tom has been very helpful and kind to me said ethel  and papa he has seen leonard and he says he looked so noble that to shake hands with him made him feel quite small  i never heard anything so much to toms credit  well and what did he say of the dear lad  the next step was to mention averils letter to mary which could not be sent on till tidings had been permitted by mr cheviot  let us see it said the doctor  do you think charles cheviot would like it  cheviot is a man of sense said the openhearted doctor and there may be something to authorize preventing this unlucky transfer of her fortune  nothing could be further from it but it was a long and interesting letter written in evidently exhilarated spirits and with a hopeful description of the new scenes  ethel read it to her father and he told every one about it when they came in  tom manifested no particular interest but he did not go by the mail train that night and was not visible all the morning  he caught ethel alone however at noon and said ethel i owe you this offering the amount she had paid for the letter  thank you she said wondering if this was to be all she should hear about it  i am going by the afternoon train he added i have been over to blewer  it is true ethel the fellow cant stand it he has sent down a manager and is always in london  most likely to dispose of it by private contract there they say  and what has become of old hardy  poor old fellow he has struck work looks terribly shaky  he took me for my father at first sight and began to apologize most plaintivelysaid no one else had ever done him any good  i advised him to come in and see my father though he is too far gone to do much for him  poor old man can he afford to come in now  why i helped him with the cart hire  it is no use any way he knows no more than we do and his case is confirmed but he thinks he has offended my father and hell die more in peace for having had him again  look here what a place they have got to  and without further explanation of the they tom placed a letter in ethels hands   my dear mr thomas  i send you the objects i promised for your microscope i could not get any before because we were in the city but if you like these i can get plenty more at massissauga where we are now  we came here last week and the journey was very nice only we went bump bump so often and once we stuck in a marsh and were splashed all over  we are staying with mr muller and cora till our own house is quite ready it was only begun a fortnight ago and we are to get in next week  i thought this would have been a town it looked so big and so square in the plan but it is all trees still and there are only thirteen houses built yet ours is all by itself in river street and all the trees near it have been killed and stand up all dead and white because nobody has time to cut them down  it looks very dismal but ave says it will be very nice by and by and rufus muller says it has mammoth privileges  i send you a bit of rattlesnake skin  they found fifteen of them asleep under a stone just where our house is built and sometimes they come into the kitchen  i do not know the names of the other things i send and i could not ask ave for she said you would not want to be bothered with a little girls letter and i was not to ask for an answer rosa willis says no young lady of my age would ask her sisters permission and not even her mothers unless her mamma was very intellectual and highly educated and always saw the justice of her arguments but minna and i do not mean to be like that  i would tell ave if you did write to me but she need not read it unless she liked                         i am your affectionate little friend                                                            ella   well said tom holding out his hand for more when she had restored this epistle  you have heard all there was in it except  except what i want to see  and ethel as she had more or less intended all along let him have averils letter since the exception was merely a few tender words of congratulation to mary  the worst had been done already by her father and it may here be mentioned that though nothing was said in answer to her explanation of the opening of the letter the headmaster never recovered the fact and always attributed it to his dear sister ethel  for the future said tom as he gave back the thin sheets they will all be for the cheviots private delectation  i shall begin on my own score said ethel  you know if you answer this letter you must not mention that visit of yours or you will be prohibited and one would not wish to excite a domestic secession  it would serve the unnatural scoundrel right said tom  well i must go and put up my things  youll keep me up to what goes on at home and if theres anything out there to tell leonard  wait a moment tomand she told him what the doctor had said about his plans  highly educated and intellectual was all the answer that tom vouchsafed and whether he were touched or not she could not gather  yet her spirit felt less weary and burdened and more full of hope than it had been for a long time past  averils letter showed the exhilaration of the change and of increasing confidence and comfort in her friend cora muller  coras confirmation had brought the girls into contact with the new york clergy and had procured them an introduction to the clergyman of winiamac the nearest church so that there was much less sense of loneliness moreover the fuller and more systematic doctrine and the development of the beauty and daily guidance of the church had softened the bright american girl so as to render her infinitely dearer to her english friend and they were as much united as they could be where the great leading event of the life of one remained a mystery to the other  yet perhaps it helped to begin a fresh life that the intimate companion of that new course should be entirely disconnected with the past  averil threw herself into the present with as resolute a will as she could muster  with much spirit she described the arrival at the winiamac station and the unconcealed contempt with which the mass of luggage was regarded by the western world who reckoned it would be fittest to make kindlings with  heavy country wagons were to bring the furniture the party themselves were provided for by a light wagon and a large cart driven by coras brother mordaunt and by the farmingman philetus a gentleman who took every occasion of asserting his equality if not his superiority to the newcomers demanded all the christian names and used them without prefix and when henry impressively mentioned his eldest sister as miss warden stared and said why doctor i thought she was not your old womanthe western epithet of a wife  but as cora was quite content to leave miss behind her in civilized society and as they were assured that to stand upon ceremony would leave them without domestic assistance the sisters had implored henry to waive all preference for a polite address  the loveliness of the way was enchantingthe roads running straight as an arrow through glorious forest lands of pine beech maple and oak in the full glory of spring and the perspective before and behind making a long narrowing green bower of meeting branches the whole of the borders of the road covered with lovely flowersmaywings a butterflylike milkwort pitcherplant convolvulus new insects danced in the shadegolden orioles blue birds the great american robin the field officer with his orange epaulettes glanced before them  cora was in ecstasy at the return to forest scenery the wards at its novelty and the escape from town  too happy were they at first to care for the shaking and bumping of the road and the first mudhole into which they plunged was almost a joke under mordaunt mullers assurances that it was easy fording though the splashes flew far and wide  then there was what philetus called a mash with a real handsome bridge over it i e a succession of tree trunks laid side by side for about a quarter of a mile  here the female passengers insisted on walkingeven cora though her brother and philetus both laughed her to scorn and more especially for her footgear delicate kid boots without which no city damsel stirred  averil and her sisters in the english boots scorned at new york had their share in the laugh while picking their way from log to log hand in hand and exciting philetuss further disdain by their rapture with the glorious flowers of the bog  but where was massissauga  several settlements had been passed the houses looking clean and white in forest openings with fields where the lovely spring green of young maize charmed the eye  at last the road grew desolate  there were a few patches of corn a few squalidlooking log or frame houses a tract of horrible dreary blackness and still more horrible beyond it was a region of spectrestrees white and stripped bare lifting their dead arms like things blasted  averil cried out in indignant horror who has done this  we have answered mordaunt  this is maclellan square miss warden and theres river street pointing down an avenue of skeletons  if you could go to sleep for a couple of years you would wake up to find yourself in a city such as i would not fear to compare with any in europe  your exhausted civilization is not as energetic as ours i calculate  the energetic young colonist turned his horses head up a slight rising ground where something rather more like habitation appeared a great brickbuilt hotel and some log houses with windows displaying the wares needed for daily consumption and a few farm buildings  it was backed by cornfields and this was the great maclellan street the chief ornament of massissauga  not one house had the semblance of a garden the wilderness came up to the very door except where cattle rendered some sort of enclosure necessary  cora exclaimed oh mordaunt i thought you would have had a garden for me  i can fix it any time you like said he but youll be the laughingstock of the place and never keep a flower  the mullers abode was a sound substantial log house neatly whitened and with green shutters bearing a festal appearance full of welcome as mr muller his tall bearded son rufus and a thin but motherlylooking elderly woman came forth to meet the travellers and in the front full stare stood a trollopylooking girl every bar of her enormous hoop plainly visible through her washedout flimsy muslin this was miss ianthe who condescended to favour the family with her assistance till she should have made up dollars enough to buy a new dress  the elder woman who went by the name of cousin deborah would have been a housekeeper in englandhere she was one of the familywelcomed cora with an exchange of kisses and received the strangers with very substantial hospitality though with pity at their unfitness for their new home and utter incredulity as to their success  here the wards had been since their arrival  their framehouse near the verdant bank of the river was being finished for them and a great brass plate with henrys new name and his profession had already adorned the door  the furniture was coming cousin deborah had hunted up a cleopatra betsy who might perhaps stay with them if she were treated on terms of equality a field was to be brought into cultivation as soon as any labour could be had  minna was looking infinitely better already and averil and cora were full of designs for rival housewifery averil taking lessons meantime in ironing dusting and the arts of the kitchen and trusting that in the two years time the skeletons would have given placeif not indeed to houses to wellkept fields  such was her account  how much was reserved for fear of causing anxiety  who could guess     chapter xxi                     quanto si fende   la rocca per dar via a chi va suso   nandai nfino ovel cerchiar si prende   comio nel quinto giro fui dischiuso   vidi gente per esso che piangea   glacendo a terra tutta volta in giuso   adhaesit pavimento anima mia   sentia dir loro con si alti sospiri   che la parola appena sintendea   o eletti di deo i cui soffriri   e giustizia e speranza fan men duri                                dante purgatorio   ah sir we have learnt the way to get your company said hector ernescliffe as he welcomed his fatherinlaw at maplewood we have only to get under sentence  sick or sorry hector thats the attraction to an old doctor  and added hector with the importance of his youthful magisterial dignity i hope i have arranged matters for you to see him  i wrote about it but i am afraid you will not be able to see him alone  great was the satisfaction with which hector took the conduct of the expedition to portland island though he was inclined to encumber it with more lionizing than the good doctors full heart was ready for few words could he obtain as in the bright august sunshine they steamed out from the pier at weymouth and beheld the gray sides of the island scarred with stone quarries stretching its lengthening breakwater out on one side and on the other connected with the land by the pale dim outline of the chesill bank  the water was dancing in golden light whitesailed or redsailed craft plied across it a ship of the line lay under the lee of the island practising gunnery the three bounds of her balls marked by white columns of spray each time of touching the water pleasure parties crowded the steamer but to dr may the cheerfulness of the scene made a depressing contrast to the purpose of his visit as he fixed his eyes on the squared outline of the crest of the island and the precipitous slope from thence to the breakwater where trains of loaded trucks rushed forth to the end discharged themselves and hurried back  landing at the quay in the midst of confusion hector smiled at the doctors innocent proposal of walking and bestowed him in a little carriage with a horse whose hardworked patience was soon called out as up and up they went through the narrow but lively street past the oldfashioned inn made memorable by a dinner of george iii past the fossil tree clamped against a house like a vine past heaps of slabs ready for transport a church perched up high on the slope and a parsonage in a place that looked only accessible to goats  lines of fortification began to reveal themselves and the doctor thought himself arrived but he was to wind further on and be more struck with the dreariness and inhospitality of the rugged rock almost bare of vegetation the very trees of stone and older than our creation the melancholy late ripening harvest within stone walls the whole surface furrowed by stern rents and crevices riven by nature or cut into greater harshness by the quarries hewn by man the grave strangeness of the region almost marked it out for a place of expiation like the mountain rising desolate from the sea where dante placed his prisoners of hope  the walls of a vast enclosure became visible and over them might be seen the tops of great cranes looking like the denuded ribs of umbrellas  buildings rose beyond with deep arched gateways and a small town was to be seen further off  mr ernescliffe sent in his card at the governors house and found that the facilities he had asked for had been granted  they were told that the prisoner they wished to see was at work at some distance and while he was summoned they were to see the buildings  dr may had little heart for making a sight of them except so far as to judge of leonards situation and he was passively conducted across a gravelled court turfed in the centre and containing a few flowerbeds fenced in by portlands most natural productions zamias and ammonites together with a few stone coffins which had once inclosed corpses of soldiers of the roman garrison large piles of building inclosed the quadrangle and passing into the first of these the doctor began to realize something of leonards present existence  there lay before him the broad airy passage and either side the empty cells of this strange hive as closely packed and as chary of space as the compartments of the workers of the honeycomb  just twice as wide as a coffin said hector doing the honours of one where there was exactly width to stand up between the bed and the wall of corrugated iron though happily there is more liberality of height  there was a ground glass window opposite to the door and a shelf holding a bible prayer and hymn book and two others one religious and one secular from the library  a rustcoloured jacket with a black patch marked with white numbers and a tarpaulin hat crossed with two lines of red paint on the crown hung on the wall  the doctor asked for leonards cell but it was in a distant gallery and he was told that when he had seen one he had seen all  he asked if these were like those that leonard had previously inhabited at milbank and pentonville and hearing that they were on the same model he almost gasped at the thought of the young enterprising spirit thus caged for nine weary months and to whom this bare confined space was still the only restingplace  he could not look by any means delighted with the excellence of the arrangements grant it though he might and he was hurried on to the vast kitchens their ranges of coppers full of savoury steaming contents and their racks of loaves looking all that was substantial and wholesome but his eyes were wandering after the figures engaged in cooking to whom he was told such work was a reward he was trying to judge how far they could still enjoy life but he turned from their stolid low stamp of face with a sigh thinking how little their condition could tell him of that of a cultivated nature  he was shown the chapel unfortunately serving likewise for a schoolroom the centre space fitted for the officials and their families the rest with plain wooden benches  but it was not an hour for schooling and he went restlessly on to the library to gather all the consolation he could from seeing that the privation did not extend to that of sound and interesting literature  he had yet to see the court where the prisoners were mustered at halfpast five in the morning thence to be marched off in their various companies to work he stood on the terrace from which the officials marshalled them and he was called on to look at the wide and magnificent view of sea and land but all he would observe to hector was that boys throat has always been tender since the fever  he was next conducted to the great court the quarry of the stones of the present st pauls and where the depression of the surface since work began there was marked by the present height of what had become a steep conical edifice surmounted by a sort of watchtower  there he grew quite restive and hearing a proposal of taking him to the verne hill works half a mile off he declared that hector was welcome to go he should wait for his boy  just then the guide pointed out at some distance a convict approaching under charge of a warder and in a few seconds more the doctor had stepped back to a small room where by special favour he was allowed to be with the prisoner instead of seeing him through a grating but only in the presence of a warder who was within hearing though not obtrusively so  looking to recognize not to examine he drew the young man into his fatherly embrace  you have hurt your hands was his first word at the touch of the bruised fingers and broken skin  they are getting hardened was the answer in an alert tone that gave the doctor courage to look up and meet an unquenched glance though there was the hollow look round the eyes that tom had noticed the face had grown older the expression more concentrated the shoulders had rounded the coarse blue shirt and heavy boots were dusty with the mornings toil and the heat and labour of the day had left their tokens but the brow was as open the mouth as ingenuous as ever the complexion had regained a hue of health and the air of alacrity and exhilaration surprised as much as it gratified the visitor  what is your work he asked  filling barrows with stones and wheeling them to the trucks for the breakwater answered leonard in a tone like satisfaction  but pray if you are so kind tell me he continued with anxiety that he could not suppress what is this about war in america  not near indiana no fear of that i trust  but how did you know leonard  i saw for one moment at a time in great letters on a placard of the contents of newspapers at the stations as we came down here the words civil war in america and it has seemed to be in the air here ever since  but averil has said nothing in her letters  will it affect them  the doctor gave a brief sketch of what was passing up to the battle of bull run and his words were listened to with such exceeding avidity that he was obliged to spend more minutes than he desired on the chances of the war and the massissauga tidings which he wished to make sound more favourable than he could in conscience feel that they were but when at last he had detailed all he knew from averils letters and it had been drunk in with glistening eyes and manner growing constantly less constrained he led back to leonard himself ethel will write at once to your sister when i get home and i think i may tell her the work agrees with you  yes and this is mans work and it is for the defences he added with a sparkle of the eye  very hard and rough returned the doctor looking again at the wounded hands and hardworked air  oh but to put out ones strength again and have room cried the boy eagerly  was it not rather a trying change at first  to be sure i was stiff and didnt know how to move in the morning but that went off fast enough and i fill as many barrows a day as any one in our gang  then i may tell your sister you rejoice in the change  why its work one does not get deadly sick of as if there was no making ones self do it said leonard eagerly it is work and besides here is sunshine and sea  i can get a sight of that every day and now and then i can get a look into the bay and weymouthlooking like the old time  that was his first sorrowful intonation but the next had the freshness of his age and there are thistles  thistles  i thought you cared for thistles for miss may showed me one at coombe but it was not like what they are herethe spikes pointing out and pointing in along the edges of the leaves and the scales lapping over so wonderfully in the bud  picciola said the doctor to himself and aloud  then you have time to enjoy them  when we are at work at a distance dinner is brought out and there is an hour and a half of rest and on sunday we may walk about the yards you should have seen one of our gang when i got him to look at the chevaux de frise round a bud how he owned it was a regular patent invention it just answered to paleys illustration  what the watch said the doctor seeing that the argument had been far from trite to his young friend  so you read paley  i read all such books as i could get up there he answered they gave one something to think about  have you no time for reading here  oh no  i am too sleepy to read except on school days and sundays he said as if this were a great achievement  and your acquaintanceis he a reader of paley too  i believe the chaplain set him on it  he is a clerk like me and not much older  he is a regular londoner and can hardly stand the work but he wont give in if he can help it or we might not be together  much the doctor longed to ask what sort of a friend this might be but the warders presence forbade him and he could only ask what they saw of each other  we were near one another in school at pentonville and knew each others faces quite well so that we were right glad to be put into the same gang  we may walk about the yard together on sunday evening too  the doctor had other questions on his lips that he again restrained and only asked whether the sundays were comfortable days  oh yes said leonard eagerly but then he too recollected the official and merely said something commonplace about excellent sermons adding and the singing is admirable  poor averil would envy such a choir as we have  we sing so many of the old bankside hymns  to make your resemblance to dantes hill of penitence complete as ethel says returned the doctor  i should like it to be a hill of purification said leonard understanding him better than he had expected  it will i think said the doctor to one at least  i am comforted to see you so brave  i longed to come sooner but  i am glad you did not  how  but he did not pursue the question catching from look and gesture that leonard could hardly have then met him with selfpossession and as the first bulletin of recovery is often the first disclosure of the severity of an illness so the doctor was more impressed by the prisoners evident satisfaction in his change of circumstances than he would have been by mere patient resignation and he let the conversation be led away to aubreys prospects in which leonard took full and eager interest  tell aubrey i am working at fortifications too he said smiling  he could not go to cambridge without you  i dont like to believe that said leonard gravely it is carrying the damage i have done further but it cant be  he always was fond of mathematics and of soldiering  how is it at the old mill he added suddenly  it is sold  sold and his eyes were intently fixed on the doctor  yes he is said to have been much in debt long before but it was managed quietlynot advertised in the county papers  he went to london and arranged it all  i saw great renovations going on at the mill when i went to see old hardy  good old hardy how is he  much broken  he never got over the shock and as long as that fellow stayed at the mill he would not let me attend him  ha exclaimed leonard but caught himself up  a message came that mr ernescliffe feared to miss the boat and the doctor could only give one tender grasp and murmured blessing and hurry away so much agitated that he could hardly join in hectors civilities to the officials and all the evening seemed quite struck down and overwhelmed by the sight of the bright brave boy and his patience in his dreary lot  after this at all the three months intervals at which leonard might be seen a visit was contrived to him either by dr may or mr wilmot and aubrey devoted his first leave of absence to staying at maplewood that hector might take him to his friend but he came home expatiating so much on the red hair of the infant hope of maplewood and the fuss that blanche made about this new possession that ethel detected an unavowed shade of disappointment  light and whitewash abundant fare garments sufficient but eminently unbecoming were less impressive than dungeons rags and bread and water when moreover the prisoner claimed no pity but rather congratulation on his badge of merit improved sunday dinner and promotion to the carpenters shop so as absolutely to excite a sense of wasted commiseration and uninteresting prosperity  conversation constrained both by the grating and the presence of the warder and aubrey more tenderly sensitive than his brother and devoid of his fathers experienced tact was too much embarrassed to take the initiative was afraid of giving pain by dwelling on his present occupations and future hopes and confused leonard by his embarrassment  hector ernescliffe discoursed about charleston harbour and new orleans and aubrey stood with downcast eyes afraid to seem to be scanning the convict garb and thus rendering leonard unusually conscious of wearing it  then when in parting aubrey a little less embarrassed began eagerly and in much emotion to beg leonard to say if there was anything he could get for him anything he could do for him anything he would like to have sent him and began to promise a photograph of his father leonard checked him by answering that it would be an irregularitynothing of personal property was allowed to be retained by a prisoner  aubrey forgot all but the hardship and began an outburst about the tyranny  it is quite right said leonard gravely there is nothing that might not be used for mischief if one chose  and the warder here interfered and said he was quite right and it always turned out best in the end for a prisoner to conform himself and his friends did him no good by any other attempt as mr ernescliffe could tell the young gentleman  the mans tone though neither insolent nor tyrannical but rather commendatory of his charge contrasting with his natural deference to the two gentlemen irritated poor aubrey beyond measure so that hector was really glad to have him safe away without his having said anything treasonable to the authorities  the meeting so constrained and uncomfortable had but made the friends more vividly conscious of the interval between the cadet and the convict and moreover tended to remove the aureole of romance with which the unseen captive had been invested by youthful fancy  to make the best of a prolonged misfortune does absolutely lessen sympathy by diminishing the interest of the situation and even the good doctor himself was the less concerned at any hindrance to his visits to portland as he uniformly found his prisoner cheerful approved by officials and always making some small advance in the scale of his own world and not as his friends without expected of him showing that he felt himself injured instead of elated by such rewards as improved diet or increased gratuities to be set to his account against the time when after eight years he might hope for exportation with a ticket of leave to western australia  the halo of approaching death no longer lighted him up and after the effusion of the first meeting his inner self had closed up he was more ready to talk of american news than of his own feelings and seemed to look little beyond the petty encouragements devised to suit the animal natures of ordinary prisoners and his visitors sometimes feared lest his character were not resisting the deadening hardening influence of the unvaried round of manual labour among such associates he had been soon advanced from the quarry to the carpenters shop and was in favour there from his activity and skill but his very promotions were sadand it was more sad as some thought for him to be gratified by them  but as dr may always ended what did they know about him     chapter xxii    oh bessie bell and mary grey   they were twa bonnie lasses   they bigged a bower on yon burn side   and theekt it over wi rashes   the early glory of autumn was painting the woods of indianacrimson orange purple as though a rainbow of intensified tints had been broken into fragments and then scattered broadcast upon the forest but though ripe nuts hung on many a bough the gipsyings had not yet taken place except at homewhen minna in her desperate attempts at making the best of things observed now we have to make the fire ourselves let us think it is all play and such fun  but such fun was hard when one or other of the inmates of the house was lying on the bed shaking with ague and the others creeping wearily about even on their intermediate days  they had been deluded into imprudent exposure in the lovely evenings of summer and had never shaken off the results  come ella said minna one afternoon as she descended the bare rickety stairs ave is getting better and if we can get the fire up and make some coffee and boil some eggs it will be comfortable for her when she comes down and henry comes in  ella with a book in her hand was curled up in a corner of a sofa standing awry among various other articles of furniture that seemed to have tumbled together by chance within the barnlike room  minna began moving first one and then the other daintily wiping off the dust and restoring an air of comfort  oh dear said ella unfolding herself i am so tired  wheres hetta mary  oh dont you know hetta mary went home this morning because henry asked her where his boots were and she thought he wanted her to clean them  cant mrs shillabeer come in  mrs shillabeer said she would never come in again because averil asked her not to hold the ham by the bone and cut it with her own knife when henry was there  come ella it is of no use  we had better do things ourselves like cora and ave and then we shall not hear people say disagreeable things  the once soft round kittenlike minna whom leonard used to roll about on the floor had become a lank sallow girl much too tall for her ten years and with a carestricken thoughtful expression on her face even more in advance of her age than was her height  she moved into the kitchen a room with an iron stove a rough table and a few shelves looking very desolate the hands of both little girls had become expert in filling the stove with wood and they had not far to seek before both it and the hearth in the sittingroom were replenished and the flame beginning to glow  wheres the coffeemill said minna presently looking round in blank despair  oh dear said ella i remember now that dirty little polly mason came to borrow it this morning  i said we wanted it every day but she guessed we could do without it for they had got a teaparty and her little brother had put in a stone and spoilt cora mullers and she snatched it up and carried it off  he will serve ours the same i suppose said minna  it is too far off to go for it let us make some tea  theres no tea said ella a week ago or more that great irene brown walked in and reckoned we could lend her ma some tea and sugar cause we had plenty  and we have used up our own since and if we did ask her to return the loan hers is such nasty stuff that nobody could drink it what shall we do minna and she began to cry  we must take some coffee up to the hotel said minna after a moments reflection black joe is very goodnatured and hell grind it  but i dont like to go ail by myself said ella into the kitchen too and hear them say things about britishers  ill go dear said minna gently if you will just keep the fire up and boil the eggs and make the toast and listen if ave calls  poor minna her sensitive little heart trembled within her at the rough contemptuous words that the exclusive refined tone of the family always provoked and bodily languor and weariness made the walk trying but she was thinking of aves need and resolutely took down her cloak and hat  but at that moment the latch was raised and the bright graceful figure of cora stood among them her feathered hat and delicate muslin looking as fresh as at new york  what all alone she said i know it is poor aves sick day  is she better  yes going to get up and come down but and all the troubles were poured out  true enough the little wretch did spoil our mill but rufus mended it and as i thought polly had been marauding on you i brought some down  ah  i thought i smelt it most deliciously as you came in but i was afraid i only fancied it because i was thinking about it  dear cora how good you are  and have you anything for her to eat  i was going to make some toast  of that dry stuff  come well manage something better and off came the dainty embroidered cambric sleeves up went the coloured ones a white apron came out of a pocket and the pretty hands were busy among the flour the children assisting learning laughing a childlike laugh  ah cried cora turning round and making a comic threatening gesture with her floury fingers you ought not to have come till we were fixed  go and sit in your chair by the fire  dear cora  but cora ran at her and the wan trembling creature put on a smile and was very glad to comply being totally unequal to resist or even to stand long enough to own her dread of henrys finding all desolate and nothing to eat  presently cora tripped in all besleeved and smartened to set cushions behind the tired back and head and caress the long thin fingers ive left minna like king alfred to watch the cakes she said and ella is getting the cups  so your fifth girl is gone  the fifth in five months  and we let her sit at table and poor dear minna has almost worn out her life in trying to hinder her from getting affronted  ive thought what to do for you ave  theres the irish woman katty blakeher husband has been killed  she is rough enough but tender in her way and she must do something for herself and her child  her husband killed  yes at summerville  i thought you had heard it  mordaunt wrote to me to tell her and i shall never forget her wailing at his dying away from his country  it was not lamentation for herself but that he should have died far away from his own people  she is not long from the old country i should like to have her ifif we can afford it  for if the dividends dont come soon from that building company cora i dont know where to turn  oh they must come  father has been writing to rufus about the arrangements  besides those irish expect less and understand old country manners better if you can put up with their breakages  i could put up with anything to please henry and save minnas little hardworked bones  i will send her tomorrow  is it not minnas day of ague  yes poor dear  that is always the day we get into trouble  i never saw a child with such an instinct for preventing variance or so full of tact and pretty ways yet i have seen her tremble under her coaxing smile that even mis shillabeer cant resist  see see cried ella hurrying in surely our contingent is not coming home  no said cora hastening to the door these must be a reinforcement marching to take the train at winiamac  marching said ella looking up archly at her  we didnt let our volunteers march in that way  they were sturdy bearded backwoodsmen rifle on shoulder and with grave earnest faces but walking rather than marching irregularly keeping together or straggling as they chose  your volunteers cried cora her eyes flashing theirs was toy work these are bound for real patriotic war and she clasped her hands together then waved her handkerchief  it is sad said averil who had moved to the window to see so many elderly facesmen who must be the prop of their families  it is because ours is a fight of men not of children not one of your european wars of paltry ambition but a war of principle cried cora with that intensity of enthusiasm that has shed so much blood in the breakup of the great republic  they do look as cromwells ironsides may have done said averil as full of stern purpose  and verily averil noted the difference  had a number of european soldiers been passing so near in an equally undisciplined manner young women could not have stood forth as cora was doing unprotected yet perfectly safe from rudeness or remark making ready answer to the inquiry for the nearest innnay only wishing she were in her own house to evince her patriotism by setting refreshment before the defenders of her cause  her ardour had dragged averil up with her a little way so as to feel personally every vicissitude that befell the north and to be utterly unaware of any argument in favour of the confederates but still averil was in coras words too english she could not for the life of her feel as she did when equipping her brother against possible french invasions and when mordaunt muller had been enrolled in the federal army she had almost offended the exultant sister by condolence instead of congratulation  five months had elapsed since the arrival of averil in massissaugamonths of anxiety and disappointment which had sickened henry of plans of farming and lessened his hopes of practice  the same causes that affected him at new york told in indiana and even if he had been employed the fees would have been too small to support the expense of horses  as to farming labour was scarce and could only be obtained at the cost of a considerable outlay and moreover of enduring rude selfassertions that were more intolerable to henry than even to his sisters  the chief hope of the family lay in the speculation in which averils means had been embarked which gave them a right to their present domicile and to a part of the uncleared waste around them and would when massissauga should begin to flourish place them in affluence  the interest of the portions of the two younger girls was all that was secure since these were fortunately still invested at home  inhabitants did not come lots of land were not taken and the mullers evidently profited more by the magnificent harvest produced by their land than by the adventure of city founding still plenty and comfort reigned in their house and cora had imported a good deal of refinement and elegance which she could make respected where averils attempts were only sneered down  nor had sickness tried her household  owing partly to situationconsiderably above the level of river streetpartly to the freer more cleared and cultivated surroundingspartly likewise to experience and cousin deborahs motherly watchfulnessthe summer had passed without a visitation of ague though it seemed to be regarded as an adjunct of spring as inevitable as winter frost averil trembled at the thought but there was no escape there were absolutely no means of leaving the spot or of finding maintenance elsewhere  indeed coras constant kindness and sympathy were too precious to be parted with even had it been possible to move  after the boardinghouse massissauga was a kind of home and the more spirits and energy failed the more she clung to it  mr muller had lately left home to arrange for the sale of his corn and had announced that he might perhaps pay a visit to his son mordaunt in the camp at lexington  cora was expecting a letter from him and the hope that dr warden might bring one from the postoffice at winiamac had been one cause of her visit on this afternoon for the mammoth privileges of massissauga did not include a postoffice nor the sight of letters more than once a week  the table had just been covered with preparations for a meal and the glow of the fire was beginning to brighten the twilight when the sound of a horses feet came near and henry rode past the window but did not appear for a considerable space having of late been reduced to become his own groom  but even in the noise of the hoofs even in the wave of the hand the girls had detected gratified excitement  charleston has surrendered  the rebels have submitted cried cora  and averils heart throbbed with its one desperate hope  no  that would have brought him in at once  after all both were in a state to feel it a little flat when he came in presenting a letter to miss muller and announcing i have had a proposal ladies what would you say to seeing me a surgeon to the federal forcesdo you bid me go miss muller  i bid every one go who can be useful to my country said cora  dont look alarmed averil said henry affectionately as he met her startled eyes there is no danger  a surgeon need never expose himself  but howwhat has made you think of it asked averil faintly  a letter from mr mullera very kind letter  he tells me that medical men are much wanted and that an examination by a board is all that is required the remuneration is good and it will be an introduction that will avail me after the termination of the war which will end with the winter at latest  and father has accepted an office in the commissariat department exclaimed cora from her letter  yes answered henry he tells me that pending more progression here it is wiser for us both to launch into the current of public events and be floated upwards by the stream  does he want you to come to him cora was all that averil contrived to say  oh no he will be in constant locomotion said cora  i shall stay to keep house for rufus  and here are some directions for him that i must carry home  dont come dr warden i shall never cure you of thinking we cannot stir without an escort  you will want to put a little public spirit into this dear ave  thats her one defect and when you are one of us she will be forced to give us her heart  and away ran the bright girl giving her caresses to each sister as she went  the little ones broke out o henry henry you must not go away to the wars and averils pleading eyes spoke the same  then henry sat down and betook himself to argument  it would be folly to lose the first opening to employment that had presented itself  he grieved indeed to leave his sisters in this desolate unhealthy place but they were as essentially safe as at stoneborough their living alone for a few weeks or at most months would be far less remarkable here than there and he would be likely to be able to improve or to alter their present situation whereas they were now sinking deeper and more hopelessly into poverty every day  then too he read aloud piteous accounts of the want of medical attendance showing that it was absolutely a cruelty to detain such assistance from the sick and wounded  this argument was the one most appreciated by averil and minna  the rest were but questions of prudence this touched their hearts  men lying in close tents or in crowded holds of ships with festering wounds and fevered lips without a hand to help themsome too whom they had seen at new york and whose exulting departure they had witnessedsufferers among whom their own coras favourite brother might at any moment be numberedthe thought brought a glow of indignation against themselves for having wished to withhold him  yes go henry it is right and you shall hear not another word of objection said averil  you can write or telegraph the instant you want me  and it will be for a short time said henry half repenting when the opposition had given way  oh we shall get on very well said minna cheerfully better perhaps for you know we dont mind far west manners and ill have learnt to do all sorts of things as well as cora when you come home  and henry after a years famine of practice was in better spirits than since that fatal summer morning  averil felt how different a man is in his vocation and deprived of it  oh yes she said to herself if i had let ourselves be a drag on him when he is so much needed i could never have had the face to write to our dear sufferer at home in his noble patience  it is better that we should be desolate than that he should be a wreck or than that mass of sickness should be left untended  and the more desolate the more sure of one protector  there was true heroism in the spirit in which this young girl braced herself to uncomplaining acceptance of desertion in this unwholesome swamp with her two little ailing sisters beside the sluggish stream amid the skeleton treesheroism the greater because there was no enthusiastic patriotism to uphold herit was only the land of her captivity whence she looked towards home like judah to jerusalem     chapter xxiii    prisoner of hope thou art look up and sing   in hope of promised spring                        christian year   in the summer of 1862 tom may was to go up for his examination at the college of physicians but only a day or two before it he made his appearance at home in as much excitement as it was in him to betray hazlitt the bankers clerk at whitford had written to him tidings of the presentation of the missing cheque for £25 which bilson had paid to old axworthy shortly before the murder and which leonard had mentioned as in the pocketbook containing his receipt for the sum that had been found upon him  tom had made a halt at whitford and seen the cheque which had been backed by the word axworthy with an initial that like all such signatures of the nephew might stand either for s or f and the stiff office hand of both the elder and younger axworthy was so much alike that no one could feel certain whose writing it was the long concealment after the prisoners pointed reference to it was however so remarkable that the home conclave regarded the cause as won and the father and son hastened triumphantly to the attorneys office  messrs bramshaw and anderson were greatly struck and owned that their own minds were satisfied as to the truth of their clients assertion but they demurred as to the possibility of further steps an action for forgery toms first hope he saw to be clearly impossible samuel axworthy appeared to have signed the cheque in his own name and he had every right to it as his uncles heir and though the long withholding of it as well as his own departure were both suspicious circumstances they were not evidence  where was there any certainty that the cheque had ever been in the pocketbook or even if it had how did it prove the existence of young wards acknowledgment  might it not have been in some receptacle of papers hitherto not opened  there was no sufficient case to carry to the police after a conviction like leonards to set them on tracing the cheque either to an unknown robber or to sam axworthy its rightful owner  mr bramshaw likewise dissuaded dr may from laying the case before the secretary of state as importunity without due grounds would only tell against him if any really important discovery should be made and the doctor walked away with blood boiling at peoples coolness to other folks tribulations and greatly annoyed with tom for having acceded to the representations of the men of law and declining all cooperation in drawing up a representation for the home office on the plea that he had no time to lose in preparing for his own examination and must return to town by the next train which he did without a syllable of real converse with any one at home  the doctor set to work with his home helpers assisted by dr spencer but the work of composition seemed to make the ground give way under their feet and a few adroit remarks from dr spencer finally showed him and ethel that they had not yet attained the prop for the lever that was to move the world  he gave it up but still he did not quite forgive tom for having been so easily convinced and ready to be dismissed to his own affairs  however dr may was gratified by the great credit with which his son passed his examination and took his degree and sir matthew fleet himself wrote in high terms of his talent diligence and steadiness volunteering hopes of being able to put him forward in town in his own line for which tom had always had a preference and adding that it was in concurrence with his own recommendation that the young man wished to pursue his studies at parishe had given him introductions that would enable him to do so to the greatest advantage and he hoped his father would consent  the letter was followed up by one from tom himself as usual too reasonable and authoritative to be gainsaid with the same representation of advantages to be derived from a course of the parisian hospitals  ah well he is after old fleets own heart said dr may between pride and mortification  i should not grudge poor fleet some one to take interest in his old age and i did not look to see him so warm about anything  he has not forgotten calton hill  but the boy must have done very well  i say shall we see him sir thomas some of these days ethel and laugh at ourselves for having wanted to make him go round in a mill after our old fashion  you were contented to run round in your mill said ethel fondly and maybe he will too  no no ethel ill not have him persuaded  easygoing folk too lazy for ambition have no right to prescribe for others  ambition turned sour is a very dangerous dose  much better let it fly off i mean to look out of my mill yet and see sir thomas win the stakes only i wish he would come and see us tell him he shall not hear a word to bother him about the old practice  people have lived and died at stoneborough without a may to help them and so they will again i suppose  ethel was very glad to see how her father had made up his mind to what was perhaps the most real disappointment of his life but she was grieved that tom did not respond to the invitation and next wrote from paris  it was one of his hurried notes great contrasts to such elaborate performances as his recent letter  thanks many thanks to my father he said i knew you would make him see reason and he always yields generously  i was too much hurried to come home could not afford to miss the trail  i had not time to say before that the bank that sent the cheque to whitford had it from a lodginghouse in town  landlord had a writ served on s a as he was embarking at folkestone he took out the draft and paid  he knew its import if bramshaw did not  i hope my father was not vexed at my not staying there are things i cannot stand namely discussions and gertrude  gertrude was one of the chief cares upon ethels mind  she spent many thoughts upon the child and even talked her over with flora  what is it flora is it my bad management  she is a good girl and a dear girl but there is such a want of softness about her  there is a want of softness about all the young ladies of the day returned flora  i have heard you say so but  we have made girls sensible and clearheaded till they have grown hard  they have been taught to despise little fears and illusions and it is certainly not becoming  we had not fears we were taught to be sensible  yes but it is in the influence of the time  it all tends to make girls independent  thats very well for the fine folks you meet in your visits but it does not account for my daisyalways at home under papas eyehaving turned nineteenth centurywhat is it flora  she is reverent in great things but not respectful except to papa and that would not have been respect in one of usonly he likes her sauciness  that is it partly  no i wont have that said exclaimed ethel  papa is the only softening influence in the housethe only one that is tender  you see it is unlucky that gertrude has so few that she really does love with anything either reverend or softening about them  she is always at war with charles cheviot and he has not fun enough is too lumbering altogether to understand her or set her down in the right way and she domineers over hector like the rest of us  i did hope the babies might have found out her heart but unluckily she does not take to them  she is only bored by the fuss that mary and blanche make about them  you know we are all jealous of both charles cheviots elder and younger  i often question whether i should not have taken her down and made her ashamed of all the quizzing and teasing at the time of marys marriage but one cannot be always spoiling bright merry mischief and i am only elder sister after all  it is a wonder she is as good to me as she is  she never remembered our mother poor dear  ah that is the real mischief said ethel  mamma would have given the atmosphere of gentleness and discretion and so would margaret how often i have been made by the merest pained look to know when what i said was saucy or in bad taste and ii can only look forbidding or else blurt out a reproof that will not come softly  the youngest must be spoilt said flora thats an ordinance of nature  it ends when a boy goes to school and when a girl  when  when she marriesor when she finds out what trouble is said flora  is that all you can hold out to my poor daisy  well it is the way of the world  there is just now a reaction from sentiment and it is the less feminine variety  the softness will come when there is a call for it  never mind when the foundation is safe  if i could only see that child heartily admiring and looking up  i dont mean lovethere used to be a higher nobler reverence  such as you and norman used to bestow on shakespeare and scott andthe vision of cocksmoor  not only used said ethel  yes it is your soft side said flora it is what answers the purpose of sentiment in people like you  it is what i should have thought living with you would have put into any girl but gertrude has a satirical side and she follows the age  i wish you would tell her soit is what she especially wants not to do  but the spirit of opposition is not the thing to cause tenderness  no you must wait for something to bring it out  she is very kind to my poor little margaret and i wont ask how she talks of her  tenderly oh yes that she always would do  there then ethel if she can talk tenderly of margaret there cant be much amiss at the root  no and you dont overwhelm the naughty girl with baby talk  like our happy proud young mothers sighed flora and then letting herself outbut indeed ethel margaret is very much improved  she has really begun to wish to be good  i think she is struggling with herself  something to love tenderly something to reverence highly  so meditated ethel as she watched her sunnyhaired openfaced daisy so unconquerably gay and joyous that she gave the impression of sunshine without shade  there are stages of youth that are in themselves unpleasing and yet that are nobodys fault nay which may have within them seeds of strength  toms satire had fostered daisys too congenial spirit and he reaped the consequence in the want of repose and sympathy that were driving him from home and shutting him up within himself  would he ever forgive that flippant saying which ethel had recollected with shame ever sinceshame more for herself than for the child who probably had forgotten long ago her shaft at random sent  then ethel would wonder whether after all her discontent with gertrudes speeches was only from feeling older and graver and perhaps from a certain resentment at finding how the course of time was wearing down the sharp edge of compassion towards leonard  a little more about leonard was gathered when the time came of release for his friend the clerk brown  this young man had an uncle at paris engaged in one of the many departments connected with steam that carry englishmen all over the world and leonard obtained permission to write to dr thomas may begging him to call upon the uncle and try if he could be induced to employ the penitent and reformed nephew under his own eye  it had been wise in leonard to write direct for if the request had been made through any one at home tom would have considered it as impossible but he could not resist the entreaty and his mission was successful  the uncle was ready to be merciful and undertook all the necessary arrangements for and even the responsibility of bringing the ticketofleave man to paris where he found him a desk in his office  one of toms few detailed epistles was sent to ethel after this arrival when the uncle had told him how the nephew had spoken of his fellowprisoner it was to leonard ward that the young man had owed the inclination to open his heart to religious instruction hitherto merely endured as a portion of the general infliction of the penalty a supposed engine for dealing with the superstitious but entirely beneath his attention  the sight of the educated face had at first attracted him but when he observed the reverential manner in chapel he thought it mere acting the umble prisoner till he observed how unobtrusive unconscious and retiring was every token of devotion and watched the eyes brightened or softened in praise or in prayer till he owned the genuineness and guessed the depth of both then perceived in school how far removed his unknown comrade was from the mere superstitious boor  this was the beginning  the rest had been worked out by the instruction and discipline of the place enforced by the example and latterly by the conversation of his fellowprisoner until he had come forth sincerely repenting and with the better hope for the future that his sins had not been against full light  he declared himself convinced that ward far better merited to be at large than he did and told of the regard that uniform good conduct was obtaining at last though not till after considerable persecution almost amounting to personal danger from the worse sort of convicts who regarded him as a spy because he would not connive at the introduction of forbidden indulgences and always stood by the authorities  once his fearless interposition had saved the life of a warder and this had procured him trust and promotion to a class where his companions were better conducted and more susceptible to good influences and among them brown was sure that his ready submission and constant resolution to do his work were producing an effect  as to his spirits brown had never known him break down but once and that was when he had come upon a curious fossil in the stone  otherwise he was grave and contented but never laughed or joked as even some gentlemen prisoners of more rank and age had been known to do  the music in the chapel was his greatest pleasure and he had come to be regarded as an important element in the singing  very grateful was dr may to tom for having learnt and still more for having transmitted all these details and ethel was not the less touched because she knew they were to travel beyond minster street those words of mr wilmots seemed to be working out their accomplishment and she thought so the more when in early spring one of leonards severe throat attacks led to his being sent after his recovery to assist the schoolmaster instead of returning to the carpenters shed and he was found so valuable in the school that the master begged to retain his services  that spring was a grievous one in indiana  the war which eighteen months previously was to have come to an immediate end was still raging and the successes that had once buoyed up the northern states with hope had long since been chequered by terrible reverses  on on still fought either side as though nothing could close the strife but exhaustion or extinction and still ardent still constant through bereavement and privation were either party to their bloodstained flag  mordaunt muller had fallen in one of the terrible battles on the rappahannock and cora while sobbing in averils arms had still confessed herself thankful that it had been a glorious death for his countrys cause  and even in her fresh grief she had not endeavoured to withhold her other brother when at the urgent summons of government he too had gone forth to join the army  cora was advised to return to her friends at new york but she declared her intention of remaining to keep house with cousin deborah  unless averil would come with her nothing should induce her to leave massissauga certainly not while ella and averil were alternately laid low by the spring intermittent fever  perhaps the fact was that besides her strong affection for averil she felt that in her ignorance she had assisted her father in unscrupulously involving them in a hazardous and unsuccessful speculation and that she was the more bound in justice as well as in love and pity to do her best for their assistance  at any rate rufus had no sooner left home than she insisted on the three sisters coming to relieve her lonelinessin other words in removing them from the thin illbuilt frame house gaping in every seam with the effects of weather and with damp oozing up between every board of the floor the pestiferous riverfog the close air of the forest and the view of the phantom trees now decaying and falling one against another  cousin deborah who had learnt to love and pity the forlorn english girls heartily concurred and averil consented knowing that the dry house and pure air were the best hope of restoring ellas health  averil and ella quickly improved grew stronger in the intervals and suffered less during the attacks but minna who in their own house had been less ill had waited on both and supplied the endless deficiencies of the kindly and faithful but twofisted katty minna whose wise and simple little head had never failed in sensible counsels or tender comfort minna whom the rudest and most selfimportant farwester never disobliged minna the peacemaker the comfort and blessingwas laid low by fever and fever that as the experienced eyes of cousin deborah at once perceived meant mischief then it was that the real kindliness of heart of the rough people of the west showed itself  the five wild young ladies whose successive domestic services had been such trouble and whose answer to a summons from the parlour had been did yer holler avy i thort i heerd a scritch each from cleopatra betsy to hetta mary were constantly rushing in to inquire or to present questionable dainties and nostrums from their respective mas the charwomen whom minna had coaxed in her blandest manner to save trouble to averil and disgust to henry were officious in volunteers of nursing and sitting up the black cook at the hotel sent choice fabrics of jelly and fragrant ice and even henrys rival who had been so strong against the insolence of a practitioner showing no testimonials no sooner came under the influence of the yearning entreating but everpatient eyes than his attendance became assiduous his interest in the case ardent  henry himself was in the camp before vicksburg with his hands too full of piteous cases of wounds and fever to attempt the most hurried visit  sister dear said the soft slow voice one day when averil had been hoping her patient was asleep are you writing to henry  yes my darling  do you want to say anything  oh yes so much and the eyes grew bright and the breath gasping please beg henrytell henrythat i musti cant bear it any longer if i dont  you must what dear child  henry would let you do anything he could  oh then would he let me speak about dear leonard and the child grew deadly white when the words were spoken but her eyes still sought averils face and grew terrified at the sight of the gush of tears o ave ave tell me onlyhe is not dead and as averil could only make a sign i do have such dreadful fancies about him and i think i could sleep if i only knew what was really true  you shall dear child you shall without waiting to hear from henry i know he would let you  and only then did averil know the full misery that henrys decision had inflicted on the gentle little heart in childish ignorance imagining fetters and dungeons even in her sober waking moods and a prey to untold horrors in every dream exaggerated by feverishness and ailmenthorrors that for aught she knew might be veritable and made more awful by the treatment of his name as that of one dead  to hear of him as enjoying the open air and light of day going to church singing their own favourite hymn tunes and often visited by dr may was to her almost as great a joy as if she had heard of him at liberty  and averil had a more than usually cheerful letter to read to her one written in the infirmary during his recovery  his letters to her were always cheerful but this one was particularly so having been written while exhilarated by the relaxations permitted to convalescents and by enjoying an unwonted amount of conversation with the chaplain and the doctor  so glad so glad minna was heard murmuring to herself again and again her rest was calmer than it had been for weeks and the doctor found her so much better that he trusted that a favourable change had begun  but it was only a gleam of hope  the weary fever held its prey and many as were the fluctuations they always resulted in greater weakness and the wandering mind was not always able to keep fast hold of the new comfort  sometimes she would piteously clasp her sisters hand and entreat tell me again and sometimes the haunting delirious fancies of chains and bars would drop forth from the tongue that had lost its selfcontrol yet even at the worst came the dear old recurring note god will not let them hurt him for he has not done it  sometimes more trying to averil than all she would live over again the happy games with him or sing their favourite hymns and chants or she would be heard pleading o henry dont be cross to leonard  cora could not fail to remark the new name that mingled in the unconscious talk but she had learnt to respect averils reserve and she forbore from all questioning trying even to warn cousin deborah who with the experience of an elderly woman remarked that she had too much to do to mind what a sick child rambled about  when cora had lived to her age she would know how unaccountably they talked  but averil felt the more impelled to an outpouring by this delicate forbearance and the next time she and cora were sent out together to breathe the air while cousin deborah watched the patient she told the history and to a sympathizing listener without a moments doubt of leonards innocence nor that american law would have managed matters better  and now cora you know why i told you there were bitterer sorrows than yours  ah  averil i could have believed you once but to know that he never can come again  now you always have hope  my hope has all but gone said averil  there is only one thing left to look to  if i only can live till he is sent out to a colony then nothing shall keep me back from him  and what would i give for even such a hope  we have a better hope both of us murmured averil  it wont seem so long when it is over  well was it for averil that this fresh link of sympathy was riveted for day by day she saw the little patient wasting more hopelessly away and the fever only burning lower for want of strength to feed on utterly exhausted and half torpid there was not life or power enough left in the child for them to know whether she was aware of her condition  when they read prayers her lips always moved for the lords prayer and doxology and when the clergyman came out from winiamac prayed by her and blessed her she opened her eyes with a look of comprehension and if according to the custom from the beginning of her illness the psalms and lessons were not read in her room she was uneasy though she could hardly listen  so came easter eve and towards evening she was a little revived and asked averil what day it was then answered i thought it would have been nice to have died yesterdayit was the first time she mentioned death averil told her she was better but half repented as the child sank into torpor again and averil no longer the bewildered girl who had been so easily led from the death scene knew the fitful breath and fluttering pulse and felt the blank dread stealing over her heart  again however the child looked up and murmured you have not read today  cora who had the bible on her knee gently obeyed and read on where she was the morning first lesson the same in the american church as in our own  averil dull with watching and suffering sat on dreamily with the scent of primroses wafted to her as it were by the association of the words though her power to attend to them was gone before the chapter was over the doze had overshadowed the little girl again and yet more than once as the night drew on they heard her muttering what seemed like the echo of one of its verses turn you turn you  at last after hours of watching and more than one vain endeavour of good cousin deborah to lead away the worn but absorbed nurses the dread messenger came  minna turned suddenly in her sisters arms with more strength than averil had thought was left in her and eagerly stretched out her arms while the words so long trembling on her lips found utterance  turn you to the stronghold ye prisoners of hope o leonard dear it does not hurt  but that last word was almost lost in the gaspthe last gasp  what did not hurt was death without his sting  o cora  was he with her  is he gone too was averils cry at the first moment as she strained the form of her little comforter for the last time in her arms  and if he is they are in joy together said cousin deborah tenderly but firmly unloosing averils arms though with the tears running down her cheeks  take her away cora and both of you sleep  this dear lamb is in better keeping than yours  heavy grievous was the loss crushing the grief but it was such as to be at its softest and sweetest at easter amid the resurrection joys and the budding flowers though ellas bitterest fit of weeping was excited by there being no primrosesthe primroses that minna loved so much and her first pleasurable thought was to sit down and write to her dear mr tom to send her some primrose seed for minnas grave  minnas grave  alas massissauga had but an untidy desolatelooking region with a rude snake fence all unconsecrated  cora wanted to choose a shaded corner in her fathers ground where they might daily tend the childs earthly restingplace but averil shrank from this with horror and finally on one of the easter holidays the little wasted form in its coffin was reverently driven by philetus to winiamac while the sisters and cora slowly followed thinkingthe one of the nameless bloodstained graves of a battlefield the other whether an equally nameless graveyard but one looked on with a shudder unmixed with exultation had opened for the other being she loved best  the resurrection and the lifeyes had not he made his grave with the wicked and been numbered with the transgressors  somehow the present sorrow was more abundant in such comforts as these than all the pangs which her heart grown old in sorrow had yet endured  yet if her soul had bowed itself to meet sorrow more patiently and peacefully it was at the expense of the bodily frame  already weakened by the intermittent fever the long strain of nursing had told on her and that hysteric affection that had been so distressing at the time of her brothers trial recurred and grew on her with every occasion for selfrestraint  the suspense in which she livedwith one brother in the camp in daily peril from battle and disease the other in his convict prisonwore her down and made every passing effect of climate or fatigue seize on her frame like a serious disorder and the more she resigned her spirit the more her body gave way  yet she was infinitely happier  the repentance and submission were bearing fruit and the ceasing to struggle had brought a strange calm and acceptance of all that might be sent nay her own decay was perhaps the sweetest solace and healing of the wearied spirit and as to ella she would trust and she did trust that in some way or other all would be well  she felt as if even leonards death could be accepted thankfully as the captives release  but that sorrow was spared her  the account of leonard came from mr wilmot who had carried him the tidings  the prisoner had calmly met him with the words i know what you are come to tell me and he heard all in perfect calmness and resignation saying little but accepting all that the clergyman said exactly as could most be desired  from the chaplain likewise mr wilmot learnt that leonard though still only in the second stage of his penalty stood morally in a very different position and was relied on as a valuable assistant in all that was good more effective among his fellowprisoners than was possible to any one not in the same situation with themselves and fully accepting that position when in contact either with convicts or officials  he has never referred to what brought him here said the chaplain nor would i press him to do so but his whole tone is of repentance and acceptance of the penalty without like most of them regarding it as expiation  it is this that renders his example so valuable among the men  after such a report as this it was disappointing on dr mays next visit to portland at two months end to find leonard drooping and downcast  the doctor was dismayed at his pale dejected stooping appearance and the silence and indifference with which he met their ordinary topics of conversation till the doctor began anxiously  you are not well  quite well thank you  you are looking out of condition  do you sleep  some part of the night  you want more exercise  you should apply to go back to the carpenters shopor shall i speak to the governor  no thank you i believe they want me in school  and you prefer school work  i dont know but it helps the master  do you think you make any progress with the men  we heard you were very effective with them  i dont see that much can be done any way certainly not by me  then the doctor tried to talk of henry and the sisters but soon saw that leonard had no power to dwell upon them  the brief answers were given with a stern compression and contraction of face as if the manhood that had grown on him in these three years was no longer capable of the softening effusion of grief and dr may with all his tenderness felt that it must be respected and turned the conversation  i have been calling at the castle he said with ernescliffe and the governor showed me a curious thing a volume of archbishop usher which had been the duke of lauderdales study after he was taken at worcester  he has made a note in the flyleaf i began this book at windsor and finished it during my imprisonment here and below are mottoes in hebrew greek and latin  i cant construe the hebrew the greek is oisteon kai elpisteon one must bear and hope the latin is durate  will you accept your predecessors legacy  i think i read about him in an account of the island said leonard with a moments awakened intelligence was he not the l of the cabal the persecutor in old mortality  i am afraid you are right  prosperity must have been worse for him than adversity  endure repeated leonard gravely  i will think of that and what he would mean by hope now  the doctor came home much distressed he had been unable to penetrate the dreary resolute selfcommand that covered so much anguish he had failed in probing or in healing and feared that the apathy he had witnessed was a sign that the sustaining spring of vigour was failing in the monotonous life  the strong endurance had been a strain that the additional grief was rendering beyond his power and the crushed resignation and air of extinguished hope together with the indications of failing health filled the doctor with misgivings  it will not last much longer he said  i do not mean that he is ill but to hold up in this way takes it out of a man especially at his age  the first thing that lays hold of him he will have no strength nor will to resist and thenwell i did hope to live to see god show the right     chapter xxiv    we twa hae wandered oer the braes     and pued the gowans fine   ive wandered many a weary foot     sin auld lang syne   these years had passed quietly at stoneborough with little change since marys marriage  she was the happy excellent wife that she was made to be and perhaps it was better for ethel that the first severance had been so decisive that marys attentions to her old home were received as favours instead of as the mere scanty relics of her former attachment  mr cheviot as the family shook down together became less afraid of ethel and did not think it so needful to snub her either by his dignity or jocularity though she still knew that she was only on terms of sufferance and had been more than once made to repent of unguarded observations  he was admirable and the school was so rapidly improving that norman had put his father into ecstasies by proposing to send home little dickie to begin his education there moreover the one element wanting to accomplish the town improvements had been supplied by a headmaster on the side of progress and dr spencers victory had been won at last  there was a chance that stoneborough might yet be clean thanks to his reiteration of plans for purification apropos to everything  baths and washhouses were adroitly carried as a monument to prince albert and on the prince of waless marriage his perseverance actually induced the committee to finish up the drains with all the contributions that were neither eaten up nor fired away  never had he been more happy and triumphant and dr may used to accuse him of perambulating the lower streets snuffing the deodorized air  one autumn evening contrary to his wont he allowed himself to be drawn into the may drawingroom and there fell into one of the bright bantering talks in which the two old friends delighted quizzing each other and bringing up stories of their life while ethel and gertrude listened to and laughed at the traditions of a sunnier gayer and more reckless age than their own and ethel thought how insufficient are those pictures of life that close with the feverdream of youthful passion and leave untold those years of the real burthen of manhood and still more the tranquil brightness when toil has been overlived and the setting sun gilds the clouds that are drifting away  ethels first knowledge of outer life the next morning was the sound of voices in her fathers adjoining room which made her call out are you sent for papa  yes he answered and in an agitated tone spencer ill send word  should she mention what she had two years ago heard from tom  there was no time for the next moment she heard him hurrying downstairs she saw him speeding up the garden  there was nothing for her to do but to dress as fast as possible and as she was finishing she heard his tread slowly mounting the very footfall warning her what to expect  she opened the door and met him  thank god he said as he took her hand into his own it has been very merciful  is it  yes  it must have been soon after he lay down at night  as calm as sleep  the heart  i am very thankful  i had thought he would have had much to suffer  and then it appeared that his own observations had made him sure of what ethel had learnt from tom but as long as it was unavowed by his friend he had thought himself bound to ignore it and had so dreaded the protracted suffering that the actual stroke was accepted as a loving dispensation  still as the close of a lifelong friendship the end of a daily refreshing and sustaining intimacy the loss was very great and would be increasingly felt after the first stimulus was over  it would make toms defection a daily grievance since much detail of hospital care and above all town work his chief fatigue would now again fall upon him  but this was not his present thought  his first care was that his friends remains should rest with those with whom his lot in life had been cast in the cloister of the old grammarschool but here mr cheviot looked concerned and with reluctance but decision declared it to be his duty not to consent cited the funeral of one of his scholars at the cemetery and referred to recent sanatory measures  dr may quickly exclaimed that he had looked into the matter and that the cloister did not come under the act  not technically sir said mr cheviot but i am equally convinced of my duty however much i may regret it  and then with a few words about marys presently coming up he departed while that is too bad was the general indignant outburst even from richard from all but dr may himself  he is quite right he said  dear spencer would be the first to say so  richard your church is his best monument and youll not shut him out of your churchyard nor me either  cheviot could not have meant began richard  yes he did i understood him and i am glad you should have had it out now said dr may though not without a quivering lip  your mother has one by her side and well find each other out just as well as if we were in the cloister  ill walk over to cocksmoor with you ritchie and mark the place  thus sweetly did he put aside what might have been so severe a shock and he took extra pains to show his soninlaw his complete acquiescence both for the present and the future  charles cheviot expressed to richard his great satisfaction in finding sentiment thus surmounted by sense not perceiving that it was faith and love surmounting both  dr spencers only surviving relation was a brothers son who on his arrival proved to be an underbred shrewdlooking man evidently with strong prepossessions against the may family whose hospitality he did not accept consorting chiefly with bramshaw and anderson his disposition to reverse the arrangement for burying his uncle in an obscure village churchyard occasioned a reference to the will drawn up two years previously  the executors were thomas and etheldred may and it was marked on the outside that they were to have the sole direction of the funeral  ethel greatly astonished but as much bewildered as touched was infinitely relieved that this same day had brought a hurried note from paris announcing toms intention of coming to attend the funeral  he would be able to talk to the angry and suspicious nephew without like his father betraying either indignation or disgust  another person was extremely anxious for toms arrival namely sir matthew fleet who not a little to dr mays gratification came to show his respect to his old fellowstudent and arriving the evening before tom was urgent to know the probabilities of his appearance an appointment in london was about to be vacant so desirable in itself and so valuable an introduction that there was sure to be a great competition but sir matthew was persuaded that with his own support and an early canvass tom might be certain of success  dr may could not help being grateful and gratified declaring that the boy deserved it and that dear spencer would have been very much pleased and then he told ethel that it was wonderful to see the blessing upon maggies children and went back as usual to his dear old tate and brady with    his house the seat of wealth shall be   an inexhausted treasury   his justice free from all decay   shall blessings to his heirs convey   and ethel within herself hoped it was no disrespect to smile at his having so unconsciously turned away the blessing from the fathers to the mothers side  it was his great pride and pleasure that so many of maggies children were round him to do honour to her old friends burialthree sons and four daughters and three sonsinlaw  they all stood round the grave as near as might be to the stone that gertrude as a child had laid under his care when his silver hair had mingled with her golden locks and with them was a concourse that evidently impressed the nephew with a new idea of the estimation in which his uncle had been held  tom had travelled all night and had arrived only just in time nobody was able to say a word to him before setting off and almost immediately after the return sir matthew fleet seized upon him to walk up to the station with him and to the infinite disgust of the nephew the reading of the will was thus delayed until the executor came back extremely grave and thoughtful  after all mr spencer had no available grievance  his uncles property was very little altogether amounting scarcely to a thousand pounds but the bulk was bequeathed to the nephew to aubrey may was left his watch and a piece of plate presented to him on his leaving india to dr may a few books to tom the chief of his library his papers notes and instruments and the manuscript of a work upon diseases connected with climate on which he had been engaged for many years but had never succeeded in polishing to his own fastidious satisfaction or in coming to the end of new discoveries to etheldred his only legacy was his writingdesk with all its contents  and mr spencer looked so suspicious of those contents that tom made her open it before him and show that they were nothing but letters  it had been a morning of the mixture of feelings and restless bustle so apt to take place where the affection is not explained by relationship and when the strangers were gone and the family were once again alone there was a drawing of freer breath and the doctor threw himself back in his chair and indulged in a long heavy sigh with a weary sound in it  can i go anywhere for you father said tom turning to him with a kind and respectful manner  oh nono thank you he said rousing himself and laying his hand on the bell i must go over to overfield but i shall be glad of the drive  well dr tom what did you say to fleets proposal  i said i would come up to town and settle about it when i had got through this executor business  you always were a lucky fellow tom said dr may trying to be interested and sympathetic  you would not wish for anything better  i dont know i have not had time to think about it yet said tom pulling off his spectacles and pushing back his hair with an action of sadness and fatigue  ah it was not the best of times to choose for the communication but it was kindly meant  i never expected to see fleet take so much trouble for any one  but you are done up tom with your night journey  not at all he answered briskly if i can do anything for you could not i go down to the hospital  why if i were not to be back till five began dr may considering and calling him into the hall to receive directions from which he came back saying there now then ethel we had better look over things and get them in train  you are so tired tom  not too much for that he said  but it was a vain boast he was too much fatigued to turn his mind to business requiring thought though capable of slow languid reading and sorting of papers  aubreys legacy was discovered with much difficulty  in fact it had never been heard of nor seen the light since its presentation and was at last found in a lumber closet in a strong box in indian packing  it was a compromise between an epergne and a candelabrum growing out of the howdah of an unfortunate elephant pinning one tiger to the ground and with another hanging on behind in the midst of a jungle of palmtrees and cobras and beneath was an elaborate inscription so laudatory of aubrey spencer m d that nobody wondered he had never unpacked it and that it was yellow with tarnishthe only marvel was that he had never disposed of it but that it was likely to wait for the days when aubrey might be a general and own a sideboard  the other bequests were far more appreciated  tom had known of the book in hand was certain of its value to the faculty and was much gratified by the charge of it both as a matter of feeling and of interest  but while he looked over and sorted the mass of curious notes his attention was far more set on the desk that reverently almost timidly ethel examined well knowing why she had been selected as the depositary of these relics  there they were some embrowned by a burn in the corner as though there had been an attempt to destroy them in which there had been no heart to persevere  it was but little after all two formal notes in which professor norman mackenzie asked the honour of mr spencers company to dinner but in handwriting that was none of the professorswriting better known to ethel than to tomand a series of their fathers letters from their first separation till the travellers own silence had caused their correspondence to drop  charming letters they were such as people wrote before the pennypost had spoilt the epistolary artlong minute and overflowing with brilliant happiness  several of them were urgent invitations to stoneborough and one of these was finished in that other handthe delicate wellrounded writing that would not be inheritedentreating dr spencer to give a few days to stoneborough it would be such a pleasure to richard to show him the children  ethel did not feel sure whether to see these would give pain or pleasure to her father  he would certainly be grieved to see how much suffering he must have inflicted in the innocence of his heart and in the glory of his happiness and tom with a sort of shudder advised her to keep them to herself he was sure they would give nothing but pain  she had no choice just then for it was a time of unusual occupation and the difference made by their loss told immediatelythe more perhaps because it was the beginning of november and there was much municipal business to be attended to  however it might be for the future during the ensuing week dr may never came in for a meal with the rest of the family was too much fagged for anything but sleep when he came home at night and on the sunday morning when they all had reckoned on going to cocksmoor together he was obliged to give it up and only come into the minster at the end of the prayers  every one knew that he was not a good manager of his time and this made things worse and he declared that he should make arrangements for being less taken up but it was sad to see him overburthened and tom as only a casual visitor could do little to lessen his toil though that little was done readily and attentively  there were no rubs between the two and scarcely any conversation  tom would not discuss his prospects and it was not clear whether he meant to avail himself of sir matthews patronage he committed himself to nothing but his wish that it were possible to stay in paris and he avoided even talking to his sister  not till a week after he had left home for london came a letter   dear ethel  i have told fleet that i am convinced of my only right course  i could never get the book finished properly if i got into his line and i must have peaceable evenings for it at home  i suppose my father would not like to let dr spencers house  if i might have it and keep my own hours and habits i think it would conduce to our working better together  i am afraid i kept you in needless distress about him but i wanted to judge for myself of the necessity and to think over the resignation of that quest  i must commit it to brown i hope it is not too great a risk but it cant be helped  it is a matter of course that i should come home now the helper is gone i always knew it would come to that  manage it as quietly as you can i must go to paris for a fortnight to bring home my things and by that time my father had better get me appointed to the hospital  yours ever   th may   ethel was not so much surprised as her father who thought she must have been working upon toms feelings but this she disavowed except that it had been impossible not to growl at patients sending at unreasonable hours  then he hoped that fleet had not been disappointing the lad but this notion was nullified by a remonstrance from the knight on the impolicy of burying such talents for the sake of present help and even proposing to send a promising young man in toms stead  not too good for poor stoneborough said dr may smiling  no no im not so decrepit as that whatever he and tom may have thought me i fancy i could tire out both of them i cant have the poor boy giving up all his prospects for my sake ethel  i never looked for it and i shall write and tell him so mind ethel i shall write not you  i know you would only stroke him down and bring him home to regret it  no no i wont always be treated like karl in debit and credit who the old giant thought could neither write nor be written to because his finger was off  and dr mays letter was the first which this son had ever had from him   my dear tom  i feel your kind intentions to the heart it is like all the rest of your dear mothers children but the young ought not to be sacrificed to the old and i wont have it done  the whole tone of practice has altered since my time and i do not want to bind you down to the routine  i had left off thinking of it since i knew of your distaste i have some years of work in me yet that will see out most of my old patients and for the rest wright is a great advance on poor ward and i will leave more to him as i grow older  i mean to see you a great man yet and i think you will be the greater and happier for the sacrifice you have been willing to make  his blessing on you  your loving father   r m   what was toms answer but one of his cool good letters a demonstration that he was actuated by the calmest motives of convenience and selfinterest in preferring the certainties of stoneborough to the contingencies of london and that he only wanted time for study and the completion of dr spencers book enforcing his request for the house  his resolution was as usual too evident to be combated and it was also plain that he chose to keep on the mask of prudent selfishness which he wore so naturally that it was hard to give him credit for any other features but this time dr may was not deceived  he fully estimated the sacrifice and would have prevented it if he could but he never questioned the sincerity of the motive as it was not upon the surface and the token of dutiful affection as coming from the least likely quarter of his family touched and comforted him  he dwelt on it with increasing satisfaction and answered all hurries and worries with i shall have time when tome is come reopened old schemes that had died away when he feared to have no successor and now and then showed a certain comical dread of being drilled into conformity with toms orderly habits  there was less danger of their clashing as the son had outgrown the presumptions of early youth and a change had passed over his nature which ethel had felt rather than seen during his fleeting visits at home more marked by negatives than positives and untraced by confidences  the bitterness and selfassertion had ceased to tinge his words the uncomfortable doubt that they were underlaid by satire had passed away and methodical and selfpossessed as he always was the atmosphere of number one was no longer apparent round all his doings he could be out of spirits and reserved without being either illtempered or ironical and ethel with this as the upshot of her weeks observations was reassured as to the hopes of the father and son working together without collisions  as soon as the die was cast and there was no danger of undue persuasion in stroking him down she indulged herself by a warmlygrateful letter and after she had sent it was tormented by the fear that it would be a great offence  the answer was much longer than she had dared to expect and alarmed her lest it should be one of his careful ways of making the worst of himself but there was a large private scored in almost menacing letters on the top of the first sheet and so much blotted in the folding that it was plain that he had taken alarm at the unreserve of his own letter   my dear ethel  i have been to portland  really my father ought to make a stir and get wards health attended to he looks very much altered but will not own to anything being amiss  they say he has been depressed ever since he heard of minnas death  i should say he ought to be doing outofdoors workperhaps at gibraltar but then he would be out of our reach  i could not get much from him but that patient contented look is almost more than one can bear  it laid hold of me when i saw him the first time and has haunted me ever since  verily i believe it is what is bringing me home  you need not thank me for it is sober calculation that convinces me that no success on earth would compensate for the perpetual sense that my father was wearing himself out and you pining over the sight  except just at first i always meant to come and see how the land lay before pledging myself to anything and nothing can be clearer than that in the state of things my father has allowed to spring up he must have help  i am glad you have got me the old house for i can be at peace there till i have learnt to stand his unmethodical ways  dont let him expect too much of me as i see he is going to do  it is not in me to be like norman or harry and he must not look for it least of all now if you did not understand and know when to hold your tongue i do not think i could come home at all as it is you are all the comfort i look for  i cross to paris tomorrow that is a page i am very sorry to close  i had a confidence that i should have hunted down that fellow and the sight of portland and the accounts from massissauga alike make one long to have ones hands on his throat but that hope is ended now and to loiter about paris in search of him when it it a plain duty to come away would be one of the presumptuous acts that come to no good  let them discuss what they will theres nothing so hard to believe in as divine justice  and yet that uncomplaining face accepts it  you need say nothing about this letter  i will talk about leonard with my father when i get home  ever yours   thomas may     chapter xxv    but soon as once the genial plain   has drunk the lifeblood of the slain   indelible the spots remain     and aye for vengeance call   till racking pangs of piercing pain     upon the guilty fall                    aeschylus translated by professor anstice   if tom mays arrival at home was eagerly anticipated there it was with a heavy heart that he prepared for what he had never ceased to look on as a treadmill life  he had enjoyed paris both from the society and the abstract study since he still retained that taste for theory rather than practice which made him prefer diseases to sick people and all sick people to those of stoneborough  the student life in the freedom of a foreign capital was even while devoid of license and irregularity much pleasanter than what he foresaw at home even though he had obtained a separate establishment  his residence at paris with the vague hope it afforded cost him more in the resignation than his prospects in london  it was the week when he would have been canvassing for the appointment and he was glad to linger abroad out of reach of sir matthews remonstrances and his fathers compunction while he was engaged in arranging for a french translation of dr spencers book and likewise in watching an interesting case esteemed a great medical curiosity at the hotel dieu  he was waiting in the lectureroom when one of the house surgeons came in saying ah i am glad to see you here  a compatriot of yours has been brought in mortally injured in a gambling fray  you may perhaps assist in getting him identified  tom followed him to the accident ward and beheld a senseless figure with bloated and discoloured features distorted by the effects of the injury a blow upon the temple which had caused a fall backwards on the sharp edge of a stove occasioning fatal injury to the spine albeit well accustomed to gaze critically upon the tokens of mortal agony tom felt an unusual shudder of horror and repugnance as he glanced on the countenance so disfigured and contorted that there was no chance of recognition and turned his attention to the clothes which lay in a heap on the floor  the contents of the pockets had been taken out and consisted only of some pawnbrokers duplicates a cigarcase and a memorandumbook which last he took in his hand and began to unfasten without looking at it while he took part in the conversation of the surgeons on the technical nature of the injuries thus he stood for some seconds before on the house surgeon asking if he had found any address he cast his eyes on the pages which lay open in his hand  ha  what have you foundhe does not hear  is it the portrait of the beloved object  is it a brotheran enemyor a debt  but he is truly transfixed  it is an effect of the gorgons head   july 15th 1860  received £120                               l a ward   there stood tom may like one petrified deaf to the words around his dazzled eyes fixed on the letters his faculties concentrated in the endeavour to ascertain whether they were sight or imagination yes there they were the very words in the wellknown writing the schoolboys forming into the clerks there was the blot in the top of the l  toms heart gave one wild bound then all sensation except the sight of the writing ceased the exclamations of those around him came surging gradually on his ear as if from a distance and he did not yet hear them distinctly when he replied alertly almost lightly here is a name that surprises me  let me look at the patient again  no dear friend asked his chief intimate in a tone ready to become gaiety or sympathy  no indeed said tom shuddering as he stood over the insensible wretch and perceived what it had been which had thrilled him with such unwonted horror for fixed by the paralyzing convulsion of the fatal blow he saw the scowl and grin of deadly malevolence that had been the terror of his childhood and that had fascinated his eyes at the moment of leonards sentence  changed by debauchery defaced by violence contorted by the injured brain the features would scarcely have been recalled to him but for the frightful expression stamped on his memory by the miseries of his timid boyhood  whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed  the awful thought answering his own struggle for faith in divine justice crossed him as he heard the injury on the head defined in almost the same scientific terms that had so often rung on his ears as the causes of francis axworthys death but this was no society where he could give vent to his feelings and mastering himself with difficulty he answered  i know him  he is from my own town  has he friends or relations  relations yes said tom hardly able to restrain a trembling of the lip half horror half irony  none here none near  they shall know  and means  once he had  probably none now  to toms great relief a new case drew off general attention  there only remained the surgeon who had called him at first and with whom he was particularly intimate  gaspard he said shall you have charge of this case  brief charge it will be apparently  i will volunteer to watch it if it is your desire  is it friendship or enmity or simple humanity  all said tom hastily  it is the clearing up of a horrible mysteryfreedom for an innocent prisoneri must tell you the rest at leisure  there is much to be done now in case of his reviving  this was remotely possible but very doubtful and tom impressed on both gaspard and the nursing sister the most stringent entreaties to summon him on the first symptom  he then gave the name of the unhappy man and though unwilling to separate himself from that invaluable pocketbook perceived the necessity of leaving it as a deposit with the authorities of the hospital after he had fully examined it recognizing leonards description in each particular the cipher f a on the tarnished silver clasp the shagreen cover and the receipt on a page a little past the middle  on the other half of the leaf was the entry of some sums due to the house and it contained other papers which the guilty wretch had been evidently eager to secure yet afraid to employ and that no doubt were the cause that like so many other murderers on record he had preserved that which was the most fatal proof against himself  or could it be with some notion of future relenting that he had refrained from its destruction  with brain still seeming to reel at the discovery and limbs actually trembling with the shock tom managed to preserve sufficient coolness and discretion to bring back to mind the measures he had so often planned for any such contingency  calling a cabriolet he repaired to the policestation nearest to the scene of the contest and there learnt that axworthy had long been watched as a dangerous subject full of turbulence and with no visible means of maintenance  the officials had taken charge of the few personal effects in his miserable lodgings and were endeavouring to secure the person who had struck the fatal blow  his next measure was to go to the british embassy where through his sister floras introductions and his own eton connections he was already well known and telling his story there without any attempt to conceal his breathless agitation he had no difficulty in bringing with him a companion who would authenticate the discovery of the receipt and certify to any confession that might be obtained  a confession  that was the one matter of the most intense interest tom considered whether to secure the presence of a clergyman but suspected that this would put axworthy on his guard rather than soften him and therefore only wrote to the chaplain begging him to hold himself in readiness for a summons to the hotel dieu whither he drove rapidly back with his diplomatic friend whom he wrought up wellnigh to his own pitch of expectation  he had already decided on his own first addresspitying but manifesting that nothing not even vengeance could be gained by concealment and then according to the effect would he try either softening or threatening to extort the truth  gaspard was eagerly awaiting them  i had already sent for you he said  the agony is commencing he has spoken but he has not his full consciousness  tom hurried on drawing after him the young diplomate who would have hung back questioning if there were any use in his witnessing the dying struggles of a delirious man  come come peremptorily repeated tom there must be some last words  every moment is of importance  yet his trust was shaken by the perception of the progress that death had made in the miserable frame during his absence  the fixed expression of malignity had been forced to yield to exhaustion and anguish the lips moved but the murmurs between the moans were scarcely articulate  he is almost past it said tom but there is the one chance that he may be roused by my voice  and having placed his friend conveniently both for listening and making notes he came close to the bed and spoke in a tone of compassion axworthy i say axworthy is there anything i can do for you  there was a motion of the lid of the fastglazing eye but the terrible face of hatred came back with the audible words i tell you you old fool none of the mays are to come prying about my place  appalled by the deadly malice of the imprecation and the look that accompanied this partial recognition of his voice tom was nerving himself to speak again when the dying man as if roused by the echo of his own thought burst out who  what is it  i say dr may shall not be called in  he never attended the old man  let him mind his own business  i was all night at the three goblets  yes i was the new darling will catch itgoing off with the money upon him and the laugh made their blood run cold  ive got the receipt and he made an attempt at thrusting his hand under the pillow but failing swore shouted howled with his last strength that he had been robbedthe pocketbookit would hang him and with one of the most fearful shrieks of despair that had perhaps ever rung through that asylum of pain woe and death the wretched spirit departed  tom may turned aside made a few steps and to the infinite surprise of every one fell helplessly down in a swoon  a nature of deep and real sensibility though repressed by external reserve and prudence could not with entire impunity undergo such a scene  the sudden discovery the vehement excitement forced down the intense strain of expectation and finally the closing horror of such a death betraying the crime without repenting of it passing to the other world with imprecations on the lips and hatred in the glare of the eye all the frightfulness enhanced by the familiarity of the allusions and the ghastly association of the tones that had tempted and tyrannized over his childhood altogether crushed and annihilated his faculties mental and bodily  oh when our very hearts burn for justice how little do we know how intolerable would be the sight of it  toms caution and readiness returned as soon asafter a somewhat long intervalhe began to distinguish the voices round him and perceive the amazement he had created  before he was able to sit up on the couch where he had been laid out of sight of the scene which had affected him so strongly he was urging his friend to set down all that had been spoken and on gaspards writing a separate deposition  the pocketbook and other effects were readily ceded to the british authority and were carried away with them  how tom got through the remaining hours of the day and the night he never recollected though he knew it must have been in the bustle of preparation and that he had imparted the tidings to leonards friend brown for when he and his friend had attended that which answered to an inquest on the body and had obtained a report of the proceedings he was ready to start by the night train bearing with him the attestations of the deathbed scene at the hotel dieu and the longlost memorandumbook and was assured that the next mail would carry an official letter to the home office detailing the circumstances of samuel axworthys decease  brown came to bid him farewell full of gladness and warm congratulation which he longed to send to his friend but which tom only received with hasty halfcomprehending assents  late in the afternoon he reached stoneborough found no one come in and sat down in the firelight where for all his impatience fatigue had made him drop asleep when he was roused by gertrudes voice exclaiming here really is tom come as you said he would without writing  here are all his goods in the hall  is it you tom cried ethel  notice or no notice we are glad of you  but what is the matter  wheres my father  coming  charles cheviot took him down to look at one of the boys is there anything the matter she added after a pause  no nothing  you look very odd added gertrude  he gave a nervous laugh  you would look odd if you had travelled all night  they commented and began to tell home news but ethel noted that he neither spoke nor heard only listened for his father  gertrude grew tired of inattentive answers and said she should go and dress ethel was turning to follow when he caught hold of her cloak and drew her close to him  ethel he said in a husky stifled voice do you know this  on her knees by the red firelight she saw the l a ward and looked up  is it she said  he bowed his head  and then ethel put her arm round his neck as he knelt down by her and he found that her tears her rare tears were streaming down silent but irrepressible  she had not spoken had asked no question made no remark when dr mays entrance was heard and she loosed her hold on her brother out without rising from the floor looked up from under the shade of her hat and said o papa it is found and he has done it  look there  her choked voice and tokens of emotion startled the doctor but tom in a matteroffact tone took up the word how are you fatheryes i have only met with this little memorandum  dr may recognized it with a burst of incoherent inquiry and exclamation wringing toms hand and giving no time for an answer and indeed his son attempted nonetill calming himself the doctor subsided into his armchair and with a deep sigh exclaimed now then tom let us hear  where does this come from  from the casualty ward at the hotel dieu  and from  he is dead said tom answering the unspoken question  you will find it all here  ethel do i sleep here tonight  my old room as he spoke he bent to light a spill at the fire and then the two candles on the sidetable but his hand shook nervously and though he turned away his face his father and sister saw the paleness of his cheek and knew that he must have received a great shock neither spoke while he put one candle conveniently for his father took up the other and went away with it  with one inquisitive glance at each other they turned to the papers and with eager eyes devoured the written narratives of tom himself and of the attache then with no less avidity the french reports accompanying them hardly a word was spoken while ethel leant against her fathers knee and he almost singed his hair in the candle as they helped one another out in the difficulties of the crooked foreign writing  will it be enough asked ethel at last holding her breath for the answer  if there is justice in england said dr may  heaven forgive me ethel this business has tried my trust more than anything that ever befell me but it will all be right now and righter than right if that boy comes out what i think him  and oh how soon  not a moment longer than can be helped  id go up by the mail train this very night if it would do any good  tom who reappeared as soon as he had spared himself the necessity of the narration was willing and eager to set out but dr may who by this time had gathered some idea of what he had gone through and saw that he was restless nervous and unhinged began to reconsider the expedience of another night journey and was for once in his life the person cool enough to see that it would be wisest to call bramshaw into their counsels and only that night to send up a note mentioning that they would do themselves the honour of calling at the home office the next day on matters connected with the intelligence received that morning from the british embassy at paris  tom was disappointed he was in no mood for sitting still and far less for talking  as a matter of business he would elucidate any question but conversation on what he had witnessed was impossible to him and when gertrude with a girls lightness lamented over being balked of a confession and explanation he gravely answered that she did not know what she was talking of and his father led away from the subject indeed dr may was full of kindness and consideration being evidently not only grateful for the discovery but touched by his entire absence of exulting triumph and his strong sense of awe in the retribution  that changed and awestruck manner impressed both the sisters so that all the evening ethel felt subdued as by a strange shock and even through the night and morning could hardly realize that it was intense reliefjoy not sorrowthat made her feel so unlike herself and that the burthen was taken away from her heart  even then there was a trembling of anxiety  the prisoner might be set free but who could give back to him the sister who had pined away in exile or the three years of his youthful brightness  there might be better things in store but she knew she must not look again for the boy of ingenuous countenance whose chivalrous devotion to herself had had such a charm even while she tried to prize it at its lightest worth  it was foolish to recollect it with a pang but there was no helping it  in the great tragedy she had forgotten that the pretty comedy was over but she regretted it rather as she did the pleasant babydays of aubrey and gertrude  indeed during the day of suspense while the two physicians were gone to london taking with them the papers and a minute detail of the evidence at the trial gertrudes high spirits triumph over charles cheviot and desire to trumpet forth the good news were oppressive how many times that day was mab stroked and assured that her master would come back  and how often did the two sisters endeavour to persuade themselves that she was not grown broader in the back  mary was of course told early in the day but gertrude got less sympathy from her than answered to that damsels extortionate expectations for according to her wicked account marys little charlie had sneezed three times and his mamma must regret what sent all the medical science of stoneborough away by the early train  however tom came home at night  the interview had been satisfactory the letters received in the morning had prepared the way and revived the recollection of the unsatisfactory case of leonard axworthy ward and of the representations of the then mayor of market stoneborough after all the new lights upon the matter had been looked into the father and son had been assured that as soon as possible a free pardon should be issued so drawn up as to imply a declaration of innocencethe nearest possible approach to a reversal of the sentence and they further were told of a mention of his exemplary conduct in a late report from portland containing a request that he might be promoted to a post of greater influence and trust before the ordinary time of probation had passed  dr may was eager to be at portland at the same time as the pardon so to give leonard the first intelligence and to bring him home and he had warmly closed with toms offer to look after the work while he himself waited till the necessary forms had been complied with  he had absolutely begged toms pardon for going in his stead  it is your right he said but somehow i think as i have been more with him i might do better  to which tom had assented with all his heart and had added that he would not go if he were paid for it  he had further taken care that the doctor should take with him a suit of clothes for leonard to come home in and had himself made the selection then came back with the tidings that filled the house with the certainty of joy and the uncertainty of expectation  nobody was however in such a fever as tom himself  he was marvellously restless all the morning  gertrude asserted it was because he was miserable at not venturing to set his fathers study to rights and to be sure he was seen looking round at the litter with a face of great disgust and declaring that he was ashamed to see a patient in a room in such a mess  but this did not fully account for his being in and out backwards and forwards all the morning looking wistfully at ethel and then asking some trivial question about messages left for his father or matters respecting his own new abode where he kept on dr spencers old housekeeper and was about to turn in paperers and painters  he had actually brought a drawingroom paper from paris a most delicate and graceful affair much too ladylike for the old house as daisy told him when she pursued him and her sister down to a consultation  late in the afternoon as the sisters were coming up the high street they met him setting out in hectors dogcart  oh i say ethel he said drawing up do you like a drive out to chilford  heres a note come to ask my father to see the old lady there and i want some one to give me courage to be looked at like the curate in the pulpit instead of the crack preacher  it was an offer not to be despised though ethel knew what a waiting there would be and what a dark drive home  up she jumped and tom showed his usual thoughtfulness by ordering gertrude to run home and fetch her muff and an additional cloak tucking her up himself with the carriage rug  that affection of toms had been slow in coming but always gave her a sense of gratitude and enjoyment  they drove all the seven miles to chilford without twenty words passing between them and when there she sat in the road and watched one constellation after another fill up its complement of stars as well as the moon permitted wondering whether toms nearsighted driving would be safe in the dark but her heart was so light so glad that she could not be afraid she did not care how long she waited it was only sitting still to recollect that deliverance had come to the captiveleonard was freefree as heart can think or eye can see as would keep ringing in her ears like a joybell and some better things too  until the time came that his cause was known the word of the lord tried him  whether she were really too happy to note time or that gossipry was deducted from the visit tom certainly returned sooner than her experience had led her to expect made an exclamation of dismay at finding the machine was innocent of lamps and remounted to his seat prepared to be extremely careful  i could not get them to take me for my father in a new wig he said but it was a very easygoing rheumatic case and i think i satisfied her  then on he drove for a mile till he was out of the bad crosscountry road and at last he said ethel i have made up my mind  theres no press of work just now and i find it is advisable i should go to america before i get into harness here  to america  yes about this book of dear old spencers  it is a thing that must be complete and i find he was in correspondence with some men of science there  i could satisfy my mind on a few points which would make it infinitely more valuable you seeand get it published there too  i know my father would wish every justice to be done to it  i know he would and continued ethel as innocently as she could shall you see the wards  why said tom in his deliberate voice that is just one thing i want particularly to see henry  i had a talk with wright this morning and he tells me that young baines at whitford is going to the dogs and the practice coming in to him  he thinks of having a partner and i put out a feeler in case henry ward should choose to come back and found it might do very well  but the proposal must come from him and theres no time to be lost so i thought of setting out as soon as i hear my father is on his way back  not waiting to see leonard  i did see him not a month ago  besides and his voice came to a sudden end  yes the first news said ethel  indeed it is due to you tom  ten minutes more of silence  ethel did she ever tell you  never said ethel her heart beating  then how did you know all about it  i didnt know  i only saw  saw what  that you were very much distressed  and very kind and rational you were about it said tom warmly i never thought any woman could have guessed so much without making mischief  but you must not put any misconstruction on my present intention  all i mean to do as yet is to induce henry to remove them out of that dismal swamp and bring them home to comfort and civilization  then it may be time to  he became silent and ethel longed ardently to ask further but still she durst not and he presently began again  ethel was i very intolerable that winter of the volunteers when harry was at home  you are very much improved since she answered  thats just like flora  answer like yourself  well you were  you were terribly rampant in eton refinement and very anxious to hinder all the others from making fools of themselves  i remember  i thought you had all got into intimacies that were for nobodys good and i still think it was foolish  i know it has done for me  well hastily catching up this last admission as if it had dropped out at unawares you think i made myself disagreeable  on principle  ah then you would not wonder at what she saidthat she had never seen anything in me but contemptuous irony  i think sometimes feeling that you were satirical she took all your courtesy for ironywhatever you meant  i have heard other people say the same  but whenwas this on the daythe day you went to remonstrate  yes  i declare to you ethel that i had no conception of what i was going to do  i never dreamt that i was in for it  i knew she waswas attractiveand that made me hate to see harry with her and i could not bear her being carried off to this horrible placebut as to myself i never thought of it till i saw herwhite and broken and then came that old action ethel knew so well in her father of clearing the dew from the glasses and his voice was half sob and with no creature but that selfish brother to take care of her  i couldnt help it ethelno one couldand thisthis was her answer i dont wonder i had been a supercilious prig and i ought to have known better than to think i could comfort her  i think the remembrance must have comforted her since  whatwhat has she said anything  oh no she could not you know  but i am sure if it did anger her at the moment there must have been comfort in recollecting that even such a terrible trouble had not alienated you  and now  now thats just what i dont want  i dont want to stalk in and say heres the hero of romance that has saved your brother  i want to get her home and show her that i can be civil without being satirical and then perhaps she would forgive me  forgive you  i mean forgiveness won not purchased  and after all you know it was mere accidentprovidence if you pleasethat brought me to that poor wretch all my plans of tracking him had come to an end any one else could have done what i did  she will not feel that said ethel but indeed tom i see what you mean and like it  it is yourself and not the conferrer of the benefit that you want her to care for  exactly said tom  and ethel i must have seen her and judged of my chance before i can be good for anything  i tried to forget itown it as a lucky escapea mere passing matter like harrys affairsbut i could not do it  perhaps i could if things had gone well but that dear face of misery that i only stung by my attempts to comfort would stick fast with me and to go and see leonard only brought it more home  it is a horrid bad speculation and flora and cheviot and blanche will scout it but ethel youll help me through and my father will not mind i know  papa will feel as i do tomthat it has been your great blessing turn out as it may  hm has it  a blessing on the wrong side of ones mouthto go about with a barb one knew one was a fool for and yet couldnt forget well i know what you mean and i believe it was  i would not have had it annihilated when the first mood was over  it was that which made it so hard to you to come home was it not  yes but it was odd enough however hard it was to think of coming you always sent me away more at peace ethel  i cant think how you did it knowing nothing  i think you came at the right time  you see i did think that while spencer lived i might follow up the track and see a little of the worldtry if that would put out that face and voice  but it wont do  if this hadnt happened i would have tied myself down and done my best to get comfort out of you and the hospital and these diseases of climatei suppose one might in time if things went well with her but as it is i cant rest till i have seen if they can be got home again  so ethel dont mind if i go before my father comes home  i cant stand explanations with him and i had rather you did not proclaim this you see the book and getting henry home are really the reasons and i shant molest her againnonot till she has learnt to know what is irony  i think if you did talk it over with papa you would feel the comfort and know him better  well well i dare say but i cant do it ethel  either he shuts me up at first with some joke or and tom stopped but ethel knew what he meant  there was on her fathers side an involuntary absence of perfect trust in this son and on toms there was a character so sensitive that her fathers playfulness grated and so reserved that his demonstrative feelings were a still greater trial to one who could not endure outward emotion  besides added tom there is really nothingnothing to tell  im not going to commit myself  i dont know whether i ever shall  i was mad that day and i want to satisfy my mind whether i think the same now i am sane and if i do i shall have enough to do to make her forget the winter when i made myself such an ass  when i have done that it may be time to speak to my father i really am going out about the book  when did you hear last  that is what makes me anxious  i have not heard for two months and that is longer than she ever was before without writing except when minna was ill  we shall know if leonard has heard  no she always writes under cover to us  the course that the conversation then took did not look much like toms doubt whether his own views would be the same  all the longrepressed discussion of averils merits her beautiful eyes her sweet voice her refinement her real worth the wonder that she and leonard should be so superior to the rest of the family were freely indulged at last and ethel could give far heartier sympathy than if this had come to her three years ago  averil had been for two years her correspondent and the patient sweetness and cheerfulness of those letters had given a far higher estimate of her nature than the passing intercourse of the town life had left  the terrible discipline of these years of exile and sorrow had ethel could well believe worked out something very different from the wellintentioned wilful girl whose spirit of partisanship had been so fatal an element of discord  distance had in truth made them acquainted and won their love to one another  toms last words as he drew up under the limetrees before the door were mind i am only going about the diseases of climate     chapter xxvi      and bishop gawain as he rose   said wilton grieve not for thy woes          disgrace and trouble   for he who honour best bestows          can give thee doublemarmion   dr may had written to portland entreating that no communication might be made to leonard ward before his arrival and the good physicians affection for the prisoner had been so much observed that no one would have felt it fair to anticipate him  indeed he presented himself at the prison gates only two hours after the arrival of the documents when no one but the governor was aware of their contents  leonard was as usual at his business in the schoolmasters department and thither a summons was sent for him while dr may and the governor alone awaited his arrival  toms visit was still very recent and leonard entered with anxious eyes brow drawn together and compressed lips as though braced to meet another blow and the unusual room the presence of the governor instead of the warder and dr mays irrepressible emotion so confirmed the impression that his face at once assumed a resolute look of painful expectation  my boy said dr may clasping both his hands in his own you have borne much of ill  can you bear to hear good news  am i to be sent out to australia already said leonardfor a shortening of the eight years before his ticketofleave was the sole hope that had presented itself  sent out yes out to go wherever you please leonard  the right is come round  the truth is out  you are a free man  do you know what that is  it is a pardon  your pardon  all that can be done to right you my boybut it is as good as a reversal of the sentence  the doctor had spoken this with pauses going on as leonard instead of answering stood like one in a dream and at last said with difficulty who did it then  it was as you always believed  has he told said leonard drawing his brows together with the effort to understand  no leonard  the vengeance he had brought on himself did not give space for repentance but the pocketbook with your receipt was upon him and your innocence is established  and let me congratulate you added the governor shaking hands with him and add that all i have known of you has been as complete an exculpation as any discovery can be  leonards hand was passive his cheek had become white his forehead still knit  axworthy he said still as in a trance  yes  hurt in a brawl at paris  he was brought to the hotel dieu and my son tom was called to see him  sam axworthy repeated leonard putting his hand over his eyes as if one sensation overpowered everything else and thus he stood for some seconds to the perplexity of both  they showed him the papers he gazed but without comprehension and then putting the bag provided by tom into his hand they sent him moving in a sort of mechanical obedience into the room of one of the officials to change his dress  dr may poured out to the governor and chaplain who by this time had joined them the history of leonards generous behaviour at the time of the trial and listened in return to their account of the growing impression he had createda belief almost reluctant that instead of being their prime specimen he could only be in their hands by mistake he was too sincere not to have confessed had he been really guilty and in the long run such behaviour as his would have been impossible in one unrepentant  he had been the more believed from the absence of complaint demonstration or assertion and the constant endeavour to avoid notice coupled with the quiet thorough execution of whatever was set before him with all his might  this was a theme to occupy the doctor for a long time but at last he grew eager for leonards return and went to hasten him  he started up still in the convict garb the bag untouched  i beg your pardon he said when his friends exclamation had reminded him of what had been desired of him and in a few minutes he reappeared in the ordinary dress of a gentleman but the change did not seem to have made him realize his freedomthere was the same submissive manner the same conventional gesture of respect in reply to the chaplains warm congratulation  come leonard i am always missing the boat but i dont want to do so now  we must get home tonight  have you anything to take with you  my bible and prayerbook  they are my own sir as he turned to the governor  may i go to my cell for them  again they tarried long for him and became afraid that he had fallen into another reverie but going to fetch him found that the delay was caused by the farewells of all who had come in his way  the tidings of his full justification had spread and each official was eager to wish him good speed and thank him for the aid of his example and support the schoolmaster who had of late treated him as a friend kept close to him rejoicing in his liberation but expecting to miss him sorely and such of the convicts as were within reach were not without their share in the general exultation  he had never galled them by his superiority and though brown the clerk had been his only friend he had done many an act of kindness and when writing letters for the unlearned had spoken many a wholesome simple word that had gone home to the heart  his hand was as ready for a parting grasp from a fellowprisoner as from a warder and his thought and voice were recalled to leave messages for men out of reach his eyes moistened at the kindly felicitations but when he was past the ofttrodden precincts of the inner court and long galleries the passiveness returned and he received the last goodbyes of the governor and superior officers as if only half alive to their import  and thus silent calm and grave his composure like that of a man walking in his sleep did leonard ward pass the arched gateway enter on the outer world and end his three and a half years of penal servitude  im less like an angel than he is like st peter thought dr may as he watched the fixed dreamy gaze but this is like yet wist he not that it was true but thought he saw a vision  when will he realize liberty and enjoy it  i shall do him a greater kindness by leaving him to himself  and in spite of his impatience dr may refrained from disturbing that openeyed trance all the way down the long hill trusting to the crowd in the steamer for rousing him to perceive that he was no longer among russet coats and blue shirts but he stood motionless gazing or at least his face turned towards the dorset coast uttering no word making no movement save when summoned by his guidethen obeying as implicitly as though it were his jailor  so they came to the pier and so they walked the length of weymouth paced the platform and took their places in the train  just as they had shot beyond the town and come into the little wooded valleys beyond leonard turned round and with the first sparkle in his eye exclaimed trees  oh noble trees and hedges then turned again to look in enchantment at the passing groupsfar from noble though bright with autumn tintsthat alternated with the chalk downs  dr may was pleased at this revival and entertained at the start and glance of inquiring alarm from an old gentleman in the other corner presently in the darkness of a cutting again leonard spoke where are you taking me dr may  home of course  whatever the word might imply to the poor lad he was satisfied and again became absorbed in the sight of fields trees and hedgerows while dr may watched the tokens of secret dismay in their fellowtraveller who had no doubt understood home to mean his private asylum  indeed though the steady full dark eyes showed no aberration there was a strange deep cave between the lid and the eyebrow which gave a haggard look the spare worn grave features had an expressionnot indeed weak nor wandering but half bewildered half absorbed moreover in spite of toms minute selection of apparel it had been too hasty a toilette for the garments to look perfectly natural and the cropped head was so suspicious that it was no wonder that at the first station the old gentleman gathered up his umbrella with intense courtesy squeezed gingerly to the door carefully avoiding any stumble over perilous toes and made his escapeentering another carriage whence he no doubt signed cautions against the lunatic and his keeper since no one again invaded their privacy  perhaps this incident most fully revealed to the doctor how unlike other people his charge was how much changed from the handsome spirited lad on whom the trouble had fallen and he looked again and again at the profile turned to the window as fixed and set as though it had been carved  ah patience is an exhausting virtue said he to himself  verily it is bearingbearing up under the full weight and the long bent spring is the slower in rebounding in proportion to its inherent strength poor lad what protracted endurance it has been  there is health and force in his face no line of sin nor sickness nor worldly care such as it makes ones heart ache to see aging young faces yet how utterly unlike the face of one andtwenty  i had rather see it sadder than so strangely settled and sedate  shall i speak to him again  not yet those green hillsides those fields and cattle must refresh him better than my clavers after his grim stony mount of purgatory  i wish it were a brighter day to greet him instead of this gray damp fog  the said fog prevented any semblance of sunset but through the gray moonlit haze leonard kept his face to the window pertinaciously clearing openings in the bedewed glass as though the varying outline of the horizon had a fascination for him  at last after ten minutes of glaring gas at a junction had by contrast rendered the mist impenetrable and reduced the view to brightened clouds of steam and to white telegraphic posts erecting themselves every moment with their wires changing their perspective in incessant monotony he ceased his gaze and sat upright in his place with the same strange rigid somnambulist air  dr may resolved to rouse him  well leonard he said this has been a very long fever but we are well through it at lastwith the young doctor from paris to our aid  probably leonard only heard the voice not the words for he passed his hand over his face and looked up to the doctor saying dreamily let me see  is it all true and then with a grave wistful look it was not i who did that thing then  my dear exclaimed the doctor starting forward and catching hold of his hand have they brought you to this  i always meant to ask you if i ever saw you alone again said leonard  but you dont mean that you have imagined it  not constantlynot when any one was with me said leonard roused by dr mays evident dismay and drawn on by his face of anxious inquiry at milbank i generally thought i remembered it just as they described it in court and that it was some miserable ruinous delusion that hindered my confessing but the odd thing was that the moment any one opened my door i forgot all about it resolutions and all and was myself again  then surelysurely you left that horror with the solitude  yes till lately but when it did come back i could not be sure what was recollection of fact and what of my own fancy and he drew his brows together in painful effort  did i know who did it or did i only guess  you came to a right conclusion and would not let me act on it  and i really did write the receipt and not dream it  that receipt has been in my hand  it was what has brought you here and now to hearing ears dr may went over the narrative and leonard stood up under the little lamp in the roof of the carriage to read the papers  i recollecti understand he said presently and sat down grave and meditativeno longer dreamy but going over events which had at last acquired assurance to his memory from external circumstances presently his fingers were clasped together over his face his head bent and then he looked up and said do they know itmy sister and brother  no  we would not write till you were free  you must date the first letter from stoneborough  the thought had brought a bitter pang  one half year sooner and he leant back in his seat with fingers tightly pressed together and trembling with emotion  nay leonard may not the dear child be the first to rejoice in the fulfilment of her own sweet note of comfort  they could not harm the innocent  not innocent he said not innocent of causing all the discord that has ended in their exile and the dear childs death  then this is what has preyed on you and changed you so much more of late said dr may  when i knew that i was indeed guilty of her death said leonard in a calm full conviction of too long standing to be accompanied with agitation though permanently bowing him down  and you never spoke of this not to the chaplain  i never could  it would have implied all the rest that he could not believe  and it would not have changed the fact  the aspect of it may change leonard  you know yourself how many immediate causes combined of which you cannot accuse yourselfyour brothers wrongheadedness and all the rest  and added the doctor recovering himself you do see it in other aspects i know  think of the spirit set free to be near youfree from the world that has gone so hard with you  i cant keep that thought long im not worthy of it  again he was silent but presently said as with a sudden thought you would have told me if there were any news of ave  no there has been no letter since her last inclosure for you and then dr may gave the details from the papers on the doings of henrys division of the army  will henry let me be with them said leonard musingly  they will come home depend upon it  you must wait till you hear  leonard thought a little while then said where did you say i was to go dr may  where indeed  home leonardhome  ethel is waiting for us  to the high street  leonard looked up again with his bewildered face then said i know what you do with me will be right but  had you rather not said the doctor startled  rather and the doctor to his exceeding joy saw the fingers over his eyes moist with the tears they tried to hide i only meant he added with an effort you must think and judgei cant thinkwhether i ought  if you ask me that said dr may earnestly all i have to say is that i dont know what palace is worthy of you  there was not much said after that and the doctor fell asleep waking only at the halts at stations to ask where he was  at last came blewer and as the light shone on the clock leonard said a quarter past twelve  it is the very train i went by  is it a dream  ten minutes more and stoneborough was the cry  hastily springing out shuffling the tickets into the porters hand and grappling leonards arm as if he feared an escape dr may hurried him into the empty streets and strode on in silence  the pull at the doorbell was answered instantly by ethel herself she held out her hand and grasped that which leonard had almost withheld shrinking as from too sudden a vision and then she ardently exchanged kisses with her father  wheres tom  gone to bed said dr may stepping into the bright drawingroom  no said ethel demurely he is gonehe is gone to america  the doctor gave a prodigious start and looked at her again  he went this afternoon she said  there is some matter about the diseases of climate that he must settle before the book is published and he thought he could best be spared now  he has left messages that i will give you by and by but you must both be famished  her looks indicated that all was right and both turned to welcome the guest who stood where the first impulse had left him in the hall not moving forward till he was invited in to the fire and the meal already spread  he then obeyed and took the place pointed out while the doctor nervously expatiated on the cold damp and changes of train and ethel in the active bashfulness of hidden agitation made tea cut bread carved chicken and waited on them with double assiduity as leonard though eating as a man who had fasted since early morning was passive as a little child merely accepting what was offered to him and not even passing his cup till she held out her hand for it  she did not even dare to look at him she could not bear that he should see her do so it was enough to know that he was freethat he was therethat it was over  she did not want to see how it had changed him and half to set him at ease half to work off her own excitement she talked to her father and told him of the little events of his absence till the meal was over and at halfpast one good nights were exchanged with leonard and the doctor saw him to his room then returned to his daughter on her own threshold  thats a thing to have lived for he said  ethel locked her hands together and looked up  and now how about this other denouement  i might have guessed that the wind sat in that quarter  but youre not to guess it papa  it is really and truly about the diseases of climate  swamp fevers eh and agues  the if you can help it was a great comfort now ethel could venture on saying of course that has something to do with it but he really does make the book his object and pleaseplease dont give any hint that you suspect anything else  i suppose you are in his confidence and i must ask no questions  i hated not telling you and letting you tease him but he trusted me just enough not to make me dare to say a word though i never was sure there was a word to say  now do just once own papa that tom is the romantic one after all to have done as he did in the height of the trouble  well in his place so should i said the doctor with the perverseness of not satisfying expectations of amazement  you would said ethel but tom would you have thought it of tom  tom has more in him than shows through his spectacles answered dr may  so  thats the key to his restless fit  poor fellow  how did it go with him  they have not been carrying it on all this time surely  oh no no papa  she cut him to the heart poor boy thought he was laughing at hertold him it had all been irony  he has no notion whether she will ever forgive him  a very good lesson master doctor thomas said dr may with a twinkle in his eye and turn out as it will it has done him goodtided him over a dangerous time of life  well you must tell me all about it tomorrow im too sleepy to know what im talking of  the sleepiness that always finished off the doctors senses at the right moment was a great preservative of his freshness and vigour but ethel was far from sharing it and was very glad when the clock sounded a legitimate hour for getting up and dressing by candlelight briefly answering gertrudes eager questions on the arrival it was a pouring wet morning and she forbade daisy to go to churchindeed it would have been too bad for herself on any morning but thisany but this as she repeated smiling at her own spring of thankfulness as she fortified herself with a weight of waterproof and came forth in the darkness of 745 on a grim november day  a few steps before her pacing on umbrellaless was a figure which made her hurry to overtake him  o leonard after your journey and in this rain  he made a gesture of courtesy but moved as if to follow not join her did he not know whether he were within the pale of humanity  here is half an umbrella  wont you hold it for me she said and as he followed his instinct of obedience she put it into his hand and took his arm thinking that this familiarity would best restore him to a sense of his regained position and moreover feeling glad and triumphant to be thus leaning and to have that strong arm to contend with the driving blast that came howling round the corner of minster street and fighting for their shelter  they were both out of breath when they paused to recover in the deep porch of the minster  is dr may come home  yesand  ethel signed and mr wilmot held out an earnest hand with this is well  i am glad to see you  thank you sir said leonard heartily and for all  this is your new beginning of life leonard  god bless you in it  as mr wilmot passed on ethel for the first time ventured to look up into the eyesand saw their hollow setting their loss of sparkle but their added steadfastness and resolution  she could not help repeating the longtreasured lines and leonard                            grieve not for thy woes                     disgrace and trouble                     for he who honour best bestows                        shall give thee double   ive never ceased to be glad you read marmion with me he hastily said as they turned into church on hearing a clattering of choristers behind them  clara might have had such sensations when she bound the spurs on her knights heels yet even she could hardly have had so pure unselfish and exquisite a joy as ethels in receiving the pupil who had been in a far different school from hers  the gray dawn through the gloom the depths of shadow in the twilight church softening and rendering all more solemn and mysterious were more in accordance than bright and beamy sunshine with her subdued grave thankfulness and there was something suitable in the fewness of the congregation that had gathered in the lady chapelso few that there was no room for shyness either in or for him who was again taking his place there with steady composed demeanour its stillness concealing so much  ethel had reckoned on the versethat he might hear the mournings of such as are in captivity and deliver the children appointed unto death  but she had not reckoned on its falling on her ears in the deep fulltoned melodious bass that came in giving body to the young notes of the choristersa voice so altered and mellowed since she last had heard it that it made her look across in doubt and recognize in the uplifted face that here indeed the freed captive was at home and lifted above himself  when the clause in the litany for all prisoners and captives brought to her the thrill that she had only to look up to see the fulfilment of many and many a prayer for one captive for once she did not hear the response only saw the bent head as though there were thoughts went too deep to find voice  and again there was the special thanksgiving that mr wilmot could not refrain from introducing for one to whom a great mercy had been vouchsafed if ethel had had to swim home she would not but have been there  charles cheviot addressed them as they came out of church good morningmr ward i hope to do myself the honour of calling on youi shall see you again ethel  and off he went over the glazy stones to his own house ethel knowing that this cordial salutation and intended call were meant to be honourable amends for his suspicions but leonard unconscious of the import and scarcely knowing indeed that he was addressed made his mechanical gesture of respect and looked up down and round absorbed in the scene  how exactly the same it all looks he said the cloister gate and the swan and the postman in the very same waterproof cape  do you not feel like being just awake  no it is more like being a ghost or somebody else  then the wind drove them on too fast for speech till as they crossed the high street ethel pointed through the planetrees to two round black eyes and a shining black nose at the diningroom window  my mab my poor little mabyou have kept her all this time  i was afraid to ask for her  i could not hope it  i could not get my spoilt child gertrude to bed without taking mab that she might see the meeting  perhaps it served daisy right that the meeting did not answer her expectations  mab and her master had both grown older she smelt round him long before she was sure of him and then their content in one another was less shown by fervent rapture than by the quiet hand smoothing her silken coat and in return by her wistful eye nestling gesture gently waving tail  and leonard  how was it with him  it was not easy to tell in his absolute passiveness  he seemed to have neither will nor impulse to speak move or act though whatever was desired of him he did with the implicit obedience that no one could bear to see  they put books near him but he did not voluntarily touch one they asked if he would write to his sister and he took the pen in his hand but did not accomplish a commencement  ethel asked him if he were tired or had a headache  thank you no he said ill write and made a dip in the ink  i did not mean to tease you she said the mail is not going just yet and there is no need for haste  i was only afraid something was wrong  thank you he said submissively i willwhen i can think but it is all too strange  i have not seen a lady nor a room like this since july three years  after that ethel let him alone satisfied that peace was the best means of recovering the exhaustion of his longsuffering  the difficulty was that this was no house for quiet especially the day after the masters return the doorbell kept on ringing and each time he looked startled and nervous though assured that it was only patients  but at twelve oclock in rushed mr cheviots little brother with a note from mary lamenting that it was too wet for herself but saying that charles was coming in the afternoon and that he intended to have a dinnerparty of old stoneborough scholars to welcome leonard back  meanwhile martin cheviot wanting to see and not to stare and to unite cordiality and unconsciousness made an awkward mixture of all and did not know how to get away and before he had accomplished it mr edward anderson was announced  he heartily shook hands with leonard eagerly welcomed him and talked volubly and his last communication was if it clears you will see matilda this afternoon  i did not know she was here  yes she and harvey are come to mrs ledwichs to stay over sunday and there was a laugh in the corner of his eye that convinced ethel that the torrents of rain would be no protection  papa said she darting out to meet her father in the hall you must take leonard out in your brougham this afternoon if you dont want him driven distracted  if he is in the house ropes wont hold mrs harvey anderson from him  so dr may invited his guest to share his drive and the excitement began to seem unreal when the doctor returned alone  i dropped him at cocksmoor he said  it was richards notion that he would be quieter thereable to get out and go to church without being stared at  did he like it asked gertrude disappointed  if one told him to chop off his finger he would do it and never show whether he liked it  richard asked him and he said thank you  i never could get an opening to show him that we did not want to suppress him i never saw spirit so quenched  charles cheviot thought it was a mistake to do what gave the appearance of suppressionhe said that it was due to leonard to welcome him as heartily as possible and not to encourage false shame where there was no disgrace so he set his wife to fill up her cards for his dinnerparty and included in it mr and mrs harvey anderson for the sake of their warm interest in the liberated prisoner  however leonard was out of the scrape as the doctor expressed it for he had one of his severe sore throats and was laid up at cocksmoor  richard was dismayed by his passive obediencea novelty to the gentle eldest who had all his life been submitting and now was puzzled by his guests unfailing acquiescence without a token of preference or independence and comically amazed at the implicit fulfilment of his recommendation to keep the throat in beda wise suggestion but one that the whole house of may in their own persons would have scouted  nothing short of the highest authority ever kept them there  the semblance of illness was perhaps a good startingpoint for a return to the ways of the world and on the day week of his going to cocksmoor ethel found him by the fire beginning his letters to his brother and sister and looking brighter and more cheery but so devoid of voice that speech could not be expected of him  she had just looked in again after some parish visiting when a quick soldierly step was heard and in walked aubrey  no im not come to you ethel im only come to this fellow and he ardently grasped his hand  ive got leave till monday and i shall stay here and see nobody elsewhat a sore throat  couldnt you get wrapped up enough between the two doctors  leonards eyes lighted as he muttered his hoarse thank you and ethel lingered for a little desultory talk to her brother contrasting the changes that the three years had made in the two friends  aubrey drilled out of his home scholarly dreaminess by military and practical discipline had exchanged his native languor for prompt upright alertness of bearing and speech his eye had grown more steady his mouth had lost its vague pensive expression and was rendered sterner by the dark moustache definite thought purpose and action had moulded his whole countenance and person into hopeful manhood instead of visionary boyhood  the other face naturally the most full of fire and resolution looked strangely different in its serious unsmiling gravity the deeply worn stamp of patient endurance and utter isolation  there was much of rest and calm and even of contentbut withal a quenched look as if the lustre of youth and hope had been extinguished and the soul had been so driven in upon itself that there was no opening to receive external sympathya settled expression all the stranger on a face with the clear smoothness of early youth  one thing at least was unchangedthe firm friendship and affectionthat kept the two constantly casting glances over one another to assure themselves of the presence before them  ethel left them together and her father who made out that he should save time by going to cocksmoor church on sunday morning reported that the boys seemed very happy together in their own way but that richard reported himself to have been at the sole expense of conversation in the eveningthe only time such an event could ever have occurred  aubrey returned home late on the sunday evening and leonard set off to walk part of the way with him in the dusk but ended by coming the whole distance for the twilight opened their lips in this renewal of old habits  it is all right to be walking together again said aubrey warmly though it is not like those spring days  ive thought of them every sunday  and what are you going to do now old fellow  i dont know  i hear bramshaw is going to offer you to come into his office  now dont do that leonard whatever you do  i dont know  you are to have all your property back you know and you could do much better for yourself than that  i cant tell till i have heard from my brother  but leonard promise me nowyoull not go out and make a yankee of yourself  i cant tell i shall do what he wishes  aubrey presently found that leonard seemed to have no capacity to think or speak of the future or the past  he set aubrey off on his own concerns and listened with interest asking questions that showed him perfectly alive to what regarded his friend but the passive inaction of will and spirits still continued and made him almost a disappointment  on monday morning there was a squabble between the young engineer and the daisy who was a profound believer in the scientific object of toms journey and greatly resented the far too obvious construction thereof  you must read lots of bad novels at chatham aubrey it is like the fag end of the most trumpery of them all  you havent gone far enough in your mathematics you see daisy you think one and one  make two  so i say  ive gone into the higher branches  i didnt think you were so simple and commonplace  it would be so stupid to think he mustjust because he could not help making this discovery  all for want of the higher branches of mathematics  one plus oneequals one  one minus common sense plus folly plus romance minus anything to do  your equation is worthy of mrs harvey anderson  i gave her a good dose of the diseases of climate  aubrey was looking at ethel all the time gertrude was triumphing and finally he said ive no absolute faith in disinterested philanthropy to a younger brotherwhatever i had before i went to the tyrol  what has that to do with it asked gertrude  everybody was cut up and wanted a changeand you more than all  i do believe the possibility of a love affair absolutely drives people mad and now they must needs saddle it upon poor tomjust the one of the family who is not so stupid but has plenty of other things to think about  so you think it a stupid pastime  of course it is  why just look  hasnt everybody in the family turned stupid and of no use as soon at they went and fell in love only good old ethel here has too much sense and thats what makes her such a dear old gurgoyle  and harryhe is twice the fun after he comes home before he gets his fit of love  and all the story books that begin pleasantly the instant that love gets in they are just alikeso stupid  and now if you havent done it yourself you want to lug poor innocent tom in for it  when your time comes may i be there to see  he retreated from her evident designs of clapperclawing him and she turned round to ethel with now isnt it stupid ethel  very stupid to think all the zest of life resides in one particular feeling said ethel but more stupid to talk of what you know nothing about  aubrey put in his head for a hurried farewell and telegraph to me when mrs thomas may comes home  if mrs thomas may comes home ill  give her that chair cover said ethel and her idle needlewoman having been eight months working one corner of it went off into fits of laughter regarding its completion as an equally monstrous feat with an act of cannibalism on the impossible mrs thomas may  how different were these young things with their rhodomontade and exuberant animation and spirits from him in whom all the sparkle and aspiration of life seemed extinguished     chapter xxvii    a cup was at my lips it passd   as passes the wild desert blast               i wokearound me was a gloom   and silence of the tomb   but in that awful solitude   that little spirit by me stood   but oh how changed               thoughts in past years   under richards kind letalone system leonard was slowly recovering tone  first he took to ruling lines in the cocksmoor accountbooks then he helped in their audit and with occupation came the sense of the power of voluntary exertion  he went and came freely and began to take long rambles in the loneliest parts of the heath and plantations while richard left him scrupulously to his own devices and rejoiced to see them more defined and vigorous every day  the next stop was to assist in the nightschool where richard had hitherto toiled singlehanded among very rough subjects  the technical training and experience derived from leonards work under the schoolmaster at portland were invaluable and though taking the lead was the last thing he would have thought of he no sooner entered the school than attention and authority were there and richard found that what had to him been a vain and patient struggle was becoming both effective and agreeable  interest in his work was making leonard cheerful and alert though still grave and shrinking from noticeavoiding the town by daylight and only coming to dr mays in the dark evenings  on the last sunday in advent richard was engaged to preach at his original curacy and that the days before and after it should likewise be spent away from home was insisted on after the manner of the friends of hardworking clergy  he had the less dislike to going that he could leave his schoolwork to leonard who was to be housed at his fathers and there was soon perceived to have become a much more ordinary member of society than on his first arrival  one evening there was a loud peal at the doorbell and the maidone of ethels experiments of trainingcame in  please sir a gentleman has brought a cockatoo and a letter and a little boy from the archdeacon  archdeacon cried dr may catching sight of the handwriting on the letter and starting up  archdeacon norman  one of normans stray missionaries and a maori newly caught oh what fun cried daisy in ecstasy  at that moment through the still open door walking as if he had lived there all his life there entered the prettiest little boy that ever was seena little knickerbocker boy with floating rich dark ringlets like a miniature cavalier coming forth from a picture with a white cockatoo on his wrist  not in the least confused he went straight towards dr may and said goodmorning grandpapa  ha  and who may you be my elfin prince said the doctor  im dickierichard rivers mayim not an elfin prince said the boy with a moments hurt feeling  papa sent me  by that time the boy was fast in his grandfathers embrace and was only enough released to give him space to answer the eager question papapapa here  oh no i came with mr seaford  the doctor hastily turned dickie over to the two aunts and hastened forth to the stranger whose name he well knew as a colonists son a favourite and devoted clerical pupil of normans  aunt ethel said little richard with instant recognition mamma said you would be like her but i dont think you will  nor i dickie but well try  and whos that  yes what am i to be like asked gertrude  youre not aunt daisyaunt daisy is a little girl  gertrude made him the lowest of curtseys for not to be taken for a little girl was the compliment she esteemed above all others dickies next speech was and is that uncle aubrey  no thats leonard  dickie shook hands with him very prettily but then returning upon ethel observed i thought it was uncle aubrey because soldiers always cut their hair so close  the other guest was so thoroughly a colonist and had so little idea of anything but primitive hospitality that he had had no notion of writing beforehand to announce his coming and accident had delayed the letters by which norman and meta had announced their decision of sending home their eldest boy under his care  papa had no time to teach me alone said dickie who seemed to have been taken into the family councils and mamma is always busy and i wasnt getting any good with some of the boys that come to school to papa  indeed mr dickie said the doctor full of suppressed laughter  it is quite true said mr seaford there are some boys that the archdeacon feels bound to educate but who are not desirable companions for his son  it is a great sacrifice remarked the young gentleman  oh dickie dickie cried gertrude in fits dont you be a prig  mamma said it defiantly answered dickie  only a parrot said ethel behind her handkerchief but dickie who heard whatever he was not meant to hear answered  it is not a parrot it is a white cockatoo that the chief of something unutterable brought down on his wrist like a hawk to the missionship and that mamma sent as a present to uncle george  i prefer the parrot that has fallen to my share observed the doctor  it was by this time perched beside him looking perfectly at ease and thoroughly at home  there was something very amusing in the aspect of the little man he so completely recalled his mothers hummingbird title by the perfect look of finished porcelain perfection that even a journey from the antipodes with only gentleman nursemaids had not destroyed  the ringleted rich brown hair shone like glossy silk the cheeks were like painting the trim wellmade legs and small hands and feet looked dainty and fairylike yet not at all effeminate hands and face were a healthy brown and contrasted with the little white collar the set of which made ethel exclaim just look daisy thats what i always told you about metas doings  only i cant understand itdickie have the fairies kept you in repair ever since mamma dressed you last  we havent any fairies in new zealand he replied and mamma never dressed me since i was a baby  and what are you now said the doctor  i am eight years old said this piece of independence perfectly well mannered and au fait in all the customs of the teatable and when the meal was over he confidentially said to his aunt shall i come and help you wash up  i never break anything  ethel declined this kind offer but he hung on her hand and asked if he might go and see the schoolroom where papa and uncle harry used to blow soapbubbles  she lighted a candle and the little gentleman showed himself minutely acquainted with the whole geography of the house knew all the rooms and the pictures and where everything had happened even to adventures that ethel had forgotten  it is of no use to say there are no fairies in new zealand said dr may taking him on his knee and looking into the blue depths of normans eyes  you have been headwaiter to queen mab and perpetually here when she made you put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes  papa read that to the boys and they said it was stupid and no use said dickie but papa said that the electric telegraph would do it  the little cavalier appeared not to know what it was to be at a loss for an answer and the joint letter from his parents explained that his precocious quickness was one of their causes for sending him home  he was so deft and useful as to be important in the household and necessarily always living with his father and mother he took constant part in their conversation and was far more learned in things than in books  in the place where they were settled trustworthy boy society was unattainable and they had felt their little son in danger of being spoilt and made forward from his very goodness and brightnesswrote meta if you find him a forward imp recollect it is my fault for having depended so much on him  his escort was a specimen of the work norman had done not actual missionwork but preparation and inspiriting of those who went forth on the actual task  he was a simpleminded singlehearted man one of the first pupils in normans college and the one who had most fully imbibed his spirit  he had been for some years a clergyman and latterly had each winter joined the mission voyage among the melanesian isles returning to their homes the lads brought for the summer for education to the mission college in new zealand and spending some time at a station upon one or other of the islands  he had come back from the last voyage much out of health and had been for weeks nursed by meta until a long rest having been declared necessary he had been sent to england as the only place where he would not be tempted to work and was to visit his only remaining relation a sister who had married an officer and was in ireland he was burning to go back again and eagerly explainedsagely corroborated by the testimony of the tiny archdeaconthat his illness was to be laid to the blame of his own imprudence not to the climate and he dwelt upon the delights of the yearly voyage among the lovely islands beautiful beyond imagination fenced in by coral breakwaters within which the limpid water displayed exquisite seaflowers shells and fishes of magical gorgeousness of hue of the brilliant white beach fringing the glorious vegetation cocoanut breadfruit banana and banyan growing on the sloping sides of volcanic rocks of mysterious redglowing volcano lights seen far out at sea at night of glades opening to show highroofed huts covered with mats of canoes decorated with the shining white shells resembling a poached egg of natives clustering round eager and excited seldom otherwise than friendly though in hitherto unvisited places or in those where the wanton outrages of sandalwood traders had excited distrust caution was necessary and there was peril enough to give the voyage a full character of heroism and adventure bows and poisoned arrows were sometimes brought downand dickie insisted that they had been usedbut in general the mission was recognized and an eager welcome given presents of fishhooks or of braid and handkerchiefs established a friendly feeling and readinessin which the hand of the maker must be recognizedwas manifested to intrust lads to the mission for the summers training at the college in new zealandwild lads innocent of all clothing except marvellous adornments of their woolly locks wigged out sometimes into huge cauliflowers whitened with coral lime or arranged quarterly red and white and their noses decorated with rings which were their nearest approach to a pocket as they served for the suspension of fishhooks or any small article  a radiate arrangement of skewers from the nose in unwitting imitation of a cats whiskers had even been known  a few days taught dressing and eating in a civilized fashion and time example and the wonderful influence of the head of the mission trained these naturally intelligent boys into much that was hopeful dickie who had been often at the college had much to tell of familiarity with the light canoes that some cut out and launched of the teaching them english games of their orderly ways in school and in hall of the prayers in their many tongues and of the baptism of some after full probation and at least one winters return to their own isles as a test of their sincerity and constancy  much as the may family had already heard of this wonderful work it came all the closer and nearer now the isle of alan ernescliffes burialplace had now many christians in it  harrys friend the young chief david was dead but his people were some of them already teachers and examples and the whole region was full to overflowing of the harvest calling out for labourers to gather it in  silent as usual leonard nevertheless was listening with all his heart and with parted lips and kindling eyes that gave back somewhat of his former countenance  suddenly his face struck mr seaford and turning on him with a smile he said you should be with us yourself you look cut out for mission work  leonard murmured something blushed up to the ears and subsided but the simple singlehearted mr seaford his soul all on one object his experience only in one groove by no means laid aside the thought and the moment he was out of leonards presence eagerly asked who that young man was  leonard ward he ishe is the son of an old friend replied dr may a little perplexed to explain his connection  what is he doing  i never saw any one looking more suited for our work  tell him so again said dr may i know no one that would be fitter  they were all taken up with the small grandson the next day  he was ready in his fairypage trimness to go to the early service at the minster but he was full of the colonial nil admirari principle and was quite above being struck by the grand old building or allowing its superiorityeither to papas own church or auckland cathedral they took him to present to mary on their way back from church when he was the occasion of a great commotion by carrying the precious master charlie all across the hall to his mamma and quietly observing in resentment at the outcry that of course he always carried little ethel about when mamma and nurse were busy  after breakfast when he had finished his investigations of all dr mays domains and much entertained gertrude by his knowledge of them ethel set him down to write a letter to his father and her own to meta being engrossing she did not look much more after him till dr may came in and said i want you to sketch off a portrait of her dickybird for meta and he put before her a natural history with a figure of that tiny hummingbird which is endowed with swansdown knickerbockers  by the bye where is the sprite  he was not to be found and when dinnertime and much calling and searching failed to produce him his grandfather declared that he was gone back to elfland but leonard recollected certain particular inquiries about the situation of the grange and of cocksmoor and it was concluded that he had anticipated the doctors intentions of taking him and mr seaford there in the afternoon  the notion was confirmed by the cockatoo having likewise disappeared but there was no great anxiety since the little new zealander appeared as capable of taking care of himself as any gentleman in her majestys dominions and a note had already been sent to his aunt informing her of his arrival  still a summons to the doctor in an opposite direction was inopportune the more so as the guest was to remain at stoneborough only this one day and had letters and messages for mr and mrs rivers while it was also desirable to see whether the boy had gone to cocksmoor  leonard proposed to become mr seafords guide to the grange learn whether dickie were there and meet the two ladies at cocksmoor with the tidings leaving mr seaford and the boy to be picked up by the doctor on his return  it was his first voluntary offer to go anywhere though he had more than once been vainly invited to the grange with richard  much conversation on the mission took place during the walk and resulted in mr seafords asking leonard if his profession were settled  no he said and not at all aware that his companion did not know what every other person round him knew he added i have been thrown out of everythingi am waiting to hear from my brother  then you are not at a university  oh no i was a clerk  then if nothing is decided is it impossible that you should turn your eyes to our work  stay said leonard standing still i must ask whether you know all about me  would it be possible to admit to such work as yours one who by a terrible mistake has been under sentence of death and in confinement for three years  i must think  let us talk of this another time  is that the grange hastily exclaimed the missionary rather breathlessly leonard with perfect composure replied that it was pointed out the different matters of interest and though a little more silent showed no other change of manner  he was asking the servant at the door if master may were there when mr rivers came out and conducted both into the drawing room where little dickie was sure enough  it appeared that cockatoo on wrist he had put his pretty face up to the glass of mrs riverss morningroom and had asked her is this mammas room aunt flora  wheres margaret  uncle aunt and cousin had all been captivated by him and he was at present looking at the display of all margarets treasures keenly appreciating the useful and ingenious but condemning the merely ornamental as only fit for his baby sister  margaret was wonderfully gracious and childlike but perhaps she rather oppressed him for when leonard explained that he must go on to meet miss may at cocksmoor the little fellow sprang up declaring that he wanted to go thither and though told that his grandfather was coming for him and that the walk was long he insisted that he was not tired and mr seaford finding him not to be dissuaded broke off his conversation in the midst and insisted on accompanying him leaving mr and mrs rivers rather amazed at colonial breeding  the first time mr seaford could accomplish being alone with dr may he mysteriously shut the door and began i am afraid mrs rivers thought me very rude but though no doubt he is quite harmless i could not let the child or the ladies be alone with him  with whom  with your patient  what patient of mine have you been seeing today asked dr may much puzzled  oh then you consider him as convalescent and certainly he does seem rational on every other point but is this one altogether an hallucination  i have not made out either the hallucination or the convalescent  i beg your pardon said the courteous doctor but i cannot understand whom you have seen  then is not that young ward a patient of yours  he gave me to understand today that he has been under confinement for three years  my poor leonard exclaimed the doctor i wish his hair would grow this is the second time  and did you really never hear of the blewer murder and of leonard ward  mr seaford had some compound edifice of various murders in his mind and required full enlightenment  having heard the whole he was ardent to repair his mistake both for leonards own sake and that of his cause  the young man was indeed looking ill and haggard but there was something in the steady eyes hollow though they still were and in the determined cast of features that strangely impressed the missionary with a sense of his being moulded for the work and on the first opportunity a simple straightforward explanation of the error was laid before leonard with an entreaty that if he had no duties to bind him at home he would consider the need of labourers in the great harvest of the southern seas  leonard made no answer save thank you and that he would think  the grave set features did not light up as they had done unconsciously when listening without personal thought he only looked considering and accepted mr seafords address in ireland promising to write after hearing from his brother  next morning dr may gave notice that an old patient was coming to see him and must be asked to luncheon  leonard soon after told ethel that he should not be at home till the evening and she thought he was going to cocksmoor by way of avoiding the stranger  in the twilight however dr may going up to the station to see his patient off was astonished to see leonard emerge from a secondclass carriage  you here the last person i expected  i have only been to w about my teeth  what have you been having toothache  at times but i have had two out so i hope there is an end of it  and you never mentioned it you stoic  it was only at night  and how long has this been  since i had that cold but it was no matter  no matter except that it kept you looking like count ugolino and me always wondering what was the matter with you  anddetaining him for a moment under the lights of the stationthis extraction must have been a pretty business to judge by your looks  what did the dentist do to you  it is not so much that said leonard low and sadly but i began to have a hope and i see it wont do  what do you mean my dear boy what have you been doing  i have been into my old cell again said he under his breath and dr may leaning on his arm felt his nervous tremor  prisoner of the bastille eh leonard  i had long been thinking that i ought to go and call on mr reeve and thank him  but he does not receive calls there  no said leonard as if the old impulse to confidence had returned but i have never been so happy since as i was in that cell and i wanted to see it again  not only for that reason he added but something that mr seaford said brought back a remembrance of what mr wilmot told me when my life was grantedsomething about the whole being preparation for future worksomething that made me feel ready for anything  it had all gone from meall but the remembrance of the sense of a blessed presence and support in that condemned cell and i thought perhaps ten minutes in the same place would bring it back to me  and did they  no indeed  as soon as the door was locked it all went back to july 1860 and worse  things that were mercifully kept from me then mere abject terror of death and of that kind of deaththe disgracethe crowdsall came on me and with them the misery all in one of those nine months the loathing of those eternal narrow waved white walls the sense of their closing in the sickening of their sameness the longing for a voice the other horror of thinking myself guilty  the warder said it was ten minutesi thought it hours  i was quite done for and could hardly get downstairs  i knew the spirit was being crushed out of me by the solitary period and it is plain that i must think of nothing that needs nerve or presence of mind he added in a tone of quiet dejection  you are hardly in a state to judge of your nerve after sleepless nights and the loss of your teeth  besides there is a difference between the real and imaginary as you have found you who in the terrible time of real anticipation were a marvel in that very point of physical resolution  i could keep thoughts out then he said i was master of myself  you mean that the solitude unhinged you  yet i always found you brave and cheerful  the sight of you made me so  nay the very sight or sound of any human being made a difference  and now you all treat me as if i had borne it well but i did not  it was all that was left me to do but indeed i did not  what do you mean by bearing it well said the doctor in the tone in which he would have questioned a patient  livingasas i thought i should when i made up my mind to life instead of death said leonard but all that went away  i let it slip and instead came everything possible of cowardice and hatred and bitterness  i lost my hold of certainty what i had done or what i had not and the horror the malice the rebellion that used to come on me in that frightful light white silent place were unutterable  i wish you would not have me among you all when i know there can hardly be a wicked thought that did not surge over me  to be conquered  to conquer me he said in utter lassitude  stay  did they ever make you offend wilfully  there was nothing i could offend in  your tasks of work for instance  i often had a savage frantic abhorrence of it but i always brought myself to do it and it did me good it would have done more if it had been less mechanical  but it often was only the instinct of not degrading myself like the lowest prisoners  well there was your conduct to the officials  oh one could not help being amenable to them they were so kind besides these demons never came over me except when i was alone  and one thing more leonard did these demons as you well call them invade your devotions  never he answered readily then recalling himselfnot at the set times i mean though they often made me think the comfort i had there mere hypocrisy and delusion and be nearly ready to give over what depended on myself  chapel was always joy it brought change and the presence of others if nothing else and that would in itself have been enough to banish the hauntings  and they did not interfere with your own readings said the doctor preferring this to the word that he meant  i could not let them said leonard  there was always refreshment it was only before and after that all would seem mockery profanation or worse still delusion and superstitionas if my very condition proved that there was none to hear  the hobgoblin had all but struck the book out of christians hand said dr may pressing his grasp on leonards shuddering arm  you are only telling me that you have been in the valley of the shadow of death you have not told me that you lost the rod and staff  no i must have been helped or i should not have my senses now  and perhaps it was the repressed tremor of voice and frame rather than the actual words that induced the doctor to replythat is the very point leonard  it is the temptation to us doctors to ascribe too much to the physical and too little to the moral and perhaps you would be more convinced by mr wilmot than by me but i do verily believe that all the anguish you describe could and would have been insanity if grace had not been given you to conquer it  it was a tottering of the mind upon its balance and humanly speaking it was the selfcontrol that enabled you to force yourself to your duties and find relief in them which saved you  i should just as soon call david conquered because the deep waters had come in over his soul  you can never know how true those verses are said leonard with another shiver  at least i know to what kind of verses they all lead said the doctor and i am sure they led you and that you had more and brighter hours than you now remember  yes it was not all darkness  i believe there were more spaces than i can think of now when i was very fairly happy even at pentonville and at portland all did well with me till last spring and then the news from massissauga brought back all the sense of bloodguiltiness and it was worse than ever  and that sense was just as morbid as your other horrible doubt about which you asked me when we were coming home  i see it was now but that was the worst time of allthe monotony of school and the sense of hypocrisy and delusion in teachingthe craving to confess if only for the sake of the excitement and the absolute inability to certify myself whether there was any crime to confessi cant talk about it  and even chapel was not the same refreshment when one was always teaching a class in it as coming in fresh only for the service  even that was failing me or i thought it was  no i do not know how i could have borne it much longer  no leonard you could not tom and i both saw that in your looks and quite expected to hear of your being ill but you see we are never tried above what we can bear  no said leonard very low as if he had been much struck and then he added after an interval it is over now and theres no need to recollect it except in the way of thanks  the question is what it has left me fit for  you know dr may and his voice trembled my first and best design in the happy time of coombe the very crown of my life was this very thingto be a missionary  but for myself i might be in training now  if i had only conquered my temper and accepted that kind offer of mr cheviots all this would never have been and i should have had my youth my strength and spirit my best to devote i turned aside because of my obstinacy against warning and now how can i offerone who has stood at the bar lived among felons thought such thoughtsthe released convict with a disgraced name  it would just be an insult to the ministry  no i know how prisoners feel  i can deal with them  let me go back to what i am trained for  my nerve and spirit have been crushed out i am fit for nothing else  the worst thing that has remained with me is this nervousnesscowardice is its right namestarting at the sound of a door or at a fresh facea pretty notion that i should land among savages  dr may had begun an answer about the remains of the terrible ordeal that might in itself have been part of leonards training when they reached the house door  these nerves or whatever they were did indeed seem disposed to have no mercy on their owner for no sooner had he sat down in the warm drawingroom than such severe pain attacked his face as surpassed even his powers of concealment  dr may declared it was all retribution for his unfriendliness in never seeking sympathy or advice which might have proved the evil to be neuralgia and saved the teeth instead of aggravating the evil by their extraction  i suspect he has been living on nothing said dr may when in a lull of the pain leonard had gone to bed  papa exclaimed gertrude dont you know what richards housekeeping is  dont you recollect his taking that widow for a cook because she was such a good woman  i dont think it was greatly richards fault said ethel  i can hardly get leonard to make a sparrows meal here and most likely his mouth has been too uncomfortable  ay that never seeking sympathy is to me one of the saddest parts of all  he has been so long shut within himself that he can hardly feel that any one cares for him  he does so more than at first said ethel  much more  i have heard things from him tonight that are a revelation to me  well he has come through and i believe he is recovering it but the three threads of our being have all had a terrible wrench and if body and mind come out unscathed it is the soundness of the spirit that has brought them through  a sleepless night and morning of violent pain ensued but at least thus much had been gainedthat there was no refusal of sympathy but a grateful acceptance of kindness so that it almost seemed a recurrence to the coombe days and as the pain lessened the enjoyment of ethels attendance seemed to grow upon leonard in the gentle languor of relief and when as she was going out for the afternoon she came back to see if he was comfortable in his easychair by the drawingroom fire and put a screen before his face he looked up and thanked her with a smilethe first she had seen  when she returned the winter twilight had closed in and he was leaning back in the same attitude but started up so that she asked if he had been asleep  i dont knowi have seen her again  seen whom  minna my dear little minna  dreamt of her  i cannot tell he said i only know she was there and then rising and standing beside ethel he continuedmiss may you remember the night of her death  easter eve  well continued he that night i saw her  i remember said ethel that mr wilmot told us you knew at once what he was come to tell you  it was soon after i was in bed the lights were out and i do not think i was asleep when she was by menot the plump rosy thing she used to be but tall and white her hair short and waving back her eyesoh so sad and wistful but glad tooand her hands held outand she said turn you to the stronghold ye prisoners of hope  o leonard dear it does not hurt  it was the last thing she did say  yes so aves letter said  and observe one oclock in indiana is halfpast nine with us  then her hairi wrote to ask for you know it used to be in long curls but it had been cut short like what i saw surely surely it was the dear loving spirit allowed to show itself to me before going quite away to her home  and you have seen her again  just nowhis voice was even lower than beforesince it grew dark as i sat there  i had left off reading and had been thinking when there she was all white but not wistful now leonard dear she said it has not hurt and then he brought me forth he brought me forth even to a place of liberty because he had a favour unto me  o leonard it must have made you very happy  i am very thankful for it he said  then after a pause you will not speak of ityou will not tell me to think it the action of my own mind upon itself  i can only believe it a great blessing come to comfort you and cheer you said ethel cheer you as with the robinnote as papa called it that sung all through the worst of times  leonard i am afraid you will think it unkind of me to have withheld it so long but papa told me you could not yet bear to hear of minna  i have her last present for you in chargethe slippers she was working for that eighteenth birthday of yours  she would go on and we never knew whether she fully understood your danger it was always they could not hurt you and at last when they were finished and i had to make her understand that you could not have them she only looked up to me and said please keep them and give them to him when he comes home  she never doubted first or last  ethel who had daily been watching for the moment took out the parcel from the drawer with the address in the childish writing the date in her own  large tears came dropping from leonards eyes as he undid the paper and looked at the work then said last time i saw that pattern my mother was working it  dear child  yes miss may i am glad you did not give them to me before  i always felt as if my blow had glanced aside and fallen on minna but somehow i feel more fully how happy she is  she was the messenger of comfort throughout to ave and to ella said ethel and well she may be to you still  i have dreaded to ask said leonard but there was a line in one letter i was shown that made me believe that climate was not the whole cause  no said ethel at least the force to resist it had been lost as far as we can see  it was a grievous error of your brothers to think her a child who could forget  she pined to hear of you and that one constant effort of faith and love was too much and wasted away the little tender body  but oh leonard how truly she can say that her captivity is over and that it has not hurt  it has not hurt musingly repeated leonard  no she is beyond the reach of distracting temptations and sorrows it has only made her brighter to have suffered what it breaks ones heart to think of  it has not hurt  nothing from without does hurt said ethel unless one lets it  hurt what he asked  the soul returned ethel  mind and body may be hurt and it is not possible to know ones mind from ones soul while one is alive but as long as the will and faith are right to think the soul can be hurt seems to me like doubting our protector  but if the will have been astray  then while we repent we must not doubt our redeemer  dickie ran in at the moment calling for aunt ethel  she had dropped her muff  leonard picked it up and as she took it he wrung her hand with an earnestness that showed his gratitude     chapter xxviii    tender as woman manliness and meekness          in him were so allied   that those who judged him by his strength or weakness          knew but a single sidej whittier   it promised to be a brilliant christmas at stoneborough though little dickie regarded the feast coming in winter as a perverse english innovation and was grand on the superiority of supple jack above holly  decorations had been gradually making their way into the minster and had advanced from being just tolerated to being absolutely delighted in but dr spencer with his knack of doing everything was sorely missed as a head and mr wilmot insisted that the may forces should come down and work the minster on the 23rd leaving the eve for the adornment of cocksmoor after the return of its incumbent  mary always highly efficient in that line joined them and leonards handiness and dexterity in the arts relating to carpentry were as quietly useful as little dickies bright readiness in always handing whatever was wanting  the work was pretty well over when aubrey who had just arrived with leave for a week came down and made it desultory  dickie whose imagination had been a good deal occupied by his soldier uncle wanted to study him and gertrude was never steady when aubrey was near presently it was discovered that the door to the tower stair was open the ascent of the tower was a feat performed two or three times in a lifetime at stoneborough  harry had once beguiled ethel and mary up but gertrude had never gone and was crazy to go as was likewise dickie  moreover aubrey and gertrude insisted that it was only proper that ethel should pay her respects to her prototype the gurgoyle they wanted to compare her with him and ordered her up in fact their spirits were too high for them to be at ease within the church and ethel maugre her thirty years partook of the exhilaration enough to delight in an extraordinary enterprise and as nothing remained but a little sweeping up they left this to the superintendence of mary and mr wilmot and embarked upon the narrow crumbling steps of the spiral stair that led up within an unnatural thickening of one of the great piers that supported the tower at the intersection of nave and transepts  after a long period of dust and darkness and the monotony of always going with the same leg foremost came a narrow door leading to the ringers region with all their ropes hanging down  ethel was thankful when she had got her youngsters past without an essay on them she doubted if she should have succeeded but for leonards being an element of soberness  other little doors ensued leading out to the various elevations of roof which were at all sorts of different heights the chancel lower than the nave and one transept than the other besides that the nave had both triforium and clerestory  it was a sort of labyrinth and they wondered whether any one except perhaps the plumbers foreman knew his way among all the doors  then there was one leading inwards to the eight bellsfrom whose fascinations ethel thought dickie never would be taken awayand still more charming to the clock which clanged a tremendous three as they were in the act of looking at it causing leonard to make a great start and then colour painfully  it was hard to believe as daisy said that the old tower that looked so short and squat below could be so very high when you came to go up it but the glimpses of the country through the little loophole windows were most inviting  at last aubrey who was foremost pushed up the trapdoor and emerged but as dickie followed him exclaimed here we are but you ladies in crinolines will never follow  youll stick fast for ever and leonard cant pass so there youll all have to stay  aunt daisy will sail away like a balloon added dickie roguishly looking back at her and holding on his cap  but gertrude vigorously compressed her hoop and squeezed through followed by ethel and leonard  there was a considerable space square leaded and protected by the battlemented parapet with a deep moulding round and a gutter resulting in the pipe smoked by ethels likeness the gurgoyle  of course the first thing dickie and aubrey did was to look for the letters that commemorated the ascent of h m e m m m in 1852 and it was equally needful that r r m if nobody else should likewise leave a record on the leads  there was an r m of 1820 that made it impossible to gainsay him  the view was not grand in itself but there was a considerable charm in looking down on the rooks in their leafless trees cawing over their old nests and in seeing the roofs of the town far away too the gray welsh hills and between the country lying like a map with rivers traced in light instead of black  leonard stood still his face turned towards the greenest of the meadows and the river where it dashed over the wheel of a mill  have you seen it again asked ethel as she stood by him and watched his eye  no  i am rather glad to see it first from so far off he answered i mean to walk over some day  ethel called gertrude is this your gurgoyle  his profile as seen from above isnt flattering  o daisy dont lean over so far  quite safe but at that instant a gust of wind caught her hat she grasped at it but only saved it from whirling away and made it fall short  there ethel your image has put on my hat and henceforth will appear to the wondering city in a black hat and feather  ill get it exclaimed the ever ready dickie and in another moment he had mounted the parapet and was reaching for it  whether it were gertrudes shriek or the natural recoil away from the grasping hand or that his hold on the side of the adjoining pinnacle was insecure he lost his balance and with a sudden cry vanished from their eyes  the frightful consternation of that moment none of those four could ever bear to recall the next they remembered that he could only fall as far as the roof but it was ethel and leonard alone who durst press to the parapet and at the same moment a cry came up  oh come  im holding on but it cuts  oh come  ethel saw some fiveandtwenty feet below the little boy upon the transept roof a smooth slope of lead only broken by a skylight a bit of churchwardens architecture still remaining  the child had gone crashing against the window and now lay back clinging to its iron frame  behind him was the entire height within to the church floor before him a rapid slope ended by a course of stone wide enough indeed to walk on but too narrow to check the impetus from slipping down the inclination above  ethels brain swam she just perceived that both aubrey and leonard had disappeared and then had barely power to support gertrude who reeled against her giddy with horror  oh look look ethel she cried i cant  where is he  there  yes hold on dickie they are coming  look upnot downhold on  a door opened and out dashed aubrey  alas it was on the nave clerestory he might as well have been a hundred miles off  another door and leonard appeared and on the right level but with a giddy unguarded ridge on which to pass round the angle of the tower she saw his head pass safely round but even then the horror was not over could he steady himself sufficiently to reach the child or might not dickie lose hold too soon  it was too close below for sight the moulding and gurgoyle impeded her agonized view but she saw the childs look of joyful relief she heard the steady voice wait dont let go yet  there and after a few more sounds came up a shout all right infinitely relieved she had to give her whole attention to poor gertrude who overset by the accident giddy with the attempt to look over horrified by the danger confused and distressed by the hair that came wildly flapping about her head and face and by the puffs of wind at her hoop had sunk down in the centre of the little leaden square clinging with all her might to the staff of the weathercock and feeling as if the whole tower were rocking with her absolutely seeing the battlements dance  how was she ever to be safely got down the rickety ladder leading to the crumbling stone stair  ethel knelt by her twisted up the fluttering hair bade her shut her eyes and compose her thoughts and then called over the battlements to aubrey who confused by the shock continued to emerge at wrong doors and lose himself on the roofs and was like one in a bad dream nearly as much dizzied as his sister to whose help he came the more readily as the way up was the only one plain before him  the detention would have been more dreadful to ethel had she known all that was passing below and that when the little boy at leonards sign lowered himself towards the outreaching arms of the young man who was steadying himself against the wall of the tower it was with a look of great pain and leaving a trail of blood behind him  when at length he stood at the angle leonard calmly said now go before me round that corner in at the door  hold by the wall ill hold your shoulder  the boy implicitly obeyed the notion of giddiness never seemed to occur to him and both safely came to the little door on the threshold of which leonard sat down and lifting him on his knee asked where he was hurt  my leg said dickie the glass was running in all the time and i could not move but it does not hurt so much now  perhaps not but a large piece of glass had broken into the slender little calf and leonard steadied himself to withdraw it as happily the fragment was large enough to give a hold for his hand the sensible little fellow without a word held up the limb across leonards knee and threw an arm round his neck to hold himself still just saying thank you when it was over  did it hurt much dickie  not very much he answered but how it bleeds  wheres aunt ethel  on the tower  she will come in a moment said leonard startled by the exceeding flow of blood and binding the gash round with his handkerchief  now ill carry you down  the boy did not speak all the weary winding way down the dark stairs but leonard heard gasps of oppression and felt the head lean on his shoulder moreover a touch convinced him that the handkerchief was soaking nay dripping and when he issued at length into the free air of the church the face was deadly white  no one was near and leonard laid him on a bench  he was still conscious and looked up with languid eyes maynt i go home he said faintly aunt ethel  let me try to stop this bleeding first said leonard  my dear little man if you will only be quiet i think i can  leonard took the handkerchief from his throat and wound it to its tightest just above the hurt dickie remonstrating for a moment with thats not the place  it is too tight  it will cut off the blood from coming said leonard and in the same understanding way the child submitted feebly asking shall i bleed to death  mamma will be so sorry  i trusti hope not said leonard he durst utter no encouragement for the lifeblood continued to pour forth unchecked and the next murmur was im so sick  i cant say my prayers  papa  mamma already however leonard had torn down a holly bough and twisted off he would have given worlds for a knife a short stout stick which he thrust into one of the folds of the ligature and pulled it much tighter so that his answer was thank god dickie that will do the bleeding has stopped  you must not mind if it hurts for a little while  an ejaculation of poor little dear here made him aware of the presence of the sextons wife but in reply to her offer to carry him in to mrs cheviots dickie faintly answered please let me go home and leonard yes i will take him home  tell miss may it is a cut from the glass i am taking him to have it dressed and will bring him home  now my dear little patient fellow can you put your arms round my neck  sensible according to both meanings of the word dickie clasped his friends neck and laid his head on his shoulder not speaking again till he found leonard was not turning towards the high street when he said that is not the way home  no dickie but we must get your leg bound up directly and the hospital is the only place where we can be sure of finding any one to do it  i will take you home directly afterwards  thank you said the courteous little gentleman and in a few minutes more leonard had rung the bell and begged the house surgeon would come at once to dr mays grandson  a few drops of stimulant much revived dickie and he showed perfect trust and composure only holding leonards hands and now and then begging to know what they were doing while he was turned over on his face for the dressing of the wound bearing all without a sound except an occasional sobbing gasp accompanied by a squeeze of leonards finger  just as this business had been completed the surgeon exclaimed theres dr mays step and dickie at once sat up as his grandfather hurried in nearly as pale as the boy himself  o grandpapa never mind it is almost well now and has aunt daisy got her hat  what is it my dear what have you been doing said the doctor looking in amazement from the boy to leonard who was covered with blood  they told me you had fallen off the minster tower  yes i did said dickie i reached after aunt daisys hat but i fell on the roof and i was sliding sliding down to the wall but there was a window and the glass broke and cut me but i got my feet against the bottom of it and held on by the iron bar till leonard came and took me down and he lay back on the pillow quiet and exhausted but brighteyed and attentive as ever listening to leonards equally brief version of the adventure  didnt he save my life grandpapa said the boy at the close  twice over you may say added the surgeon and his words as to the nature of the injury manifested that all had depended on the immediate stoppage of the haemorrhage  with so young a child delay from indecision or want of resource would probably have been fatal  there would have been no doing anything if this little man had not been so good and sensible said leonard leaning over him  and i did not cry  you will tell papa i did not cry said dickie eagerly but only half gratified by such girlish treatment as that agitated kiss of his grandfather after being a little bit of a hero but then dickies wondering eyes really beheld such another kiss bestowed over his head upon leonard and quite thought there were tears on grandpapas cheeks  perhaps old gentlemen could do what was childish in little boys  dickie was to be transported home  he wished to be carried by leonard but the brougham was at the door and he had to content himself with being laid on the seat with his friend to watch over him the doctor pointing out that leonard was a savage spectacle for the eyes of stoneborough and hurrying home by the short cut  ethel met him in extreme alarm  gertrudes halfrestored senses had been totally scattered by the sight of the crimson traces on the spot of leonards operations and she had been left to marys care while ethel and aubrey had hastened home and not finding any one there the latter had dashed off to bankside whilst ethel waited arranging the little fellows bed and trying to trust to leonards message and not let her mind go back to that fearful day of like waiting sixteen years ago nor on to what she might have to write to norman and meta of the charge they had sent to her  her fathers cheerful face at first was a pang and then came the rebound of gladness at the words  he is coming  no fear for him gallant little manthanks for gods mercy and to that noble fellow leonard  at the same moment aubrey burst inno one at wrightswont be in no one knows how long  what is to become of us  and he sank down on a chair  ay what would become of any of us if no one had a better pate than yours sir said dr may  you have one single perfection and you had better make the most of itthat of knowing how to choose your friends  theres the carriage  after a moments delay the cushion was lifted out with the little wounded cavalier still like a picture for true to his hummingbird nature a few scarcelyconscious movements of his hands had done away with looks of disarraythe rich glossy curls were scarcely disordered and no stains of blood had adhered to the upper part of his small person whereas leonard was a ghastly spectacle from head to foot  so master dickybird said dr may as they rested him a moment on the halltable give me that claw of yours  yes youll do very well only you must go to bed now and mind whatever you did when you were in fairyland we dont fly here in stoneboroughand it does not answer  i am not to go to bed for being naughty am i said dickie his brave white lip for the first time quivering indeed i did not know it was wrong  the poor little mans spirits were so exhausted that the reassurance on this head absolutely brought the muchdreaded tears into his eyes and he could only be carried up gently to his bed and left to be undressed by his aunt so great an aggravation to the troubles of this small fragment of independence that it had almost overset his courtesy and selfcommand  there was no contenting him till he had had all traces of the disaster washed from face and hands and the other foot and then over his tea though his little clear chirrup was weak he must needs give a lucid description of leonards bandaging in the midst of which came a knock at the door and a gasping voiceill be quite quietindeed i will  only just let me come in and kiss him and see that he is safe  o auntie daisy have you got your hat  wan tearstained dishevelled gertrude bit her lip to save an outburst gave the stipulated kiss and retreated to mary who stood in the doorway like a dragon  auntie daisy has been crying said dickie turning his eyes back to ethel  please tell her i shall be well very soon and then ill go up again and try to get her hat if i may have a hook and lineill tell you how  my dear dickie you had better lie down and settle it as you go to sleep said ethel her flesh creeping at the notion of his going up again  but if i go to sleep now i shall not know when to say my prayers  had you not better do so now dickie  next came the childs scruple about not kneeling but at last he was satisfied if aunt ethel would give him his little book out of the drawerthat little delicatelyilluminated book with the pointed writing and the twisted cipher metas hand in every touch presently he looked up and said aunt ethel isnt there a verse somewhere about giving the angels charge  i want you to find it for me for i think they helped me to hold on and helped leonard upon the narrow place  you know they are sure to be flying about the church  ethel read the ninetyfirst psalm to him  he listened all through and thanked her but in a few minutes more he was fast asleep  as she left the room she met leonard coming down and held out her hands to him with a mute intensity of thanks telling him in a low voice what dickie had said of the angels care  i am sure it was true said leonard  what else could have saved the brave child from dizziness  downstairs leonards reception from dr may was pretty well for a nervous man  anybody can do what comes to hand  i beg your pardon  some bodies lose their wits like your friend aubrey who tells me if he had stood still he would have fainted away  as long as nerves can do what comes to hand they need not be blamed even if they play troublesome tricks at other times as i suspect they are doing now  yes my face is aching a little  not to say a great deal said the doctor  well i am not going to pity you for i think you can feel today that most of us would be glad to be in your place  i am very glad said leonard  you remember that childs parents  no you have grown so old that i am always forgetting what a boy you ought to be but if you had ever seen the tenderness of his father and that sunbeam of a meta you would know all the more how we bless you for what you have spared them leonard if anything had been needed to do so you have won to yourself such a brother in norman as you have in aubrey  meantime ethel was soothing gertrude to whom the shock had been in proportion to the triumphal heights of her careless gaiety  charles cheviot had come in while his wife was restoring her and he had plainly said what no one else would have intimated to the spoilt darlingthat the whole accident had been owing to her recklessness and that he had always expected some fatal consequences to give her a lesson  gertrude had been fairly cowed by such unwonted treatment and when he would only take her home on condition of composure and selfcommand her trembling limbs obliged her to accept his arm and he subdued her into meek silence and repression of all agitation till she was safe in her room when she took a little bit of revenge upon mary by crying her heart out and declaring it was very cruel of charles when she did not mean it  and mary on her side varied between assurances that charles did not mean it and that he was quite rightthe sister now predominating in her and now the wife  mean what said ethel sitting down among them before they were aware  thatthat it was all my fault burst out gertrude  if it was i dont see what concern it is of his  but daisy dear he is your brother  ive got plenty of brothers of my own  i dont count those peopleinlaw  shes past reasoning with mary said ethel  leave her to me she will come to her senses by and by  but indeed ethel you wont be hard on her  i am sure dear charles never thought what he said would have been taken in this way  why did he say it then cried gertrude firing up  my dear mary do please go down before we get into the pitiable lastword condition  that condition was reached already but in ethels own bedroom marys implicit obedience revived and away she went carrying off with her most of what was naughtiness in gertrude  ethelethel dear cried she at once i know you are coming down on me  i deserve it all only charles had no business to say it and wasnt it very cruel and unkind when he saw the state i was in  i suppose charles thought it was the only chance of giving a lesson and therefore true kindness  come daisy is this terrible fit of pride a proper return for such a mercy as we have had today  if i didnt say so to myself a dozen times on the way homeonly mary came and made me so intolerably angry by expecting me to take it as if it had come from you or papa  ah daisy that is the evil  if i had done my duty by you all this would not have been  now ethel when you want to be worse and more cutting than anything you go and tell me my faults are yours  for pitys sake dont come to that  but i must daisy for it is true  oh if you had only been a naughty little girl  whatand had it out then said daisy who was lying across the bed and put her golden head caressingly on ethels knee  if i had plagued you then you would have broken me in out of selfdefence  something like it said ethel  but you know daisy the little last treasure that mamma left did always seem something we could not make enough of and it didnt make you fractious or tiresomeat least not to ustill we thought you could not be spoilt  and then i didnt see the little faults so soon as i ought and im only an elder sister after all without any authority  no youre not to say that ethel i mind your authority and always will  you are never a bother  ah thats it daisy  if i had only been a bother you might never have got ahead of yourself  then you really think like charles cheviot that it was my doing ethel  what do you think yourself  great tears gathered in the corners of the blue eyes  was it weak in ethel not to bear the sight  my poor daisy she said yours is not all the burden  i ought not to have taken up such a giddy company or else i should have kept the boy under my hand  but he is so discreet and independent that it is more like having a gentleman staying in the house than a child under ones charge and one forgets how little he is and i was as much off my balance with spirits as you  it was the flightiness of us all and we have only to be thankful and to be sobered for another time i am afraid the pride about being reproved is really the worse fault  and what do you want me to doto go and tell papa all about it i mean to do that of course it is the only way to get comforted  of course it is but  you horrid creature ethel  ill never say you arent a bother again you really do want me to go and tell charles cheviot that he was quite right and mary that im ready to be trampled on by all my brothersinlaw in a row  well there wont be any more  youll never give me onethats one comfort said gertrude wriggling herself up and flinging an arm round ethels neck  as long as you dont do that ill do anything for you  not for me  well you know that you old thing only you might take it as a personal compliment  i really will do it for of course one could not keep ones christmas otherwise  it was rather too businesslike but elders are often surprised to find what was a hard achievement in their time a matter of course to their pupilsalmost lightly passed over  dickie slept till morning when he was found very pale but lively and goodhumoured as ever  mr wright coming up to see him found the hurt going on well and told ethel that if she could keep him in bed and undisturbed for the day it would be better and safer but that if he became restless and fretful there would be no great risk in taking him to a sofa  restless and fretful  mr wright little knew the discretion or the happy power of accommodation to circumstances that had descended to metas firstborn  he was quite resigned as soon as the explanation had been madeperhaps indeed there was an instinctive sense that to be dressed and moved would be fatiguing but he had plenty of smiles and animation for his visitors and when propped up in bed was full of devices for occupation  moreover he acquired a slave he made a regular appropriation of leonard whom he quickly perceived to be the most likely person to assist in his great design of constructing a model of the clock in the minster tower for the edification of his little brother harry  leonard worked away at the table by the bedside with interest nearly equal to the childs and when wire and cardboard were wanting he put aside all his dislike to facing the stoneborough streets and tradesmen in open day and at dickies request sallied forth in quest of the materials  and when the bookseller made inquiries after the boy leonard in the fulness of his heart replied freely and in detailnay he was so happy in the little mans welldoing that he was by no means disconcerted even by a full encounter of mrs harvey anderson in the street but answered all her inquiries in entire oblivion of all but the general rejoicing in little dickies wonderful escape  well said aubrey to his sisters after a visit to his nephews room dickie has the best right to him certainly today  it is an absolute appropriation  they were talking away with all their might when i came up but came to a stop when i went in and master dick sent me to the rightabout  the truth was that dickie who with eyes and ears all alive had gathered up some fragments of leonards history had taken this opportunity of catechizing him upon it in a manner that it was impossible to elude and which the childs pretty tact carried off as it did many things which would not have been tolerated if done rudely and abruptly  step by step in the way of question and remark he led leonard to tell him all that had happened and when once fairly embarked in the reminiscence there was in it a kind of peace and pleasure  the fresh loving wondering sympathy of the little boy was unspeakably comforting and besides the bringing the facts in their simple form to the grasp of the childish mind restored their proportion which their terrible consequences had a good deal disturbed  they seemed to pass from the present to the historical and to assume the balance that they took in the childs mind coming newly upon them  it was like bathing in a clear limpid stream that washed away the remains of morbid oppression  i wish mamma was here said the little friend at last  do you want her  are you missing her my dear  i miss her always said dickie  but it was not thatonly mamma always makes everybody so happy and she would be so fond of you because you have had so much trouble  but dickie dont you think i am happy to be with your grandfather and aunt and hoping to see my own sisters very soonyour aunt who taught me what bore me through it all  aunt ethel cried dickie considering  i like aunt ethel very much but then she is not like mamma  there could be no doubt that leonard was much better and happier after this adventure  reluctantly dickie let him go back to cocksmoor where his services in churchdecking and in singing had been too much depended on to be dispensed with but he was to come back with richard for the family assembly on christmas evening  moreover gertrude who was quite herself again having made her peace with the cheviots and endured the reception of her apologies seized on him to lay plots for a christmastree for the delectation of dickie on his sofa and likewise of margaret rivers and of the elite of the cocksmoor schools  he gave in to it heartily and on the appointed day worked with great spirit at the arrangements in the diningroom where gertrude favoured by the captive state of the little boy conducted her preparations relegating the family meals to the schoolroom  this tree was made the occasion for furnishing leonard with all the little appliances of personal property that had been swept away from him and after all he was the most delighted of the party  the small charlie cheviot had to be carried off shrieking margaret rivers was critical even cocksmoor was experienced in christmastrees and dickie when placed in the best situation and asked if such trees grew in new zealand made answer that he helped mamma to make one every year for the maori children  it was very kind in aunt daisy he added with unfailing courtesy but he was too zealous for his colony to be dazzledtoo utilitarian to be much gratified by any of his gifts excepting a knife of perilous excellence which aubrey in contempt of stoneborough productions had sacrificed from his own pocket at the last moment  leonard and dickie together were in a state of great delight at the little packets handed to the former studs purse pencilcase writing materials from hector ernescliffe a watch with the entreaty that his gifts might not be regarded as unlucky from ethel a photographic book with the cartes of his own family whose old negatives had been hunted up for the purpose also a recent one of dr may with his grandson on his knee the duplicate of which was gone to new zealand with the doctors inscription the modern cyropaedia astyages confounded  there was richard very good young and pretty there was ethel exactly like the doctor only more so there was gertrude like nobody not even herself and her brothers much in the same predicament there was the latest of mr riverss many likenesses with the cockatoo on his wrist and there was the least truculent and witchlike of the numerous attempts on flora there was mrs cheviot broadfaced and smiling over her son and mr and mrs ernescliffe pinioning the limbs of their offspring as in preparation for a family holocaust there was dickies mamma unspoilable in her loveliness even by photography and his papa grown very bald and archidiaconal there was ethels great achievement of influence dr spencer beautiful in his white hair there were the vicar and the late and present headmasters  the pleasure excited by all these gifts far exceeded the anticipations of their donors it seemed as if they had fallen on the very moment when they would convey a sense of home welcome and restoration  he did not say much but looked up with liquid lustrous eyes and earnest thank yous and caressingly handled and examined the treasures over and over again as they lay round him on dickies couch  i suppose said the child to him it is like job when all his friends came to see him and every one gave him a piece of money  he could hardly have enjoyed it more murmured leonard feeling the restful capacity of happiness in the new possession of the childs ardent love and of the kind looks of all around above all of the one presence that still gave him his chief sense of sunshine  the boyish and romantic touch of passion had as ethel had long seen been burnt and seared away and yet there was something left something that as on this evening she felt made his voice softer his eye more deferential to her than to any one else  perhaps she had once been his guiding star and if in the wild tempests of the night he had learnt instead to direct his course by the brightest and best of the sons of the morning still the star would be prized and distinguished as the first and most honoured among inferior constellations     chapter xxix    till now the dark was worn and overhead   the lights of sunset and of sunrise mixedtennyson   at new york tom wrote a short letter to announce his safe arrival and then pushed on by railway into indiana  winter had completely set in and when he at length arrived at winiamac he found that a sleigh was a far readier mode of conveyance to massissauga than the wagons used in summer  his drive through the white cathedrallike arcades of forest hung with transparent icicles and with the deep blue sky above becoming orange towards the west was enjoyable and even massissauga itself when its skeleton trees were like their neighbours embellished by the pure snowy covering looked less forlorn than when their death contrasted with the exuberant life around  he stopped at the hotel left his baggage there and after undergoing a catechism on his personal affairs was directed to mr mullers house and made his way up its hardtrodden path of snow towards the green door at which he knocked two or three times before it was opened by a woman whose hair and freckled skin were tinted nowhere but in ireland  he made a step forward out of the cutting blast into the narrow entry and began to ask is miss ward here  i mean can i see miss warden when as if at the sound of his voice there rang from within the door close by a shriekone of the hoarse hysterical cries he had heard upon the day of the inquest  without a moments hesitation he pushed open the door and beheld a young lady in speechless terror hanging over the stiffened figure on the couchthe eyes wide open the limbs straight and rigid  he sprang forward and lifted her into a more favourable posture hastily asking for simple remedies likely to be at hand and producing a certain amount of revival for a few moments though the stiffness was not passingnor was there evidence of consciousness  are you leonard said cora muller under her breath in this brief interval gazing into his face with frightened puzzled eyes  no but i am come to tell her that he is free  but the words were cut short by another terrible access of that most distressing kind that stimulates convulsion and again the terrified women instinctively rendered obedience to the stranger in the measures he rapidly took and his words hysteriaa form of hysteria were forced from him by the necessity of lessening coras intense alarm so as to enable her to be effective  we must send for dr laidlaw she began in the first breathing moment and again he looked up and said i am a physician  mr tom she asked with the faintest shadow of a smile he bent his head and that was their introduction broken again by another frightful attack and when quiescence if not consciousness was regained tom knelt by the sofa gazing with a sense of heartrending despair at the wasted features and thin hands the waxen whiteness of the cheek and the tokens in which he clearly read long and consuming illness as well as the overthrow of the sudden shock  what is this he asked looking up to coras beautiful anxious face  oh she has been very sick very sick she answered it was an attack of pleurisy but she is getting better at last though she will not think so and this news will make all well  does she hear say it again  tom shook his head afraid of the sound of the name as yet and scarcely durst even utter the word ella above his breath  she is gone out with cousin deborah to an apple bee was the reassuring answer  she wanted change poor child  is she getting better  averil was roused by a cough the sound which tore toms heart by its import but he drew back out of her sight and let cora raise her and give her drink in a soothing tender manner that was evident restoration  cora dear is it you she said faintly didnt i hear some one elses voice  didnt they say and the shiver that crept over her was almost a return of the hysteric fit  we said he was free said cora holding her in her arms  freeyes i know what that meansfree among the dead said averil calmly smoothing coras hair and looking in her face dont be afraid to let me hear  i shall be there with him and minna soon didnt somebody come to tell me  please let him in ill be quiet now  and as she made gestures of arranging her hair and dress tom guardedly presented himself saying in a voice that trembled with his endeavour to render it calm did you think i should have come if i had nothing better to tell you and as she put out her hand in greeting he took it in both his own and met her eyes looking at him wide open in the first dawning of the hope of an impossible gladness  yes he said the truth is come outhe is clearedhe is at homeat stoneborongh  the hot fingers closed convulsively on his own then she raised herself pressed her hands together and gasped and struggled fearfully for breath  the joy and effort for selfcommand were more than the enfeebled frame could support and there was a terrible and prolonged renewal of those agonizing paroxysms driving away every thought from the other two except of the immediate needs  at last when the violence of the attack had subsided and left what was either fainting or stupor they judged it best to carry her to her bed and trust that reviving without the associations of the other room the agitation would be less likely to return and that she might sleep under the influence of an anodyne  poor tom it was not the reception he had figured to himself and after he had laid her down and left her to cora and to katty to be undressed he returned to the parlour and stood over the sinking woodfire in dejection and dreariness of heartwrung by the sufferings he had witnessed with the bitter words too late echoing in his brain and with the still more cruel thoughthad it been his father or one of his brothersany one to whose kindness she could trust the shock had not been so great and there would have been more sense of soothing and comfort and then he tried to collect his impressions of her condition and judge what would serve for her relief but all his senses seemed to be scattered dismay compassion and sympathy had driven away all power of forming a conclusionhe was no longer the doctorhe was only the anxious listener for the faintest sound from the room above but none reached him save the creaking of the floor under kattys heavy tread  the gay tinkle of sleighbells was the next noise he heard and presently the door was opened and two muffled hooded figures looked into the room now only lighted by the red embers of the fire  wheres cora wheres ave said the bright tone of the lesser  it is all dark and she was raising her voice to call when tom instinctively uttered a hush and moved forward hush ella your sister has been ill  the little muffled figure started at the first sound of his voice but as he stepped nearer recoiled for a second then with a low cry almost a sob of recognition exclaimed mr tom  oh mr tom  i knew you would come  cousin deborah its mr tom and she flew into his arms and clung with an ecstasy of joy unknowing the why or how but with a sense that light had shone and that her troubles were over  she asked no questions she only leant against him with mr tom  mr tom under her breath  but what is it stranger  do tell  where are the girls  whats this about avys being sick  do you know the stranger ella  its mr tom she cried holding his arm round her neck looking up in a rapturous restfulness  i brought miss warden some good news that i fear has been too much for her said he i amonly waiting tohear how she is  by way of answer deborah opened another door which threw more light on the scene from the cooking stove in the kitchen and at the same moment cora with a candle came down the stairs  o dr may she said you have been too long left alone in the dark i think she is asleep now  you will stay  we will have tea directly  tom faltered something about the hotel and began to look at cousin deborah and to consider the proprieties of life but cousin deborah cora and ella began declaring with one voice that he must remain for the evening meal and a bustle of cheerful preparation commenced while ella still hung on his hand  but ella youve never asked my good news  oh dear  i was too glad  are we going home then  yes i trust so i hope so my dear for leonards innocence has come to light and he is free  then henry wont mindand we may be called by our proper name againand ave will be well cried the child as the ideas came more fully on her comprehension  o cora  o cousin deborah do you hear does ave know  may i run up and tell ave  this of course was checked but next ella impetuously tore off her wraps for the convenience of spinning up and down wildly about the kitchen and parlour  leonard himself did not seem to have great part in her joy henrys policy had really nearly rooted out the thought of him personally and there was a veil of confusion over the painful period of his trial which at the time she had only partially comprehended  but she did understand that his liberation would be the term of exile and though his name was to her connected with a mysterious shudder that made her shrink from uttering or hearing details she had a security that mr tom would set all right and she loved him so heartily that his presence was sunshine enough for her  a little discomfited at the trouble he was causing tom was obliged to wait while not only cousin deborah but cora busied herself in the kitchen and ella in her restless joy came backwards and forwards to report their preparations and at times to tarry a short space by his side and tell of the recent troubles  ave had been very ill she said very ill indeed about a month ago and henry had come home to see her but had been obliged to go away to the siege of charleston when she was better  they had all been ill ever since they came there but now mr tom was come should not they all go home to dear stoneborough away from this miserable place  if they could only take cora with them  it was still a childish tongue but ella had outgrown all her plump roundness and was so tall and pale that tom would hardly have known her  her welcome was relief and comfort and she almost inspired her own belief that now all would be well  his english ideas were rather set at rest by finding that mrs deborah was to preside at the teatable and that he was not to be almost teteatete with miss muller deborah having concluded her hospitable cares catechized him to her full content and satisfied herself on the mystery of the wardens life  and now what brought himself out  she guessed he could not find an opening in the old country  tom smiled explained his opening at home and mentioned his charge of his late friends book  so you are come out about the book and just come a few hundred miles out of the way to bring this bit of news that you could have telegraphed said the yankee dame looking at him with her keen eyes well if you were coming it was a pity you were not sooner she has pined away ever since she came here and to such a worndown condition as hers poor child i doubt joys kinder more upsetting than trouble when one is used to it  there ill fix the things and go up and sit with avy  shell be less likely to work herself into a flight again if she sees me than one of you  so tomless embarrassed nowfound himself sitting by the fire with ella roasting her favourite nuts for him and miss muller opposite he was taken by surprise by her beautiful face elegant figure and ladylike manner and far more by her evidently earnest affection for averil  she told him that ever since the fatal turn of little minnas illness averil had been subject to distressing attacks of gasping and rigidity often passing into faintness and though at the moment of emotion she often showed composure and selfcommand yet that nature always thus revenged herself  suspenseletters from home or from henryeven verses or times connected with the past would almost certainly bring on the affection and the heat of the summer had relaxed her frame so as to render it even more unable to resist there had been hope in the bracing of winter but the first frosts had brought a chill and a terrible attack of pleurisy so dangerous that her brother had been summoned she had struggled through however and recovered to a certain point but there had stopped short often suffering pain in the side and never without panting breath and recurring cough  this had been a slightly better day and she had been lying on the sofa counting the days to leonards next letter when the wellknown voice fell on her ears and the one strong effort to control herself had resulted in the frightful spasms which had been worse than any cora had yet witnessed  but she will get well and we shall go home said ella looking up wistfully into toms mournful face  and i shall lose you said cora but indeed i have long seen it was the only thing  if i had only known she never should have come here  no indeed i feel that you would have led her to nothing that was not for her good and comfort  ah but i did not know said cora i had not been hereand i only thought of my own pleasure in having her  but if there is any way of freeing her from this unfortunate speculation without a dead loss i will make father tell me  thisfrom coras pretty mouththough only honest and prudent rather jarred upon tom in the midst of his present fears and he began to prepare for his departure to the inn after having sent up ella to ask for her sister and hearing that she still slept soundly under the influence of the opiate  when averil awoke it was already morning and cora was standing by her bed with her eyes smiling with congratulation like veronicas on a sunny day  cora is it true she said looking up  cora bent down and kissed her and whispered i wish you joy my dear  then it is she said it is not all a dream  no dream dearest  who said it she asked  o cora that could not be true and the colour rose in her cheek  that yes averil if you mean that we had a visitor last evening i took him for leonard do you know  only i thought his eyes and hair did not quite answer the description  he is a very gentlemanlike person  did you not think so said averil  ah ave ive heard a great deal  dont you think you had better tell me some more  no no exclaimed averil you are not to think of folly as coughing cut her short  ill not think of any more than i can help except what you tell me  never think at all cora  oh what has brought him here  i dont know how i can dare to see him again and yet he is not gone is he  oh no he is only at the inn  he is coming back again  i must be up  let me get up said averil raising herself but pausing from weakness and breathlessness  and when they had forced some food upon her she carried out her resolution though twice absolutely fainting in the course of dressing and at length crept softly leaning on coras arm into the parlour though tom was waiting there he neither spoke nor came forward till she was safely placed upon the sofa and then gathering breath she sought him with her eager eyes shining large lustrous and wistful as they looked out of the white thin face where the once glowing colour had dwindled to two burning carnation spots  it was so piteous a change that as he took her hand he was silent from sheer inability to speak calmly  you have come to tell me she said  i am afraid i could not thank you last night  how different that soft pleading languid voice from the old half defiant tone  i did not know you had been so unwell he forced himself to say or i would not have come so suddenly  i am grown so silly she said trying to smile  i hardly even understood last night and the voice died away in the intense desire to hear  ii was coming on business and i thought you would not turn from the good tidings though i was the bearer he said in a broken agitated apologetic way  only let me hear it again she said  did you say he was free  yes free as you are or i  at home  my father was gone to fetch him  she put her hands over her face and looked up with the sweetest smile he had ever seen and whispered now i can sing my nunc dimittis  he could not at once speak and before he had done more than make one deprecatory gesture she asked you have seen him  not since thisnot since september  i know  you have been very good and he is at homeah not homebut dr mays  was he well  was he very glad  i have not seen him i have not heard you will hear soon  i came at once with the tidings  thank you and she clasped her hands together  have you seen henry does he know  could i  had not you the first right  leonard  oh dear leonard  she lay back for a few moments panting under the gust of exceeding joy while he was silent and tried not to seem to observe her with his anxious eyes  then she recovered a little and said the truth come out  did you say so what was the truth  he paused a moment afraid of the shock and remembering that the suspicion had been all unknown to her  she recalled probabilities and said  was it from a confession  is it known whowho was the real unhappy person  yes  had you no suspicion  nonone said averil shuddering unless it was some robber  who was it  you had never thought of the other nephew  you dont mean samuel axworthy  oh no  why the last thing leonard bade me was always to pray for him  ah said tom with bent head and colouring cheeks but who are those for whom such as leonard would feel bound to pray  there was a moments silence and then she said his enemy  is that what you mean  but then he would have known it was he  he was entirely convinced that so it must have been but there was no proof and an unsupported accusation would only have made his own case worse  and has he confessed has he been touched and cleared leonard at last  no he had no space granted him  it was the receipt in your brothers writing that was found upon him  the receipt  yes leonard always said the receipt would clear him but oh how dreadful  he must have had it all the time  how could he be so cruel  oh  i never felt before that such wickedness could be and she lay looking appalled and overpowered  think of your brother knowing it all and biddingand giving you that injunction said tom feeling the necessity of overcoming evil with good  oh if i had known it i could noti could not have been like leonard  and wherewhat has become of him she asked breathlessly you speak as if he was dead  yes  he was killed in a fray at a gaminghouse  there was a long silence first of awe then of thankfulness plainly beaming in her upraised eyes and transparent countenance which tom watched filled with sensations mournful but not wholly wretched shattered as she was sinking away from her newfound happiness it was a precious privilege to be holding to her the longedfor draught of joy  tell me about it please she presently said  wherehow did the receipt come to light  were the police told to watch for it  i want to know whom i have to thank  his heart beat high but there was a spirit within him that could not brook any attempt to recall the promise he had pursued her with the promise that he would not rest till he had proved her brothers innocence  he dreaded her even guessing any allusion to it or fancying he had brought the proffered price in his hand and when he began with can you bear to hear of the most shocking scene i ever witnessed he gave no hint of his true motive in residing at paris of the clue that bilsons draft had given him in thither pursuing axworthy nor of his severe struggle in relinquishing the quest  he threw over all the completest accidental air and scarcely made it evident that it was he who had recognized the writing and all that turned on it  averil listened to the narration was silent for some space then having gone over it in her own mind looked up and said  then all this came of your being at that hospital and a burning blush spread over the pale cheek and made tom shrink start and feel guilty of having touched the chord of obligation connected with that obtrusive pledge of his  above all however to repress emotion was his prime object and he calmly answered it was a good providence that brought any one there who knew the circumstances  she was silent and he was about to rise and relieve her from the sense of his presuming on her gratitude when a cough accompanied with a pressure of her hand on her side betrayed an access of suffering that drew him on to his other purpose of endeavouring to learn her condition and to do what he could for her relief  his manner curiously like his fathers and all the home associations connected with it easily drew from her what he wanted to ascertain and she perfectly understood its purport and was calm and even bright  i was glad to be better when henry went away she said he had so much to do and we thought i was getting well then  you must not frighten him and hurry him here if you please she said earnestly for he must not be wasting his time here and you think it will last a month or two dont you  i want to persuade henry to bring you all home and enter into partnership with mr wright said tom  the voyage wouldmightit would be the best thing for you  could i ever be well enough again  oh dont tell me to think about it  the one thing i asked for before i die has been given me and now i know he is free i willwill not set my mind on anything else  there was a look so near heaven on her face as she spoke that tom durst not say any more of home or earthly schemes but quiet grave and awestricken left her to the repose she needed and betook himself to the other room where ella of course flew on him having been hardly detained by cora from breaking in before  his object was to go to see the medical man who had been attending averil and cora assuring him the horse had nothing to do in the frost and telling him the times of the day when he would be most likely to find dr laidlaw he set forth  averil meantime lay on her sofa calmly happy and thankful the worn and wearied spirit full of rest and gladness unspeakable in the fulness of gratitude for the answered prayer that she might know her brother free before her death  if she had ever doubted of her own state she had read full confirmation in her physicians saddened eyes and the absence of all hopeful auguries except the single hint that she might survive a voyage to england and that she wished unsaid life for the last five years had been mournful work there had been one year of blind selfwill discord and bitterness then a crushing stroke and the rest exhausted submission and hopeless bending to sorrow after sorrow with selfreproach running through all  wearied out she was glad to lay down the burthen and accept the evening gleam as sunset radiance without energy to believe it as the dawn of a brighter day  she shrank from being made even to wish to see leonard if once she began to think it possible it would be a hard sacrifice to give it up and on one point her resolution was fixed that she would not be made a cause for bringing him to share their wretchedness in america  life and things of life were over with her and she would only be thankful for the softening blessings that came at its close without stirring up vain longings for more that kindness of tom may for instance how soothing it was after her long selfreproach for her petulant and cutting unjust reply to his generous affectiongenerous above all at such a moment  and after all it was heit was he and no other who had cleared leonardhe had fulfilled the pledge he had given when he did not know what he was talking of  how she hated the blush that the sudden remembrance had called up on her face  it was quite plain that he had been disgusted by her unkind undignified improper tone of rejection and though out of humanity he had brought her the tidings he would not let her approach to thanking him she was ashamed that he should have traced an allusion the most distant to the scene he had doubtless loathed in remembrance  he would no doubt go away today or tomorrow and then these foolish thoughts would subside and she should be left alone with cora and her thankfulness to think again of the great change before her  but tom was not gone  indeed averil was much more ill before the next morning partly from hysteria the reaction of the mornings excitement and partly from an aggravation of the more serious pulmonary affection  it was a temporary matter and one that made his remaining the merest act of common humanity since he had found dr laidlaw a very thirdrate specimen and her brother was too far off to have arrived in time to be of use  the fresh science and skill of the young physician were indeed of the highest value and under his care averil rallied after a few days of prostration and suffering during which she had watched and observed a good deal and especially the good understanding between her doctor and cora muller when cousin deborah was sitting with her they always seemed to be talking in the drawingroom nay there were reports of his joining in the fabrication of some of the delicacies that were triumphantly brought to her room and ella was in a state of impatient pique at being slighted by mr tom who she complained was always fighting with cora about their politics and cora herself used to bring what dr may had said as the choicest entertainment to her sick friend while to herself he was merely the physician kind and gentle to the utmost degree but keeping his distance so scrupulously that the pang awoke that he absolutely disliked her and only attended her from common compassion and it might be found consolation in being thus brought in contact with cora oh if it were only possible to own her wrongs and ask his pardon without a compromise of maidenliness  perhapsperhaps she might when she was still nearer death and when she was supposed to know how it was between him and cora  dear cora it would be a beautiful reward for them both and they would take care of ella  cora would be happier than ever yet among the maysandoh why why was there so much unkind selfish jealousy left that instead of being glad the notion left her so very miserable  why did the prospect of such happiness for her selfdevoted friend and nurse make her feel full of bitterness and hardly able to bear it patiently when she heard her speak the name of dr may  averil had again left her bed and resumed her place on the sofa before letters arrived  there was leonards from cocksmoor parsonage the first real letter she had had from him since his term of servitude had begun  it was a grave and thankful letter very short doing little more than mention every ones kindness and express a hope of soon meeting her and ella however and wherever henry should think best brief as it was it made her more thoroughly realize his liberty and feel that the yearning towards him in her heart was growing more and more ardent in spite of her strivings not to let it awaken  the same post brought henrys answer to tom mays representation it was decisive  he had broken off his whole connection with england and did not wish to return to a neighbourhood so full of painful recollections  he was making his way rapidly upwards in his present position and it would be folly to give up the advantages it offered moreover he had no fears of the future welldoing of the massissauga company  as soon as the weather permitted it he hoped to remove his sister to a healthier locality for change of air but she could not be fit for a journey in the winter  there were plenty of acknowledgments to the mays for their kindness to leonard from whom henry said he had heard as well as from dr may and others at stoneborough  he should advise leonard by all means to close with mr bramshaws offer for he saw no opening for him in the united states at present although the ultimate triumph over rebellion c c cin the most inflated style of henrys truly adopted country no one who had not known the whole affair would ever enter into leonards entire innocence the stigma of conviction would cleave to him and create an impression against him and his family among strangers and it was highly desirable that he should remain among friends  in fact it was plain that henry was still ashamed of him and wished to be free of a dangerous appendage  tom was so savagely angry at this letter that he could only work off his wrath by a wild expedition in the snow in the course of which he lost his way wandered till the adventure began to grow perilous came at last upon a squatter with great difficulty induced him to indicate the track sufficiently for his english density and arrived at massissauga at nine oclock at night  averil was still on her sofa quite calm and quiet all but her two red spots but afterwards in her own room she had one of her worst fits of spasms  however she was up and dressed by the middle of the next day and contrary to her wont since the first time she sent ella out of the room when her doctor came to see her  i wanted to speak to you she said i have a great favour to ask of you  you will soon be going home  would you could you take ella with you  i know it is a great a too great thing to ask  but i would not have her in any ones way  i am going to write to mrs wills at the school where i was and ellas means are quite enough to keep her there holidays and all till leonard can give her a home  it will be much better for her and a relief to henry and it will be giving back oneone to leonard  it will be one thing more that i shall be happy about  tom had let her go on with her short gentle sentences because he knew not how to answer but at last she said forgive me and do not think of it if i have asked what i ought not or would be troublesome  troublesome no indeed  i was only thinkingif it might not be better managed he answered rather by way of giving himself time to debate whether the utterance of the one thought in his heart would lead to his being driven away  pray do not propose leonards coming for her  he must come to this feverish place in spring  and if he came and i were not here and henry not wanting him  oh no no do not let me think of his coming  averil he said kneeling on one knee so as to be nearer and to be able to speak lower you are so unearthly in your unselfishness that i dare the less to put before you the one way in which i could take ella home to him  it is if you would overlook the past and give me a brothers right in them both  she turned in amazement to see if she had heard aright  he had removed his glasses and the deep blue expressive eyes so seldom plainly visible were wistfully pleadingly fixed on her brimming over with the dew of earnestness  her face of inquiry gave him courage to go on if you would only let me i think i could bring you home to see him and if you would believe it and try i believe i could make you happier and with an uncontrollable shake in his voice he ceasedand only looked  she sat upright her hands clasped in her lap her eyes shut trying to collect her thoughts and the silence lasted for several seconds at last she said opening her eyes but gazing straight before her not at him i do not think i ought  do you really know what you are saying you know i cannot get well  i know he said  all i ask is to tend and watch over you while i may to bring you home to leonard and to be ellas brother  his voice was still and low and he laid his hand on her folded ones with reverent solemnity but though it did not tremble its touch was cold as marble and conveyed to averil an instant sense of the force of his repressed emotion  she started under it and exclaimed with the first agitation she had shown no no it would cost you too much you young beginning lifeyou must not take a sorrow upon you  is it not there already he said almost inaudibly  would it lessen it to be kept away from you  oh do not go on do not tempt me she cried  think of your father  nay think what he is yourself  or rather look here and he took out a part of a letter from ethel and laid it before her  as to papa not guessing your object she said that was a vain delusion if you ever entertained it so you must not mind my having explained  he said if he had been you it was just what he should have done himself and he is quite ready to throw his heart into it if you will only trust to his kindness  i do so want you really to try what that is  and you came for this faltered averil leaning back almost overcome  i did not come meaning to hurry the subject on you  i hoped to have induced henry to have brought you all home and then when i had done my best to efface the recollection of that unpardonable behaviour to have tried whether you could look on me differently  i dont like you to say that said averil simply but earnestly i have felt over and over again how wrong i washow ungratefulto have utterly missed all the nobleness and generosity of your behaviour and answered in that unjust illtempered way  nothing was ever more deserved he answered i have hated myself ever since and i hope i am not as obnoxious now  it was i she said i have lived every bit of the winter over again and seen that i was always ready to be offended and somehow i could not help caring so much for what you said that lesser things from you hurt and cut as other peoples did not  do you know what that proves said tom with an arch subsmile lighting on his eyes and mouth and as a glow awoke on her pale cheek he added and wont you believe too that my propensity to contemptuous irony was all from my instinctive fear of what you could do to me  oh dont repeat that  i have been so bitterly ashamed of it  i am sure i have  and i have longed so to ask your pardon  i thought i would leave a letter or message with ella that you would understand  you can do better than that now  you can forgive me  oh said averil her hands suddenly joined over her face this is one joy more  i cannot think why it is all growing so bright just at lastat last  it is all come now  how good it is  he saw that she could bear no more  he pressed no more for a decisive answer he did not return to the subject but from that time he treated her as what belonged to him as if it was his business to think act and judge for her and to watch over her and her acquiescence was absolute  there was not much speaking between them there were chiefly skirmishes between him and cora to which she listened in smiling passive amusement and even when alone together they said littleactually nothing at all about the future  he had written to ethel on his first arrival and on the reply as well as on averils state all must depend  meanwhile such a look of satisfied repose and peace shone upon averils face as was most sweet to look upon and though extremely feeble and not essentially better she was less suffering and could in great languor but in calm enjoyment pass through day by day of the precious present that had come to crown her long trial     chapter xxx    oh when its flower seems fain to die   the full heart grudges smile or sigh   to aught beside though fair and dear   like a bruised leaf at touch of fear   its hidden fragrance love gives outlyra innocentum   the letters at last  one to ethel and three to leonard  now for it ethel  ethel openedreadran out of the room without a word and sought her father in his study where she laid before him toms letter written from massissauga the day after his arrival   dear ethel  i have found my darling but too late to arrest the diseasethe work of her brothers perverseness and wrongheadedness  i have no hope of saving her though it will probably be a matter of several monthsthat is with care and removal from this vile spot  i am writing to henry but i imagine that he is too much charmed with his present prospects to give them up and in her angelic selfsacrifice she insists on leonards not coming out  indeed there would be no use in his doing so unless she leaves this place but should no unforeseen complication supervene it is my full persuasion that she could be removed safely make the voyage and even be spared for this summer among us  surely my father will not object  it will be but a short time and she has suffered so much so piteously needs love and cherishing that it is not in him to refuse  he who consented to margarets engagement cannot but feel for us  i would work for him all my life  i would never cast a thought beyond home if only once hallowed by this dear presence for ever so short a time only let the answers be so cordial as to remove all doubts or scruples and when they are sent prepare for her  i would bring her as quickly as her health permits  no time must be lost in taking her from hence and i wait only for the letters to obtain her consent to an immediate marriage  furnish the house at once i will repay you on my return there is £200 for the first floor sitting and bedrooms for the rest the old will do  only regard the making these perfect colouring pinkall as cheerful and pleasant as money can accomplish  if flora will bear with me get her to help you or else mary if cheviot forgives me  only dont spare cost  i will make it up some way if you find more wanted  i saw an invalid sofa an improvement on margarets which i will write to gaspard to send from paris  if you could only see the desolateness of the house where she has wasted away these three years you would long to make a bower of bliss for her  i trust to you  i find i must trust everything to you  i cannot write to my father i have made nine beginnings and must leave it to you he has comforted her he knows her sorrows he could not see her and bid me leave her  only there must be no hesitation  that or even remonstrance would prevent her from consenting and as to the objections i cannot know them better than i do  indeed all this may be in vain she is so near heaven that i dare not talk to her of this but i have written to leonard dwelling chiefly on the chance of bringing her to him  her desire to keep him from attempting to come out will i trust be an inducement but if you could only see her you would know how irreverent it seems to persecute one so nearly an angel with such matters  if i may only tend her to the last  i trust to you  this is for my father                                            ever yours                                               thomas may   the last sentence referred to a brief medical summary of her symptoms on a separate paper  can this be tom was the doctors exclamation  poor boy it is going very hard with him  this would soften it more than anything else could said ethel  oh yes  you write  yes and ill write and tell him he is free to take his own way  poor child she would have been a good girl if she had known how  well of all my eleven children that tom should be the one to go on in this way  poor dear tom  what do you think of his statement of her case  is she so very ill  dr may screwed up his face  a sad variety of mischief he said if all be as he thinks i doubt his getting her home but he is young and has his heart in it  i have seen her mother in a state like thisonly without the diseased lungs  you cant remember it but poor ward never thought he could be grateful enough after she was pulled through however this is an aggravated case and looks badvery bad  it is a mournful ending for that poor boys patienceit will sink very deep and he will be a sadder man all his days but i would not hinder his laying up a treasure that will brighten as he grows older  thank you papa  i shall tell him what you say  i shall writeto her i think  i owe him something for not proving that it is all as a study of pneumonia  i say ethel what is become of the diseases of climate he added with a twinkle in his eye  in the nine beginnings  and how about the massissauga company  you heartless old worldlyminded father said ethel  when you take to prudence for tom what is the world coming to  into order said the doctor shaking himself into the coat she held for him  tom surrendered to a pet patient of mine  now for poor leonard  goodbye young people  i am off to cocksmoor  please take me grandpapa cried dickie hopping into the hall  you you onelegged manikin  im going over all the world and how are you to get home  on leonards back said the undaunted dickie  not so master poor leonard has news here that will take the taste of nonsense out of his mouth  i am his friend said dickie with dignity  then your friendship must not disturb him over his letters  and can you sit in the carriage and twirl your thumbs while i am at fordham  i shall not twirl my thumbs  i shall make out a problem on my ship chessboard  thats the boy who was sent from the antipodes that he might not be spoilt quoth aubrey as the doctor followed the child into the carriage  granting reasonable wishes is not spoiling said ethel  may the system succeed as well with dickie as with and aubrey in one flourish indicated gertrude and himself  ay we shall judge by the reception of ethels tidings cried gertrude  now for it ethel  read us toms letter confute the engineer hoist with his own petard  now ethel confute the daisy the green field daisythe simple innocent daisy deluded by diseases of climate  ethel looks as concerned as if it were fatal truth added gertrude  what is it asked aubrey  if henry ward has gone down in a monitor at charleston ill forgive him  not that said ethel but we little thought how ill poor ave is  dangerously said aubrey gravely  not perhaps immediately so but tom means to marry at once that he may have a chance of bringing her home to see leonard  another shock for leonard said aubrey quite subdued why cant he have a little respite  may they at least meet once more said ethel there will be some comfort in looking to that  and what a fellow tom is to have thought of it added aubrey nobody will ever dare to say again that he is not the best of the kit of us i must be off now to the meet but if you are writing ethel i wish you would give her my love or whatever he would like and tell him he is a credit to the family  i say may i tell george rivers  oh yes it will soon be in the air and charles cheviot will be down on us  away went aubrey to mount the hunter that george rivers placed at his service  gertrude who had been struck dumb looked up to ask then it is really so  indeed it is  then cried gertrude vehemently you and he have been deceiving us all this time  no gertrude there was nothing to tell  i did not really know and i could not gossip about him  you might have hinted  i tried but i was clumsy  i hate hints exclaimed the impetuous young lady one cant understand them and gets the credit of neglecting them  if people have a secret attachment they ought to let all their family know  perhaps they do in ireland  you dont feel one grain for me ethel said gertrude with tears in her eyes  only think how tom led me on to say horrid things about the wards and now to recollect them when she is so ill tooand he she burst into sobs  my poor daisy  i dare say it was half my fault  gertrude gave an impatient leap  there you go again calling it your fault is worse than charless improving the circumstance  it was my fault and it shall be my fault and nobody elses fault except toms and he will hate me and never let me come near her to show that i am not a nasty spiteful thing  i think that if you are quiet and kind and not flighty he will forget all that and be glad to let you be a sister to her  a sister to ave ward  pretty preferment muttered gertrude  poor ave  after the way she has borne her troubles we shall feel it an honour to be sisters to her  and that chair broke out gertrude  o ethel you did out of malice prepense make me vow it should be for mrs thomas may  well daisy if you wont suspect me of improving the circumstance i should say that finishing it for her would be capital discipline  horrid mockery i should say returned gertrude sadly a gaudy rosecoloured chair all over white foxgloves for a person in that state  poor toms great wish is to have her drawingroom made as charming as possible and it would be a real welcome to her  luckily said gertrude breaking into laughter again they dont know when it began how in a weak moment i admired the pattern and blanche inflicted it and all its appurtenances on me hoping to convert me to a fancyworkwoman  dear me pride has a fall  i loved to answer three stitches when mrs blanche asked after my progress  ah daisy if you did but respect any one  if they would not all be tiresome  seriously i know i must finish the thing because of my word  yes and i believe keeping a light word that has turned out heavy is the best help in bridling the tongue  and ethel i will really try to be seen and not heard while i am about the work said gertrude with an earnestness which proved that she was more sorry than her manner conveyed  her resolution stood the trying test of a visit from the elder married sisters for as ethel said the scent of the tidings attracted both flora and the cheviots and the headmaster endeavoured to institute a kind of family committee to represent to the doctor how undesirable the match would be entailing inconveniences that would not end with the poor brides life and bringing at once upon tom a crushing anxiety and sorrow  ethels opinion was of course set aside by mr cheviot but he did expect concurrence from mrs rivers and from richard and flora assented to all his objections but she was not to be induced to say she would remonstrate with her father or with tom and she intimated the uselessness thereof so plainly that she almost hoped that charles cheviot would be less eager to assail the doctor with his arguments  no hope of that said ethel when he had taken leave  he will disburthen his conscience but then papa is well able to take care of himself  flora i am so thankful you dont object  no indeed said flora  we all know it is a pity but it would be a far greater pity to break it off nowand do tom an infinity of harm now tell me all  and she threw herself into the subject in the homelike manner that had grown on her almost in proportion to marys guestlike ways and absorption in her own affairs  six weeks from that time another hasty note announced that dr and mrs thomas may and ella were at liverpool adding that averil had been exceedingly ill throughout the voyage though on being carried ashore she had so far revived that tom hoped to bring her home the next day but emotion was so dangerous that he begged not to be met at the station and above all that leonard would not show himself till summoned  dr may being unavoidably absent ethel alone repaired to the newlyfurnished house for this strange sad bridal welcome  the first person to appear when the carriage door was opened was a young girl pale tall thin only to be recognized by her black eyes with a rapid kiss and greeting ethel handed her on to the further door where she might satisfy the eager embrace of the brother who there awaited her while tom almost lifted out the veiled muffled figure of his bride and led her upstairs to the sittingroom where divesting her of hat cloak muff and respirator he laid her on the sofa and looked anxiously for her reassuring smile before he even seemed to perceive his sister or left room for her greeting  the squarelymade highcomplexioned handsome averil ward was entirely gone  in averil may ethel saw delicately refined and sharpened features dark beautiful eyes enlarged softened and beaming with perilous lustre a transparently white blueveined skin with a lovely roseate tint deepening or fading with every word look or movement and a smile painfully sweet and touching as first of the three the invalid found voice for thanks and inquiries for all  quite well said ethel  but papa has been most unluckily sent for to whitford and cant get home till the last train  it may be as well said tom we must have perfect quiet till after the nights rest  may i see one else tonight she wistfully asked  let us see how you are when you have had some coffee and are rested  very well she said with a gentle submission that was as new a sight as toms tenderness but indeed i am not tired and it is so pretty and pleasant  is this really dr spencers old house  can there be such a charming room in it  i did not think so said tom looking in amazement at the effect produced by the bright modern grate with its cheerful fire the warm delicate tints of the furniture the appliances for comfort and ornament already giving a home look  i know this is in the main your doing ethel but who was the hand  all of us were hands said ethel but flora was the moving spring she went to london for a week about it  mrs rivers  oh how good said averil flushing with surprise then raising herself as her coffee was brought in a dainty little service she exclaimed and oh if it were possible i should say that was my dear old piano  yes said ethel we thought you would like it and hector ernescliffe gave mrs wright a new one for it  this was almost too much  averils lip trembled but she looked up into her husbands face and made an answer which would have been odd had she not been speaking to his thought  never mind it is only happiness and the kindness  and she drank the coffee with an effort and smiled at him again as she asked where is ella  at our house said ethel we mean her to be there for the present  knowing with whom ella must be and fearing to show discontent with the mandate of patience averil again began to admire  what a beautiful chair  look tom is it not exquisite  whose work is it  gertrudes  that is the most fabulous thing of all said tom walking round it daisy  her present not her work  her work every stitch  it has been a race with time the gratification of averils flush and smile was laid up by ethel for gertrudes reward but it was plain that tom wanted complete rest for his wife and ethel only waited to install her in the adjoining bedroom which was as delightfully fitted up as the first apartment averil clung to her for the instant they were alone together and whispered oh it is all so sweet  dont think i dont feel it but you see it is all i can do for him to be as quiet as i can  say so please  ethel felt the throb of the heart and knew to whom she was to say so but toms restless approaching step made averil detach herself and sink into an armchair  ethel left her feeling that the short clasp of their arms had sealed their sisterhood here and for ever  it is too sad too beautiful to be talked about she said to gertrude who was anxiously on the watch for tidings  obedient as averil was she had not understood her husbands desire that she should seek her pillow at once  she was feeling brisk and fresh and by no means ready for captivity and she presently came forth again with her soft feeble noiseless step but she had nearly retreated again feeling herself mistaken and bewildered for in the drawingroom stood neither tom nor his sisters but a strangera dark grave thoughtful man of a singularly resolute and settled cast of countenance  the rustle of her dress made him look up as she turned ave he exclaimed and as their eyes met the light in those brown depths restored the whole past  she durst not trust herself to speak as her head rested on his shoulder his arms were round her only as her husband came on the scene with a gesture of surprise she said indeed i did not mean it  i did not know he was here  i might have known you could not be kept apart if i once let leonard in he said as he arranged her on the sofa and satisfied himself that there were no tokens of the repressed agitation that left such dangerous effects  will you both be very good if i leave you to be happy together he presently added after a few indifferent words had passed  averil looked wistfully after him as if he were wanted to complete full felicity even in leonards presence  how little would they once have thought that her first words to her brother would be  oh was there ever any one like him  we owe it all to him said leonard  so kind added averil not to be vexed though he dreaded our meeting so much and you see i could not grieve him by making a fuss but this is nice she added with a sigh going far beyond the effect of the homely word  you are better  ella said so  i am feeling well tonight  come let me look at you and learn your face  he knelt down beside her and she stroked back the hair which had fulfilled his wish that she should find it as long though much darker than of old  posture and action recalled that meeting when her couch had been his prison bed and the cold white prison walls had frowned on them yet even in the rosy light of the cheerful room there was on them the solemnity of an approaching doom  where is the old face averil said  you look as you did in the fever  your smile brings back something of yourself  but oh those hollow eyes  count ugolino is dr mays name for me but indeed ave i have tried to fatten for your inspection  it is not thinness she said but i had carried about with me the bright daring open face of my own boy  i shall learn to like this better now  nay it is you and ella that are changed  o ave you never let me know what a place you were in  there were many things better than you fancy she answered and it is overit is all gladness now  i see that in your face he said gazing his fill  you do look ill indeed but ave i never saw you so content  i cant help it she said smiling  every moment comes some fresh kindness from him  the more trouble i give him the kinder he is  is it not as if the tempest was over and we had been driven into the smoothest little sunshiny bay  to rest and refit he said thoughtfully  for me the last long wave and a most gentle smooth one it is said averil for you to refit for a fresh voyage  dear leonard i have often guessed what you would do  what have you guessed  only what we used to plan in the old times after you had been at coombe leonard  dear sister  and you would let me go  our parting is near any way she said her eye turning to the print from ary scheffers st augustine and monica  whoever gave us that divined how we ought to feel in these last days together  it was richard mays gift said leonard  ave there was nothing wanting but your liking this  then so it is she asked  unless the past disqualifies me he said  i have spoken to no one yet except little dickie  when i thought i ought to find some present employment and wanted to take a clerkship at bramshaws dr may made me promise to wait till i had seen you before i fixed on anything but my mind is made up and i shall speak nowwith your blessing on it ave  i knew it she said  he saw it was safer to quit this subject and asked for henry  he sent his love  he met us at new york  he is grown so soldierly with such a black beard that he is more grown out of knowledge than any of us but i scarcely saw him for he was quite overset at my appearance and tom thought it did me harm  i wish our new sister would have come to see me  sister  oh did you not know  i thought tom had written  she is a virginian lady whose first husband was a doctor who died of campfever early in the war  a federal of course  and they are to be married as soon as charleston has fallen  leonard smiled  and averil expressed her certainty that it had fallen by that time  and he is quite americanized asked leonard  does he return to our own name  no  then i do not wonder he did not wish for me perhaps he may yet bear to meet me some day when we are grown old  at least we can pray to be altogether where one is gone already said averil  that was the one comfort in parting with the dear coramy blessing through all the worst  leonard she would not go to live in the fine house her father has taken at new york but she is gone to be one of the nurses in the midst of all the hospital miseries  and oh what comfort she will carry with her  here tom returned but made no objection to her brothers stay perceiving that his aspect and voice were like fulness to the hungry heart that had pined so longbut keeping all the others away and they meanwhile were much entertained by ella who was in joyous spirits a little subdued indeed by the unknown brother but in his absence very communicative  gertrude was greatly amused with her account of the marriage in the sittingroom at massissauga and of toms being so unprepared for the brevity of the american form that he never knew where he was in the service and completed it with a puzzled is that all  averil had according to ella been infinitely more calm and composed she does nothing but watch his eyes said ella and ever since we parted from cora i have had no one to speak to  in the cabin he never stirred from sitting by her and if she could speak at all it was so low that i could not hear  school will be quite lively  are you going to school  oh yes where ave was  that is quite fixed and i have had enough of playing third person said ella with her precocious western manner you know i have all my own property so i shall be on no ones hands oh and cora made her father buy all aves massissauga sharesat a dead loss to us of course  well said gertrude i am sorry tom is not an american shareholder it was such fun  he wanted to have made them all over to henry but cora was determined and her father is making heaps of money as a commissary so i am sure he could afford it  some day when the rebellion is subdued i mean to go and see cora and henry and his wife added ella whose tinge of americanism formed an amusing contrast with dickies colonial easeespecially when she began to detail the discomforts of massissauga and he made practical suggestions for the remedies of eachdescribing how mamma and he himself managed  the younger ones had all gone to bed richard had returned home and ethel was waiting to let her father in when leonard came back with the new arrivals  i did not think you would be allowed to stay so late said ethel  we did not talk much  i was playing chants most of the time and after she went to bed i stayed with tom  what do you think of her  i cannot think  i can only feel a sort of awe  end as it may it will have been a blessed thing to have had her among us like this  yes it ought to do us all good  and i think she is full of enjoyment  perfect enjoyment repeated leonard  thank god for that  after some pause during which he turned over his pocketbook as if seeking for something he came to her and said miss may averil has assented to a purpose that has long been growing up within meand that i had rather consult you about than any one because you first inspired it  i think i know the purpose you mean said ethel her heart beating high  the first best purpose of my boyhood he said  if only it may be given back to me  will you be kind enough to look over this rough copy  it was the draught of a letter to the missionary bishop mr seafords diocesan briefly setting forth leonards early history his conviction and his pardon referring to archdeacon may as a witness to the truth of his narrative  after this statement he proceeded it appears to me little short of effrontery to offer myself for any share of the sacred labour in which your lordship is engaged and though it had been the wish of the best days of my youth i should not have ventured on the thought but for the encouragement i received from mr seaford your lordships chaplain  i have a small income of my own so that i should not be a burthen on the mission and understanding that mechanical arts are found useful i will mention that i learnt shoemaking at milbank and carpentry at portland and i would gladly undertake any manual occupation needed in a mission  latterly i was employed in the schoolmasters department and i have some knowledge of music  my education is of course imperfect but i am endeavouring to improve myself  my age is twentyone i have good health and i believe i can bring power of endurance and willingness to be employed in any manner that may be serviceable whether as artisan or catechist  i dont think they will make a shoemaker of you said ethel with her heart full  will they have me at all  there will always be a sort of ticketofleave flavour about me said leonard speaking simply straightforwardly but without dejection and i might be doubtful material for a mission  your brother put that in your head  he implied that my case half known would be a discredit to him and i am prepared for others thinking so  if so i can get a situation at portland and i know i can be useful there but when such a hope as this was opened to me again i could not help making an attempt do you think i may show that letter to dr may  o leonard this is one of the best days of ones life  but what he asked as she looked over the letter what shall i alter  i do not know only you are so businesslike you do not seem to care enough  if i let myself out it would look like unbecoming pressing of myself considering what i am but if you think i ought i will say more  i have become so much used to writing letters under constraint that i know i am very dry  let papa see it first said ethel  after all earnestness is best out of sight  mr wilmot and he shall decide whether i may send it he said and in the meantime i would go to st augustines if they will have me  i see you have thought it all over  yes  i only waited to have spoken with my sister and shedear dear avehad separately thought of such a destination for me  it was more than acquiescence more than i dared to hope  her spirit will be with you wherever she is  and with a sudden smile leonard was not this the secret between you and dickie  yes said leonard smiling too the dear little fellow is so fresh and loving as well as so wise and discreet that he draws out all that is in ones heart  it has been a new life to me ever since he took to me  do you know i believe he has been writing a letter of recommendation of me on his own account to the bishop i told him he must enclose it to his father if he presumed to send it though he claims the bishop as his intimate friend  ah said ethel papa is always telling him that they cant get on in new zealand for want of the small archdeacon and that i really think abashes him more than anything else  he is not forward he is only sensible said leonard on whose heart dickie had far too fast a hold for even this slight disparagement not to be rebutted  i had forgotten what a child could be till i was with him i felt like a stock or a stone among you all  ethel smiled  i was nearly giving you marmion in remembrance of old times on the night of the christmastree she said but i did not then feel as if the giving double for all your care and trouble had begun  the heart to feel it so was not come said leonard now since i have grasped this hope of making known to others the way to that grace that held me uphe paused with excess of feelingall has been joy even in the recollection of the darkest days  mr wilmots words come back now that it may all have been training for my masters work  even the manual labour may have been my preparation his eyes brightened and he was indeed more like the eager hopeful youth she remembered than she had ever hoped to see him but this brightness was the flash of steel tried strengthened and refined in the firea brightness that might well be trusted  one knew it must be so was all she could say  yes yes he said eagerly  you sent me words of greeting that held up my faith and above all when we read those books at coombe you put the key of comfort in my hand and i never quite lost it miss may he added as dr mays latchkey was heard in the front door if ever i come to any good i owe it to you  and that was the result of the boys romance  the first tidings of the travellers next morning were brought near the end of breakfast by tom who came in looking thin worn and anxious saying that averil had called herself too happy to sleep till morning when a short doze had only rendered her feeble exhausted and depressed  i shall go and see her said dr may i like my patients best in that mood  nor would the doctor let his restless anxious son do more than make the introduction but despatched him to the hospital whence returning to find himself still excluded he could endure nothing but pacing up and down the lawn in sight of his fathers head in the window and seeking as usual ethels sympathy  there was some truth in what charles cheviot had said  wedlock did enhance the grief and loss and tom found the privilege of these months of tendance more heartwringing than he had anticipated though of course more precious and inestimable  moreover averils depression had been a phase of her illness which had not before revealed itself in such a degree  generally he said she has talked as if what she looks to were all such pure hope and joy that though it broke ones heart to hear it one saw it made her happy and could stand it  fancy ethel not an hour after we were married i found her trying the ring on this finger and saying i should be able to wear it like my father  it seemed as if she would regret nothing but my sorrow and that my keeping it out of sight was all that was needful to her happiness but today she has been blaming herself forfor grieving to leave all so soon just as her happiness might have been beginning  think ethel  reproaching herself for unthankfulness even to tears  it might have been more for her peace to have remained with her where she had no revival of these associations if they are only pain to her  oh no no tom  it only proves the pleasure they do give her  you know better than i do that there must be ups and downs failures of spirits from fatigue when the will is peaceful and resigned  i know it  i know it with my understanding ethel but as to reasoning about her as if she was anybody else the thing is mere mockery  what can my father be about he added for the twentieth time  talking to her in the morning always knocks her up  if he had only let me warn him but he hurried me off in his inconsiderate way  at last however the head disappeared and tom rushed indoors  so tom you have made shorter work of twentyfive patients than i of one  ill go again said poor tom in the desperation of resolute meekness only let me see how she is  let ethel go up now  she is very cheery except for a little headache  while ethel obeyed dr may began a minute interrogation of his son so lengthened that tom could hardly restrain sharp impatient replies to such apparent trifling with his agony to learn how long his father thought he could keep his treasure and how much suffering might be spared to her  at last dr may said i may be wrong  your science is fresher than mine but to me there seem indications that the organic disease is in the way of being arrested  good health of course she cannot have but if she weathers another winter i think you may look for as many years of happiness with her as in an ordinary case  it was the first accent of hope since the hysteric scream that had been his greeting and all his reserve and dread of emotion could not prevent his covering his face with his hands and sobbing aloud father father he said you cannot tell what this is to me  i can in part my boy said the doctor sadly  and he started up and walked about the room you shall have the whole treatment  i will only follow your measures  no one at new york saw the slightest hope of checking it  they had your account and you hardly allowed enough for the hysterical affection  i do not say it is certaintyfar less health  any way any way if i may only have her to lie and look at me it is happiness unlooked for  you dont think i could have treated her otherwise  no  under his blessing you saved her yourself  you would have perceived the change if she had been an indifferent person  tom made another turn to the door and came back still half wild and laid his face on his arms upon the table  you tell her he said i shall never be able  knocking at averils door dr may was answered by a call of tom  not this time my dear  he is coming but we have been talking you over  ave you have a very young doctor and rather too much interested  indeed she said indignantly he has made me much better  exactly so my dear so much better that he agrees with me that he expressed a strong opinion prematurely  they thought the same at new york she said still resolved on his defence  my dear unless you are bent on growing worse in order to justify his first opinion i think you will prove that which he now holds and ave it was under providence skill that we may be proud of by which he has subdued the really fatal disorder  you may have much to undergo and must submit to a sofa life and much nursing but i think you will not leave him so soon  there was a long pause at last she said o dr may i beg your pardon  if i had known i would never  never what my dear  never have consented  it is such a grievous thing for a professional man to have a sick wife  it is exactly what he wanted my dear if you will not fly at me for saying so  nothing else could teach him that patients are not cases but persons and here he comes to tell you what he thinks of the trouble of a sick wife  well said dr may as he and ethel walked away together poor young things they have a chequered time before them  pretty well for the doctor who hated sick people wards and stoneborough but after all i have liked none of our weddings better  i like people to rub one another brighter  and i am proud when the least unselfish nature has from first to last done the most unselfish things  no one of us has ever given up so much as tom and i am sure he will be happy in it  more can hardly be said without straying into the realms of prediction yet such of our readers as are bent on carrying on their knowledge of the daisies beyond the last sentence may be told that to the best of our belief leonards shoemaking is not his foremost office in the mission where he finds that fulness of hopeful gladness which experience shows is literally often vouchsafed to those who have given up home land and friends for the gospels sake  his letters are the delight of more than one at stoneborough and his sister upon her sofa is that home member of a mission without whom nothing can be donethe copier of letters the depot of gifts the purveyor of commissions the maker of clothes the collector of books the keeper of accountsso that the house still merits the name of the s p g office as it used to be called in the spenserian era  but mrs thomas may is a good deal more than this  her sofa is almost a renewal of the family centre that once margarets was the region where all tidings are brought fresh for discussion all joys and sorrows poured out the external influence that above all has tended to soften gertrude into the bright grace of womanhood  mary cheviot and blanche ernescliffe cannot be cured of a pitying poor tomas they speak of the professorin which title the awkward sound of dr tom has been merged since an appointment subsequent to the appearance of the diseases of climate  but every one else holds that not his honours as a scientific physician his discoveries and ablywritten  papersnot even his fathers full and loving confidence and gratitude give professor may as much happiness as that brighteyed delicate wife with whom all his thoughts seem to begin and end
