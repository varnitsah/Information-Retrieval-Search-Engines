81179786	the norsemen in the west by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the norsemen in the west or america before columbus  the curtain rises and the play begins  one fine autumn evening between eight and nine hundred years ago two large hairy creatures bearing some resemblance to polar bears might have been seen creeping slowly and with much caution toward the summit of a ridge that formed a spur to one of the iceclad mountains of greenland  the creatures went on allfours  they had long bodies short legs shorter tails and large round heads  having gained the top of the ridge they peeped over and beheld a hamlet nestled at the foot of a frowning cliff and at the head of a smiling inlet  we use these terms advisedly because the cliff being in deep shadow looked unusually black and forbidding while the inlet besides being under the influence of a profound calm was lit up on all its dimples by the rays of the setting sun  the hamlet consisted of one large cottage and half a dozen small cots besides several sheds and enclosures wherein were a few sleepylooking sheep some lean cattle and several halfstarved horses  there was active life there also  smoke issued from the chimneys freshlooking women busied themselves about household work rosy children tumbled in and out at the doors while men in rough garments and with ruddy countenances mended nets or repaired boats on the shore  on a bench in front of the principal cottage sat a sturdy man scarcely middleaged with shaggy fair and flowing locks  his right foot served as a horse to a rapturous little boy whose locks and looks were so like to those of the man that their kinship was obviousonly the man was rugged and rough in exterior the boy was round and smooth  tow typified the hair of the man floss silk that of the boy  everything in and around the hamlet bore evidence of peace and thrift it was a settlement of norsementhe first greenland settlement established by eric the red of iceland about the year 986nearly twenty years before the date of the opening of our taleand the hairy creatures above referred to had gone there to look at it  having gazed very intently over the ridge for a considerable time they crept backwards with extreme caution and on getting sufficiently far down the hillside to be safe from observation rose on their hindlegs and began to talk from which circumstance it may be concluded that they were human beings  after talking grinning and glaring at each other for a few minutes with gestures to correspond as though on the point of engaging in mortal combat they suddenly wheeled about and walked off at a rapid pace in the direction of a gorge in the mountains the head of which was shut in by and filled up with cliffs and masses and fields of ice that overtopped the everlasting hills and rested like a white crest on the blue sky  vast though it seemed this was merely a tongue of those great glaciers of the mysterious north which have done and are still doing so much to modify the earths economy and puzzle antiquarian philosophy which form the fountainhead of influences that promote the circulation of the great deep and constitute the cradle of those ponderous icebergs that cover the arctic seas  from out that gloomy gorge a band of more than a hundred hairy creatures issued with wild shouts and upraised arms to welcome back the adventurous two  they surrounded them and forthwith the nationfor the entire nation was evidently thereheld a general assembly or parliament on the spot  there was a good deal of uproar and confusion in that parliament with occasional attempts on the part of several speakers to obtain a hearing at one and the same timein which respects this parliament bore some resemblance to civilised assemblies of the present day  there was also an immense amount of gesticulation and excitement  at last there uprose a man clad in garments that had once belonged to a seal and with a face that was quite as round and nearly as flat as a fryingpan  he stood fully half a foot higher than the tallest of his fellows  like the adventurous two he had a taila very short tailto his coat but indeed this might be said of all the men of the tribe the womens tails however were long  perhaps this was meant as a mark of distinction for their costume was so very similar to that of the men that their smaller size and longer tails alone marked the difference to be sure there was additional presumptive evidence of their sex in the fact that most of them carried babies in their hoods which hoods were made preposterously large for the express purpose of containing the babies  to the tall man with the flat face the assembly listened with eager looks bated breath and open mouths  what he saidwho can tell  his language was unintelligible to civilised ears  not so however his actions which were vigorous and full of meaning and comprehensible by all nations  if there be any significance in signs at all he began by saying hold your stupid tongues and i will speak  this drew forth loud and prolonged applauseas consummate impudence usually does  when he pointed with both hands to the women and children and spoke in tender tones instantly thereafter growling in his speech gnashing his teeth glaring fiercely waving one hand at the surrounding hills and shaking the other clenched at the unoffending seahe was obviously stating his grievances namely that the white men had come there to wrest from him his native hills and glaciers and rob him of his wife and children and that he defied them to come on and do their worst seeing that in regard to the whole assembled white world in arms he did not care a buttonor a walrustusk for buttons were unknown to these creatures at that time  when suddenly changing his manner and tone he seized a spear hissed his sentiments through his teeth with great volubility and made a furious plunge that caused the assembly to gasp and the man nearest the spear point to shrivel upwhat could be his meaning save that nothing short of a hole right through the body of a norseman could appease the spirit of indignation that caused his blood to boil  and when finally he pointed to the setting sun traced a line with his finger from it downward to the centre of the earth under his feet then shook his spear wrathfully toward the sea and wound up with a tremendous ho that would have startled the echoes of the place had there been any there it was plain to the meanest capacity that an attackimpetuous and overwhelmingwas to be made on the strangers at midnight  whatever were his sentiments the assembly heartily appreciated applauded and approved them  they cheered and shouted hear hear after their own fashion and then the whole band rushed back into the mountain gorgedoubtless with the intent to gorge themselves with raw blubber prepare their weapons and snatch a little repose before issuing forth to battle  but let us return to the norsemen over whose innocent heads such awful prospects were impending  the sturdy man with the fair shaggy locks was leif the son of eric the red of iceland  the boy with the silken curls who rode on his foot so joyously was his son olaf  eric had died several years before the date on which our tale opens and leif inherited his cottage and property at brattalid in ericsfiord on the west coast of greenlandthe hamlet which we have already described  come now olaf said leif flinging the child from his foot to his knee and thence to the ground give me your hand we shall go see how the boats and nets get onhey there goes a puff of wind  we shall have more presently  he paused and scanned the seaward horizon with that intent abstracted gaze which is peculiar to seafaring men  so long did he gaze and so earnestly that the child looked up in his face with an expression of surprise and then at the horizon where a dark blue line indicated the approach of a breeze  what do you see father asked olaf  methinks i see two ships replied leif  at this there came a sweet musical voice from the cottageships brother  did i not tell you that i had a dream about two ships and said i not that i was sure something was going to happen  the speaker appeared in the doorway drying her hands and arms on a towelfor she had been washing dishes  she was a fair comely young woman with exceedingly deep blue eyes and a bright colour in her cheeksfor women of the richer class were remarkably healthy and wellmade in those days  they did a great deal of hard work with their hands hence their arms were strong and well developed without losing anything of their elegance  you are always dreaming widow gudrid said leif with a quiet smilefor he was no believer in dreams or superstitions in which respect he differed much from the men and women of his time nevertheless i am bound to admit that you did tell me that something was going to happen and no one can deny that something is about to occur just now  but your dream happened a month or six weeks ago and the something which you are pleased to assume is these two ships is only happening today  see now i can be a more definite prophet than thou i will prophesy that yule is comingand it will surely come if you only wait long enough  you are an unbeliever brotherinlaw retorted gudrid with a laugh but i have not time to reason with you  these ships will bring strangers and i must prepare to show them hospitalitycome olaf help me to put the house in order  thus summoned olaf followed gudrid into the house with alacrity for he was passionately fond of his pretty aunt who stood in the place of a mother to him his own mother having died when he was an infant  but aunt said olaf checking himself in the doorway and looking wistfully back i want to see the ships come in  you shall see that my son i will not keep you too long  this was quite sufficient  olaf thoroughly believed in his aunts truthfulness and wisdom  he set to work to assist in clearing away the confusionpart of which in the shape of toys and chipswas of his own creatingand became so busy that he almost forgot the shipsat least if he did remember them they did not weigh heavily on his mind  now olaf said gudrid going to the window when the preparations were nearly completed you may run down to the shore for the ships will soon be on the strand  the boy waited no second bidding you may be sure  he flew out of the house and to his great surprise beheld the two shipswhich so lately had appeared like seabirds on the horizoncoming grandly up the fiord their great square sails bulging out before a smart breeze  all the men of the little colony were assembled on the shoreall at least who chanced to be at home at the time but many of the inhabitants were absentsome fishing some gone to iceland and others on vikingcruise  there were probably about thirty men on the sands besides a good many women and children  it must not be supposed however that this was the whole of that greenland colony  it was only the part of it that had settled at brattalid in ericsfiord  there was another portion a few miles distant named heriulfness nearly as large as that of ericsfiord which had been founded by heriulf a friend and companion of eric the red heriulf had soon followed his friend eric to the grave leaving the management of the colony of heriulfness to his son biarne  biarne had not been present when the two sails were first observed but he chanced to come over to brattalid just before their arrival  what ho  biarne shouted leif as the son of heriulf went down to the beach come up hither  leif stood on an elevated rock apart and biarne a good deal excited went up to him  why what ails thee asked leif  nothing replied biarne but i think i know whose ship that first one is  ay is it the ship of a friend or a foe  a friend replied biarneat least he was a friend when i knew him in norway nigh twenty summers past and i did not think him changeable you and i leif have often sailed these northern seas together and apart but i do not think that in all our wanderings either of us has met before or since a finer man than karlsefin though he was a mere stripling when i knew him  the norsemans eyes flashed as he spoke of his friend for besides being a strong and handsome man he possessed a warm enthusiastic heart indeed he had been noted in the settlement for the strength of his affection for his father heriulf and his dutiful conduct towards him as long as the old man lived  karlsefin repeated leif musing i know him not  yet he knows you said biarne when i met him in norway i told him all about your discovery of vinland  nay thine own discovery of it said leif  not so replied the other with a blush in which a frown mingled i did but look upon the landyou went ashore and took possession  well if i did so i have not retained it replied leif with a laugh but say how know you that this is karlsefins ship  i know by the cut of her figurehead and the colour of her sails karlsefin was always partial to stripes of white and blue  well it may be as you say we shall soon know  thus saying leif descended to the beach as the vessels approached and ran their keels straight on the sandy shores of the bay  there was great bustle on board and there were many men besides some women who could be seen looking over the bulwarks with keen interest while leifs men brought planks with which to make a gangway from the ship to the shore  the ships which had thus come to greenland were of the quaint build peculiar to the norse vessels of those daysa peculiarity of build by the way which has not altogether disappeared for to this day the great central mast huge square sail and high prow may be seen in the fiords of norway  each of the vessels which now lay beached in ericsfiord had a high forecastle and poop with figureheads on stem and sternposts that towered higher still  the ships were only halfdecked with benches for numerous rowers and each had a crew of sixty men  when the gangway was laid to the leading ship the first man who descended to the shore was of striking appearance  it was not so much that he was tall and strong enough to have been a worthy foeman to the stoutest colonist in ericsfiord as that his demeanour was bland and courtly while there was great intellectuality in his dark handsome countenance  unlike most norsemen his hair and beard were black and closecurling and his costume though simple was rich in quality  the moment he landed biarne stepped forward exclaiming karlsefin  the strangers face lighted up with surprise and pleasure  biarne he said seizing his hand i thought you were in iceland  so i was but now i am in greenland and right glad to be the first to welcome my friend  hereupon the two shook hands fervently but not content with this they seized each other in an embrace and their bearded mouths met with a hearty masculine smack that did credit to their hearts and which it might have gratified the feelings of an affectionate walrus to behold    chapter two  strong emotions are succeeded by supper and followed by discussions on discovery which end in a wild alarm  when karlsefin had been introduced to leif ericsson the former turned round and presented to him and biarne his friend thorward the captain of the other ship  thorward was not a tall man but was very broad and stout and had a firm yet pleasing cast of countenance  both thorward and karlsefin were men of about thirtyfive years of age  are you not on vikingcruise asked leif as they walked up to the house together while the male members of his household and the men of the settlement assisted the crews to moor the ships  no my friend thorward and i are not men of war  we prefer the peaceful occupation of the merchant and to say truth it is not unprofitable  i would that more were of your way of thinking said leif  i do not love the bloody game of war and glad am i that we have got into a quiet corner here in greenland where there is small occasion for it  biarne too is of our way of thinking as no doubt you already know  he has often told me so and if i mistake not has feathered his nest well by merchanting  he has answered biarne for himself with a laugh  while they thus advanced talking little olaf had kept walking in front of the tall stranger looking up into his face with unbounded admiration  he had never before seen any man so magnificent  his father and biarne whom he had hitherto regarded as perfect specimens of mankind were quite eclipsed  looking backward and walking forward is an unsafe process at any time  so olaf found it on the present occasion for he tripped over a stone and in falling hit his little nose with such violence that it soon became a big nose and bled profusely  karlsefin picked him up and set him on his legs  my poor boy dont cry he said  no fear of him crying observed leif he never criessave when his feelings are hurt  when you touch these he is addicted to blubberingrun lad and gudrid will wash you  olaf bounded into the house where he was carried off to a sleepingroom and there carefully sponged by the sympathetic gudrid  oh he exclaimed while his face was being washed  does it pain you much dear said the pretty aunt interrupting him  oh he continued enthusiastically i never did see such a splendid man before  what splendid man child  why karlsefin  and who is karlsefin  the stranger who has come across the sea from norway  indeed said gudrid  whether it was the sound of the strangers voice in the adjoining room or anxiety to complete her hospitable preparations that caused gudrid to bring her operations on olaf to an abrupt termination we cannot tell but certain it is that she dried him rather quickly and hastened into the outer hall where she was introduced to the two strangers in due form as widow gudrid  she had no difficulty in distinguishing which was olafs splendid man she looked at karlsefin and fell in love with him on the spot but gudrid was modest and not sentimental  it is only your mawkishly sentimental people who are perpetually tumbling into love and out of it and cant help showing it  cupid shot her right through the heart with one powerful dart and took her unawares too but she did not show the smallest symptom of having been even grazed  she neither blushed nor stammered nor looked conscious nor affected to look unconscious she was charmingly natural  but this was not all karlsefin also fell in love on the spotover head and ears and hair and hat to boot neither did he show sign of it after the trifling ceremonies usual on an introduction were over he turned to continue his conversation with leif and paid no further attention to gudrid while she busied herself in preparing supper  it is true that he looked at her now and then but of course he looked at everybody now and then in the course of the evening  besides it is wellknown what is said about the rights of the feline species in reference to royalty  at supper gudrid waited on the guests karlsefin therefore necessarily paid her somewhat more attention in accepting her civilities but thorward was quite as attentive as he so that the most sharpwitted matchmaker in the world would have failed to note any symptom of anything whatever in regard to either of them  gudrid felt this a little for she was accustomed to admiration from the young men of ericsfiord and heriulfness and you know people dont like to want what they are accustomed to  what karlsefin thought he did not show and never mentioned therefore we cannot tell  now good reader pray do not run away with the notion that this love affair is the plot on which the story is to hinge  nothing of the kind it ran its course much more rapidly and terminated much more abruptly than you probably supposeas the sequel will show  during supper there was not much conversation for all were hungry but afterwards when cans of homebrewed ale were handed round the tongues began to move  leif soon observed that karlsefin merely sipped his beer but never once drank  you do not drink he said pushing a large silver tankard towards him come fill up  thanks i drink but sparingly said karlsefin taking up the large tankard and admiring the workmanship  in good sooth ye do cried biarne with a laugh a mouse could hardly slake his thirst with all that you have yet imbibed  i have been so long at sea rejoined karlsefin smiling that i have lost my relish for beer  we had nothing but water with us  where got you this tankard leif it is very massive and the workmanship such as one seldom meets with save in kings houses  it belonged to a king replied leif with a look of pride  good king olaf tryggvisson gave it to me on an occasion when i chanced to do him some small service  many winters have passed since then  indeed leif then you must be a favourite with king olaf exclaimed karlsefin for i am the bearer of another gift to you from his royal hand  to me  ay  hearing that i meant to sail over to greenland this summer he asked me to bear you his remembrances and gave me two slaves to present to you in token of his continued friendship  leifs face beamed with satisfaction and he immediately filled and quaffed a bumper of ale to king olafs health which example was followed by biarne and the guests as well as by the housecarls who sat on benches in various parts of the hall drinking their ale and listening to the conversation  even little olafwho had been named after the king of norwayfilled his tankard to the brim with milk and quaffed it off with a swagger that was worthy of a descendant of a long line of seakings who could trace their lineage back to odin himself  the slaves continued karlsefin are from the land of the scots wouldst like to see a scotsman gudrid he added turning to the widow who sat near him  i should like it much  i have heard of the scots in iceland  tis said they are a wellfavoured race stout warriors and somewhat fond of trading  leif and biarne both laughed loud and long at this  in good truth they are a stout race and fight like very wildcats as biarne and i can testify as to their being wellfavoured there can be no question about that though they are rather more rugged than the people farther south andyes they are good traders and exceedingly cautious men  they think well before they speak and they speak slowlysometimes they wont speak at all  ha ha  here i drink to the land of the scot  it is a grand good land like our own dear old norway  brotherinlaw exclaimed gudrid reproachfully do you forget that you are an icelander  forget exclaimed leif tossing back his yellow locks and raising the tankard again to pledge his native land no i shall only forget iceland when i forget to live but i dont forget also that it is only about 130 years since my greatgrandfather and his companions came over from norway to iceland  before that it was an unpeopled rock in the northern sea without name or history  iceland was colonised by norsemen about the year 874 twas as little known then as vinland is known now  by the way biarne said karlsefin turning to his friend the mention of vinland reminds me that when you and i met last you did not give me a full account of that discovery seeing that you omitted to mention your own share in it  tell me how was it and when and where was it  nay have i unintentionally touched on a sore point he added on observing a slight shade of annoyance pass over biarnes usually cheerful countenance  he is a little sore about it said leif laughing  come biarne dont be thinskinned  you know the saying a dutiful son makes a glad father  you had the best of reasons for acting as you did  ay but people dont believe in these best of reasons retorted biarne still annoyed though somewhat mollified by leifs remarks  never mind tis long past now  come give us the saga  tis a good one and will bear retelling  oh yes exclaimed olaf with sparkling eyes for the boy dearly loved anything that bore the faintest resemblance to a saga or story tell it biarne  not i said biarne leif can tell it as well as i if he chooses  well ill try said leif laying his huge hand on the table and looking earnestly at karlsefin and thorward  the latter was a very silent man and had scarcely uttered a word all the evening but he appeared to take peculiar interest in vinland and backed up the request that leif would give an account of its discovery  about twenty summers ago said leif my father eric the red and his friend heriulf biarnes father came over here from iceland  ad 986 biarne was a very young man at the timelittle more than a boy but he was a man of enterprise and fond of going abroad and possessed a merchantship of his own with which he gathered wealth and i will say it reputation alsothough perhaps i should not say that to his face  he was a good son and used to be by turns a year abroad and a year with his father  he chanced to be away in norway when heriulf and my father eric came over to greenland  on returning to iceland he was so much disappointed to hear of his fathers departure that he would not unload his ship but resolved to follow his old custom and take up his winter abode with his father  who will go with me to greenland said he to his men  we will all go replied the men  our expedition said biarne will be thought foolish as none of us have ever been on the greenland sea before  we mind not that said the menso away they sailed for three days and lost sight of iceland  then the wind failed after that a north wind and a fog set in and they knew not where they were sailing to and this lasted many days  at length the sun appeared  then they knew the quarters of the sky and after sailing a day and a night made the land  they saw that it was without mountains was covered with wood and that there were small hills inland  biarne saw that this did not answer to the description of greenland he knew he was too far south so he left the land on the larboard side and sailed two days and nights before they got sight of land again  the men asked biarne if this was greenland but he said it was not for on greenland he says there are great snowy mountains but this is flat and covered with trees here the wind fell and the men wanted to go ashore because said they we have need of wood and water  biarne replied ye are not in want of either and the men blamed him for thisbut the season was far spent he knew not how long it might take him to find greenland so he had no time to sparewas it not so said leif appealing to his friend  it was so replied biarne nodding gravely  well then continued leif it must be told that he ordered them to hoist the sail which they did and turning the bow from the land kept the sea for three days and nights with a fine breeze from the southwest when a third time land was seen with high snowy mountains still biarne would not land for it was not like what had been reported of greenland  they soon found it to be an island and turning from it stood out to sea when the breeze increased to a gale forcing them to take in a reef so they sailed for three days and nights more and made land the fourth time  this turned out to be greenland and quite close to heriulfs dwelling at heriulfness  biarne then gave up seafaring and dwelt with his old father as long as he lived but since his death he has been sometimes at sea and sometimes at home  now these lands which biarne discovered were what i have since called vinland  yes exclaimed biarne with a look of indignation and when i afterwards fared to norway they blamed me for not going on shore and exploring these landsas if i at the end of autumn could afford to put off time in explorations when it was all i could do to make my port before the winter set in  he finished off by striking the table with his fist seizing his tankard and draining it to the bottom  i have often observed said karlsefin quietly that people who sit by their firesides at home and do nothing are usually very severe and noisy in their remarks on those who fare abroad and do great things but that arises not so much from illwill as ignorance  but what of your own doings leif said thorward breaking in here impatiently  well i didnt do much replied leif  i only took possession and didnt keep it  this was the way of it  fourteen years after this voyage of biarne about the year ad 1000 i was seized with a desire to see these new lands  i bought biarnes ship from him set sail with a good crew and found the lands just as biarne had described them far away to the south of greenland  i landed and gave names to some places at the farthest south point we built huts and spent the winter but returned home in spring  i called this part vinland and this is the reason why we had a german with us named tyrker who is with me here still  one day tyrker was lost i was very anxious about him fearing that he had been killed by wild beasts or skraelingers esquimaux or savages probably indians so i sent out parties to search  in the evening we found him coming home in a state of great excitement having found fruit which he said was grapes  the sight and taste of the fruit to which he was used in his own land had excited him to such an extent that we thought he was drunk and for some time he would do nothing but laugh and devour grapes and talk german which none of us understood  at last he spoke norse and told us that he had found vines and grapes in great abundance  we found that this was trueat least we found a berry which was quite new to us  we went off next day and gathering enough to load our boat brought them away with us  from this circumstance i called it vinland  two years after that my brother thorwald went to vinland wintered three years there was killed by the skraelingers and his men returned to greenland  then my youngest brother thorstein who was gudrids husband went off to vinland to fetch home the body of our brother thorwald but was driven back by stress of weather  he was taken ill soon after that and died  since then gudrid has dwelt with my household and glad we are to have her this is the whole story of vinland so if you want to know more about it you must een go on a voyage of discovery for yourself  i should like nothing better replied karlsefin if i could only  at that moment the door was burst violently open and a man with bloodshot eyes and labouring breath rushed in exclaiming the skraelinger the skraelinger are upon us    chapter three  dark warclouds lower but clear away without a showervoices and legs do good service  up carls buckle on your wargear cried leif rising hastily on hearing the announcement with which the last chapter ended  run thorward call out our men whispered karlsefin i will stay to learn what leif means to do  bring them all up to the door  thorward was gone almost before the sentence was finished  leif and his housecarls of whom there were ten present at the time did not take long to busk them for the fight  the norse of old were born bred and buriedif they escaped being killed and cut to piecesin the midst of alarms  their armour was easily donned and not very cumbrous  even while leif was giving the first order to his men gudrid had run to the peg on which hung his sword and helmet and brought him these implements of war  my men and i shall be able to render you some service leif said karlsefin what do you intend to do  do exclaimed leif with a grim laugh as he buckled on his sword why i shall give the skraelingers a tremendous fright that is all the rascals  they knew well that we were shorthanded just now and thought to take advantage of us but hah they do not seem to be aware that we chance to have stout visitors with us tonight  so lads follow me  biarne meanwhile had darted out on the first alarm and assembled all the men in the settlement so that when leif karlsefin and the housemen issued out of the cottage they found about a dozen men assembled and others running up every moment to join them  before these were put in array most of the men of karlsefins ship numbering forty and those belonging to thorward numbering thirty came up so that when all were mustered they were little if at all short of one hundred stout warriors  the moon came out brightly at the time and leif chuckled as he watched biarne put the men hastily into marching order  methought you said that war was distasteful observed karlsefin in some surprise  so it is so it is friend replied leif still laughing in a low tone but there will be no war tonight  leave your bows behind you lads he added addressing the men you wont want them shield and sword will be enough  for the matter of that we might do without both now lads follow my leading and do as i bid you advance with as little noise as may be  so saying leif led the way out of the little hamlet towards the extremity of the ridge or spur of the mountains that sheltered ericsfiord from the northwest  towards that same extremity another band of men were hastening on the other side of the ridge  it was a band of our hairy friends whom the norsemen called skraelingers  truly there was something grand in the look and bearing of the tall man with the flat face as he led his band to attack the warlike norsemen and there was something almost sublime in the savage resolute aspect of the men who followed himeach being armed with a large walrus spear and each being moreover an adept in the use of it  flatface in default of a better let that name stick to him had ascertained beyond a doubt that the entire available force of norsemen in ericsfiord had in consequence of fishing and other expeditions been reduced to barely thirty fighting men  he himself could muster a band of at least one hundred and fifty good men and truenot to mention hairy a hundred and fifty seals having unwillingly contributed their coats to cover these bloodthirsty skraelingers  the norsemen flatface knew were strong men and bold besides being large but he resolved to take them by surprise and surely he argued with himself a hundred and fifty brave men with spears will be more than a match for thirty sleepy men unarmed and in bed  flatface had screwed himself up with such considerations made a few more inflammatory speeches to his men by way of screwing them up also and then a little before midnight set forth on his expedition  now it chanced that there was a man among the norsemen who was a great hunter and trapper  his name was tyrkerthe same tyrker mentioned by leif as being the man who had found grapes in vinland  leif said he was a german but he said so on no better authority than the fact that he had originally come to norway from the south of europe  it is much more probable that he was a turk for whereas the germans are known to be a wellsized handsome race of fair men this tyrker was an ugly little dark wiry fellow with a high forehead sharp eyes and a small face but he was extremely active and although an elderly man few of the youths in ericsfiord could beat him at feats requiring dexterity  but whether german or turk tyrker was an enthusiastic trapper of white or arctic foxes  these creatures being very numerous in that part of greenland he was wont to go out at all hours late and early to visit his traps  hence it happened that on the night in question tyrker found himself in company with two captured arctic foxes at the extremity of the mountain spur before referred to  he could see round the corner of the spur into the country beyond but as the country there was not attractive even at its best he paid no attention to it  he chanced however to cast upon it one glance after setting his traps just as he was about to return home  that glance called forth a steady look which was followed by a stare of surprise and the deep guttural utterance of the word zzgrandimaghowl which no doubt was turkish at that ancient date for hallo  it was the band of hairy creatures that had met his astonished sight tyrker shrank behind the spur and peeped round it for a few seconds to make quite sure  then turning and creeping fairly out of sight he rose and bounded back to the hamlet as though he had been a youth of twenty  as we have seen he arrived gasping in time to warn his friends  between the hamlet and the spur where tyrkers traps were set there were several promontories or projections from the cliffs all of which had to be passed before the spur came in view  leif led his men past the first and second of these at a run  then believing that he had gone far enough he ordered his band to draw close up under the cliffs where the shadow was deepest saying that he would go alone in advance to reconnoitre  and mark me lads he said when i give a loud sneeze do you give vent to a roar that will only stop short of splitting your lungs then give chase and yell to your hearts content as you run but see to it that ye keep together and that no man runs past me  there is plenty of moonlight to let you see what youre about  if any man tries to overshoot me in the race ill hew off his head  this last remark was no figure of speech  in those days men were but too well accustomed to hewing off heads  leif meant to have his orders attended to and the men understood him  on reaching the second projection of cliff after leaving his men leif peeped round cautiously and beheld the advancing skraelingers several hundred yards off  he returned at once to his men and took up a position at their head in the deep shadow of the cliffs  although absolutely invisible themselves the norsemen could see the skraelingers quite plainly in the moonlight as they came slowly and with great caution round each turn of the footpath that led to the hamlet  there was something quite aweinspiring in the manner of their approach  evidently flatface dreaded a surprise for he put each leg very slowly in advance of the other and went on tiptoe glancing quickly on either side between each step  his followersin a compact body in deep silence and with bated breathfollowed his steps and his example  when they came to the place where the men crouched in ambush leif took up a large stone and cast it high over their heads  so quietly was this done that none even of his own party heard him move or saw the stone though they heard it fall with a thud on the sand beyond  the skraelingers heard it too and stopped abruptlyeach man on one leg with the other leg and his arms more or less extended just as if he had been suddenly petrified  so in truth he had beenwith horror  to meet an open enemy however powerful would have been a pleasure compared with that slow nervous advance in the midst of such dead silence  as nothing followed the sound however the suspended legs began to descend slowly again towards the ground when leif sneezed  if greenlands icy mountains had become one monstrous polar bear whose powers of voice frozen for prolonged ages had at last found vent that night in one concentrated roar the noise could scarcely have excelled that which instantly exploded from the norsemen  the effect on the skraelingers was almost miraculous  a bombshell bursting in the midst of a hundred and fifty kilkenny cats could not have been more effective and the result would certainly have borne some marks of resemblance  each hairy creature sprang nearly his own height into the air and wriggled while there as if impatient to turn and fly before reaching the ground  earth regained the more active among them overshot and overturned the clumsy whereby fifty or sixty were instantly cast down but these rose again like springjacks and fled followed by a roar of laughter from their foes which mingled as it was with howls and yells did infinitely more to appal the skraelingers than the most savage warcry could have done  but they were followed by more than laughter  the norsemen immediately gave chasestill yelling and roaring as they ran for leif set the example and his followers remembered his threat  karlsefin and biarne kept one on each side of leif about a pace behind him  if they fight as well as they run observed the former they must be troublesome neighbours  they are not bad fighters replied leif but sometimes they deem it wise to run  not unlike to other people in that respect said biarne but it seems to me that we might overhaul them if we were to push on  he shot up to leif as he spoke but the latter checked him  hold back biarne i mean them no harm and wish no bloodshedonly they must have a good fright  the lads no doubt would like to run in and make short work of them but i intend to breathe the lads which will in the end do just as well as fighting to relieve their feelings enough  it is ill talking and running  they were silent after that and ran thus for fully an hour at nearly the top of their speed  but leif sometimes checked his men and sometimes urged them on so that they fancied he was chasing with full intent to run the skraelingers down  when the fugitives showed signs of flagging he uttered a tremendous roar and his men echoed it sending such a thrill to the hearts of the skraelingers that they seemed to recover fresh wind and strength then he pushed after them harder than ever and so managed that without catching or killing one he terrified them almost out of their wits and ran them nearly to death  at last they came to a place where there was an abrupt bend in the mountains  here leif resolved to let them go  when they were pretty near the cliff round which the path turned he put on what in modern sporting phraseology is termed a spurt and came up so close with the flying band that those in rear began to glance despairingly over their shoulders  suddenly leif gave vent to a roar into which he threw all his remaining strength  it was taken up and prolonged by his men  the horrorstruck skraelingers shrieked in reply swept like a torrent round the projecting cliff and disappeared  leif stopped at once and held up his hand  all his men stopped short also and though they heard the skraelingers still howling as they fled no one followed them any farther  indeed most of the norsemen were panting vehemently and rather glad than otherwise to be allowed to halt  there were however two young men among themtall strongboned and thin but with broad shoulders and grave earnest though not exactly handsome countenanceswho appeared to be perfectly cool and in good wind after their long run  leif noticed them at once  yonder youths seem to think little of this sort of thing he said to karlsefin  you are right leif it is mere childs play to them  these are the two scotsthe famous runnerswhom i was charged by king olaf to present to you  why these men ill engage to say could overtake the skraelingers even yet if they chose  say you so cried leif  do they speak norse  yes excellently well  their names  the one is heika the other hake  ho  hake and heika come hither cried leif beckoning to the men and hastening round the point where the skraelingers could be seen nearly a mile off and still running as if all the evil spirits of the north were after them  see there carls think you that ye could overtake these rascals  the scots looked at each other nodded smiled and said they thought they could  do it then  let them see how you can use your legs and give them a shout as you draw near but have a care do them no hurt and see that they do no injury to you  take no arms your legs must suffice on this occasion  the scots looked again at each other and laughed as if they enjoyed the joke then they started off like a couple of deer at a pace which no norseman legs had ever before equalled or even approached  leif biarne and the men gazed in speechless wonder much to the amusement of karlsefin and thorward while hake and heika made straight for the flying band and came up with them  they shouted wildly as they drew near  the skraelingers looked back and seeing only two unarmed men stopped to receive them  as the saying goes remarked biarne a stern chase is a long one but tonight proves the truth of that other saying that there is no rule without an exception  what are they doing now cried leif laughing  seethey are mad  truly it seemed as if they were for after separating and coursing twice completely round the astonished natives the two scots performed a species of wardance before them which had a sort of fling about it more easily conceived than described  in the middle of this they made a dart at the group so sudden and swift that hake managed to overturn flatface with a tremendous buffet and heika did the same to his second in command with an energetic cuff  the skraelingers were taken so thoroughly by surprise that the scots had sheered off and got out of reach before a spear could be thrown  of course a furious rush was made at them but the hairy men might as well have chased the wind  after tormenting and tantalising them a little longer the scots returned at full speed to their friends and the skraelingers glad to be rid of them hastened to seek the shelter of the gloomy gorge from which they had originally issued like a wolf on the fold    chapter four  important events transpire which end in a voyage of discovery  some weeks afterwards karlsefin and gudrid went down to walk together on the seabeach  it would appear that lovers were as fond of rambling together in those olden times as they are in these modern days  it was evening when they went to ramble thusanother evidence of similarity in taste between the moderns and ancients  karlsefin said gudrid stopping at the margin of the fiord and looking pensively towards the horizon where golden clouds and air and sea appeared to mingle harmoniously i wonder that you with good ships and many stout men and plenty of means should choose to remain in this barren spot instead of searching out the famous vinland and making a settlement there  this barren spot is very bright to me gudrid i have no desire to leave it yet a while  since you and i were betrothed the ocean has lost its attractions  besides would you have me set out on a voyage of discovery at the beginning of winter  nay but you do not even talk about going when spring comes round  because i have other things to talk of gudrid  i fear me that you are a lazy man returned the widow with a smile and will prove but a sorry husband  just think she added with sudden animation what a splendid country it must be and what a desirable change for all of us  thick and leafy woods like those of old norway instead of these rugged cliffs and snowclad hills  fields of waving grass and rye instead of mosscovered rocks and sandy soil trees large enough to build houses and merchantships instead of willow bushes that are fit for nothing except to save our poor cattle from starvation when the hay crop runs out besides longer sunshine in winter and more genial warmth all the year round instead of howling winds and ice and snow  truly i think our adopted home here has been woefully misnamed  and yet i love it gudrid for i find the atmosphere genial and the sunshine very bright  foolish man said gudrid with a little laugh  and then she added recurring to her theme there are grapesthough to be sure i know not what these are never having tasted them  biarne says they are very gooddo you think so too  they are magnificent answered karlsefin  in southern lands where tyrker comes from they have a process whereby they can make a drink from grapes which maddens youth and quickens the pulse of age something like our own beer  it does not please me to hear that replied gudrid gravely some of our carls are too fond of beer  when old heriulf was sick a little of it did him good and when eric the red was in his last days he seemed to gather a little strength and comfort from beer but i never could perceive that it ever did anything to young men except make them boast and talk nonsense and look foolishor what is worse quarrel and fight  right gudrid right said karlsefin my opinion at least is the same as yours whether it be right or wrong  there is some reason in applying heat to cold but it seems to me unnecessary to add heat to warmth artificial strength to natural vigour and it is dangerous sometimes to add fuel to fire  i am glad you think as i think on this point for it is well that man and wife should be agreed in matters of importancebut to return to vinland i have been thinking much about it since i came here though saying littlefor it becomes a man to be silent and circumspect in regard to unformed plans  my mind is to go thither next spring but only on one condition  and what may that be asked gudrid looking up with a little surprise and some interest  that you shall go with me gudrid for which end it will be needful that you and i should wed this winter  gudrid could not help blushing a little and looking down for karlsefin despite his suavity had a way with him when thoroughly in earnest that was very impressive  she did not hesitate however but answered with straightforward candour i will not say nay to that if my brother leif is willing  it is settled then replied karlsefin decisively for leif has already told me that he is willing if you are and so  at this interesting point in the conversation they were interrupted by a loud merry laugh not very far from them and next moment little olaf starting out from behind a bush ran shouting into gudrids extended arms  oh what do you think he exclaimed aunt freydissa has come over from heriulfness and is in such a rage because biarne has told her that thorward has been making love to his cousin astrid and  hush boy said gudrid covering his mouth with her hand you should not talk so of your aunt  besides you know that it is an evil thing to get the name of a talebearer  i did not think it was talebearing replied the lad somewhat abashed for it is no secret  leif was there and astrid herself and all the housecarls in the hall must have heard her for she spoke very loud  and oh you should have seen her give thorward the cold shoulder when he came in  well well olaf hold your noisy tongue said gudrid laughing and come tell me how would you like to go to vinland  like to go to vinland echoed the boy turning an ardent gaze full on karlsefin are you going there sir  will you take me  karlsefin laughed and said you are too quick in jumping to conclusions child  perhaps i may go there but you have not yet answered gudrids questionwould you like to go  i would like it well replied olaf with a bright look of hopeful expectation that said far more than words could have expressed  just then thorward was seen approaching along the beach  his brows were knit his lips pursed and his eyes fixed on the ground  he was so engrossed with his thoughts that he did not perceive his friends  here he comes said karlsefinin the blues evidently for he does not see us  we had better leave you to his company said gudrid laughing a man i the blues is no pleasure to a womancome olaf you and i shall to the dairy and see how the cattle fare  olafs capacity for imbibing milk and cream being unlimited he gladly accepted this invitation and followed his aunt while karlsefin advanced to meet his friend  how now thorward methinks an evil spirit doth possess thee  an evil spirit echoed thorward with a wrathful look nay a legion of evil spirits possess me  a plague on that fellow biarne he has poisoned the ears of freydissa with lies about that girl astrid to whom i have never whispered a sweet word since we landed  i trust you have not whispered sour words to her said karlsefin smiling  and freydissa forsooth gives me the cold shoulder continued the exasperated norseman not noticing the interruption as if i were proved guilty by the mere assertion  it is my advice to you thorward that you return the compliment and give the cold shoulder to freydissa  the woman has a shrewish temper she is a very vixen and will lead you the life of a dog if you marry her  i had rather said thorward between his teeth and stamping live a dogs life with freydissa than live the life of a king without her  karlsefin laughed at this and thorward taking offence said fierily and with some scornthinkest thou that because thy gudrid is so smoothtongued she is an angel  that is what i am inclined to think answered karlsefin with a smile that still further exasperated his friend  perchance you may find yourself mistaken said thorward  since you are so free with your warnings let me remind you that although the course of your courtship runs smooth there is an old proverbdescended from odin himself i believewhich assures us that true love never did so run  then i recall my words thorward and congratulate you on your true lovefor assuredly your courtship runs in an uncommonly rugged course  at this thorward turned on his heel and walked away in a towering passion  it so happened that on drawing near to brattalid he met biarne coming in the opposite direction  nothing could have pleased him betterfor in the state of his mind at the time he would have turned savagely on himself had that been possible in order to relieve his feelings  so he cried confronting biarne well met  tell me biarne didst thou poison the ears of freydissa by telling her that i had been courting thy cousin astrid  biarne who was not aware of the consequences of what he had said in jest felt inclined to laugh but he checked himself and flushed somewhat not being accustomed to be addressed in such haughty tones instead of explaining the matter as he might otherwise have done he merely said i did  liar exclaimed thorward fiercely for he was a very resolute man when roused go tell her that the assertion was a falsehood  go now and come back to tell me thou hast done it else will i chop thy carcase into mincemeat  go i will await thee here  he laid his hand upon his sword but biarne said quietly i go sir and turning round hastened up to the hamlet  thorward could scarcely believe his eyes for biarne was fully as stout as himself and somewhat taller besides having the look of a courageous man  he had issued his imperative mandate more as a defiance and challenge than anything else so that he gazed after the retreating biarne with mingled feelings of surprise contempt and pity but surprise predominated  he had not long to wait however for in about ten minutes biarne returned  well have you told her  i have replied biarne  hah exclaimed thorward very much perplexed and not knowing what to say next  but thorward said biarne after a momentary pause methinks that you and i must fight now  with all my heart answered thorward much relieved and again grasping his sword  nay not with such weapons said biarne stepping up to him but with the weapons of friendship  with that he bestowed such a hearty buffet on thorwards left ear that it turned the irascible man head over heels and laid him at full length on the sand  thorward rose slowly being somewhat stunned with a confused impression that there was something wrong with his head  before he had quite recovered biarne burst into a laugh and seized him by the hand  freydissa bids me tell you he said and paused  the pause was intentional  he saw that thorward was on the point of snatching away his hand and returning the blow or drawing his sword but he restrained himself in order to hear freydissas message  she bids me tell you repeated biarne that you are a goose  this was not calculated to soothe an angry man but thorward reflected that the epithet was figurative and bore a peculiar signification when uttered by a woman he therefore continued his selfrestraint and waited for more  she also said added biarne that she never for a moment believed my statement which by the way was only made in jest and that she thinks you deserve a good buffet on the ear for taking the thing up so hotly  agreeing with her entirely in this i have fulfilled her wish and given you your deserts  moreover she expects you to accompany her to heriulfness tonight  so now said biarne releasing thorwards hand and touching his swordhilt if you are still inclined  well well said thorward whose visage while his friend was speaking had undergone a series of contortions indicative of a wild conflict of feelings in his breast well well i am a goose and deserved the buffet  after all i did call you a liar so we are quits biarnetit for tat  come let us shake hands and go up to leifs cottage  you said freydissa was there i think  during that winter karlsefin married gudrid and thorward freydissa and in the following spring they embarked in karlsefins shipwith a large party of men women children and cattleand set sail for vinland    chapter five  freydissa shows her temper and a whale checks itpoetical and other touches  the expedition which now set out for vinland was on a much larger scale than any of the expeditions which had preceded it  biarne and leif had acted the part of discoverers onlynot colonisersand although previous parties had passed several winters in vinland they had not intended to take up a permanent abode thereas was plain from the fact that they brought neither women nor flocks nor herds with them karlsefin on the contrary went forth fully equipped for colonisation  his ship as we have said was a large one with a decked poop and forecastle fitted to brave the most tempestuous weatherat least as well fitted to do so as were the ships of columbusand capable of accommodating more than a hundred people  he took sixty men with him and five women besides his own wife and thorwards  thorward himself and biarne accompanied the expedition and also olafto his inexpressible joy but leif preferred to remain at home and promised to take good care of thorwards ship which was left behind  astrid was one of the five women who went with this expedition the other four were gunhild thora sigrid and bertha  gunhild and sigrid were wives to two of biarnes men  thora was handmaiden to gudrid bertha handmaid to freydissa  of all the women bertha was the sweetest and most beautiful and she was also very modest and goodtempered which was a fortunate circumstance because her mistress freydissa had temper enough as biarne used to remark for a dozen women  biarne was fond of teasing freydissa but she liked biarne and sometimes took his pleasantries wellsometimes ill  it was intended that when the colony was fairly established the ship should be sent back to greenland to fetch more of the mens wives and children  a number of cattle horses and sheep were also carried on this occasion to vinland  these were stowed in the waist or middle of the vessel between the benches where the rowers sat when at work  the rowers did not labour much at sea as the vessel was at most times able to advance under sail  during calms however and when going into creeks or on landingalso in doubling capes when the wind was not suitablethe oars were of the greatest value  karlsefin and the principal people slept under the high poop  a number of the men slept under the forecastle and the rest lay in the waist near the cattlesheltered from the weather by tents or awnings which were called tilts  it may perhaps surprise some readers to learn that men could venture in such vessels to cross the northern seas from norway to iceland and thence to greenland but it is not so surprising when we consider the small size of the vessels in which columbus afterwards crossed the atlantic in safety and when we reflect that those norsemen had been long accustomed in such vessels to traverse the ocean around the coasts of europe in all directionsround the shores of britain up the baltic away to the faroe islands and up the mediterranean even as far as the black sea  in short the norsemen of old were magnificent seamen and there can be no question that much of the ultimate success of britain on the sea is due not only to our insular position but also to the insufficiently appreciated fact that the blood of the hardy and adventurous vikings of norway still flows in our veins  it was a splendid spring morning when karlsefin hoisted his whiteandblue sail and dropped down ericsfiord with a favouring breeze while leif and his people stood on the stone jetty at brattalid and waved hats and shawls to their departing friends  for olaf thora and bertha it was a first voyage and as the vessel gradually left the land behind the latter stood at the stern gazing wistfully towards the shore while tears flowed from her pretty blue eyes and chased each other over her fair round facefor bertha left an old father behind her in greenland  dont cry bertha said olaf putting his fat little hand softly into that of the young girl  oh  i shall perhaps never see him again cried bertha with another burst of tears  yes you will said olaf cheerily  you know that when we get comfortably settled in vinland we shall send the ship back for your father and mine too and for everybody in ericsfiord and heriulfness why were going to forsake greenland altogether and never go back to it any more  oh  i am so glad  i wish i wish i had never come said bertha with a renewed flow of tears for olafs consolations were thrown away on her  it chanced that freydissa came at that moment upon the poop where karlsefin stood at the helm and gudrid with some others were still gazing at the distant shore  freydissa was one of those women who appear to have been born women by mistakewho are always chafing at their unfortunate fate and endeavouring to emulateeven to overwhelmmen in which latter effort they are too frequently successful  she was a tall elegant woman of about thirty years of age with a decidedly handsome face though somewhat sharp of feature  she possessed a powerful will a shrill voice and a vigorous frame and was afflicted with a short violent temper  she was decidedly a masculine woman  we know not which is the more disagreeable of the twoa masculine woman or an effeminate man  but perhaps the most prominent feature in her character was her volubility when enragedthe copiousness of her vocabulary and the tremendous force with which she shot forth her ideas and abuse in short abrupt sentences  now if there was one thing more than another that roused the ire of freydissa it was the exhibition of feminine weakness in the shape of tears  she appeared to think that the credit of her sex in reference to firmness and selfcommand was compromised by such weakness  she herself never wept by any chance and she was always enraged when she saw any other woman relieve her feelings in that way  when therefore she came on deck and found her own handmaid with her pretty little face swelled or as she expressed it begrutten and heard her express a wish that she had never left home she lost command of herselfa loss that she always found it easy to come byand seizing bertha by the shoulder ordered her down into the cabin instantly  bertha sobbingly obeyed and freydissa followed  dont be hard on her poor soul murmured thorward  foolish fellow  how difficult it is for manancient or modernto learn when to hold his tongue  that suggestion would have fixed freydissas determination if it had not been fixed before and poor bertha would certainly have received a hearing or a blowingup or a setting down such as she had not enjoyed since the date of freydissas marriage had it not been for the fortunate circumstance that a whale took it into its great thick head to come up just then and spout magnificently quite close to the vessel  the sight was received with a shout by the men a shriller shout by the women and a screech of surprise and delight by little olaf who would certainly have gone over the side in his eagerness had not biarne caught him by the skirts of his tunic  this incident happily diverted the course of freydissas thoughts curiosity overcame indignation and bertha was reprieved for the time being  both mistress and maid hastened to the side of the ship the anger of the one evaporated and the tears of the other dried up when they saw the whale rise not more than a hundred yards from the ship  it continued to do this for a considerable time sometimes appearing on one side sometimes on the other now at the stern anon at the bow  in short it seemed as if the whale had taken the ship for a companion and were anxious to make its acquaintance  at last it went down and remained under water so long that the voyagers began to think it had left them when olaf suddenly gave a shriek of delight and surpriseoh  oh  oh he exclaimed looking and pointing straight down into the water here is the whaleright under the ship  and sure enough there it was swimming slowly under the vessel not two fathoms below the keelits immense bulk being impressively visible owing to the position of the observers and its round eyes staring as if in astonishment at the strange creature above  the author has seen a whale in precisely similar circumstances in a norwegian fiord it expressed this astonishment or whatever feeling it might be by coming up suddenly to the surface thrusting its big blunt head like the bow of a boat out of the sea and spouting forth a column of water and spray with a deep snort or snoreto the great admiration of the whole ships crew for although most of the men were familiar enough with whales alive and dead they had never in all probability seen one in such circumstances before  four or five times did the whale dive under the vessel in this fashion and then it sheered off with a contemptuous flourish of its tail as if disgusted with the stolid unsociable character of the ship which seen from a submarine point of view must have looked uncommonly like a whale and quite as big  this episode occurring so early in the voyage and trifling though it was tended to create in the minds of allespecially of the women and the younger peoplea feeling of interest in the ocean and an expectation of coming adventure which though not well defined was slightly exciting and agreeable  bertha in particular was very grateful to that whale for it had not only diverted her thoughts a little from homeleaving and given her something new to think and talk about but it had saved her from freydissa and a severe scold  the first night at sea was fine with bright moonlight and a soft wind on the quarter that carried them pleasantly over the rippling sea and everything was so tranquil and captivating that no one felt inclined to go to rest  karlsefin sat beside the helm guiding the ship and telling sagas to the group of friends who stood sat or reclined on the deck and against the bulwarks of the high poop  he repeated long pieces of poetry descriptive of the battles and adventures of their viking forefathers and also gave them occasional pieces of his own composing in reference to surrounding circumstances and the enterprise in which they were then embarkedfor karlsefin was himself a skald or poet although he pretended not to great attainments in that way  from where they sat the party on the poop could see that the men on the high forecastle were similarly engaged for they had gathered together in a group and their heads were laid together as if listening intently to one of their number who sat in the centre of the circle  below in the waist of the ship some humorous character appeared to be holding his mates enchained for long periods of comparative silencein which could be heard the monotonous tones of a single voice mingled with occasional soft lowing from the cattlewere suddenly broken by bursts of uproarious laughter which however quickly subsided again leaving prominent the occasional lowing and the prolonged monotone  everything in and around the ship that night breathed of harmony and peace though there was little knowledge among them of him who is the prince of peace  we say little knowledge because christianity had only just begun to dawn among the norsemen at that time and there were some on board of that discoveryship who were tinged with the first rays of that sweet light which in the person of the son of god was sent to lighten the world and to shine more and more unto the perfect day  now said karlsefin at the conclusion of one of his stories that is the saga of halfdan the blackat least it is part of his saga but friends it seems to me that we must begin a saga of our own for it is evident that if we are successful in this venture we shall have something to relate when we return to greenland and we must all learn to tell our saga in the same words for that is the only way in which truth can be handed down to future generations seeing that when men are careless in learning the truth they are apt to distort it so that honest men are led into telling lies unwittingly  they say that the nations of the south have invented a process whereby with a sharppointed tool they fashion marks on skins to represent words so that once put down in this way a saga never changes  would that we norsemen understood that process said karlsefin meditatively  it seems to me said biarne who reclined on the deck leaning against the weatherbulwarks and running his fingers playfully through olafs fair curls it seems to me that it were better to bestow the craft of the skald on the record of our voyage for then the measure and the rhyme would chain men to the words and so to the truththat is supposing they get truth to start with  come karlsefin begin our voyage for us  all present seemed to agree to that proposal and urged karlsefin to begin at once  the skipperfor such indeed was his position in the shipthough a modest man was by no means bashful therefore after looking round upon the moonlit sea for a few minutes he began as follows    when western waves were all unknown   and western fields were all unsown   when iceland was the outmost bound   that roving vikingkeels had found   gunbiorn thenulf krakas son   still farther west was forced to run   by furious gales and there saw land   stretching abroad on either hand   eric of iceland called the red   heard of the news and straightway said   this western land ill go and see   three summers hence look out for me   he went he landed stayed awhile   and wintered first on erics isle   then searched the coast both far and wide   then back to iceland oer the tide   a wondrous land is this said he   and called it greenland of the sea   twenty and five great ships sailed west   to claim this gem on oceans breast   with man and woman horn and hoof   and bigging for the homestead roof   some turned backin heart but mice   some sank amid the northern ice   half reached the land in much distress   at ericsfiord and heriulfness   next biarneheriulfs doughty son   sought to trace out the aged one  his father   from norway sailed but missed his mark   passed snowtopped greenland in the dark   and came then to a newfound land   but did not touch the tempting strand   for winter winds oppressed him sore   and kept him from his fathers shore   then leif the son of eric rose   and straightway off to biarne goes   buys up his ship takes all his men   fares forth to seek that land again   leif found the land discovered more   and spent a winter on the shore   cut trees and grain to load the ship   and pay them for the lengthened trip   named hellaland and markland too   and saw an island sweet with dew   and grapes in great abundance found   so named it vinland all around   but after that forsook the shore   and north again for greenland bore   and nowwe cross the moonlit seas   to search this land of grapes and trees   biarne thorward karlsefin   go forth this better land to win   with men and cattle not a few   and household gear and weapons too   and best of all with women dear   to comfort counsel check and cheer   thus far weve made a prosprous way   god speed us onward every day  they all agreed that this was a true account of the discovery of vinland and of their own expedition as far as it had gone though gudrid said it was short and freydissa was of opinion that there was very little in it  but hold exclaimed biarne suddenly raising himself on his elbows karlsefin you are but a sorry skald after all  how so asked the skipper  why because you have made no mention of the chief part of our voyage  and pray what may that be  stay i too am a skald i will tell you  biarne whose poetical powers were not of the highest type here stretched forth his hand and said    when biarne thorward karlsefin   this famous voyage did begin   they stood upon the deck one night   and there beheld a moving sight   it made the very men grow pale   their shudder almost rent the sail   for lo they saw a mighty whale   it drew a shriek from olaf brave   then plunged beneath the briny wave   and while the women loudly shouted   up came its blundering nose and spouted   then underneath our keel it went   and glared with savage fury pent   and round about the ship it swum   striking each man and woman dumb   stayone there was who found a tongue   and still retained her strength of lung   freydissa beauteous matron bold   resolved to give that whale a scold   but little cared that monster fish   to gratify freydissas wish   he shook his tail that naughty whale   and flourished it like any flail   and ho for vinland he made sail  now friends was not that a great omission on the part of karlsefin  if the whale had brought his flail down on your pate it would have served you right biarne said freydissa flushing yet smiling in spite of herself  i think it is capital cried olaf clapping his handsquite as good as the other poem  some agreed with olaf and some thought that it was not quite in keeping with karlsefins composition but after much debate it was finally ruled that it should be added thereto as part and parcel of the great vinland poem  hence it appears in this chronicle and forms an interesting instance of the way in which men for the sake of humorous effect mingle little pieces of fiction with veritable history  by the time this important matter was settled it was getting so late that even the most enthusiastic admirer among them of moonlight on a calm sea became irresistibly desirous of going to sleep  they therefore broke up for the night the women retired to their cabin and none were left on deck except the steersman and the watch  long before this the sagatellers on the forecastle had retired the monotone and the soft lowing of the cattle had ceased man and beast had sought and found repose and nothing was heard save the ripple of the water on the ships sides as she glided slowly but steadily over the sleeping sea    chapter six  changes in wind and weather produce changes in temper and feelingland discovered and freydissa becomes inquisitive  there are few things that impress one more at sea than the rapidity of the transitions which frequently take place in the aspect and the condition of vessel sea and sky  at one time all may be profoundly tranquil on board then perhaps the necessity for going about ship arises and all is bustle ropes rattle blocks clatter and chirp yards creak and seamens feet stamp on the deck while their voices aid their hands in the hauling of ropes and soon all is quiet as before  or perhaps the transition is effected by a squall and it becomes more thorough and lasting  one moment everything in nature is hushed under the influence of what is appropriately enough termed a dead calm  in a few seconds a cloudbank appears on the horizon and one or two catspaws are seen shooting over the water  a few minutes more and the sky is clouded the glassy sea is ruffled the pleasant light sinks into a dull leaden grey the wind whistles over the ocean and we areas far as feeling is concernedtransported into another but by no means a better world  thus it was with our adventurers  the beautiful night merged into a dirty morning the calm into a breeze so stiff as to be almost a gale and when olaf came out of the cabin holding tight to the weatherbulwarks to prevent himself from being thrown into the leescuppers his inexperienced heart sank within him at the dreary prospect of the grey sky and the black heaving sea  but young olaf came of a hardy seafaring race  he kept his feelings to himself and staggered toward karlsefin who still stood at his post olaf thought he had been there all night but the truth was that he had been relieved by biarne had taken a short nap and returned to the helm  karlsefin was now clad in a roughweather suit  he wore a pair of untanned sealskin boots and a cap of the same material that bore a strong resemblance in shape and colour to the souwesters of the present day and his rough heavy coat closed up to the chin was in texture and form not unlike to the pilotcloth jackets of modern seamenonly it had tags and loops instead of buttons and buttonholes with his legs wide apart he stood at the tiller round which there was a single turn of a rope from the weatherbulwarks to steady it and himself  the boy was clad in miniature costume of much the same cut and kind and proud was he to stagger about the deck with his little legs ridiculously wide apart in imitation of thorward and biarne both of whom were there and had he observed a tendency to straddle  come hither olaf and learn a little seamanship said karlsefin with a goodhumoured smile  olaf said he would be glad to do that and made a run towards the tiller but a heavy plunge of the ship caused him to sheer off in quite a different direction and another lurch would have sent him headforemost against the leebulwarks had not biarne with a laugh caught him by the nape of the neck and set him against karlsefins left leg to which he clung with remarkable tenacity  ay hold on tight to that boy said the legs owner and youll be safe  a few days will put you on your sealegs lad and then you wont want to hold on  always hold your head up olaf when you move about aboard ship in rough weather said biarne pausing a minute in his perambulation of the deck to give the advice and look overboard or up or away at the horizonanywhere except at your feet  you cant see how the ships going to roll you know if you keep looking down at the deck  olaf acted on this advice at once and then began to question karlsefin in regard to many nautical matters which it is not necessary to set down here while biarne and thorward leaned on the bulwarks and looked somewhat anxiously to windward  already two reefs of the huge sail had been taken in and biarne now suggested that it would be wise to take in another  let it be done said karlsefin  thorward ordered the men to reef and the head of the ship was brought up to the wind so as to empty the sail while this was being done  before it was quite accomplished some of the women had assembled on the poop  this is not pleasant weather observed gudrid as she stood holding on to her husband  we must not expect to have it all plain sailing in these seas replied karlsefin but the dark days will make the bright ones seem all the brighter  gudrid smiled languidly at this but made no reply  freydissa who scorned to receive help from man had vigorously laid hold of the bulwarks and gradually worked her way aft  she appeared to be very much out of sortsas indeed all the women were  there was a greenish colour about the parts of their cheeks that ought to have been rosy and a whitey blue or frosted appearance at the points of their noses which damaged the beauty of the prettiest among them  freydissa became positively plainand she knew it which did not improve her temper  astrid though fair and exceedingly pretty by nature had become alarmingly white and thora who was dark had become painfully yellow  poor bertha too had a washedout appearance though nothing in the way of lost colour or otherwise could in the least detract from the innocent sweetness of her countenance  she did not absolutely weep but being cold sick and in a state of utter wretchedness she had fallen into a condition of chronic whimpering which exceedingly exasperated freydissa  bertha was one of those girls who are regarded by some of their own sex with a species of mild contempt but who are nevertheless looked upon with much tenderness by men which perhaps makes up to them for this to some extent  gudrid was the least affected among them all by that dire malady which appears to have been as virulent in the tenth as it is in the nineteenth century and must have come in with the flood if not before it  why dont you go below said freydissa testily instead of shivering up here  i get so sick below answered bertha endeavouring to brighten up that i thought it better to try what fresh air would do for me  hm it doesnt appear to do much for you retorted freydissa  as she spoke a little spray broke over the side of the ship and fell on the deck near them  karlsefin had great difficulty in preventing this for a short crosssea was running and it was only by dint of extremely good and careful steering that he kept the poopdeck dry  in a few minutes a little more spray flew inboard and some of it striking bertha on the head ran down her shoulders  karlsefin was much grieved at this but freydissa laughed heartily  instead of making bertha worse however the shock had the effect of doing her a little good and she laughed in a halfpitiful way as she ran down below to dry herself  it serves you right cried freydissa as she passed i wish you had got more of it  now karlsefin was a man whose temper was not easily affected and he seldom or never took offence at anything done or said to himself but the unkindness of freydissas speech to poor bertha nettled him greatly  get behind me gudrid he said quickly  gudrid obeyed wondering at the stern order and karlsefin gave a push to the tiller with his leg  next moment a heavy sea struck the side of the ship burst over the bulwarks completely overwhelmed freydissa and swept the deck fore and aftwetting every one more or less except gudrid who had been almost completely sheltered behind her husband  a sail which had been spread over the waist of the ship prevented much damage being done to the men and of course all the water that fell on the forecastle and poop ran out at the scupperholes  this unexpected showerbath at once cleared the poop of the women fortunately thora and astrid had been standing to leeward of biarne and thorward and had received comparatively little of the shower but freydissa went below with streaming hair and garmentsas biarne remarkedlike an elderly mermaid  you must have been asleep when that happened said thorward to karlsefin in surprise  he must have been sleeping then with his eyes open said biarne with an amused look  karlsefin gazed sternly towards the ships head and appeared to be attending with great care to the helm but there was a slight twinkle in his eye as he saidwell it was my intention to wash the decks a little but more spray came inboard than i counted on  tis as dangerous to play with water sometimes as with fire  there is truth in that said biarne laughing and i fear that this time water will be found to have kindled fire for when freydissa went below she looked like the smoking mountain of icelandas if there was something hot inside and about to boil up  karlsefin smiled but made no reply for the gale was increasing every moment and the management of the ship soon required the earnest attention of all the seamen on board  fortunately it was a shortlived gale  when it had passed away and the sea had returned to something like its former quiescent state and the sun had burst through and dissipated the grey clouds our female voyagers returned to the deck and to their wonted condition of health  soon after that they came in sight of land  now biarne said karlsefin after the lookout on the forecastle had shouted land ho come give me your opinion of this new land that we have madedo you mind the helm thorward while we go to the ships head  the two went forward and on the forecastle they found olaf flushed with excitement and looking as if something had annoyed him  ho olaf youre not sorry to see land are you said biarne  sorry no not i but im sorry to be cheated of my due  how so boy  why i discovered the land first and that fellow there pointing to the man on lookout shouted before me  but why did you not shout before him asked karlsefin as he and biarne surveyed the distant land with keen interest  just because he took me unawares replied the boy indignantly  when i saw it i did not wish to be hasty  it might have turned out to be a cloud or a fogbank and i might have given a false alarm so i pointed it out to him and asked what he thought but instead of answering me he gaped with his ugly mouth and shouted land ho  i could have kicked him  nay olaf that is not well said observed karlsefin very gravely if you could have kicked him you would have kicked him  why did you not do it  because he is too big for me answered the boy promptly  so then thy courage is only sufficient to make thee kick those who are small enough returned karlsefin with a frown  perhaps if you were as big as he you would be afraid to kick him  that would not i retorted olaf  it is easy for you to say that boy when you know that he would not strike you now and that there is small chance of your meeting again after you have grown up to prove the truth of what you say  it is mere boasting olaf and mark me you will never be a brave man if you begin by being a boastful boy  a truly brave and modest manfor modesty and bravery are wont to consort togethernever says he will strike until he sees it to be right to do so  sometimes he does not even go the length of speaking at all but in any case having made up his mind to strike he strikes at once without more ado let the consequences be what they will  but in my opinion it is best not to strike at all  do you know olaf my boy some of the bravest men i ever knew have never struck a blow since they came to manhood excepting of course when compelled to do so in battle and then they struck such blows as made shields and helmets fly and strewed the plain with their foes  did these men never boast when they were boys asked olaf with a troubled air  karlsefin relaxed into a smile as he said only when they were very little boys and very foolish but they soon came to see how contemptible it is to threaten and not perform so they gave up threatening and when performance came to be necessary they found that threats were needless  now olaf i want you to be a bold brave man and i must lull you through the foolish boasting period as quickly as possible therefore i tell you these things  think on them my boy  olaf was evidently much relieved by the concluding remarks  while karlsefin was speaking he had felt ashamed of himself because he was filled with admiration of the magnificent skipper and wanted to stand well in his opinion  it was therefore no small comfort to find that his boasting had been set down to his foolishness and that there was good reason to hope he might ultimately grow out of it  but olaf had much more of the true metal in him than he himself was aware of  without saying a word about it he resolved not to wait for the result of this slow process of growth but to jump vault or fly out of the boastful period of life by hook or by crook and that without delay  and he succeeded  not all at once of course  he had many a slip but he persevered and finally got out of it much sooner than would have been the case if he had not taken any trouble to think about the matter or to try  meanwhile however he looked somewhat crestfallen  this being observed by the lookout that worthy was prompted to sayim sure olaf you are welcome to kick me if that will comfort you but there is no occasion to do so because i claim not the honour of first seeing the landand if i had known the state of your mind i would willingly have let you give the hail  you may have been first to discover it at this time olaf said biarne turning round after he had made up his mind about it and no doubt you were since the lookout admits it nevertheless this is the land that i discovered twenty years ago  but we shall make it out more certainly in an hour or two if this breeze holds  the breeze did hold and soon they were close under the land  now am i quite certain of it said biarne as he stood on the poop surrounded by all his friends who gazed eagerly at the shore to which they had approached so close that the rocks and bushes were distinctly visible that is the very same land which i saw before  what vinland asked freydissa  nay not vinland  are you so eager to get at the grapes that ye think the first land we meet is vinland  a truce to your jesting biarne what land is it  it is the land i saw last when leaving this coast in search of greenland so that it seems not unnatural to find it first on coming back to it  leif on his voyage went on shore here  he named it helloland which methinks was a fitting name for it is as you see a naked land of rocks  now then said karlsefin lower the sail heave out the anchor and let two men cast loose the little boat  some of us will land and see what we shall see for it must not be said of us biarne as it was unfairly said of you that we took no interest in these new regions  the little boat was got ready  the scottish brothers hake and heika were appointed to row  karlsefin biarne thorward gudrid freydissa and olaf embarked and proceeded to the shore  this land on which the party soon stood was not of an inviting aspect it was sterile naked and very rocky as biarne had described it and not a blade of grass was to be seen  there was a range of high snowcapped mountains in the interior and all the way from the coast up to these mountains the land was covered with snow  in truth a more forbidding spot could not easily have been found even in greenland  it seems to me said freydissa that your new land is but a sorry placeworse than that we have left  i wonder at your landing here  it is plain that men see with flushed eyes when they look upon their own discoveries  cold comfort is all we shall get in this place  i counsel that we return on board immediately  you are too hasty sister said gudrid  oh of course always too hasty retorted freydissa sharply  and somewhat too bitter growled thorward with a frown  thorward was not an illnatured man but his wifes sharp temper tried him a good deal  your interrupting me before you heard all i had to say proves you to be too hasty sister said gudrid with a playful laugh  i was about to add that it seems we have come here rather early in the spring  who knows but the land may wear a prettier dress when the mantle of winter is gone  even greenland looks green and bright in summer  not in those places where the snow lies all the summer objected olaf  thats right olaf said biarne stick up for your sweet aunt  she often takes a stick up for you lad and deserves your gratitudebut come lets scatter and survey the land for be it good or bad we must know what it is and carry with us some report such as karlsefin may weave into his rhymes  this land would be more suitable for your rhymes biarne than for mine said karlsefin as they started off together because it is most dismal  after that the whole party scattered  the three leaders ascended the nearest heights in different directions and gudrid with olaf went searching among the rocks and pools to ascertain what sort of creatures were to be found there while freydissa sat down and sulked upon a rock she soon grew tired of sulking however and looking about her observed the brothers who had been left in charge of the boat standing as if engaged in earnest conversation  she had not before this paid much attention to these brothers and was somewhat struck with their appearance for as we have said before they were good specimens of men  hake the younger of the two had closecurling auburn hair and bright blue eyes  his features were not exactly handsome but the expression of his countenance was so winning that people were irresistibly attracted by it  the elder brother heika was very like him but not so attractive in his appearance  both were fully six feet high and though thin as has been said their limbs were beautifully moulded and they possessed much greater strength than most people gave them credit for  in aspect thought and conversation they were naturally grave and very earnest nevertheless they could be easily roused to mirth  going up to them freydissa saidye seem to have earnest talk together  we have answered heika  our talk is about home  i am told that your home is in the scottish land said freydissa  it is answered hake with a kindling eye  how come you to be so far from home asked freydissa  we were taken prisoners two years ago by vikings from norway when visiting our father in a village near the forth fiord  how did that happen  come tell me the story but first who is your father  he is an earl of scotland said heika  ha and i suppose ye think a scottish earl is better than a norse king  heika smiled as he replied i have never thought of making a comparison between them  wellhow were you taken  we were as i have said on a visit to our father who dwelt sometimes in a small village on the shores of the forth for the sake of bathing in the seafor he is sickly  one night while we slept a norse longship came to land  those who should have been watching slumbered the norsemen surrounded my fathers house without awaking anyone and entering by a window which had not been securely fastened overpowered hake and me before we knew where we were  we struggled hard but what could two unarmed men do among fifty  the noise we made however roused the village and prevented the vikings from discovering our fathers room which was on the upper floor  they had to fight their way back to the ship and lost many men on the road but they succeeded in carrying us two on board bound with cords  they took us over the sea to norway  there we became slaves to king olaf tryggvisson by whom as you know we were sent to leif ericsson  no doubt ye think said freydissa that if you had not been caught sleeping ye would have given the norsemen some trouble to secure you  they both laughed at this  we have had some thoughts of that kind said hake brightly but truly we did give them some trouble even as it was  i knew it cried the dame rather sharply the conceit of you men goes beyond all bounds  ye always boast of what valiant deeds you would have done if something or other had been in your favour  we made no boast replied heika gravely  if you did not speak it ye thought it i doubt notbut tell me is your land as good a land as norway  we love it better replied heika  but is it better asked freydissa  we would rather dwell in it than in norway said hake  we hope not  but we would prefer to be in our own land replied the elder brother sadly for there is no place like home  at this point karlsefin and the rest of the party came back to the shore and put an end to the conversation  returning on board they drew up the anchor hoisted sail and again put out to sea    chapter seven  songs and sagasvinland at last  in days of old just as in modern times tars when at sea were wont to assemble on the focsle or forecastle and spin yarnsas we have seenwhen the weather was fine and their work was done  one sunny afternoon on the forecastle of karlsefins shipwhich by the way was called the snake and had a snakes head and neck for a figureheadthere was assembled a group of seamen among whom were tyrker the turk one of thorwards men named swend who was very stout and heavy and one of karlsefins men called krake who was a wild jocular man with a peculiar twang in his speech the result of having been long a prisoner in ireland  we mention these men particularly because it was they who took the chief part in conversations and in storytelling  the two scots were also there but they were very quiet and talked little nevertheless they were interested and attentive listeners  olaf was there also all eyes and earsfor olaf drank in stories and songs and jests as the seasand drinks waterso said tyrker but krake immediately contradicted him saying that when the seasand was full of water it drank no more as was plain from the fact that it did not drink up the sea whereas olaf went on drinking and was never satisfied  come sing us a song krake cried tyrker giving the former a slap on the shoulder let us hear how the danish kings were served by the irish boys  not i said krake firmly  ive told ye two stories already  its hakes turn now to give us a song or what else he pleases  but youll sing it after hake has sung wont you krake pleaded several of the men  ill not say no to that  hake who possessed a soft and deep bass voice of very fine quality at once acceded to the request for a song  crossing his arms on his chest and looking as if in meditation towards the eastern horizon he sang to one of his national airs the land across the sea  the deep pathos of hakes voice more than the words melted these hardy norsemen almost to tears and for a few minutes effectually put to flight the spirit of fun that had prevailed  thats your own composin ill be bound said krake an sure its not bad  its scotland you mean no doubt by the land across the sea ah  ive heard much of that land  the natives are very fond of it they say  it must be a fine country  ive heard irishmen who have been there say that if it wasnt for ireland theyd think it the finest country in the world  no doubt answered hake with a laugh and i dare say swend there would think it the finest country in the world after norway  ha  gamle norge old norway said swend with enthusiasm there is no country like that under the sun  except greenland said olaf stoutly  or iceland observed biarne who had joined the group  where can you show such mountainsspouting fire and smoke and melted stonesor such boiling fountains ten feet thick and a hundred feet high as we have in iceland  thats true observed krake who was an icelander  oh exclaimed tyrker with a peculiar twist of his ugly countenance turkey is the land that beats all others completely  at this there was a general laugh  why how can that be cried swend who was inclined to take up the question rather hotly  what have you to boast of in turkey  eh  what have we not is the question  what shall i say  ha we have grapes there and we do make such a drink of themoh  here tyrker screwed his face and figure into what was meant for a condition of ecstasy  twere well that they had no grapes there tyrker said biarne for if all be true that karlsefin tells us of that drink they would be better without it  i wish i had it remarked tyrker pathetically  well it is said that we shall find grapes in vinland observed swend and as we are told there is everything else there that man can desire our new country will beat all the others put togetherso hurrah for vinland  the cheer was given with right goodwill and then tyrker reminded krake of his promise to sing a song  krake whose jovial spirits made him always ready for anything at once struck up to a rattling ditty    the danish kings    one night when one o the irish kings   was sleeping in his bed   six danish kingsso sigvat sings   came an cut off his head   the irish boys they heard the noise   and flocked unto the shore   they caught the kings and put out their eyes   and left them in their gore    chorusoh this is the way we served the kings   an spoiled their pleasure the dirty things   when they came to harry and flap their wings   upon the irish shoreore   upon the irish shore    next year the danes took terrible pains   to wipe that stain away   they came with a fleet their foes to meet   across the stormy say   each irish carl great stones did hurl   in such a mighty rain   the danes went down with a horrible stoun   an never came up again    oh this is the way etcetera  the men were still laughing and applauding krakes song when olaf who chanced to look over the bow of the vessel started up and shouted land ho in a shrill voice that rang through the whole ship  instantly the poop and forecastle were crowded and there on the starboard bow they saw a faint blue line of hills far away on the horizon  olaf got full credit for having discovered the land first on this occasion and for some time everything else was forgotten in speculations as to what this new land would turn out to be but the wind which had been getting lighter every hour that day died away almost to a calm so that as there was no prospect of reaching the land for some hours the men gradually fell back to their old places and occupation  now then krake said tyrker tell us the story about that king you were talking of the other day which was it  harald  ay king harald said krake and how he came to get the name of greyskin  well you must know that its not many years ago since my father sigurd was a trader between iceland and norway  he went to other places too sometimesand once to ireland on which occasion it was that i was taken prisoner and kept so long in the country that i became an irishman  but after escaping and getting home i managed to change back into an icelander as ye may see  well in my fathers younger days before i was bornwhich was a pity for he needed help sorely at that time and i would have been just the man to turn myself handy to any sort of work however it wasnt my faultin his younger days my father one summer went over from iceland to norway his ship loaded till she could hardly float with skins and peltry chiefly grey wolves  its my opinion that the reason she didnt go down was that they had packed her so tight there was no room for the water to get in and sink her  anyway over the sea she went and got safe to norway  at that time king harald one of the sons of eric reigned in norway after the death of king hakon the good  he and my father were great friends but they had not met for some time and not since harald had come to his dignity  my father sailed to hardanger intending to dispose of his pelts there if he could  now king harald generally had his seat in hordaland and bogaland and some of his brothers were usually with him but it chanced that year that they went to hardanger so my father and the king met and had great doings drinking beer and talking about old times when they were boys together  my father then went to the place where the greatest number of people were met in the fiord but nobody would buy any of his skins  he couldnt understand this at all and was very much annoyed at it and at night when he was at supper with the king he tells him about it  the king was in a funny humour that night  he had dashed his beard with beer to a great extent and laughed heartily sometimes without my father being able to see what was the joke  but my father was a knowing man he knew well enough that people are sometimes given to hearty laughter without troubling themselves much about the jokeespecially when they are beeryso he laughed too out of friendliness and was very sociable  when my father went away the king promised to pay him a visit on board of his ship next day which he did sure enough and my father took care to let it be known that he was coming so there was no lack of the principal people thereabouts  they had all come down together by the merest chance to the place where the ship lay just to enjoy the fresh airbeing fresher there that day than at most other places on the fiord no doubt  king harald came with a fullymanned boat and a number of followers he was very condescending and full of fun as he had been the night before  when he was going away he looked at the skins and said to my father wilt thou give me a present of one of these wolfskins  willingly says my father and as many more as you please  on this the king wrapped himself up in a wolfskin and went back to his boat and rowed away  immediately after all the boats in his suite came alongside and looked at the wolfskins with great admiration and every man bought just such another wolfskin as the king had got  in a few days so many people came to buy skins that not half of them could be served with what they wanted and the upshot was that my fathers vessel was cleared out down to the keel and thereafter the king went as you know by the name of harald greyskin  but here we are comrades continued krake rising drawing near to the landill have a look at it  the country off which they soon cast anchor was flat and overgrown with wood and the strand far around consisted of white sand and was very low towards the sea  biarne said that it was the country to which leif had given the name of markland because it was wellwooded they therefore went ashore in the small boat but finding nothing in particular to attract their interest they soon returned on board and again put to sea with an onshore wind from the northeast  some antiquaries appear to be of opinion that helloland must have been newfoundland and markland some part of nova scotia  for two days they continued their voyage with the same wind and then made land for the third time and found it to be an island  it was blowing hard at the time and biarne advised that they should take shelter there and wait for good weather  this they did and as before a few of them landed to explore the country but there was not much to take note of  little olaf who was one of the explorers observed dew on the grass and remembering that leif had said that the dew on one of the islands which he met with was sweet he shook some into the hollow of his hand and tasted it but looked disappointed  are you thirsty olaf asked karlsefin who with biarne walked beside him  no but i wondered if the dew would be sweet  my father said it was on one of the islands he came to  foolish boy said biarne laughing leif did but speak in a figure he was very hot and tired at the time and found the dew sweet to his thirsty spirit as well as refreshing to his tongue  thus you see olaf observed karlsefin with a sly look at biarne whenever you chance to observe your father getting angry and hear him say that his beer is sour you are not to suppose that it is really sour but must understand that it is only sour to his cross spirit as well as disagreeable to his tongue  olaf received this with a loud laugh for though he was puzzled for a moment by biarnes explanation he saw through the jest at once  well biarne returned olaf whether the dew was sweet to my fathers tongue or to his spirit i cannot tell but i remember that when he told us about the sweet dew he said it was near to the island where he found it that the country he called vinland lay  so if this be the sweetdew island vinland cannot be far off  the boy is sharp beyond his years said karlsefin stopping abruptly and looking at biarne what thinkest thou of that  i think replied the other that olaf will be a great discoverer some day for it seems to me not unlikely that he may be right  come we shall soon see said karlsefin turning round and hastening back to the boat  biarne either had not seen this particular spot on his former visit to these shores which is quite probable or he may have forgotten it for he did not recognise it as he had done the first land they made but before they left ericsfiord leif had given them a very minute and careful description of the appearance of the coast of vinland especially of that part of it where he had made good his landing and set up his booths so that the explorers might be in a position to judge correctly when they should approach it  nevertheless as every one knows regions even when well defined may wear very different aspects when seen by different people for the first time from different points of view  so it was on this occasion  the voyagers had hit the island a short distance further south than the spot where leif came upon it and did not recognise it in the least  indeed they had begun to doubt whether it really was an island at all  but now that olaf had awakened their suspicions they hastened eagerly on board the snake and sailed round the coast until they came into a sound which lay between the island and a cape that jutted out northward from the land  tis vinland cried biarne in an excited tone  dont be too sure of that said thorward as a sudden burst of sunshine lit up land and sea  i cannot be too sure cried biarne pointing to the land  see there is the ness that leif spoke of going out northwards from the land there is the island here between it and the ness is the sound and yonder doubtless is the mouth of the river which comes out of the lake where the son of eric built his booths  ho  vinland hurrah he shouted enthusiastically waving his cap above his head  the men were not slow to echo his cheer and they gave it forth not a whit less heartily  tis a noble land to look upon said gudrid who with the other females of the party had been for some time gazing silently and wistfully towards it  perchance it may be a great land some day observed karlsefin  who knows murmured thorward in a contemplative tone  ay who knows echoed biarne time and luck can work wonders  gods blessing can work wonders said karlsefin impressively may he grant it to us while we sojourn here  with that he gave orders to prepare to let go the anchor but the sound over which they were gliding slowly before a light wind was very shallow and he had scarcely ceased speaking when the ship struck with considerable violence and remained fast upon the sand    chapter eight  a chapter of incidents and exploration in which a bear and a whale play prominent parts  although arrested thus suddenly and unexpectedly in their progress toward the shore these resolute norsemen were not to be balked in their intention of reaching the land that forenoonfor it was morning when the vessel stuck fast on the shallows  the tide was ebbing at the time so that karlsefin knew it would be impossible to get the ship off again until the next floodtide  he therefore waited till the water was low enough and then waded to the land accompanied by a large band of men  we need scarcely say that they were wellarmed  in those days men never went abroad either by land or sea without their armour which consisted of swords axes spears and bows for offence with helmets and shields for defence  some of the men of wealth and position also wore defensive armour on their breasts thighs and shins but most of the fighting men were content to trust to the partial protection afforded by tunics of thick skin  they were not long of reaching the mouth of the river which biarne had pointed out and after proceeding up its banks for a short distance were convinced that this must be the very spot they were in search of  now biarne said karlsefin stopping and sitting down on a large stone i have no doubt that this is leifs river for it is broad and deep as he told us therefore we will take our ship up here nevertheless before doing so it would be a satisfaction to make positively certain that we are in the right way and this we may do by sending one or two of our men up into the land who by following the river will come to the lake where leif built his booths and so bring us back the news of them  meanwhile we can explore the country here till they return  biarne and thorward thought this advice good and both offered to lead the party to be sent there  for said thorward they may meet with natives and if the natives here bear any resemblance to the skraelingers methinks they wont receive us with much civility  i have thought of that returned karlsefin with a smile but i like not your proposal  what good would it do that either you or biarne should lead so small a party if ye were assaulted by a hundred or more savages as might well be the case  why we could at all events retreat fighting retorted thorward in a slightly offended tone  with fifty perhaps in front to keep you in play and fifty detached to tickle you in rear  thorward laughed at this and so did biarne  well if the worst came to the worst said the latter we could at any rate sell our lives dearly  and pray what good would that do to us demanded karlsefin  well well have it your own way skipper said biarne it seems to me nevertheless that if we were to advance with the whole of the men we have brought on shore with us we should be in the same predicament for twenty men could not easily save themselves from a hundredor as it might be a thousandif surrounded in the way you speak of  besides that added thorward it seems to me a mean thing to send out only one or two of our men without a leader to cope with such possible dangers unless indeed they were possessed of more than mortal powers  why what has become of your memories my friends exclaimed karlsefin  are there none of our men possessed of powers that are at all events more than those of ordinary mortals  oho  hake and heika  i forgot them cried biarne the very men for the work to be sure  no doubt of it said karlsefin  if they meet with natives who are friendly well and good if they meet with no natives at allbetter if they meet with unfriendly natives they can show them their heels and i warrant you that unless the natives here be different from most other men the best pair of savage legs in vinland will fail to overtake the scottish brothers  thorward agreed that this was a good plan but cautioned karlsefin to give the brothers strict injunctions to fly and not upon any account to fight for said he these doughty scots are fiery and fierce when roused and from what i have seen of them will i think be much more disposed to use their legs in running after their foes than in running away from them  this having been settled the brothers were called and instructed to proceed into the woods and up the bank of the river as quickly as possible until they should come to a lake on the margin of which they would probably see a few small huts  on discovering these they were to turn immediately and hasten back  they were also particularly cautioned as to their behaviour in the event of meeting with natives and strictly forbidden to fight if these should be evil disposed but to run back at full speed to warn their friends so that they might be prepared for any emergency  nevertheless said karlsefin in conclusion ye may carry weapons with you if ye will  thanks replied heika  as however you appear to doubt our powers of selfrestraint we will relieve your mind by going without them  thus instructed and warned the brothers tightened their belts and leaping nimbly into the neighbouring brake disappeared from view  a pair of proper men said karlsefinand now comrades we will explore the neighbourhood together for it is advisable to ascertain all we can of the nature of our new country and that as quickly as may be it is needful also to do so without scattering lest we be set upon unexpectedly by any lurking foe  this land is not easily surveyed like iceland or greenland being as you see covered with shrubs and trees which somewhat curtail our vision and render caution the more necessary  while the norsemen were engaged in examining the woods near the coast the two scots held on their way into the interior  there was something absolutely exhilarating as krake once remarked in the mere beholding of these brothers movements  they had been famed for agility and endurance even in their own country  they did not run but trotted lightly and appeared to be going at a moderate pace when in reality it would have compelled an ordinary runner to do his best to keep up with them  yet they did not pant or show any other symptom of distress  on the contrary they conversed occasionally in quiet tones as men do when walking  they ran abreast as often as the nature of the ground would allow them to do so taking their leaps together when they came to small obstructions such as fallen trees or brooks of a few feet wide but when they came to creeks of considerable width the one usually paused to see the other spring over and then followed him  just after having taken a leap of this kind and while they were running silently side by side along the margin of the river they heard a crash among the bushes and next instant a fine deer sprang into an open space in front of them  the brothers bent forward and flying like the wind or like arrows from a bow followed for a hundred yards or sothen stopped abruptly and burst into a hearty fit of laughter  ah  heika exclaimed the younger that fellow would be more than a match for us if we could double our speed  we have no chance with fourlegged runners  while he was speaking they resumed the jogtrot pace and soon afterwards came to a rocky ridge that seemed to traverse the country for some distance  here they were compelled to walk and in some places even to clamber the ground being very rugged  here also they came to a small branch or fork of the river that appeared to find its way to the sea through another channel  it was deep and although narrow in comparison with the parent stream was much too broad to be leaped over  the pioneers were therefore obliged to swim  being almost as much at home in the water as otters they plunged in clothes and all without halting and in a few seconds had gained the other side  when they reached the top of the ridge they stopped and gazed in silent admiration for there lay stretched out before them a vast woodland scene of most exquisite beauty  just at their feet was the lake of which they were in search some parts of it bright as the blue sky which its unruffled breast reflected other parts dark almost to blackness with the images of rocks and trees  everywhere around lay a primeval wilderness of wood and water which it is beyond the power of mortal pen adequately to describe and while all was suffused with the golden light of an early summer sun and steeped in the repose of an absolutely calm day the soft and plaintive cries of innumerable wildfowl enlivened without disturbing the profound tranquillity of the scene  does it not remind you of our own dear land said heika in a low soft voice  ay like the lowlands on the shores of the forth fiord replied hake in the same low tone as if he feared to break the pleasing stillness and there surely are the booths we were to search forsee in the hollow at the head of yonder bay with the gravelly beach and the birchtrees hanging from the rocks as if they wished to view themselves in the watery mirror  truethere are three of them visible  let us descend and examine  hist  some one appears to have got there before us said hake laying his hand on his brothers shoulder and pointing in the direction of the huts  it is not a human visitor methinks observed heika  more like a bear returned hake  in order to set the question at rest the brothers hastened round by the woods to a spot immediately behind the huts  there was a hill there so steep as to be almost a precipice  it overlooked the shores of the lake immediately below where the huts were and when the pioneers came to the crest of it and peeped cautiously over they beheld a large brown bear not far from the hut that stood nearest to the hill busily engaged in devouring something  now it is a pity whispered heika that we brought no arms with us truly little cause have we men to be proud of our strength for yonder beast could match fifty of us if we had nothing to depend on save our fists and feet and fingers  why not include the teeth in your list brother asked hake with a quiet laugh but it is a pity as you say  what shall  he stopped abruptly for a large boulder or mass of rock against which he leaned gave way under him made a sudden lurch forward and then stuck fast  ha a dangerous support said hake starting back but hist suppose we shove it down on the bear  a good thought replied heika if we can move the mass which seems doubtful but let us try  something may be gained by tryingnothing lost  the boulder which had been so balanced on the edge of the steep hill that a gentle pressure moved it was a mass of rock weighing several tons the moving of which would have been a hopeless task for twenty men to attempt but it stood balanced on the extreme edge of the turn of the hill and the little slip it had just made rendered its position still more critical so that when the young men lay down with their backs against a rock placed their feet upon it and pushed with all their might it slowly yielded toppled over and rolled with a tremendous surge through a copse which lay immediately below it  the brothers leaped up and gazed in breathless eagerness to observe the result  the bear hearing the crash looked up with as much surprise as the visage of that stupid creature is capable of expressing  the thing was so suddenly done that the bear seemed to have no time to form an opinion or get alarmed for it stood perfectly still while the boulder bounding from the copse went crashing down the hill cutting a clear path wherever it touched attaining terrific velocity and drawing an immense amount of debris after it  the direction it took happened to be not quite straight for the animal whose snout it passed within six or eight feetcausing him to shrink back and growlas it rushed smoking onward over the level bit of sward beneath through the mass of willows beyond across the gravelly strand and out to the lake into which it plunged and disappeared amid a magnificent spout of foam  but the avalanche of earth and stones which its mad descent had created did not let bruin off so easily  one after another these latter small and large went pattering and dashing against himsome on his flank some on his ribs and others on his head  he growled of course yet stood the fire nobly for a few seconds but when at last a large boulder hit him fairly on the nose he gave vent to a squeal which terminated in a passionate roar as he turned about and made for the open shore along which for some distance he ran with the agility of a monstrous wildcat and finally leaped out of sight into his forest home  the brothers looked at each other with sparkling eyes and next moment the woods resounded with their merriment as they held their sides and leaned for support against a neighbouring cliff  heika was first to recover himself  hold brother he exclaimed we laugh loud enough to let bruin know who it was that injured him or to bring all the savages in these woods down upon us  peace man peace and let us return to our friends  as soon as ye please brother said hake still laughing as he tightened his belt but was it not rare fun to see bruin stand that stony rain so manfully until his tender point was touched  and then how he ran  twas worth coming here to see a bear leave off his rolling gait so and run like a very wildcatnow im ready  without staying to make further examination of leifs old hutsfor from the place where they stood all the six of them could be clearly seen the young pioneers started on their return to the coast  they ran back with much greater speed than they had pushed forwardfearing that their companions might be getting impatient or alarmed about them  they did not even converse but with heads up chests forward and elbows bent addressed themselves to a quick steady run which soon brought them to the branch of the river previously mentioned  here they stopped for a moment before plunging in  suppose that we run down its bank suggested hake and see whether there be not a shallow crossing  surely ye have not grown afraid of water hake  no not i but i should like to see whither this branch trends and what it is like besides the divergence will not cost us much time as we can cross at any point we have a mind to and come at the main river again through the woods  well i will not balk youcome on  they accordingly descended the smaller streams and found it to be broken by various little cascades and rapids with here and there a longish reach of pebbly ground where the stream widened into a shallow rippling river with one or two small islands in it  at one of these places they crossed where it was only kneedeep in the centre and finally stopped at the end of a reach where a sudden narrowing of the banks produced a brawling rapid  below this there was a deep pool caused by a great eddy  now we go no further said heika  here we shall cross through the woods to the main branch  tis a pretty stream observed hake when they were about to leave it  as he spoke a large salmon leaped high out of the pool below flashed for one moment in the sunshine like a bar of living silver and fell back into the water with a sounding splash  hake caught his breath and opened wide his eyes  truly that is a good sight to the eyes of a scotsman said heika gazing with interest at the place where the fish had disappeared it reminds me of my native land  ay and me of my dinner observed hake smacking his lips  out upon thee man cried heika how can ye couple our native land with such a matterofact thought as dinner  why it would be hard to uncouple the thought of dinner from our native land returned hake with a laugh as they entered the forest for every mannot to mention womanwithin its circling coastline is a diner and so by hook or crook must daily have his dinnerbut say brother is it not matter of satisfaction as well as matter of fact that the waters of this vinland shall provide us with abundance of food not less surely than the land  if things go on as they have begun i shall be well content to stay here  ye do not deserve the name of scot hake said the other gravely  my heart is in scotland it is not here  true i know it replied hake with a touch of feeling in a double sense too for your betrothed is there  nevertheless as i did not leave my heart behind me surely there is no sin in taking some pleasure in this new land  but heed not my idle talk brother  you and i shall yet live to see the bonny hills of  ha here we are on the big stream once more sooner than i had expected and if i mistake not within hail of our comrades  hake was right  the moment they emerged from the woods upon the open bank of the large river they saw a party of men in the distance approaching them and an instant later a loud halloo assured them that these were their friends  when the pioneers had related all that they had seen and done the whole party returned to the shore and hailed the ship for the tide having risen they could not now reach it by wading  a boat was immediately sent for them and great was the interest manifested by all on board to learn the news of vinland  they had time to give an account of all that had been done and seen because it still wanted an hour of floodtide and the ship still lay immoveable  while they were thus engaged gudrid happened to cast her eyes over the stern of the ship and thought she saw an object moving in the water  what is that i see she said pointing towards it  the great seaserpent exclaimed biarne shading his eyes with his hand  or his ghost remarked krake  from which observations coupled together it would appear that the famous monster referred to was known by repute to the norsemen of the eleventh century though he was to some extent regarded as a myth  be this as it may the object which now attracted the attention and raised the eyebrows of all on board the snake evidently possessed life for it was very activewildly sobesides being large  it darted hither and thither apparently without aim sending the water in curling foam before it  suddenly it made straight for the ship then it turned at a tangent and made for the island anon it wheeled round and rushed like a mad creature to the shore  then arose a deafening shout from the men  a whale an embayed whale  and so in fact it was a large whale which as whales will sometimes doblind ones perhapshad lost its way got entangled among the sandbanks lying between the island and the shore and was now making frantic efforts to escape  need we say that a scene of the wildest excitement ensued among the men the two boatsone of which was as we have said a large onewere got ready barbed spears and lances and ropes were thrown into them as many men as they could hold with safety jumped in and pulled away might and main after the terrified whale  you may be sure reader that little olaf was there fast by the side of his friend and hero karlsefin who took charge of the large boat with thorward in the bow to direct him how to steer  biarne was there too as a matter of course in charge of the little boat with krake as his bowman and tyrker pulling the strokeoar  for tyrker was strong though little ugly and old and had a peculiar talent for getting involved in any fighting fun or mischief that chanced to be in hand  men said that he was afraid of dying in his bed and had made up his mind to rush continually into the jaws of danger until they should close upon and crush him but we are of opinion that this was a calumny  those of the men who were necessarily left in the ship could scarce be prevented from swimming after the boats as they shot away and nothing but the certainty of being drowned restrained them from making the mad attempt as it was they clambered upon the figurehead and up the rigging where with gaping mouths and staring eyes they watched the movements of their more fortunate companions  meanwhile the whale had made what appeared to be a grand and final neckornothing rush in the direction of the shore  of course he was high although not dry in a few seconds  that is to say he got into water so shallow that he stuck fast with his great head and shoulders raised considerably out of the sea in which position he began to roll heave spout and lash his mighty tail with a degree of violence that almost approached sublimity  he was in these circumstances when the norsemen came up for though too shallow for the whale the water was quite deep enough for the boats  being light the small boat reached the scene of action first  krake stood up in the bow to be ready  he held in his hand a curious wooden spear with a loose barb tipped with the tusk of a walrus  it had been procured from one of the greenland skraelingers  a rope was attached to it  as they drew near the whale stopped for an instant probably to recover breath  krake raised his spearthe fish raised his tail  whizz went the spear  down came the tail with a thunderclap and next moment mud sand water stones foam and blood were flying in cataracts everywhere as the monster renewed its struggles  back back oars shouted biarne as they were almost swamped by the flood  the men obeyed with such goodwill that krake was thrown headforemost over the bow  hold fast yelled krake on coming to the surface  if ye had held fast ye wouldnt have been there said biarne where are ye  he rose again out of the foam yelled and tossed up his arms  can the man not swim cried biarne in alarm pull boys pull  the men were already pulling with such force that they almost went over the man  as they rubbed past him hake dropped his oar and caught him by the hair biarne leaned over the side and got him by the breeches and with a vigorous heave they had him inboard  why krake i thought you could swim said biarne  ay so i can but who could swim with a coil of rope round his neck and legs  the poor man had indeed been entangled in the rope of the spear so that he could not use his limbs freely  no more was said however for they were still in dangerous proximity to the tail of the struggling fish and had to pull out of its way  meanwhile the large boat profiting by the experience of the small one had kept more towards the whales head and before krake had been rescued thorward sent a skraelinger spear deep into its shoulder  but this only acted as a spur to the huge creature and made it heave about with such violence that it managed to slew right round with its head offshore  at this the men could not restrain a shout of alarm for they knew that if the whale were to succeed in struggling again into water where it could swim it would carry away spears and ropes or in the event of these holding on would infallibly capsize and sink the boats  come drive in your spears shouted karlsefin in a voice of thunder for his usually quiet spirit was now deeply stirred  thorward and one of the men threw their spears but the latter missed and the former struck his weapon into a part that was too thick to do much injury though it was delivered with great force and went deep  this will never do cried karlsefin leaping up here swend take the helm  ho hand me that spear quick  now lads pull pull with heart and limb  as he spoke he sprang like a roused giant into the bow of the boat and caught up a spear  the men obeyed his orders  the boat rushed against the whales side and with its impetus added to his own herculean strength karlsefin thrust the spear deep down into the monsters body just behind the shoulder fin  the crimson stream that immediately gushed forth besprinkled all in the boat and dyed the sea around  that is his lifeblood said karlsefin with a grim smile you may back off now lads  this was done at once  the small boat was also ordered to back off and those in it obeyed not a moment too soon for immediately after receiving the deadly wound the whale went into a violent dying struggle it soon subsided  there were one or two mighty heavings of the shoulder then a shudder ran through the huge carcase and it rolled slowly over in a relaxed manner which told significantly that the great mysterious life had fled    chapter nine  the first night in vinland  the prize which had thus fallen into the hands of the norsemen was of great importance because it furnished a large supply of food which thus enabled them to go leisurely to work in establishing themselves instead of as would otherwise have been the case spending much of their time and energy in procuring that necessity of life by hunting and fishing  it was also exceedingly fortunate that the whale had been killed a little before the time of high water because that enabled them to fasten ropes through its nose and row with it still farther in to the shore  this accomplished the boats made several trips back to the ship and landed all the men and these with a number of ropes hauled up the carcase foot by foot as the tide rose  after reaching a certain point at high water they could get it up no farther and when the tide turned all the men twice doubled could not have budged it an inch  the ropes were therefore tied together and lengthened until they reached a strong tree near the beach to which they were fastened  leaving their prize thus secured they hastened back to the ship hauled up the anchor and made for the mouth of the river but they had lost so much of the floodtide in consequence of their battle with the whale and the evening was so far advanced that they resolved to delay further proceedings until the following day  the ship was therefore hauled close in to the land at the rivers mouth and allowed to take the ground on a spit of sand  here the men landed and soon built up a pile of stones between which and the ship a gangway was made  the women were thus enabled to walk comfortably ashore  and here on a grassy spot they pitched their tents for the first time in vinland  provisions were now brought on shore and large fires were kindled which blazed up and glared magnificently as the night drew on rendering the spit of sand with the grassy knoll in the centre of it quite a cheerful and ruddy spot  a few trees were cut down and stretched across the spit at its neck on the land side and there several sentinels were placed as a precautionfor which there seemed little occasion  karlsefin then set up a pole with a flag on it and took formal possession of this new land after which the whole colony sat down on the grasssome under the tents others under the starry skyto supper the cattle it may here be noted were not landed at this place as they were to be taken up the river next day but their spirits were refreshed with a good supply of newmown grass so that it is to be hoped and presumed they rejoiced not less than their human companions in the satisfactory state of things  in the largest tent karlsefin biarne thorward gudrid freydissa astrid and olaf sat down to a sumptuous repast of dried greenlandfish and fresh vinlandwhale besides which they had soup and beer  being healthy and hungry they did full justice to the good things  bertha and thora served and then joined in the repast  this is pleasant isnt it freydissa asked biarne with his mouth full  freydissa with her mouth not quite so full admitted that it was for she happened to be in an amiable humouras well she might  come let us pledge the new land in a can of beer cried biarne pouring the beverage out of an earthenware jar into a squat old norse flagon of embossed silver  thorward fill up  i will join you heartily in that cried thorward suiting the action to the word  and i said karlsefin raising an empty flagon to his lips will pledge it in a wish  i wishprosperity to vinland  come karlsefin remonstrated biarne forego austerity for once and drink  not i returned the skipper with a laugh  wherefore not  first because a wish is quite as potent as a drink in that respect second because our beer is nearly finished and we have not yet the means to concoct more so that it were illadvised to rob you biarne by helping to consume that which i do not like and last of all i think it a happy occasion this in which to forswear beer altogether  have thy way said biarne helping himself to another whalesteak of large dimensions  you are too good a fellow to quarrel with on such trifling ground  here pass the jar thorward i will drink his portion as well as my own  and i will join you both cried little olaf with a comical turn of his eyebrows  here i wish prosperity to vinland and drink it too in water  we can all join thee in that olaf said gudrid i with an approving nod and laugh  come girls fill up your cups and pledge to vinland  stop shouted biarne in sudden anxiety  they all paused with the cups halfway to their lips  you must not drink freydissa he continued seriously  gudrid did call upon the girls to join her surely ye dont  he was cut short by freydissa throwing her cup of water in his face  with a burst of laughter biarne fell backwards and partly to avoid the deluge partly for fun rolled out of the tent when he got up and dried his dripping beard  no more of that fair girl i beseech thee he said resuming his place and occupation  i will not again offendif thou wilt not again misunderstand  freydissa made no reply to this silence being her usual method of showing that she condescended to be in good humourand they were all very merry over their evening meal  from the noise and laughter and songs around them it was evident that the rest of the company were enjoying their first night on shore to the full insomuch that olaf was led in the height of his glee to express a wish that they could live in that freeandeasy fashion for ever  tis of no use wishing it observed karlsefin if you would insure success you must according to biarne drink it in beer  i cry you mercy skipper said biarne if you persecute me thus i shall not be able to drink any more tonight  hand me the jar thorward and let me drink again before i come to that pass  hark exclaimed gudrid there must be something going to happen for all the men have become suddenly quiet  they listened intently for a moment or two when krakes voice broke the deep silencecome now dont think so long about it as if ye were composing something new  every one knows sure that its about sweet scotland youre going to sing  right krake right replied a rich deep voice which it required no sight to tell belonged to hake the young scot but there are many songs about sweet scotland and i am uncertain which to choose  let it be lively said krake  no no no chorussed some of the men let it be slow and sad  well well laughed the halfirishmanas he was fond of styling himselfhave it your own way  if ye wont be glad by all means be sad  a moment after hakes manly tones rose on the still air like the sound of an organ while he sang one of the ancient airs of his native land wherein like the same airs of modern days were sounded the praises of scotlands heather hills and brawling burnsher bonny daughters and her stalwart sons  to those in the large tent who had listened with breathless attention and heads half averted it was evident that song sentiments and singer were highly appreciated from the burst of hearty applause at the conclusion and the eager demand for another ditty  but hake protested that his ruling motto was fair play and that the songs must circle round  so let it be cried swendkrake it is your turn next  i wont keep ye waiting said that worthy though i might do it too if i was to put off time selecting from the songs of old ireland for its endless they areand in great variety  sure i could give ye songs about hills and streams that are superior to scotlands burns and braes any dayalmost up to those of gamle norge if they were a bit higherthe hills i mean not the songs which are too high already for a man with a low voiceand i could sing ye a lament that would make ye shed tears enough to wash us all off the spit of land here into the sea but thats not in my way  im fond of a lively ditty so here you are  with that krake struck up an air in which it was roundly asserted that ireland was the finest country in the world except iceland as he stopped in his song to remark that irish boys and girls lived in a state of perpetual hilarity and goodwill and that the boys displayed this amiable and pleasant condition chiefly in the way of kissing the girls and cracking each others crowns  after that swend was called on to sing which he did of norway with tremendous enthusiasm and noise but little melody  then another man sang a loveditty in a very gruff voice and much out of tune which nevertheless to the mans evident satisfaction was laughingly applauded  after him a sentimental youth sang in a sweet tenor voice an icelandic air and then tyrker was called on to do his part but flatly refused to sing  he offered to tell a saga instead however which he did in such a manner that he made the sides of the norsemen ache with laughterthough to say truth they laughed more at the teller than the tale  thus with song and saga they passed the first hours of the night while the campfires blazed ruddily on their weatherbeaten faces and the heavenly constellations shone not only on the surrounding landscape but appeared to light up another world of cloudland beneath the surface of the sleeping sea  at last karlsefin went out to them  now lads said he it is high time that you laid your heads on your pillows  men who do not sleep well cannot labour well  tomorrow we have hard work before us in taking possession and settling our new home god has prospered us thus far  we have made a good beginning in vinland  may it be the foretaste of a happy ending  away then and get you to rest before the night is older and let your sleep be sound for i will see to it that the sentinels posted round the camp are vigilant  the men received this brief speech with a murmur of willing acquiescence and at once obeyed the order though krake observed that he fell in with the custom merely out of respect to the opinions of his comrades having himself long ago learned to do without sleep in ireland where the lads were in the habit of workingor fightingall day dancing all night and going home with the girls in the morning each norseman then sought a spot upon the grassy knoll suited to his taste used his arm or a hillock or stone for a pillow or anything else that came conveniently to hand and with his sword or axe beside him and his shield above him as a coverlet courted repose while the bright stars twinkled him to sleep and the rippling wavelets on the shore discoursed his lullaby    chapter ten  taking possession of the new home an event which is celebrated by an explosion and a reconciliation  every one knowsat least a wellknown proverb assures usthat early to bed and early to rise conduces to health wealth and wisdom  the norsemen of old would appear to have been acquainted with the proverb and the cheering prospect it holds out perhaps they originated it at all events that they acted on it and probably experienced the happy results is evident from the fact that karlsefin and his men not only went to bed in good time at nightas related in the last chapterbut were up and doing by daybreak on the following morning  having roused the women relieved the sentinels struck the tents and carried everything safely on board the snake they manned the oars or large sweeps with the stoutest of the crew and prepared to row their vessel up the river into the lake on the shores of which they designed to fix their future home  previous to this however a party of men were told off to remain behind and cut up the whale slice the lean portions into thin layers and dry them in the sun for winter use  see that you make a good job of it said karlsefin to swend who was left behind as the leader of the whalepartybecause he was fat as krake said and therefore admirably suited for such workand be careful not to let sand get amongst the meat  cut out the whalebone too it will be of use to us and dont forget that there may be enemies lurking in the woods near you  keep your windward eye uncovered and have your weapons always handy  swend promised to attend to these orders and with twenty men armed with axes scythes and large knives besides their swords shields bows and arrows stood on the ness and cheered their comrades as they rowed away  the force of the current was not great so that the snake made rapid progress and in a few hours reached the place where the small stream forked off from the main river  this they named little river  above that point the current was more rapid and it became necessary to send a large party of men on shore with a trackingrope by means of which and the oars they at last overcame all obstacles and finally swept out upon the bosom of the beautiful sheet of water which had afforded such delight to the eyes of the two scots  here then we have got home at last said karlsefin as they rowed over the still water to a spit or natural landingplace near leifs old booths  it is very beautiful said gudrid but i find it difficult to call it home  it seems so strange though so pleasant  you were always difficult to please gudrid said freydissa surely you dont think greenlandcold windy bleak nasty greenlanda better home than this  nay sister i made no comparison  i did but say that it seemed strange and im sure that bertha agrees with me in thatdont you bertha  indeed i do replied the maiden strange the land is but beautiful exceedingly  of course shell agree with what you say cried freydissa testily i would that she agreed as readily with me  it is a wonder that she is not weeping as she is always so ready to do on the smallest provocation or without any provocation at all  i only wept on leaving my father remonstrated bertha with a winning smile  im sure you have not seen me shed a tear since then  besides i do agree with you in this case for i think vinland will be a pleasant home  dont you too she added turning round to thora who had been standing at her side but thora had moved away and her place had been taken by hake the scot  bertha blushed on meeting the youths gaze and the blush deepened when hake said in a quiet undertone that vinland could not but be a pleasant home to him and added that greenland iceland norwayanywhere would be equally pleasant if only she were there  poor bertha was so taken aback by the cool and sudden boldness of this unexpected reply that she looked hastily round in alarm lest it had been overheard but hake not intending that it should be overheard had addressed it to her ear and fortunately at the moment the grating of the keel upon the pebbly shore drew the attention of all to the land  now then jump ashore lads cried biarne and get out the gangway make it broad for our cattle must not be allowed to risk their limbs by tumbling off  while biarne superintended the gangway thorward prepared the live stock for their agreeable change and karlsefin went up to examine the state of the huts  they were found to be in excellent condition having been well built originally and the doors and windows having been secured against the weather by those who had used them last  no natives can have been here observed the leader of the party to those who accompanied him because every fastening is secured apparently as it was left  nevertheless sigrid and i have seen footprints in the sand remarked the woman gunhild coming up at that moment  show them to me said karlsefin with much interest  yonder they are replied the woman pointing towards a sandy spot on her left and he who made them must have been a giant they are so large  truly a dangerous giant to meet with observed karlsefin laughing when he reached the place these are none other gunhild than the footprints of the bear that the two scots sent away with the toothache but come we will open these huts and have them put in order and made comfortable against suppertime  so get to work all of you and see how active you can be  while some of the party were busily engaged in sweeping out and arranging the huts others shouldered their axes and went into the woods to cut down a few dead trees for firewood and when the gangway between the ship and the shore was completed the live stock was driven on shore  there was something quite impressive in this part of the landing  there was a deliberate slowness in the movements of most of the animals that gave to it quite the air of a solemn procession and must have been a good illustration on a small scale of the issuing of the beasts from noahs ark on the top of ararat  the first creature which appropriately enough led the van was a lordly black bull  little olaf whose tastes were somewhat peculiar had made a pet of this bull during the voyage and by feeding it scratching it behind the ears patting its nose giving it water and talking to it had almost if not altogether won its affections  he was therefore permitted to superintend the landing of it  come get on blackie cried olaf giving the bull a push on the flank as it stood on the gangway with its head high tail slightly raised nostrils expanded and eyes flashing  it glanced from side to side as if to take a general survey of its new domains  olaf advised it to get on again but blackie deigned to take no further notice than by a deeptoned internal rumbling  not unlike mount hecla when it is going to explode said biarne laughing  come back boy he will do you a mischief cried gudrid in some alarm  why olaf said karlsefin your pet is going to be disobedient speak louder to him  instead of speaking louder olaf quietly grasped the brutes tail and gave it a twist  the effect was wonderful and instantaneous  the huge animal rushed wildly along the gangway leaped across the beach making the pebbles fly as he went scampered over the green turf and plunged into the forest kicking up his heels flourishing his tail and bellowing in frantic delight  most of the cows went slowly and placidly along the gangway and landed with easygoing satisfaction expressed in their patient faces to the supreme contempt of freydissa who said she wished that they had all been bulls  there was one young heifer amongst them however which proved an exception to the rule  it glared savagely round as if in imitation of the bull refused pointblank to land swerved from side to side of the gangway backed right into the ship at the risk of its neck and limbs attempted to charge the men created dire confusion and alarm among the poultry and finally fell off the gangway into the water and scrambled on shore in a way that must have thrilled freydissas heart with admirationalthough she did not say so but maintained a grim silence all the time  next came the sheep which owing perhaps to seasickness or homesickness or some other cause looked remarkably sheepish and walked on shore with as much solemnity as if each had been attending the funeral of the rest  there were about twenty of these and after them came a dozen or so of icelandic ponies which although somewhat more active than the sheep were evidently suffering in their spirits from the effects of the recent voyage  one of them however on feeling the soft turf under his feet attempted to neigh without much success and another said something that sounded more like a horselaugh than anything else  then followed the fowls some of which walked some flew and others fluttered according to their varying moods with an immense deal of fuss and cackling which was appropriately capped by the senior cock mounting on one of the huts and taking possession of the land with an ecstatic crow  the procession was brought up by the ducks which waddled out of the ship some with an expression of grave surprise some with quacks of an inquiring nature others with dubious steps and slow while a few with an eye to the main chance made ineffectual dabs at little roughnesses in their pathway in the hope that these might turn out to be edible  at last all were landed and driven up into the woods where they were left without any fear being entertained as to their going astray seeing that they were guarded by several fine dogs which were too much associated with the men as companions to be included in the foregoing list of the lower animals  shall we set the nets said hake going up to karlsefin who was busy arranging the principal hut while the men were bringing their goods and chattels on shore  you know we saw a salmon leap from a pool on little river  doubtless they are in the lake also  try it hake by all means  go with your brother in the little boat and set them where you think best  fresh salmon for supper would be a rare treat just now  are you sure it was a salmon you saw and not a large trout  sure  ay as sure as i am that a horse is not a cow replied hake smiling  go then and luck go with you  the nets were soon set in the bay near the point of the ness on which the huts were built and near to which a small mountainstream entered the lake  suddenly a shrill angry voice was heard issuing from one of the smaller huts near the lake  it was freydissa storming at poor bertha  there was an occasional bass growl intermingled with it  that was thorward remonstrating  poor bertha said karlsefin to biarne who was standing beside him at the time she has a hard mistress  poor thorward said biarne he has a tough wife  thorward will cure or kill her rejoined karlsefin with a laugh  he is a longsuffering man and very tender to women withal but he is not made of butter  biarne shook his head  he evidently had not much opinion of thorwards resolution when opposed by the will and passion of such a termagant as freydissa  how much better twould have been said he if thorward had married her maidthe sweet little fairhaired blueeyed bertha  why biarne methinks that thou art somewhat like to try that plan said his friend looking at him in surprise for he had spoken with much enthusiasm  not i man returned biarne with a smile and a shake of the head it is long since my heart was buried in iceland  i am doomed to be an old bachelor now  they both listened at this point for the domestic brawl in the small hut seemed to be waxing furious  thorwards voice was not heard so often but when it did sound there was an unusually stern tone in it and freydissas became so loud that her words were audible  it has been killed i tell you bertha by sheer carelessness  if you had fed it properly it would have been as well as the others  dont say you did your best for it  you didnt  you know you didnt youre a smoothfaced vixen  you are  dont speak  dont speak back i say  hold your tongue  you killed that kitten by carelessness  if you dont hold your tongue wife said thorward in a loud stern voice ill kill the cat too  there was a pause here as if the threat had taken away freydissas breath  oho thats the poor little kitten whispered karlsefin to biarne referring to one of a litter that had been born at sea that was nigh eaten by one of the dogs  bertha had no hand in its death  i wonder it lived so long  kill the cat shrieked freydissa stamping her foot  this was instantly followed by an unearthly caterwaul and the sudden appearance of a dark object in the air which issuing from the door of the hut flew upwards like a skyrocket described a wide curve and fell heavily about fifty yards out into the lake  next moment freydissa sprang from the hut and stood with clasped hands on the shore in speechless horror  thorward immediately after came forth with a dark frown on his face and walked away into the forest  freydissa stood like a statue for some minutes and then seeing that the cat lay quite motionless she turned and with a face that was deadly pale reentered the hut  it was cruel observed karlsefin sadly  but salutary perhaps said biarne  it may be so rejoined the other but even if thorwards end be a good one a right end does not justify a wrong actionah here comes sunshine  how goes it gudrid  gudrid who came forward at the moment and knew nothing of what had occurred said that she wanted karlsefins help if he could spare time in order to arrange some of the fixtures in their new home  assuring her that she herself was the most valuable fixture in the house karlsefin left his work and the two walked off together while biarne went down to the ship  meanwhile thorward returned to his hut where he found freydissa alone sitting on a box with her face buried in her hands  she did not move so he sat down beside her with a subdued look  freydissa he said im sorry i did that  twas cruel twas hard but it is done now and cant be undone  forgive me lass if you can  she raised her head suddenly and gazed at him with a flushed countenance  thorward she said with energy if you had come with any other tone or word i would have hated you with all the power of my heart  and thats a strong power freydissa  it is  but now  she threw her arms round her husbands neck and kissed him  thorward returned the kiss with the vigour of a man who is wont to give back more than he gets  thanks my girl said he rising thanks  that puts my heart at ease  as for the poor cat shes beyond the influence of anger or repentance now but trust me freydissa i shall fetch you the handsomest cat that can be had for love or money in all greenland or iceland ay even if i should have to make a special voyage to get hold of it  thus did thorward and freydissa fall out and thus were they reconciled on the first day in their new home in vinland  talking this matter over with thorward next day karlsefin took occasion to give his friend some sage advice  depend upon it thorward said he no good ever comes of quarrelling or violence but on the contrary much evil  tis well that you confessed your fault to her else had she ever after held you in light esteem because although she deserved reproof the cat did not deserve to be killed  beshrew me  nay interrupted karlsefin with a laugh that is the last thing you ought to say seeing that you have had so much beshrewing already  well well said thorward thou art wonderfully smart at giving good advice  would that i could say thou wert equally smart at taking it  however i have hope of thee thorward  come let us go see what the nets have produced  i observe hake and heika rowing to land  it was found that the fishermen had loaded their boat with magnificent trout of all sizessome above five or six pounds weightbesides a large quantity of excellent fish of other kinds but not a single salmon had been taken  nevertheless they had good reason to be content with their success for the supply was sufficient to provide a hearty supper for the whole party so that the first night in the new homelike the first night in the new landwas a merry one    chapter eleven  settling downhake proves that his arms as well as his legs are gooda wonderful fishing incident which ends in a scene between freydissa and krake  the little hamlet on the vinland lake which had been so long silent and deserted resounded from that time forth with the voices and activities of energetic labourers for these adventurous norsemen had much to do before their new home could be made comfortable  the forest and undergrowth around had to be cleared the huts of which there were six had to be cleaned out fitted up with new parchment in the windowsfor there was no glass in those daysand new thatch on the roofs besides being generally repaired additional huts had to be built for the people pens for the sheep and stabling for the cattle all of which implied felling and squaring timber while the smaller articles of household furniture and fittings kept the people generally in full occupation  of course a party had to be told off as hunters for the community while another party were set to attend to the nets in the lake and a third under the special charge of karlsefin went out at intervals to scour the woods with the double purpose of procuring food and investigating the character and resources of the new land  in regard to this last these settlers had every reason to be satisfied the country appeared to be boundless in extent and was pleasantly diversified in form the waters teemed with fish the land was rich with verdure and the forests swarmed with game large and small  one day karlsefin and biarne attended by hake and several men went out for a ramble of exploration in the direction of the small river or branch of the large river mentioned in a previous chapter  some of the party were armed with bows and arrows others had spears the leader and his friend carried short spears or javelins  all wore their swords and iron headpieces and carried shields  indeed no party was ever allowed to go beyond the neighbourhood of the settlement without being fully armed for although no natives had yet been seen it was quite possible nay highly probable that when they did appear their arrival would be sudden and unexpected  as they advanced they heard a rustle of leaves behind a knoll and next instant a large deer bounded across their path  karlsefin hurled his spear with sudden violence and grazed its back  biarne flung his weapon and missed it  there was an exclamation of disappointment among the men which however was turned into a cheer of satisfaction when hake let fly an arrow and shot it through the heart  so forcibly was the shaft sent that it passed quite through the animal and stood bloodstained and quivering in the stem of a tree beyond while the deer leaped its own height into the air and fell stonedead upon the sward  a brave shotexcellently done exclaimed karlsefin turning to the young scot with a look of admiration and not the first or second time i have seen thee do something of the same sort from which i conclude that it is not chance but that your hand is always quick and your eye generally true  is it not so  i never miss my mark said hake  how now you never miss your mark  it seems to me young man that though your air is modest your heart and words are boastful  i never boast replied hake gravely  say you so cried karlsefin energetically glancing round among the trees  come clear yourself in this matter  see you yonder little bird on the topmost branch of that birchtree that overhangs the stream it is a plain object well defined against the sky  touch it if you can  that little bird said hake without moving is not my mark  i never make a mark of the moon nor yet of an object utterly beyond the compass of my shafts  well it is considerably out of range returned karlsefin laughing but come i will test you  see you the round knot on the stem of yonder pine  it is small truly so small that i can barely see it nevertheless it is not more than half a bowshot off  do you object to make that your mark  the words had scarcely left his lips when an arrow stood quivering in the knot referred to  with an exclamation and look of surprise karlsefin said it must have been a chance and biarne seemed inclined to hold the same opinion but while they were yet speaking hake planted another arrow close by the side of the first  once more hake said krake who stood close behind the archer theres a saying in ireland that theres good fortune in odd numbers try it again  the scot readily complied and sent a third shaft into the knot with its head touching the heads of the other two arrows  enough enough your arms are as good as your legs said karlsefin ye are a valuable thrall hake and leif ericsson has reason to be grateful to king olaf of norway for his gifthere two of you sling that deer on a pole and bear it to gudrid  tell her how deftly it was brought down and relate what you have seen just now  and hark ee he added with a peculiar smile there is no occasion to say anything about what occurred before the successful shot  it always adds to the value of a good story that it be briefly as well as pithily told and disencumbered from unnecessary details  a wise tongue is that which knows when to wag and when to lie stillcome biarne we will proceed in our examination of this stream  leaving behind them the two men who were to return to the huts with the deer they proceeded down the banks of little river until they came to the pool where hake and his brother had seen the salmon leap  on the way down however the leader had been convinced of the fact that many salmon were there having seen several rise and observed others passing over some of the pebbly shallows  it was here was it not asked biarne that you and your brother saw the salmon leaping on the occasion of your first visit  it was replied hake  at what part of the pool  just below the tail of the island where the water is deep and rolls with numberless oily ripples  ha a likely spot said karlsefin  at that moment a salmon leaped out of the pool as if to assure him that hakes statement was true and immediately afterwards another fish rose and flourished its fanlike tail as if to make assurance doubly sure  for some time they went about examining that part of the river which the reader will remember has been described as being divided for some distance by a long island into two streams which again united after spreading out into a broad rippling shallow  here biarne was very silent and very close in his inspection of the bed of the river particularly at the top and lower end of the island  it appears to me as if some plan were rolling in your head biarne said karlsefin what may it be  truly a plan is forming in my brain  simple enough too only the details require consideration  well we must now return home so we can discuss it on the way  you know of our custom in iceland said biarne as they retraced their steps in regard to a river which is similar to this in the matter of having two channelsthey shut off the water from one channel and catch the fish when the bed is dry  know it  ay i know it well why man how comes it that this did not occur to me before  we will have it tried and that without delay what is worth doing at all is worth doing at once unless it can be clearly shown that there shall be distinct gain by delay  as this cannot be shown on the present occasion we will begin tomorrow  accordingly in pursuance of this resolve karlsefin went down to the island on little river with a large party of men and set to work biarne undertook to superintend what may be termed the engineering operations and thorward who was a handy fellow directed the mechanical details  first of all biarne fixed on the spot at the top of the island where a dam was to be thrown across the right branch of the streamthat being the channel which was to be run dryand planned the direction in which it was to be placed and the form it was to take  then strong stakes were driven into the bed of the river all across the head of that branch  while this was being done thorward marked off some tall straight trees in the forest and set men to cut them down while karlsefin directed and with his own hands aided a party appointed to collect large piles of earth sand stones mud and branches on the rivers bank  although the men were numerous and active the work was so extensive that it was sunset before all the stakes were driven the first of the heavy logs laid down in the bed of the stream and the rest of the material collected in readiness on the banks  having completed these preparations they returned to the huts and made arrangements for a grand effort on the following day  early in the morning nearly the whole body of the people set off to little river leaving the settlement in charge of one or two men who chanced at that time to be sick  of course olaf was with them armed with a huge iron hook fastened to the end of a stout pole  all the women also went being quite as anxious as the men to witness the sport  the island reached karlsefin divided his party into two bands  the smaller body numbering about twentyfive were stationed in the water at the lower end of the channel at equal distances from each other so as to extend from the tail of the island to the right bank of the stream  these carried strong poles about seven feet long and were placed there to frighten back any fish that might attempt to rush down the river  the rest of the men went in a body to the dam and there awaited orders  when all was ready karlsefin said to themmy lads if we would act well we must act together  here is the plan on which you are to proceed  on getting the word from biarne to begin you will all set to work to dam up the water right across from this bank to the head of the island  you see that we have already done the work in part so that it only requires to be completed and to have the centre gap stopped up that will be the difficult point for the great rush of water will be there and you will have to do it quicklyto heave in the logs and stones and rubbish not forgetting the branches and the turf which will keep all togetheras if your very lives depended on your speed  a certain number of you who shall be told off presently will do your best at the same time to deepen the channel of the other branch of the stream  when this is done you will have a little breathing space for doubtless the water will take a little time to run off  you will take advantage of this time to get your hooks and poles and landingnets in readiness  for the rest your own sense will guide younow biarne tell off the men and go to work  reader you should have seen the countenance of little olaf ericsson when all this was being said and done  many a time had he seen nets hauled and fish taken and often had he dreamt of netting whales and other seamonsters but never before had he imagined such a thing as laying the bed of a river dry and his exuberant fancy depicted to him scenes which it is not possible to describe  his visage glowed and his large blue eyes glared with excitement while his little bosom heaved and his heart beat high with expectation  this condition of course increased tenfold when he saw the men cast off more or less of their upper garments and spring to the work with the energy of lunatics  in his own small way he carried logs and branches and mud and stones till he was as dirty and dishevelled as the best of them and when gudrid looked horrified at him and said that it would be next to impossible to clean him he burst into such a fit of laughter that he lost his balance fell head over heels into the river which was only kneedeep at the place and came out more than halfwashed in a moment  you see it wont be so difficult as you think he cried laughing and gasping when he emerged another plunge like that would make me quite clean aunty  ho  olaf were you after a salmon cried swend as he passed with a large log on his shoulder  not i swend it was a whale i was after  you dont say that boy cried krake in a tone of admiration  was he a big one  oh frightfulso big thatthati couldnt see him all  couldnt see him at all  ah then he was a big one sure  the things we cant see at all are always the most wonderful  foolish boy said gudrid come i will wring the water out of your clothes  tis hardly worth while aunty said olaf coming on shore ill be as wet as ever in a few minutes  the careful gudrid nevertheless wrung as much water out of his dripping garments as was possible without taking them off  by the time this was done the dam had been completed and the men stood on the banks of the river wiping off and wringing out the superabundant mud and water from their clothes besides getting ready hooks nets and staves  some of the nets were several fathoms in length  others were small bags fastened to wooden rings at the end of long poles  presently a shout was heard from the men at the lower end of the pool and they were seen to use their staves smartly several times as some of the fish alarmed no doubt at the strange doings above endeavoured to shoot down the river  ere long the stony ground on which these men stood became a rippling shallow and soon afterwards a neck of land connecting the lower end of the island with the shore  they therefore abandoned it and rejoined their comrades higher up  the fish were now imprisoned in a pool retreat having been effectually cut off above and below and the whole river diverted into the bed of its left branch  as the water lowered it became obvious that the pool thus isolated was absolutely swarming with salmon for they could be seen darting hither and thither in shoals making for the deeper parts of the pool and jostling one another under stones  gradually little islets began to appear as the water continued to sink and then the fish seemed to be seized with a panic  they shot like silver arrows from bank to bankup the pool and down again as if enjoying a piscatorial country dance or in blind flight rushed clear out upon the pebbly islets in half dozens at a time where they leaped slid twirled and bounded frantically in what bore some resemblance to a piscatorial reel  then slipping into the water again and recovering their fins and tails they shot away to encounter similar misfortune elsewhere or to thrust their noses under stones andentertaining the same delusive notions that are said to characterise the ostrichimagine that they were not seen  by degrees the islets enlarged until they joined here and there and finally the state of things being inverted the bed of the stream became a series of little ponds which were absolutely boiling with fishnot unlike as krake remarked to the boiling springs of iceland only that those boiled with heat instead of with living fish  and now commenced a scene such as unquestionably had not been witnessed there since vinland was created  the norsemen were half mad with excitement  the women ran up and down the banks clapping their hands and shouting with delight while freydissa unable to contain herself cast appearances to the dogs leaped among the men and joined in the fray  the big pool first this way lads shouted karlsefin as he seized the end of a long net and dragged it towards the pool in question  twenty willing hands assisted  the net encircled the pool and was thrust in men with poles forced one side of it down to the bottom and the two ends were hauled upon might and main  at the same moment other men went with hand nets to smaller pools and scooping up the fish sent them writhing and struggling through the air towards the bank where gudrid thora astrid gunhild sigrid and even timid bertha sought in vain to restrain their struggles and prevent them from wriggling back into the almost dry bed of the stream  haul away with heart men shouted biarne who was at one end of the large net  already the stout ropes were strained to the uttermostat last the net came out bursting with salmon more hands were hailed it was run over the pebbles up the bank and onwards to a flat open spot where with a shout it was emptied on the greensward  talk of silver bars  the simile is wretched  no simile is of any avail here  the brightest and freshest silver bars ever cast might shine as much as these salmon did but they could not glitter so for they could not wriggle and spring and tumble  they could not show that delicate pink which enhanced the silvery sheen so wondrously  they could not exhibit that vigorous life which told of firm flakessuggestive of glorious meals for many a day to come  pooh even their intrinsic value could not suggest anything in this casefor all the silver bars that ever were coined on earth could not have purchased the appetites which made the mouths of these norsemen to water as they gazed in admiration on that vast hecatomb of splendid salmon  they absolutely danced round the fishit might almost be said they danced with themin triumphant glee  come come cried karlsefin loudly to work to work  ye may dance after that is done  here sweep this pool also  with a cheer the men ran down the bank and little olaf followed having already used his hook with such effect that he had pulled six large fish out of various holes and added them to the general pile  take care olaf that you dont fall in and get drowned cried biarne as he ran past  hurrah shouted olaf with a flourish of his weapon which made the narrowest possible miss of cleeking tyrker by the nose  have a care roared the turk  youve much need to say that replied olaf with a laugh for tyrker at that moment set his heel upon a salmon fell and rolled heavily down the bank  but tyrker was tough  he rose with a growl and a grin and ran on to join his comrades  a second pool was netted and with the like result  as the net was being dragged forth olaf saw that several fish had escaped  he struck in his hook at random for the pools being by that time a thick compound of mud and water could not be seen into  oh  ive got him he shouted struggling with the handle of his hook which jerked so violently that the sturdy little fellow was almost thrown to the ground  hold on cried thorward running to his aid  why olaf whats this  have a care  not too fast  there  hallo an eel  and so it wasan enormous eel that went twirling round the pole in wondrous fashion until it freed itself and after twisting round the limbs of olaf and thorward who in vain sought to hold it fast made off over the wet stones as if they were its native element and slid into another large pool where it disappeared  never mind olaf cried thorward with a laugh youll catch hold of it again  hook away at it lad  dont give  a tremendous shriek arose from the women on the bank at this juncture  oh look look at freydissa cried gunhild pointing wildly to the river bed  and there freydissa stoodup to the armpits in mud and salmon  whether she had fallen in or been pushed in no one could tell but unquestionably she was in having gone in too headforemost so that although she had struggled rightend up she reappeared coated with mud to an extent that might have suggested a sculptors clay modelhad sculptors been known to the norsemen of those days  there was an irresistible roar of laughter at first and then loud expressions of condolence and sympathy while a dozen strong but wet and dirty hands were stretched forth to the rescue  here lay hold of my hand poor thing cried krake there now dont cry it would only be wasting tears with so much water on your face already  if anything could have made freydissa cry it would have been that remark for it implied that she was inclined to weep while nothing was further from her thoughts at that time  she did however grasp krakes hand but instead of aiding herself by it to get out of the hole she gave it such a vigorous and hearty pull that krake went souse into the mud beside her  before he could recover himself freydissa had put her knee on his body and using him as a footrest thrust him deeper down as she stepped out  the delight with which this was hailed is beyond description and many a year passed after that before men grew tired of twitting krake about the pleasant mudbath that had been given him by freydissa on the occasion of the celebrated take of salmon at little river in vinland    chapter twelve  sage converse between hake and berthabiarne is outwitteda monster is slain and savages appear on the scene  not long after this an event occurred which produced great excitement in the new settlement namely the appearance of natives in the woods  it occurred under the following circumstances  one morning karlsefin gave orders for one of the exploring parties to be got ready to go out immediately  karlsefins plan from the beginning had been to class his men in two divisions  one half stayed at home to work the other half searched the landalways taking care however not to travel so far but that they could return home in the evening they were careful also not to wander far from each other  sometimes karlsefin went with the exploring party at other times stayed at home to superintend the work there while biarne or thorward filled his place  on the occasion in question biarne was in charge  soon after the party had started hake who was one of them observed a female figure disappear round a copse near the shores of the lake  at that part they were about to strike off into the thick woods so hake went up to biarne and asked leave to go along by the borders of the lake saying that he could overtake the party again before they had reached the willow glen a wellknown rendezvous of the hunters and explorers of the colony  go as thou wilt hake replied biarne only see to it that ye overtake us before noon as i intend to go on a totally new path today  the youth left with a light step and on overtaking the female found as he had expected that it was bertha  you wander far from home today he said with a deferential salutation for hakes bondage had not robbed him of his breeding  i love to wander answered bertha blushing  poor bertha she could not help blushing  it was her unfortunate nature to do so  when her feelings were touchedever so littleshe blushed and then she blushed because she had blushed and blushed again to think herself so silly  i fear it may be somewhat dangerous to wander far said hake stopping for bertha had stopped and seated herself on the stump of a fallen tree  dangerous  why so  why because skraelingers may find us out any day and if they should come upon you unawares so far from home they might carry you off and no one would be aware that you were gone until too late to pursue  i never thought of that returned bertha with a slightly troubled look  well i shall be more careful in future  but how come you to be wandering here alone hake did i not hear your name called this morning among those appointed to go forth and search out what is good and beautiful and useful in the land  most true bertha and i have gone forth and not gone far and yet have found something both good and beautiful and useful in the land  and pray what may that be asked the maiden with a look of surprise  hake did not answer but the expression of his eyes was more eloquent than speech  nay then said bertha looking hastily away and again blushingas a matter of course  i am no reader of riddles and i hate riddlesthey perplex me so  besides i never could find them out  but hake has your party gone yet  yes some time ago  and are you left behind  no i have leave to go by the margin of the lake  then if you put off time talking with me you will not find it easy to overtake them but i forgot i suppose you count it an easy matter to overtake ordinary men  i shall not find it difficult replied the youth briefly and then perceiving that bertha felt uneasyapparently at the tenor of the conversationhe quietly changed it by remarking that he preferred to walk by the lake for several reasons one of which was that it reminded him of scotland  ah you profess to love scotland very much said bertha archly but your brother evidently loves it more than you do  with good reason too replied hake for it has given him a bride and it had no such favours for me  indeed what is her name asked the maiden with much interest  emma  poor emma sighed bertha but i hope that heika will be freed one day and return to his native land to wed emma  perchance by that time scotland may smile upon you too and give you cause to love it better  i love it well already said hake with enthusiasm yet am i content to stay here  for shame hake you do not deserve to be a scot if you mean what you say  i mean what i say yet do i deserve to be a scot  come tell me then what this scotland of yours is like  i suppose you deem it more beautiful than iceland  the youth smiled  it is not more wonderful than iceland  i can say that with truthbut it is passing fair to look upon  it is a land of mountain and flood of heathclad braes and grassy knowes  its mountain peaks rise bare and rugged to the skies where lordly eagles soar  its brawling burns in their infancy dash down these rugged steeps but as they grow older flow on through many a hazel dell where thrush and blackbird fill the woods with melodythrough many flowering pastures where cattle browse and lambkins skip on the sunny braes  wildfowl breed on its reedy lochs and moorfowl dwell on its heather hills  its waters teem with the spotted trout and the royal salmon  temperate breezes fan its cheeks and beauty in form and colour revels everywhere  its sons are lovers of their native land and its daughters are wondrous fair  and yet it would seem said bertha that not one is fair enough for you  nay bertha thy speech is hardly fair  the heart cannot command its affection said hake with a smile but i regret it not  and where does emma dwell asked bertha  beside my father near the shores of forth not far from a noted town and castle that stand on the summit of a rocky ridge  it is named after edwin a northumbrian king  a sweet romantic spotmy own dear native town  beside it stands a mountain which those who have travelled in far southern lands tell us bears some resemblance to a couching lion but i never saw a lion and know not what truth there is in that  you almost make me wish to see that land said bertha with a sigh  i would you might see it and that it were my fortune to show it to you  that is not likely said bertha with a little laugh  i know not  the most unlikely things happen and often those that seem most likely do not come to pass  what more unlikely than that karlsefin should forsake the religion of his fathers  yet karlsefin is now a christian  do you know hake much about the nature of this new religion that has come amongst us and made so many people change asked bertha with sudden earnestness  to say truth i dont know much about it  only this do i know that karlsefin says the foundation of it is god and man united in jesus christ and that the guiding principle of it is love  if so it must be a sweet religion and as far as karlsefin is concerned it seems both good and true but there are some of its professors whom i know whose guiding star is selfnot lovewhich goes rather against it methinks  you do not reason well hake that is against the professors not against the religion  true but this religion is said to change those who profess itwhat if they are not changed  why then they are false professors said bertha with a smile  it may be so i know not  but if you would have further light on the point karlsefin will gladly give it you  well i will go find him and inquire said bertha rising i have kept you too long already from your comradesfarewell  farewell bertha replied the youth gazing after her as she tripped lightly away and disappeared behind a thicket  then turning into the woods he went off at his utmost speed in the direction of the willow glen  just in time hake said biarne as the scot approached we are about to start off westward today and go as far inland as we can before dark  i have long had a desire to search out the land in that direction  from the distance of these blue ridges the size of our lake and river and other signs i am of opinion that this is a great land not an island  it may be so replied hake looking round on the vast and beautiful landscape i should like well to traverse it  if a thrall may be permitted to remark i would say that a spirited chief would explore somewhat farther than a days march from home  perchance a spirited chief might see fit to have his homestead put well in order before undertaking explorations for his amusement replied biarne who was not much pleased with hakes speech  the scot made no answer and after that the party advanced to the westward sometimes clearing their way through dense thickets sometimes walking under the branching canopy of large trees and frequently coming to more open places in many of which there were little ponds swarming with wildfowl  towards the afternoon they came to a rocky ridge which was crowned with trees  on the other side of it was a deep gorge near the end of which some large animal was observed sitting on its haunches  hist a brown bear whispered biarne  the bear looked up and growled for it had heard the approach of the party  nevertheless it appeared to be in a sluggish as well as a sulky humour for it gave no indication of any intention either to attack or run away but sat still on its haunches swaying its huge head and shoulders to and fro and gloweringas krake saidhorribly  a fierce monster truly observed hake fitting an arrow to his bow  biarne laid his hand on hakes arm  hast seen such a brute before he inquired  not i replied hake  wouldst like to see how the skraelingers of greenland treat the white bears of their land when so few as only two men chance to meet one in this fashion  i should like it well  goodi will show you but first i must explain the manner of it  when two skraelingers see a bear they go up to him with spears  on approaching him they separate  one settles that he is to kill him the other agrees to distract his attention  he who is to kill approaches on the side next the heart  his comrade goes up and pricks the bear on the other side  the bear turns full on him who wounds exposes his heartside and is instantly thrust through by him who is to kill  dost understand  perfectly replied hake  perhaps you would like to join me in such an adventure though of course there is some danger said biarne who was very anxious to punish hake for his late advice by giving him a good fright  hake smiled in a grim fashion and taking a short spear from one of his comrades looked at biarne pointed to the bear and said  come  they advanced together biarne also carrying a short spear while their comrades stood on the ridge and looked on with much interest  when bruin saw the two men approach he got up and showed himself to be an uncommonly large bear indeed insomuch that biarne glanced at hake with some anxiety and asked if he felt sure of himself and wasnt frightened  hake laughed lightly but made no other reply  well then have a care and see that ye be prompt in action  i will go to the left side and kill being used to such work  do you separate from me here and give him the prick on the right side  dont get flurried  we must approach and act together  he seems inclined to meet us halfway and must not be trifled with and harkee prick him well for methinks his hide will prove a tough one  hake nodded and separated from his companion  seeing this the bear stopped  it had been advancing with a rapidly increasing step growling all the way and with an extremely savage aspect but this movement of the enemy perplexed it  looking first on one side and then on the other it remained in a state of uncertainty as to which of the two it should attack  the enemy took advantage of thisboth men ran in upon it  as they did so the bear rose on its hindlegs still glancing savagely from one side to the other and in this position appearing a larger monster than it had seemed before  give it him sharply cried biarne delaying his deaththrust till the proper time  hake stepped close up to the bear and plunged his spear into its side with such vigorous goodwill that it went straight through its heart and came out at the other side just under the shoulder  with a tremendous roar it fell and writhed on the ground in a dying state while a loud cheer burst from the men on the ridge  why did ye that cried biarne fiercely stepping up to hake as though he would strike him  was it not arranged that i should kill him  the fates arranged it otherwise answered the scot  i felt afraid that my fears might weaken my arm  to make sure i gave him a good thrust  besides did you not tell me that his hide was tough and advise me to prick him well  hake looked so innocent and spoke so gently that biarne who was a goodnatured fellow laughed in spite of himself as he said  truly thou didst prick him to some purpose  well i do not grudge thee the honour and unquestionably it was deftly donehere two of you stay behind and skin this fellow  cut off the best parts of the meat also  bears of this kind are not bad for food i dare say  we will go on a little farther and return to you in a short time  saying this biarne resumed his march followed by the rest of the men  they had not gone far however when one of the party uttered a sudden exclamation and pointed to footprints on a soft part of the ground  perhaps the bears footprints said one  too small and narrow for that remarked another  we shall trace them till we come to soft ground and make certain said biarne  they did so and after walking a hundred yards or so came to a sandy piece where the footprints were so clearly defined that there remained no doubt they were those of a man  that the marks had not been made by any wandering member of their own band was evident also from the form of the sole of the shoe as indicated by the prints  now must we be ready to meet with men who may be foes although i hope they shall turn out to be friends said biarne  come hake there may be need for haste therefore do you hie back before us and inform karlsefin what we have seen  we will follow as swiftly as may be and fetch your bear along with us  hake started off at a smart run without a word of reply and never paused a moment until he reached the hamlet which he found in a considerable state of confusion and excitement  what now demanded karlsefin as hake came forward  strange footprints have been seen and  strange footprints exclaimed karlsefin  why man strange men have been seen by us so i have stranger news to tell than thou  biarne is returning of course  he is with all the men as fast as he can  thats well  now hake get your weapons ready and help the men to make preparations for the reception of the strangers  i go to set the ship in order  hake found on inquiry that one of a woodcutting party having strayed a little way beyond his fellows but not far from the hamlet had come suddenly on a native who was crouching behind a rock and gazing intently at the woodcutters  he was at the moment fitting an arrow to the string of a short bow which he carried and was so absorbed that he did not at first observe the norseman  the instant he saw him however he sprang up and discharged an arrow which the other avoided  the savage immediately turned to fly but the norseman sprang after him and struck him to the ground  at the same instant a dozen or more savages rushed from the woods to the rescue and the norseman immediately ran back to his comrades  more savages appeared and the norsemen seeing that they were greatly outnumbered retreated to the hamlet  they were not followed by the savages but there could be no doubt that now the colony had been discovered they were certain to receive a visit from them whether that visit was likely to be amicable or otherwise remained to be seen  meanwhile karlsefin and his men did their best to put the place in a state of defence  a breastwork of large trees which had been long ago thrown all round the hamlet was repaired and strengthened before dark and sentinels were posted around in all directions so that when biarne arrived somewhat late at night he was amused as well as gratified to find that unseen though wellknown voices challenged him several times as he drew near home and that finally a rude but effectual barrier stopped him altogether until a friend from within conducted him to the proper entrance  thus the night passed away without anything transpiring and at last the longedfor dawn appeared    chapter thirteen  a great but comparatively bloodless fight which ends peculiarly and with singular results  when the sun rose above the trees next day karlsefin began to think that the natives had left the place for there was no sign of them anywhere and he was about to issue from behind his defences and go out to reconnoitre when a man came running from the ship shouting skraelingers  it is probable that by that term he meant savages generally because the men who had been seen bore very little resemblance to the hairy savages of greenland  they were taller though not stouter and clothed in welldressed skins of animals with many bright colours about them  but whatever they were the sensation they created among the norsemen was considerable for it was found on going to the margin of the lake that they were now approaching in canoes by water  this at once accounted for the delay in their appearance  that their intentions were hostile was plain from the fact that the canoes came on abreast of each other in regular order while the men shouted fiercely and brandished their weapons  there could not have been fewer than three or four hundred of them  karlsefin saw at once that his only chance of saving the ship was to go on board of it and fight on the water  get on board all of you he cried to those who stood beside him away biarne thorward call in the outposts and have them on board without delay  here swend heika tyrker station the men as they arrive  get up the warscreens round the sides of the ship and harkee give orders that the men use their weapons as little as possible and spare life  i shall want you on the poop hake  see that no one throws down the gangway or loosens the ropes till the order is given  i will see to the womenaway  each man ran with speed to obey for the case was urgent  karlsefin found the women with olaf assembled in the large house waiting for orders  come he cried not a moment to be lost  give me your hand gudrid  he seized it as he spoke and hurried down to the ship where the men were already trooping on board as fast as they could  the women were soon put under cover out of the reach of missiles and in a few minutes more all were on board  of course the cattle and live stock generally being scattered about the hamlet were left to their fate  then the ropes were cast loose the gangway was thrown down the ship was pushed out into the bay and the anchor let go  all this had barely been accomplished when the canoes came sweeping round the nearest point of land and made straight for the ship with the foam curling at their bows  then karlsefins voice rose loud and clear as he issued his final commands  my lads he cried remember my orders about using your weapons as little as possible  be careful to throw only the smaller stones  kill no one if you can avoid it but give as many of them the toothache as you can  we must be friends with these people if we are to live in peace here and that wont be possible if we kill many of them  the men answered with a great shout mingled with some laughter which latter was such a strange sound to hear on the eve of an engagement that the savages stopped short for a moment  but soon they came on again with redoubled impetuosity  no sooner were they within range than the norsemen rose up in a body and hurled a shower of stones at them  they were evidently not prepared for such artillery for they again stepped short but after a brief pause once more advanced  three times did they receive a shower of stones before getting alongside  these hurt many but disabled none for according to orders no heavy stones were used  when within a few yards of the ship the canoes surrounded her and lay still while the savages began to discharge arrows in abundance  the norsemen kept well behind the shields which formed a screen round the ship and replied with stones only a few of the best marksmen using arrows when they saw a chance to wound without killing any of the foe  karlsefin stood exposed on the high poop with hake and heika beside him all three wore iron helmets and the leader protected himself with his shield  heika devoted his attention to warding off missiles from his brother who having to use his bow could not manage a shield  presently the savages made a grand assault  but the moment they came to close quarters they found that they had to cope with a formidable foe for the norsemen using only bludgeons knocked them down whenever they came within reach and one or two of the boldest among them who succeeded in clambering up the sides were seized by the legs and arms and hurled back into the lake as if they had been mere puppets  thus beaten off they continued the arrow shower and some of the norsemen were wounded  all this time karlsefin stood close to the helm looking sharply about him and whenever he saw a savage who was bolder and stouter than his fellows he made hake send an arrow through his right hand  in this way most of the best men among them were sent off howling with pain and for the time disabled  suddenly a very tall active savage succeeded in clambering up by the rudder unobserved and leaping on the poop stood behind karlsefin with uplifted club  karlsefin without turning quite round gave him a backhanded slap under the left ear and sent him flying overboard  he fell into a canoe in his descent and sank it  at this juncture a number of the canoes were detached from the fight and karlsefin observed with much anxiety that the savages were going to ransack the houses  would that i were on shore with twenty of my best men he said bitterly  send a shaft hake at yonder fellow who leads  it is out of range i fear butha well hit he exclaimed on seeing an arrow from hakes prompt hand strike the man full in the back  the savage fell and his comrades crowded round him  by that time others of the canoes had put ashore and their owners ran up to the crowd who surrounded the fallen leader  at this moment an incident occurred which put a most unexpected termination to the fight  for a considerable time olafs huge pet blackie had viewed the fight with calm indifference from the heart of a thicket close by in which he chanced to be cooling himself at the time  now it happened that one of the many arrows which were discharged by the savages on the offshore side of the ship glanced from a neighbouring tree and hit the bull on the flank  associating the pain resulting therefrom with the group of savages before him blackie at once elevated his tail lowered his head and with a bellow that would have shamed a thousand trumpets charged furiously down upon the foe  horrorstruck is but a feeble word to indicate the feelings of that foe although no doubt some of them might have heard of perhaps seen the ponderous and comparatively quiet bison of the western prairies none of them had ever imagined anything so awful as a little black bull with tremendous horns bloodred nostrils flashing eyes and catlike activity  one awestruck look they gave it and then fled howling into the woods  the sounds were so startling that those of the enemy still round the ship were panicstricken and made off by water as fast as their fellows had escaped by land leaving the norsemen victorious  hurrah for blackie shouted olaf who was wild with excitement and delight  the cheer thus claimed was given with intense enthusiasm and then the ship was rowed back to the shore  here a great prize was found in the shape of twenty canoes which had been left by the party that had fled to the woods  these were carried carefully up to the hamlet and placed in security  on the way up another prize was found which afterwards turned out to be of the utmost importance  this was the wounded savage who had been forsaken by his friends when the bull charged and who only escaped from the horns of that infuriated animal by lying quite motionless beside a log which fortunately chanced to be near him  take care krake lift him gently said biarne as he came up and found that worthy turning the poor savage over as if he had been already a dead carcase  let me see the arrow does not seem to have gone far in  hell recover perhaps  come hake and swend lift his shoulders and run olaf tell astrid or one of the other women toha  bertha well met  here is a subject for your care  you are a good nurse im told  i try to be replied bertha  she who tries to be is sure to be returned biarne nursing like fighting is an art and must be acquired though to say truth some folk seem born to learn more rapidly than others whether as regards nursing or fighting  have the poor fellow into the house and do your best for him bertha  while this was being said the native was lying on his back looking very stern but pale  it is probable that the poor wretch expected to be taken off summarily to have his eyes punched out or to be roasted alivefor the natives of vinland no doubt expected from their foes in those days the same treatment that they accorded to themalthough the saga says nothing to that effect  when therefore he was put into a comfortable bed had his wound dressed and an agreeable though strange drink given to him by the fair hands of bertha the expression of his countenance seemed to imply that he believed himself to have passed from earth and got into the happy huntinggrounds of his fathers if so the increasing pain of his wound must have perplexed him not a little  however it is due to him to say that he bore his surprises and pains with the uncomplaining resignation of a stoic  karlsefin employed the remainder of that day in strengthening his defences and connecting them in such a way with that part of the shore where his vessel lay that there would be no possibility of surrounding him in the event of future hostilities  this accomplished he organised his men into three bands which were to be commanded respectively by biarne thorward and himself  these were appointed to particular localities and duties in the little fortress for it was now almost entitled to such an appellation  when night drew on sentinels were posted as before  but there was no alarm during the night  the savages appeared to have had enough of fighting for that time and next mornings sun arose as it was wont to do on a peaceful scene  do you think they will attack us again asked gudrid as she sat at breakfast  i think not replied her husband  they cannot but know that we are troublesome fellows to deal with even when taken unawares  i hope they wont go off without giving us a chance to show that we desire to be friendly observed thorward  no fear of that said biarne we have got one of their chiefsat least i think he is so for he looks like oneand that is as good as a string tied to their great toe  by the way how is the chief bertha asked karlsefin  much better this morning  he slept well and is even now sitting up on his bed  he looked so well indeed that i took the precaution to fasten the door on the outside when i left him just now  ha  didst fasten the window wench cried thorward starting up and hastening from the room  truly no remarked the girl with a somewhat confused look i never thought of the window  thorward returned a minute later with a peculiar smile  hes all safe said he i peeped through a small shothole in the parchment and saw him sitting there meditating as deeply as if he hoped to meditate himself out of his prison  not a difficult thing to do that said karlsefin  i suspect that most prisoners manage to free themselves in that way pretty often  but who comes here in such hot haste  why swend whats i the wind now  the skraelingers are coming said he  they come unarmed and only ten of them  oho good exclaimed karlsefin rising  come methinks i see my way out of this difficulty  fetch me nine of our smartest men biarne  i will go forth with them unarmed to meet those messengers of peace  you and thorward will keep the defences to be ready for any emergency  let the scottish brothers be among the nine  when the selected men had assembled their leader took them aside and conferred with them for a few minutes after which he led them towards that part of the defences nearest the woods when they saw the ten natives approaching holding up their empty hands and making other demonstrations of a peaceful nature  far away on the heights in the background the whole army of savages could be seen watching the proceedings of their messengers  when these latter had come within about a hundred yards of the hamlet they selected a low grassy knoll in an open spot in full view of both parties  here they sat down in a row and made signs to the norsemen to approach  now lads we will accept their invitation said karlsefin follow me  with that he passed through the opening in the defences holding up his hands as he went to show that he was unarmed his followers doing the same  karlsefin went up to the native who appeared to be the chief of the band and with a bland smile took his hand gently and shook it  if the savage did not understand the shake of the hand he evidently understood the smile for he returned it and sat down again  karlsefin and his men did the same and for a few moments the two rows of men sat looking benignantly at one another in silence  the savage chief then spoke  of course karlsefin shook his head and touched his ear brow and lips by way of intimating that he heard but could neither understand nor reply  he then spoke norse with similar results  after that the savage leader rose up touched his back and fell down as if badly wounded  upon this one of his comrades rose pointed to the hamlet lifted the wounded man in his arms carried him behind his companions and laid him down exclaiming utway whereupon another savage took a small bundle of beautiful furs from the ground and laid them at the feet of karlsefin with much humility  sure he wants to buy back the wounded chief with these furs said krake who found it difficult to conceal his amusement at all this dumb show  no doubt of it and i suppose utway is his name replied karlsefin but my object is to get them inside the defences in order to show them that when we have them in our power we will treat them well  if i let their chief go for these furs nothing will have been gained  karlsefin now did his best by means of signs and encouraging looks to induce the ten natives to enter the hamlet but no persuasion would induce them to do this  they held stoutly to their original proposition and kept constantly pointing to the bundle of furs and going through the pantomime with the wounded man  at last karlsefin appeared to agree to their proposal  now heika and hake said he nothing remains to be done but to try the plan i have described to you  up and bring the wounded chief hither without delay  the two men obeyed and in a few minutes were seen reissuing from the fortress bearing a litter between them on which lay the wounded chief with a blanket thrown over him only his head being visible  carrying him towards the row of natives the brothers laid the burden at their feet as they sat still on the ground looking on with great interest karlsefin removed the blanket and revealed the chief bound hand and foot  something covered by another blanket lay at his side  karlsefin took hold of this  as he did so the norsemen rose  the blanket was cast off and ten naked swords were revealed which were instantly grasped by ten stalwart arms and flashed with the speed of light over the ten native heads  taken thus by surprise they remained seated and supposing that to move would be the signal for instant death they were perfectly motionless though the colour of their countenances revealed to some extent the state of their feelings  a terrific yell from the distant heights told that the deed had been noticed and understood  it was answered by a shout from the norsemen as they issued from their fortress secured their prisoners and carried them within the defences  in a few minutes thereafter not a man was to be seen on the heights and the region became as silent and apparently as deserted as it had been before the advent of the savages  now then biarne get the things ready  is the kettle boiling said karlsefin  all is prepared answered biarne  tis well  we must carry out our plan as quickly as may be rejoined karlsefin  we may be sure that these fellows have only retired behind the heights to hold a council of war and in their present humour it wont be long before they come on to make an effort to retaliate upon us for our supposed treachery  the ten men were conveyed to the largest house in the hamlet and there ranged in a row against the wall  they looked very grave but were firm and stern  evidently they imagined that death by torture was to be their doom and had braced themselves up to die like brave men in the presence of their foes  karlsefin hastened to relieve them from this state of mind as quickly as possible  he placed before them ten plates of splendid boiled salmon they regarded this proceeding with some surprise but shook their heads and refused to eat  doubtless their appetites were not good at the time  fetch the wounded chief hither said karlsefin and tell bertha that she is wanted  when the wounded man was carried in and seated opposite to his comrades a box being placed for him to lean against karlsefin said to berthanow lass do thy best to induce the chief to show his friends how to eat  he has had some experience of you and will doubtless understand  with a winning smile that would have compelled any susceptible man to eat or drink or do anything else that he was bid whether inclined or not bertha put a plate of salmon before the chief and made signs to him to eat  he smiled in return and began at once  then bertha patted him on the shoulder pointed to the ten prisoners and made signs again the chief smiled intelligently and spoke to his companions  he evidently said more than was necessary to order them to eat for their faces brightened perceptibly and they commenced dinner in these peculiar circumstances without delay  it was clear that their appetites had not been much impaired by alarm for the salmon disappeared in a twinkling  then karlsefin ordered ten plates of fried venison to be placed before them which was done and they applied themselves to the consumption of this with equal relish having concluded the repast each man received a can of warm water and milk highly sweetened with sugar  at first they took a doubtful sip of this and looked at each other in surprise  it was a new sensation one of them smacked his lips the rest said waugh nodded their heads and drained their cans to the bottom at a single draught after which observing that there was some sediment left they scraped it out with their fingers and sucked them  so far that is satisfactory said karlsefin with a smile  now biarnethe gifts  a wooden tray was now brought on which lay a variety of silver brooches rings and other baubles  these were distributed to the prisoners  last of all each received a yard of brightcoloured cloth and then they were ordered by signs to rise  they obeyed with alacrity and were led out of the house at the door of which they found a litter similar to the one which they had seen before it was simply a blanket fastened to two long poles and rolled round them so as to form a couch of about a yard in width  on this the wounded chief was laid and two of the natives were ordered to grasp the ends of the poles and raise him  they did so and were conducted by the norsemen in single file out into the forest  here to their intense surprise karlsefin shook hands with them all very kindly and then going back with his men to the fortress left them to return to their kindred  karlsefin remarked quietly to biarne as he went along that one of the precepts of the new religion which he had remembered well because it seemed to him so very wise was that men should always try to overcome evil with good  thus was established a warm friendship between the natives of vinland and the norsemen a friendship which might have lasted for everto the great modification no doubt of american historyhad not unfortunate circumstances intervened to break it up  as it was it lasted for a considerable time    chapter fourteen  the first american fur tradersstrange devicesanxious times and pleasant discoveries  the business of the colony progressed admirably after this  a large house was erected with a central hall and numerous sleepingrooms or closets off it where all the chief people dwelt together and a number of the men messed daily  grass was found in abundance and a large quantity of this was cut and stacked for winter use although there was good reason to believe that the winter would be so mild that the cattle might be left out to forage for themselves  salmon were also caught in great numbers not only in little river but in the main stream and in the lake at their very doors  what they did not consume was dried smoked and stored  besides this a large quantity of fine timber was felled squared cut into lengths and made suitable for exportation eggs were found on the islands offshore and feathers collected so that early in the summer they had more than enough wherewith to load the ship  among other discoveries they found grain growing wild  the sagawriters have called it wheat but it is open to question whether it was not wild rice of which large quantities grow in the uninhabited parts of america at the present time  they also found a beautiful kind of wood called massurwood of which samples were sent to greenland and norway but what this wood really was we cannot tell  meanwhile an extensive traffic in valuable furs was commenced with the natives who were more than satisfied with the scraps of bright cloth beads and other trifling ornaments they received in exchange for them some of the natives wanted to purchase weapons with their furs but karlsefin would not allow this  at first the norsemen gave their cloth and other wares in exchange with liberal hand cutting the bright cloth into stripes of three or four inches in breadth but they soon found that at this rate their supplies would become exhausted too early in the year  they therefore reduced their prices and began to give stripes of cloth only two inches in width and at last reduced the measure to one inch for furs that had previously fetched four  but the unsophisticated natives were quite content with the change and appeared to enjoy nothing so much as to twist these stripes of cloth into their long black hair  one day karlsefin said to gudrid that he had a new plan in his head  what is that said she  i think that our goods are going away too fast so i mean to try if these skraelingers will give their furs for dairy produce  we have a good deal of that and can spare some  i dont know how astrid will like that she said laughing  you know she has charge of the dairy and is very proud of it  that is well gudrid for astrid will be all the more pleased to have her produce turned to such good account  milk is pleasant to the throat and cream delights the tongue  methinks these fellows will be tempted by it  would they not like beer better  beer cried karlsefin with a shout of laughter  you should have seen the faces they made and the way they spat it out the only time they were asked to taste it  biarne was very keen to let them try it and i did not object for i partly expected some such result  no no a man must learn to like beer  nature teaches him to like milk  but go tell astrid to fill twenty cans with milk and twenty small cups with good cream  let her also set out twenty cakes with a pat of fresh butter and a lump of cheese on each  let her spread all on the table in the great hall and see that she does it speedily  i will go and fetch the company to this feast  he left the room as he spoke and in less than an hour his orders had been executed  when he entered the hall a short time afterwards followed by twenty natives he found everything prepared according to his directions  that he was correct in his expectation was clearly proved ere many minutes had passed for the twenty natives raised their forty eyes and looked on each other with rapturous delight when they tasted the good things  they finished them in a twinkling and then wished for more but it is only justice to their goodbreeding and selfrestraint to add that they did not ask for more  from that day nothing would please them but that they should have dairy produce for their furs  some time after this karlsefin was walking one afternoon on the shores of the lake with thorward  he suddenly asked him how he should like to take a trip to greenland  i should like it well replied thorward  then if you will go in charge of the snake i should be pleased said the other for we have collected more than enough of merchandise to fill her and if you set sail at once you will have time to bring back a cargo of such things as we need before autumn comes to an end  i will go said thorward tomorrow if you choose  nay not quite so fast  the ship is only half loaded yet but in a day or two she will be ready  there are two things i am anxious you should manage  one is to persuade leif ericsson to come and visit usif he will not come to stay with us  the other is to tempt as many married men as you can to come over and join usespecially those men who chance to have a good many daughters for we would be the better of a few more busy little hands fair faces and silvery tones in this beautiful vinland of ours  i will do what i can replied thorward and i would advise that olaf should go with me that his glowing descriptions may tempt his father to come  nay that would spoil all objected karlsefin for having had a sight of his son he would be content to let him come back alone  no no we will keep olaf here as a bait to tempt him  but go now and make your arrangements for you set sail as soon as the ship is ready  not long after that the snake left her anchorage with a full cargo rowed down the river hoisted sail and bore away for greenland  while she was gone an event of deep and absorbing interest occurred in vinland  one fine morning in autumn the heart of the entire hamlet was moved by the sound of a new voice  it was not a musical voicerather squawky indeed than otherwiseand it was a feeble voice that told of utter helplessness  in short a son had been born to karlsefin and gudrid and they called him snorro  we record it with regretfor it went a long way to prove that in regard to sweet sounds karlsefin and his wife were destitute of taste  it is our business however to record facts rather than to carp at them therefore we let snorro pass without further comment  the little body that was attached to the little voice although far from beautiful at first was an object of intense affection to the parents and of regard almost amounting to veneration to the rugged men by whom it was surrounded  bertha declared enthusiastically that it was perfectly lovely although it was obvious to all unprejudiced eyes that it resembled nothing so much as a piece of wrinkled beef of bad colour  astrid declared that it had such a wise look despite the evident fact that its expression was little short of idiotical karlsefin said nothing but he smiled a good deal and chucked it under the place where its chin ought to have been with his great forefinger in a timid way  but when snorro was deemed sufficiently far advanced in life to be handed out for public exhibition then it was that the greatest number of falsehoods were uttered with the quietest deliberation although to say truth the greater number of the men said nothing but contented themselves with taking the infant in their big rough hands as delicately as if they thought it was a bubble and feared that it might burst and leave nothing to be handed back to thora who acted the part of nurse others merely ventured to look at it silently with their hairy lips parted and their huge eyes gazing in blank admiration  perhaps krake made the most original remark in reference to the newcomer  ah said he quite seriously touching its cheek as softly as though he half feared it would bite only to think that myself was like that once  this was received with a shout of laughter so loud that little snorro was startled  ah then cried krake with a look of great alarm what is it going to do  this question was occasioned by the sudden change on the infants countenance which became if possible redder than before and puckered up into such a complicated series of wrinkles that all semblance to humanity was wellnigh lost  suddenly a hole opened on the surface and a feeble squall came forth  oh you wicked men cried thora snatching the infant indignantly from them and hurrying back into the house  tis a sweet child observed swend tenderly as he and his comrades sauntered away  you must have a good opinion of yourself krake said tyrker to fancy that you were once like it  so i have replied krake  its what my father had before me  it lies in the family you see and with good reason too for we were the best of company not to mention fighting  it was always said that we were uncommonly fine infants though a trifle big and noisy for the peace of our neighbourhoodquite like turks in that way i believe  i doubt it not krake said biarne who came up in time to hear the concluding remark and since you are such a noisy fellow i am going to send you on an expedition in search of these vines that seem to me to have rooted themselves out of the land and fled from mere spite since leif named it vinland  there is but one quarter that i can think of now which has not yet been explored you may take a party of men and let tyrker go too as he discovered them on his first visit the stupid fellow ought to have rediscovered them long before now  you can discuss by the way the little matter you have in handonly see that you dont fall out about it  thus instructed krake organised a party and set off to search for the celebrated vines which as biarne said had not up to that time been found  that day they searched far and wide without success  then they sat down to rest and eat  while thus engaged krake and tyrker returned to the subject of the reported noisiness of turks and the former became so caustic in his jests that the irascible little tyrker lost temper much to the amusement of his comrades  after refreshing themselves the explorers again set out and came to a part of the country which was broken up and beautifully diversified by rocky eminences crowned with trees and shady hollows carpeted with wildflowers  it was difficult here to decide as to which of the innumerable valleys or hollows they should traverse they therefore sat down again for a little to consult but the consultation soon became a discussion and krake whose spirit of fun had got the better of him gradually edged the talk round until it came again quite in a natural way to the turks  at last tyrker became so angry that he started up declared he would follow the party no longer plunged into a thicket and disappeared  he was followed by a shout of laughter and then the others rising resumed their search not doubting that their irate companion would ere long rejoin them  but tyrker did not join them and when evening drew on apace they became anxious gave up the search for vines and went about looking for him at last it became too dark for them to continue the search and they were obliged to return home without their comrade  on leaving them tyrker had no definite idea what he meant to do or where he meant to go  he just walked straight before him in high dudgeon taking no notice of the route by which he journeyed or the flight of time  at length he awoke from his absent condition of mind and looked up  a vast amphitheatre of wooded hills surrounded him and there in the heart of a secluded dell under a clump of trees were the long sought and muchdesired vines  for some time tyrker stood gazing at them in silent admiration and delight  he rubbed his eyes and looked again  yes there could be no question as to their reality  there hung the rich purple clusters such as he had seen on his first visit to vinland and such as he had been wont to see in his own land in days long gone by  he pinched himself pulled his hair punched his eyeballs but noall that failed to awaken him from which circumstance he naturally came to the conclusion that he was awake already  he then uttered a wild probably a turkish cheer and rushed upon the spoil  filling both hands with the fruit he crammed his mouth full  then he raised his eyes upwards in ecstasy and did it again  he repeated it after which he paused to sigh and leaped up to cheer and sat down again toguzzle  pardon the word good reader it is appropriate for there is no disguising the fact that tyrker was a tremendous glutton and did not care a figor a grapefor appearances  after eating for a long time he was satisfied and sat down to rest  by that time the shades of evening were falling  they proved to be soporific for he gradually reclined backwards on the green turf and fell asleep surrounded by and partially covered with grapes like a drunken and disorderly bacchus  now tyrker was a man in robust health full of energy and high spirits sleep therefore was to him a process which once begun continued till morning  even the puckered little snorro did not rest more soundly in his kneadingtrough crib than did tyrker on the greensward under his vinous canopy  when next he opened his eyes groaned rolled over sat up and yawned the sun was beginning to peep above the eastern sea  ho exclaimed tyrker  i have forgot myself  to refresh his memory he scratched his head and shook it then he raised his eyes saw the grapes leaped up and burst into a fit of joyous laughter  thereafter he again sat down and breakfasted after which he filled his cap his wallet his various pockets the breast of his coatevery available compartment in fact outside as well as inwith grapes and hastened homeward at his utmost speed in order to communicate the joyful news to his comrades  now the disappearance of tyrker had caused no small amount of anxiety to his friends at the hamlet especially to karlsefin who was very fond of him and who feared that his strength might have given way or that he had fallen into the hands of savages or under the paws of bears  he sat up the greater part of the night watching and hoping for his return and when the first grey light of dawn appeared he called up a number of the men and dividing them into several bands organised a systematic search  placing himself at the head of one band he went off in the direction in which from krakes account of what had taken place it seemed most probable that tyrker might be found  they advanced so rapidly that when the sun rose they had got to within a mile or so of the spot where krake and his party had given up their search on the previous evening  thus it came to pass that before the red sun had ascended the eastern sky by much more than his own height karlsefin and tyrker met face to face in a narrow gorge  they stopped and gazed at each other for a few moments in silence karlsefin in astonishment as welland no wonder for the figure that stood before him was a passing strange one  to behold tyrker thus dishevelled and besmeared was surprising enough but to see him with grapes and vineleaves stuffed all about him and twined all round him was absolutely astounding  his behaviour was little less so for clapping his hands to his sides he shut his eyes opened his big mouth and burst into an uproarious fit of laughter  the men who came up at that moment did so also for laughter is catching  why tyrker where have you been demanded karlsefin  grapes shouted tyrker and laughed again  are these grapes asked karlsefin regarding the fruit with much interest  ay grapes vines  vinland hurrah  but are you sure  instead of answering tyrker laughed again and began to talk as he always did when greatly moved in turkish  altogether he was so much excited that krake said he was certainly drunk  drunk exclaimed tyrker again using the norse language no that is not possible  a man could not get drunk on grapes if he were to eat a shipload of them  i am only joyfulhappy happy as i can be  it seems as if my young days had returned again with these grapes  i am drunk with old thoughts and memories  i am back again in turkey  ye couldnt be in a worse place if all accounts be true said krake with a grin  come dont keep all the grapes to yourself let us taste them  ay let us taste them said karlsefin advancing and plucking a bunch from tyrkers shoulders  the others did the same tasted them and pronounced the fruit excellent  now lads we will make the strong drink from the grapes said tyrker i dont know quite how to do it but we will soon find out  that you certainly shall not if i can prevent it said karlsefin firmly  tyrker looked a little surprised and asked why not  because if the effect of eating grapes is so powerful drinking the strong drink of the grape must be dangerous  why do you wish to make it  why becausebecauseit does make one so happy  you told us just now returned karlsefin that you were as happy as you could be did you not  you cannot be happier than thattherefore according to your own showing tyrker there is no need of strong drink  thats for you whispered krake to tyrker with a wink as he poked him in the side  go to sleep upon that advice man and itll do ye goodif it dont do ye harm  ease him of part of his load boys and we shall go back the way we came as fast as may be  each man relieved tyrker of several bunches of grapes so that in a few minutes he resumed his own ordinary appearance  they then retraced their steps and soon afterwards presented to the women the first grapes of vinland  karlsefin carried a chosen bunch to gudrid who after thanking him heartily stuffed a grape into the hole in snorros puckered visage and nearly choked him  thus narrowly did the first yankee for such one of his own countrymen has claimed him to be escape being killed by the firstfruits of his native land    chapter fifteen  greenland againflatface turns up also thorward who becomes eloquent and secures recruits for vinland  who has not heard of that solitary step which lies between the sublime and the ridiculous  the very question may seem ridiculous  and who has not at one period or another of life been led to make comparisons to that step  why then should we hesitate to confess that the step in question has been suggested by the brevity of that other step which lies between the beautiful and the plain the luxuriant and the barren the fruitful and the sterilewhich step we now call upon the reader to take by accompanying us from vinlands shady groves to greenlands rocky shores  leif ericsson is there standing on the end of the wharf at brattalid bold stalwart and upright as he was when some years before he opened up the way to vinland  flatface the skraelinger is there too stout hairy and as suggestive of a fryingpan as he was when on murderous deeds intent not very long before he had led his hairy friends on tiptoe to the confines of brattalid and was made almost to leap out of his oily skin with terror  but his terror by this time was gone  he and the norsemen had been reconciled very much to the advantage of both and his tribe was just then encamped on the other side of the ridge  leif had learned a little of the skraelinger tongue flatface had acquired a little less of the norse languageand a pretty mess they made of it between them  as we are under the necessity of rendering both into english we beg the readers forbearance and consideration  so you are going off on a sealing expedition are you said leif turning from the contemplation of the horizon and regarding the skraelinger with a comical smile  yis yo ha hooroo said flatface waving his arms violently to add force to his reply  and when do you go asked leif  wen  e go skrumch en cracker smorrow  just so replied leif only i cant quite make that cracker out unless you mean tomorrow  yis yo ha exclaimed the hairy man  kite right kite right smorrow yis tomorrow  youre a wonderful man remarked leif with a smile  youll speak norse like a norseman if you live long enough  eh exclaimed the skraelinger with a perplexed look  when are you to be back asked leif  flatface immediately pointed to the moon which although it was broad daylight at the time showed a remarkably white face in the blue sky and doubling his fist hit himself four blows on the bridge of his nose or rather on the spot where the bridge of that feature should have been but where as it happened there was only a hollow in the fryingpan with a little blob below it  ha four months  very good  it will be a good riddance for to say truth im tired of you and your noisy relations  leif said this more as a soliloquy than a remark for he had no intention of hurting the feelings of the poor savage who he was aware could not understand him  turning again to him he saidyou know the kitchen flatface  flatface said nothing but rolled his eyes nodded violently and rubbed that region which is chiefly concerned with food  go said leif tell anders to give you foodfoodfood  at each mention of the word flatface retreated a step and nodded  when leif stopped he turned about and with an exclamation of delight trundled off to the kitchen like a goodnatured polar bear  for full half an hour after that leif walked up and down the wharf with his eyes cast down evidently he was brooding over something  presently anders came towards him  anders was a burly middleaged norseman with a happylooking countenance he was also cook steward valet and general factotum to leif  well anders hast had a visit from flatface asked leif  ayhe is in the kitchen now  hast fed him  ay gorged him replied anders with a grin  good said leif laughing he goes off tomorrow it seems for four months which im right glad to hear for we have had him and his kindred long enough beside us for this time  i am sorry on account of the christian teachers however because they were making some progress with the language and this will throw them back  leif here referred to men who had recently been sent to greenland by king olaf tryggvisson of norway with the design of planting christianity there and some of whom appeared to be very anxious to acquire the language of the natives  leif himself had kept somewhat aloof from these teachers of the new faith  he had indeed suffered himself to be baptized when on a visit to norway in order to please the king but he was a very reserved man and no one knew exactly what opinions he held in regard to religion  of course he had been originally trained in the odinworship of his forefathers but he was a remarkably shrewd man and people said that he did not hold by it very strongly  no one ever ventured to ask him what he held until the teachers above mentioned came  when they tried to find out his opinions he quietly and with much urbanity asked to be informed as to some of the details of that which they had come to teach and so managed the conversation that without hurting their feelings he sent them away from him as wise as they came  but although leif was silent he was very observant and people said that he noted what was going on keenlywhich was indeed the case  i know not what the teachers think said anders with a careless air but it is my opinion that they wont make much of the skraelingers and the skraelingers are not worth making much of  there thou art wrong anders said leif with much gravity does not flatface love his wife and children as much as you love yours  i suppose he does  is not his flesh and blood the same as thine his body as well knit together as thine and as well suited to its purposes  doubtless it is though somewhat uglier  does he not support his family as well as thou dost and labour more severely than thou for that purpose  is he not a better hunter too and a faster walker and fully as much thought of and prized by his kindred  all that may be very true replied anders carelessly  then pursued leif if the skraelingers be apparently as good as thou art how can ye say that they are not worth making much of  truly on the same ground that i say that i myself am not worth making much of  i neither know nor care anything about the matter  only this am i sure of that the skraelingers do not serve you master as well as i do  anders thou art incorrigible said leif smiling but i admit the truth of your last remark so now if ye will come up to the house and do for me to some extent what ye have just done to flatface ye will add greatly to the service of which thou hast spoken  i follow master said anders but would it not be well first to wait and see which of our people are returning to us for if i mistake not yonder is a boats sail coming round the ness  a boats sail exclaimed leif eagerly as he gazed at the sail in question why man if your eyes were as good as those of flatface ye would have seen that yonder sail belongs to a ship  my own eyes have been turned inward the last half hour else must i have observed it sooner  it seems to me but a boat said anders  i tell thee it is a ship cried leif ay and if my eyes do not deceive it is the ship of karlsefin  go call out the people quickly and see that they come armed  there is no saying who may be in possession of the ship now  anders hastened away and leif after gazing at the approaching vessel a little longer walked up to the house where some of his housecarls were hastily arming and where he received from the hands of an old female servant his sword helmet and shield  the people of brattalid were soon all assembled on the shore anxiously awaiting the arrival of the ship and an active boy was sent round to heriulfness to convey the news to the people therefor in greenland the arrival of a ship was of rare occurrence in those days  as the ship drew near all doubt as to her being karlsefins vessel was removed and when she came close to land great was the anxiety of the people to make out the faces that appeared above the bulwarks  that is karlsefin said one  i know his form of face well  no it is biarne cried another  karlsefin is taller by half a foot  tis thorward said a third  id know his face among a thousand  there seem to be no women with them observed anders who stood at the end of the wharf near his master  does any one see olaf asked leif  nono replied several voices  when the ship was near enough leif shoutedis olaf on board  no replied thorward in a stentorian voice  leifs countenance fell  is all well in vinland he shouted  all is well was the reply  leifs countenance brightened and in a few minutes he was shaking thorward heartily by the hand  why did ye not bring my son said leif somewhat reproachfully as they went up to the house together  we thought it best to try to induce you to go to him rather than bring him to you answered thorward smiling  you must come back with me leif  you cannot conceive what a splendid country it is  it far surpasses iceland and norway  as to greenland it should not be named in the same breath  leif made no reply at that time but seemed to ponder the proposal  now we shall feast thorward said leif as he entered the hall  ho lay the tables good womancome anders see that ye load it well have all the housecarls gathered i will go fetch in our neighbours and we shall hear what thorward has to say of this vinland that we have heard so much about of late  leifs instructions were promptly and energetically carried out  the tables were spread with all the delicacies of the season that greenland had to boast of which consisted chiefly of fish and wildfowl with seals flesh instead of beef for nearly all the cattle had been carried off by the emigrants as we have seen and the few that were left behind had died for want of proper food  the banquet was largely improved by thorward who loaded the table with smoked salmon  after the dishes had been removed and the tankards of beer sent round thorward began to relate his story to greedy ears  he was very graphic in his descriptions and possessed the power of detailing even commonplace conversations in such a way that they became interesting  he had a great deal of quiet humour too which frequently convulsed his hearers with laughter  in short he gave such a fascinating account of the new land that when the people retired to rest that night there was scarcely a man woman or child among them who did not long to emigrate without delay  this was just what thorward desired  next day he unloaded the ship and the sight of her cargo fully confirmed many parts of his story  the upshot of it was that leif agreed to go and spend the winter in vinland and a considerable number of married men made up their minds to emigrate with their wives and families  having discharged cargo and taken in a large supply of such goods as were most needed at the new colony thorward prepared for sea  leif placed anders in charge of his establishment and about grey dawn of a beautiful morning the snake once again shook out her square sail to the breeze and set sail for vinland    chapter sixteen  joyful meetings and hearty greetings  need we attempt to describe the joy of our friends in vinland when one afternoon towards the end of autumn they saw their old ship sweep into the lake under oars and sail and cast anchor in the bay  we think not  the reader must possess but a small power of fancy who cannot without the aid of description call up vividly the gladsome faces of men and women when they saw the familiar vessel appear and beheld the bulwarks crowded with wellknown faces  besides words cannot paint olafs sparkling eyes and the scream of delight when he recognised his father standing in sedate gravity on the poop  suffice it to say that the joy culminated at night as human joys not unfrequently do in a feast at which as a matter of course the whole story of the arrival and settlement in vinland was told over again to the newcomers as if it had never been told before  but there was this advantage in the telling that instead of all being told by thorward each man gave his own version of his own doings or at all events delegated the telling to a friend who was likely to do him justice sometimes one or another undertook that friendly act without having it laid upon him  thus krake undertook to relate the discovery of the grapes by tyrker and tyrker retaliated by giving an account of the accident in connexion with a mudhole that had happened to krake  this brought out biarne who went into a still more minute account of that event with reference to its bearing on freydissa and that gentle woman revenged herself by giving an account of the manner in which hake had robbed biarne of the honour of killing a brown bear the mention of which ferocious animal naturally suggested to olaf the brave deed of his dear pet the black bull to a narrative of which he craved and obtained attention  from the black bull to the baby was an easy and natural transitionmore so perhaps than may appear at first sightfor the bull suggested the cows and the cows the milk which last naturally led to thoughts of the great consumer thereof  it is right to say here however that the baby was among the first objects presented to leif and his friends after their arrival and great was the interest with which they viewed this firstborn of the american land  the wrinkles by the way were gone by that time  they had been filled up so completely that the place where they once were resembled a fair and smooth round ball of fresh butter with two bright blue holes in it a knob below them and a ripe cherry underneath that  snorro happened to be particularly amiable when first presented to his new friends  of course he had not at that time reached the crowing or smiling age  his goodness as yet was negative  he did not squall he did not screw up his face into inconceivable formations he did not grow alarmingly red in the face he did not insist on having milk seeing that he had already had as much as he could possibly holdno he did none of these things but lay in gudrids arms the very embodiment of stolid and expressionless indifference to all earthly thingsthose who loved him best included  but this state of goodness did not last long  he soon began to display what may be styled the oldadamic part of his nature and induced leif after much longsuffering to suggest that that would do and that he had better be taken away  the effervescence of the colony caused by this infusion of new elements ere long settled down  the immigrants took part in the general labour and duties  timbercutting grapegathering haymaking fishing hunting exploring eating drinking and sleeping went on with unabated vigour and thus gradually autumn merged into winter  but winter did not bring in its train the total change that these norsemen had been accustomed to in their more northern homes  the season was to them comparatively mild  true there was a good deal of snow and it frequently gave to the branches of the trees that silvery coating which in sunshine converts the winter forest into the very realms of fairyland but the snow did not lie deep on the ground or prevent the cattle from remaining out and finding food all the winter there was ice also on the lake thick enough to admit of walking on it and sledging with ponies but not thick enough to prevent them cutting easily through it and fishing with lines and hooks made of bone and baited with bits of fat with which they caught enormous trout little short of salmon in size and quite as good for food  daring the winter there was plenty of occupation for every one in the colony  for one thing it cost a large number of the best men constant and hard labour merely to supply the colonists with firewood and food then the felling of timber for export was carried on during winter as easily as in summer and the trapping of wild animals for their furs was a prolific branch of industry  sometimes the men changed their work for the sake of variety  the hunters occasionally took to fishing the fishers to timber felling and squaring the timbercutters to trapping the trappers undertook the work of the firewoodcutters and these latter relieved the men who performed the duties of furnituremaking repairing general homework and guarding the settlement  thus the work went on and circled round  of course all this implied a vast deal of tear and wear  buttons had not at that time been invented but tags could burst off as well as buttons and loops were not warranted to last for ever any more than buttonholes  socks were unknown to those hardy pioneers but soft leather shoes not unlike mocassins and boots resembling those of the esquimaux of the present day were constantly wearing out and needed to be replaced or repaired hence the women of the colony had their hands full for besides these renovating duties which devolved on them they had also the housekeepinga duty in itself calling for an amount of constant labour anxiety and attention which that ridiculous creature man never can or will understand or appreciateat least so the women say but being a man we incline to differ from them as to that  then when each days work was over the men returned to their several abodes tired and hungry  arrangements had been made that so many men should dwell and mess together and the women were so appointed that each mess was properly looked after  thus the men found cheerful fires clean hearths spread tables smoking viands and a pleasant welcome on their return home and after supper were wont to spend the evenings in recounting their days experiences telling sagas singing songs or discussing general principlesa species of discussion by the way which must certainly have originated in eden after the fall  in karlsefins large hall the largest number of men and women were nightly assembled and there the time was spent much in the same way but with this difference that the heads of the settlement were naturally appealed to in disputed matters and conversation frequently merged into something like orations from leif and biarne karlsefin and thorward all of whom were fartravelled wellinformed and capable of sustaining the interest of their audiences for a prolonged period  in those days the art of writing was unknown among the norsemen and it was their custom to fix the history of their great achievements as well as much of their more domestic doings in their memories by means of song and story  men gifted with powers of composition in prose and verse undertook to enshrine deeds and incidents in appropriate language at the time of their occurrence and these scalds or poets and sagamen or chroniclers although they might perhaps have coloured their narratives and poems slightly were not likely to have falsified them because they were at first related and sung in the presence of actors and eyewitnesses to attempt imposition on whom would have been useless as well as ridiculous  hence those old songs and sagas had their foundation in truth  after they were once launched into the memories of men the form of words doubtless tended to protect them to some extent from adulteration and even when all allowance is made for mans wellknown tendency to invent and exaggerate it still remains likely that all the truth would be retained although surrounded more or less with fiction  to distinguish the true from the false in such cases is not so difficult a process as one at first sight might suppose  men with penetrating minds and retentive memories who are trained to such work are swift to detect the chaff amongst the wheat and although in their winnowing operations they may frequently blow away a few grains of wheat they seldom or never accept any of the chaff as good grain  we urge all this upon the reader because the narratives and poems which were composed and related by karlsefin and his friends that winter doubtless contained those truths which were not taken out of the traditionary state collected and committed to writing by the icelandic sagawriters until about one hundred years afterwards at the end of the eleventh or beginning of the twelfth century  on these winter evenings too karlsefin sometimes broached the subject of the new religion which had been so recently introduced into greenland  he told them that he had not received much instruction in it so that he could not presume to explain it all to them but added that he had become acquainted with the name and some of the precepts of jesus christ and these last he said seemed to him so good and so true that he now believed in him who taught them and would not exchange that belief for all the riches of this world for said he the world we dwell in is passing awaythat to which we go shall never pass away his chief delight in the new religion was that jesus christ was described as a saviour from sin and he thought that to be delivered from wicked thoughts in the heart and wicked deeds of the body was the surest road to perfect happiness  the norsemen listened to all this with profound interest for none of them were so much wedded to their old religion as to feel any jealousy of the new but although they thought much about it they spoke little for all were aware that the two religions could not go togetherthe acceptance of the one implied the rejection of the other  frequently during the winter karlsefin and leif had earnest conversations about the prospects of the infant colony  leif said karlsefin one day my mind is troubled  that is bad replied leif what troubles it  the thoughts that crowd upon me in regard to this settlement  i marvel not at that returned leif stopping and looking across the lake on the margin of which they were walking your charge is a heavy one calling for earnest thought and careful management  but what is the particular view that gives you uneasiness  why the fact that it does not stand on a foundation which is likely to be permanent  a house may not be very large but if its foundation be good it will stand  if however its foundation be bad then the bigger and grander it is so much the worse for the house  that is true  go on  well it seems to me that the foundation of our settlement is not good it is true that some of us have our wives here and there is besides a sprinkling of young girls who are being courted by some of the men nevertheless it remains a stubborn truth that far the greater part of the men are those who came out with thorward and me and have left either wives or sweethearts in norway and in iceland  now these may be pleased to remain here for a time but it cannot be expected that they will sit down contentedly and make it their home  there is truth in what you say karlsefin  have any of your men spoken on that subject  no none as yet but i have not failed to note that some of them are not so cheerful and hearty as they used to be  what is to prevent you making a voyage to iceland and norway next spring said leif and bringing out the wives and families and if you can the sweethearts of these men  karlsefin laughed heartily at this suggestion  why leif he said has your sojourn on the barren coast of greenland so wrought on your good sense or your feelings that you should suppose thirty or forty families will agree at once to leave home and kindred to sail for and settle in a new land of the west that they have barelyperhaps never heard of and think you that sweethearts have so few lovers at home that they will jump at those who are farthest away from them  it is one thing to take time and trouble to collect men and households that are willing to emigrate it is another thing altogether to induce households to follow men who have already emigrated  nay but i would counsel you to take the men home along with you so that they might use their persuasions returned leif but as you say it is not a likely course to take even in that way  what then do you think is wisest to be done  i cannot yet reply to that leif  i see no course open  tell me karlsefin how is it with yourself asked leif looking earnestly at his friend  are you content to dwell here  karlsefin did not reply for a few seconds  well to tell you the truth he said at length i do not relish the notion of calling vinland home  the sea is my home  i have dwelt on it the greater part of my life  i love its free breezes and surging waves  the very smell of its salt spray brings pleasant memories to my soul  i cannot brook the solid earth  while i walk i feel as if i were glued to it and when i lie down i am too still  it is like death  on the sea whether i stand or walk or lie i am ever bounding on  yes the sea is my native home and when old age constrains me to forsake it and take to the land my home must be in iceland  truly if that be your state of mind said leif laughing there is little hope of your finally coming to an anchor here  but continued karlsefin less energetically it would not be right in me to forsake those whom i have led hither  i am bound to remain by and aid them as long as they are willing to stayat least until they do not require my services  that is well spoken friend said leif  thou art indeed so bound now what i would counsel is this that you should spend another year or perhaps two more years in vinland and at the end of that time it will be pretty plain either that the colony is going to flourish and can do without you or that it is advisable to forsake it and return home meanwhile i would advise that you give the land a fair trial  put a good face on it keep the men busyfor that is the way to keep them cheerful and contented always being careful not to overwork them provide amusements for their leisure hours if possible and keep them from thinking too much of absent wives and sweetheartsif you can  if i can repeated karlsefin with a smile ay but i dont think i can  however your advice seems good so i will adopt it and as i shall be able to follow it out all the better with your aid i hope that you will spend next winter with us  i agree to that said leif but i must first visit greenland in spring and then return to you  and now tell me what you think of the two thralls king olaf sent me  karlsefins brow clouded a little as he replied that they were excellent men in all respectscheerful willing and brave  so should i have expected of men sent to me by the king said leif but i have noticed that the elder is very sad  does he pine for his native land think ye  doubtless he does answered karlsefin but i am tempted to think that he like some others among us pines for an absent sweetheart  not unlikely not unlikely observed leif looking gravely at the ground  and the younger lad hake what of him  he i think seems well enough pleased to remain if one may judge from his manner and countenance  there is reason for that returned karlsefin with a recurrence of the troubled expression  the truth is that hake is in love with bertha  the thrall exclaimed leif  ay and he has gone the length of speaking to her of love i know it for i heard him  what does karlsefin condescend to turn eavesdropper said leif looking at his friend in surprise  not so but i chanced to come within earshot at the close of an interview they had and heard a few words in spite of myself  it was in summer  i was walking through the woods and suddenly heard voices near me in the heart of a copse through which i must needs pass  thinking nothing about it i advanced and saw hake and bertha partially concealed by the bushes  suddenly hake cried passionately i cannot help it bertha  i must tell you that i love you if i should die for it to which bertha replied it is useless hake neither leif nor karlsefin will consent and i shall never oppose their will  then hake said you are right bertha rightforgive me  at this point i felt ashamed of standing still and turned back lest i should overhear more  he is a thralla thrall murmured leif sternly as if musing  and yet he is a scottish earls son said karlsefin  it does seem a hard case to be a thrall  i wonder if the new religion teaches anything regarding thraldom  leif looked up quickly into his friends face but karlsefin had turned his head aside as if in meditation and no further allusion was made to that subject by either of them  do you think that bertha returns hakes love asked leif after a few minutes  there can be no doubt of that said karlsefin laughing the colour of her cheek the glance of her eye and the tones of her voice are all telltale  but since the day i have mentioned they have evidently held more aloof from each other  that is well said leif somewhat sternly  bertha is freeborn  she shall not wed a thrall if he were the son of fifty scottish earls  this speech was altogether so unlike what might have been expected from one of leifs kind and gentle nature that karlsefin looked at him in some astonishment and seemed about to speak but leif kept his frowning eyes steadily on the ground and the two friends walked the remainder of the road to the hamlet in perfect silence    chapter seventeen  treats of the friendship and adventures of olaf and snorro and of sundry surprising incidents  we must now pass over a considerable period of time and carry our story forward to the spring of the third year after the settlement of the norsemen in vinland  during that interval matters had progressed much in the same way as we have already described only that the natives had become a little more exacting in their demands while engaged in barter and were on the whole rather more pugnacious and less easily pleased  there had been a threatening of hostilities once or twice but owing to karlsefins pacific policy no open rupture had taken place  during that interval too leif had made two trips to greenland and back a considerable amount of merchandise had been sent home a few more colonists had arrived and a few of the original ones had left thorwards ship had been also brought to vinland and last but not least snorro had grown into a most magnificent baby  things were in this felicitous condition when early one beautiful spring morning snorro resolved to have a ramble  snorro was by that time barely able to walk and he did it after a peculiar fashion of his own  he had also begun to make a few desperate efforts to talk but even gudrid was forced to admit that in regard to both walking and talking there was great room for improvement  now it must be told that little olaf was particularly fond of snorro and if one might judge from appearances snorro reciprocated the attachment  whenever snorro happened to be missed it was generally understood that olaf had him  if any one chanced to ask the question where is snorro the almost invariable reply was ask olaf  in the event of olaf not having him it was quite unnecessary for any one to ask where he was because the manner in which he raged about the hamlet shouting howling absolutely yelling for oaf was a sufficient indication of his whereabouts  it was customary for olaf not only to tend and nurse snorro in a general way when at home but to take him out for little walks and rides in the foresthimself being the horse  at first these delightful expeditions were very short but as snorros legs developed and his mother became more accustomed to his absences they were considerably extended  nevertheless a limit was marked out beyond which olaf was forbidden to take him and experience had proved that olaf was a trustworthy boy  it must be remembered here that although he had grown apace during these two years olaf was himself but a small boy with the clustering golden curls and the red chubby cheeks with which he had left greenland  as we have said then snorro resolved to have a walk one fine spring morning of the year one thousand and tenor thereabouts  in the furtherance of his design he staggered across the hall where gudrid had left him for those fatal few minutes during which children of all ages and climes have invariably availed themselves of their opportunity coming to a serious impediment in the shape of the doorstep he paused plucked up heart and tumbled over it into the road  gathering himself up he staggered onward through the village shouting his usual cryoaf  oaf  oaf  ooo with his wonted vigour  but oaf was deaf to the touching appeal  he chanced to have gone away that morning with biarne and hake to visit a beartrap  a little black bear had been found in it crushed and dead beneath the heavy tree that formed the drop of the trap  this bear had been slung on a pole between the two men and the party were returning home in triumph at the time that snorro set up his cry but they were not quite within earshot  finding that his cries were not attended to snorro staggered out of the village into the forest a short way and there standing in the middle of the path began againoaf  oaf  oaf  ooo  still there was no reply therefore snorro stirred by the blood which had descended to him through a long line of illustrious and warlike seakings lost his temper stamped his feet and screeched with passion  nothing resulting he changed his mood shouted oaf once more in heartrending accents andwith his eyes halfshut and mouth wide open his arms and hands helplessly pendent his legs astraddle and his whole aspect what is expressively styled in the norse tongue begruttenhowled in abject despair  in this condition he was found by the bear party not many minutes later and in another moment he was sobbing out his heart and sorrows into the sympathetic bosom of his dearlyloved friend  what is it snorrie  whats the matter inquired olaf tenderly  hikmehupowanthifwak replied the sobbing child  it wants to walk does it  so it shall my bold little man  there dry its eyes and get on my back hupnow away we go  ill be back soon he said to biarne who stood laughing at them  be sure that you keep the claws of the bear for menow snorrie off and away hurrah  hooah echoed snorro as holding tight with both his fat arms round olafs neck he was borne away into the wilderness  olafs usual mode of proceeding was as follows  first he dashed along the track of the woodcutters for about half a mile  it was a good broad track which at first had been cleared by the axe and afterwards well beaten by the constant passage of men and horses with heavy loads of timber  then he stopped and set snorro on his legs and going down on his knees before him laughed in his face you may be sure that snorro returned the laugh with right goodwill  whereaway next snorrie  away away shouted the child throwing up his arms losing his balance and falling plumpin sedentary fashion  ay anywhere you please that means no doubt up to the sun or moon if possible  but come it must walk a bit now  give me its hand old man  snorro was obedient to olafand reader that was an amazing triumph of love for to no one else not even to his mother did he accord obedience  he quietly took his guides hand trotted along by his side and listened wonderingly while he chatted of trees and flowers and birds and squirrels and wild beasts just as if he understood every word that olaf said  but snorros obedience was not perfect  olafs pace being regulated by his spirits snorro soon began to pant and suddenly pulled up with a violent top  ho is it tired cried olaf seizing him and throwing him over his shoulder into the old position  well then off we go again  he not only went off at a run but he went off the track also at this point and struck across country straight through the woods in the direction of a certain ridge which was the limit beyond which he was forbidden to go  it was an elevated ridge which commanded a fine view of the surrounding country being higher than the treetops and was a favourite resort of olaf when he went out to ramble with snorro  beyond it lay a land that was unknown to olaf because that part of the forest was so dense that even the men avoided it in their expeditions and selected more open and easier routes  olaf who was only allowed to accompany the men on short excursions had never gone beyond the ridge in that direction  he longed to do so however and many a time had he while playing with snorro on the ridge gazed with ever increasing curiosity into the deep shades beyond and wondered what was there  to gaze at a forbidden object is dangerous  we have already said that olaf was a trustworthy boy but he was not immaculate  he not only sometimes wished to have his own way but now and then took it  on this particular occasion he gave way alas to temptation  snorro said he after sitting under a tree for a considerable time basking in the checkered sunshine with the child beside him snorro why should not you and i have a peep into that dark forest  eh said snorro who understood him not  it would be great fun pursued olaf  the shade would be so pleasant in a hot day like this and we would not go far  what does it think  ho said snorro who thought and cared nothing at all about it for he happened to be engaged just then in crushing a quantity of wildflowers in his fat hands  i see it is not inclined to talk much today  well come get on my back and we shall have just one peepjust one run into itand then out again  error number one  smelling forbidden fruit is the sure prelude to the eating of it  he took the child on his back descended the hill and entered the thick forest  the scene that met his gaze was indeed well calculated to delight a romantic boy  he found that the part of the woods immediately around him consisted of tall straight trees with thick umbrageous tops the stems of which seemed like pillars supporting a vast roof and through between these stems he could see a vista of smaller stems which appeared absolutely endless  there was no grass on the ground but a species of soft moss into which he sank ankledeep yet not so deep as to render walking difficult  in one direction the distance looked intensely blue in another it was almost black while just before him a long way off there was a bright sunny spot with what appeared to be the glittering waters of a pond in the midst of it  the whole scene was both beautiful and strange to olaf and would have filled him with intense delight if he could only have got rid of that uncomfortable feeling about its being forbidden ground  however having fairly got into the scrape he thought he might as well go through with it  error number two  having become impressed with the fact that he had sinned he ought to have turned back at once  in for a penny in for a pound is about the worst motto that ever was invented  interpreted it means having done a little mischief ill shut my eyes and go crashing into all iniquity  as well might one say having burnt my finger ill shove my whole body into the fire  but olaf did not take time to think  he pushed boldly forward in the direction of the lake  as he drew near he found the moss becoming softer and deeper besides being rather wet  going a few steps further he found that it changed into a swamp  ho  snorrie this is dangerous ground he said turning back well take a roundabout and try to get to the lake by a drier way  he did so but the more he diverged towards dry ground the more did the swamp force him to one side until it compelled him to go out of sight of the pond altogether  now isnt that vexin he said looking about him  iss replied snorro who was becoming sleepy and had laid his head on his friends shoulder  well as we cant get to the lake and as this is rather a wild place well just turn back now and get out of it as fast as we can  iss murmured snorro with a deep sigh  olaf turned back and made for the edge of the wood  he was so long of coming to it that he began to be somewhat surprised and looked about him a little more carefully but the tall straight stems were all so much alike that they afforded him no clue to his way out of the wood young though he was olaf knew enough of woodcraft to be able to steer his course by the sun but the sky had become clouded and the direction of the sun could not be ascertained through the dense foliage overhead he now became seriously alarmed  his heart beat against his ribs as if it wanted to get out and he started off at a run in the direction in which he felt sure the ridge lay  becoming tired and still more alarmed he changed his course eagerly advanced for a short time hesitated changed his course again and finally stopped altogether as the terrible fact flashed upon him that he was really lost in the woods he set snorro on the ground and sitting down beside him burst into tears  we need scarcely say that poor olaf was neither a timid nor an effeminate boy  it was not for himself that he thus gave way  it was the sudden opening of his eyes to the terrible consequences of his disobedience that unmanned him  his quick mind perceived at once that little snorro would soon die of cold and hunger if he failed to find his way out of that wilderness and when he thought of this and of the awful misery that would thus descend on the heads of karlsefin and gudrid he felt a strange desire that he himself might die there and then  this state of mind however did not last long  he soon dried his eyes and braced himself up for another effort  snorro had gone to sleep the instant he was laid on the ground  as his luckless guide raised him he opened his eyes slightly murmured oaf and again went off to the land of nod  olaf now made a more steady and persevering effort to get out of the wood and he was so far successful that he came to ground that was more open and brokenmore like to that through which he had been accustomed to travel with the men  this encouraged him greatly for although he did not recognise any part of it he believed that he must now be at all events not far distant from places that he knew  here he again looked for the sun but the sky had become so thickly overcast that he could not make out its position  laying snorro down he climbed a tall tree but the prospect of interminable forest which he beheld from that point of vantage did not afford him any clue to his locality  he looked for the ridge but there were many ridges in view any of which might have been his ridge but none of which looked precisely like it  nevertheless the upward bound which his spirits had taken when he came to the more open country did not altogether subside  he still wandered on manfully in the hope that he was gradually nearing home  at last evening approached and the light began to fade away  olaf was now convinced that he should have to spend the night in the forest  he therefore wisely resolved while it was yet day to search for a suitable place whereon to encamp instead of struggling on till he could go no farther  fortunately the weather was warm at the time  ere long he found a small hollow in a sandbank which was perfectly dry and thickly overhung with shrubs  into this he crept and carefully laid down his slumbering charge  then going out he collected a large quantity of leaves  with these he made a couch on which he laid snorro and covered him well over  lying down beside him he drew as close to the child as he could placed his little head on his breast to keep it warm laid his own curly pate on a piece of turf and almost instantly fell into a profound slumber  the sun was up and the birds were singing long before that slumber was broken  when at last olaf and his little charge awoke they yawned several times and stretched themselves vigorously opened their eyes with difficulty and began to look round with some halfformed notions as to breakfast  olaf was first to observe that the roof above him was a confused mass of earth and roots instead of the customary plank ceiling and crossbeams of home  where am i he murmured lazily yet with a look of sleepy curiosity  he was evidently puzzled and there is no saying how long he might have lain in that condition had not a very small contented voice close beside him replied  yous here oaf an sos me  olaf raised himself quickly on his elbow and looking down observed snorros large eyes gazing from out a forest of leaves in quiet satisfaction  isnt it nice continued snorro  nice exclaimed olaf in a voice of despair when the whole truth in regard to their lost condition was thus brought suddenly to his mind nice  no snorrie my little man it isnt nice  its dreadful its awful  itsbut come i must not give way like a big baby as i did yesterday  we are lost snorrie lost in the woods  lost  whats lost asked snorro sitting up and gazing into his friends face with an anxious expressionnot of course in consequence of being lost which he did not understand but because of olafs woeful countenance  oh you cant understand it snorrie and after all im a stupid fellow to alarm you for that can do no good  come my mannie you and i are going to wander about in the woods today a great long way and try to get home so let me shake the leaves off you  there now we shall start  dat great fun cried snorro with sparkling eyes but oaf me want mik  milkeh  well to be sure but  olaf stopped abruptly not only because he was greatly perplexed about the matter of breakfast thus suggested to him but because he chanced at that moment to look towards the leafy entrance of the cave and there beheld a pair of large black eyes glaring at him  to say that poor olafs heart gave a violent leap and then apparently ceased to beat altogether while the blood fled from his visage is not to say anything disparaging to his courage  whether you be boy or man reader we suspect that if you had in similar circumstances beheld such a pair of eyes you might have been troubled with somewhat similar emotions  cowardice lies not in the susceptibility of the nervous system to a shock but in giving way to that shock so as to become unfit for proper action or selfdefence  if olaf had been a coward he would forgetting all else have attempted to fly or that being impossible would have shrunk into the innermost recesses of the cave  not being a coward his first impulse was to start to his feet and face the pair of eyes his second to put his left arm round snorro and still keeping his white face steadily turned to the foe to draw the child close to his side  this act and the direction in which olaf gazed caused snorro to glance towards the caves mouth where he no sooner beheld the apparition than shutting his own eyes tight and opening his mouth wide he gave vent to a series of yells that might have terrified the wildest beast in the forest  it did not however terrify the owner of the eyes for the bushes were instantly thrust aside and next instant snorros mouth was violently stopped by the black hand of a savage  seeing this olafs blood returned to its ordinary channels with a rush he seized a thick branch that lay on the ground and dealt the savage a whack on the bridge of his nose that changed it almost immediately from a snub into a superb roman  for this he received a buffet on the ear that raised a brilliant constellation in his brain and laid him flat on the ground  rising with difficulty he was met with a shower of language from the savage in a voice which partook equally of the tones of remonstrance and abuse but olaf made no reply chiefly because not understanding what was said he could not  seeing this plainly indicated on his face the savage stopped speaking and gave him a box on the other ear by way of interpreting what he had said  it was not quite so violent as the first and only staggered olaf besides lighting up a few faint stars very soon little snorro became silent from the combined effects of exhaustive squeezes and horror  having thus promptly brought matters to what he seemed to consider a satisfactory condition the savage wiping his roman nose which had bled a little threw snorro over his shoulder and seizing olaf by the collar of his coat so as to thrust him on in advance left the cavern with rapid strides  words cannot describe the condition of poor olafs mind as he was thus forced violently along through the forest he knew not whither  fearful thoughts went flashing swiftly through his brain  that the savage would take him and snorro to his home wherever that might be and kill roast and eat him was one of the mildest of these thoughts  he reflected that the hatred of the savage towards him must be very intense in consequence of his recent treatment of his nose and that the pain of that feature would infallibly keep his hatred for a long time at the boilingpoint so that in addition to the roasting and eating referred to he had every reason to expect in his own case the addition of a little extra torture  then he thought of the fact that little snorro would never more behold his mother and the torture of mind resulting from this reflection is only comparable to the roasting of the body but the worst thought of all was that the dreadful pass to which he and snorro had come was the consequence of his own wilful disobedience  the anguish of spirit that filled him when he reflected on this was such that it caused him almost to forget the pain caused by savage knuckles in his neck and savage prospects in the future  oh how he longed for a knife  with what fearful gloating did he contemplate the exact spot in the savage groin into which he would have plunged it until the haft should have disappeared  and this not so much from a feeling of revengethough that was bad enoughas from an intense desire to rescue snorro ere it should be too late  several times he thought of a final dying effort at a handtohand struggle with his captor but the power of the grip on the back of his neck induced him to abandon that idea in despair  then he thought of a sudden wrench and a desperate flight but as that implied the leaving of snorro to his fate he abandoned that idea too in disdain  suddenly however he recurred to it reflecting that if he could only manage to make his own escape he might perhaps find his way back to the settlement give the alarm and lead his friends to snorros rescue the power of this thought was so strong upon him that he suddenly stooped and gave his active body a twist which he considered absolutely awful for strength but much to his astonishment did not find himself free  on the contrary he received such a shake accompanied by such a kick that from that moment he felt all hope to be gone  thus they proceeded through the woods and out upon an open space beyond and over a variety of ridges and down into a number of hollows and again through several forests not unlike the first until poor olaf began to wonder whether they had not passed the boundaries of the world altogether and got into another region beyonduntil his legs sturdy though they were began to give way beneath himuntil the noonday sun shone perpendicularly down through the trees and felt as if it were burning up his brain  then they came to a rivulet on the banks of which were seen several tents of a conical form made of skins from the tops of which smoke was issuing  no sooner did the savage come in sight of these tents than he uttered a low peculiar cry  it was responded to and immediately a band of halfnaked savages like himself advanced to meet him  there was much gesticulation and loud excited talking and a great deal of pointing to the two captives with looks expressive of surprise and delight but not a word could olaf understand and the gestures were not definite in their expression  when snorro was placed sittingwise on the groundnearly half dead with fatigue alarm and hungerhe crept towards olaf hid his face in his breast and sobbed  then did olafs conscience wake up afresh and stab him with a degree of vigour that was absolutely awfulfor olafs conscience was a tender one and it is a strange almost paradoxical fact that the tenderer a conscience is the more wrathfully does it stab and lacerate the heart of its owner when he has done wrong  there was however no uncertainty as to the disposition of the savages when after a thorough inspection of the children they took them to the tents and set before them some boiled fish and roast venison  need we remark that for the time olaf and snorro forgot their sorrow it would scarcely be an exaggeration to say that snorro was as ravenous as any wolf in vinland  from the day of his birth that wellcaredfor child had four times a day received regular nutriment in the form of milk bread eggs and other substances and never once had he been permitted to experience the pangs of hunger though the intimations thereof were familiar  no wonder then that after an evening a night and half a day of abstinence he looked with a longing gaze on victuals and when opportunity offered devoured them desperately  olaf though trained a little in endurance was scarcely less energetic for his appetite was keen and his fast had been unusually prolonged  when they had eaten as much as they couldto the delight of the natives excepting of course the man with the temporary roman nose they were ordered by signals which even snorro understood to remain still and behave themselves  thereafter the natives struck their tents packed up their goods and chattels embarked in sixteen large canoes and descended the rivulet a hundred yards or so to the spot where it flowed into a large river  here they turned the canoes upstream and silently but swiftly paddled away into the interior of the land    chapter eighteen  anxious timesa search organised and vigorously carried out  it is not easy to conceive the state of alarm that prevailed in the settlement of the norsemen when it came to be known that little snorro and olaf were lost  the terrible fact did not of course break on them all at once  for some hours after the two adventurers had left home dame gudrid went briskly about her household avocations humming tunefully one of her native icelandic airs and thinking no doubt of snorro  astrid assisted by bertha went about the dairy operations gossiping of small matters in a pleasant way and among other things providing snorros allowance of milk  thora busied herself in the preparation of snorros little bed and freydissa whose stern nature was always softened by the sight of the child constructed with elaborate care a little coat for snorros body  thus snorros interests were being tenderly cared for until the gradual descent of the sun induced the remark that olaf must surely have taken a longer walk than usual that day  i must go and meet them said gudrid becoming for the first time uneasy  let me go with you said bertha  come child returned gudrid  in passing the spot where the little bear had been cut up and skinned they saw hake standing with biarne  did you say that olaf took the track of the woodcutters asked gudrid  ay that was their road at starting answered biarne  are they not later than usual  a little  we go to meet them  tell olaf that i have kept the bears claws for him said biarne  the two women proceeded a considerable distance along the woodcutters track chatting as they went on various subjects but not meeting the children they became alarmed and walked on in silence  suddenly gudrid stopped  bertha said she let us not waste time  if the dear children have strayed a little out of the right road it is of the utmost importance to send men to search and shout for them before it begins to darken come we will return  being more alarmed than she liked to confess even to herself gudrid at once walked rapidly homewards and on approaching the huts quickened her pace to a run  quick swend hake biarne she cried the children must have lost their wayhaste you to search for them before the sun goes down  shout as ye go  it will be ill to find them after dark and if they have to spend the night in the woods i fear me they will  dont fear anything gudrid said biarne kindly  we will make all haste and doubtless shall find them rambling in the thickets near at handgo hake find karlsefin and tell him that i will begin the search at once with swend while he gets together a few men  cheered by biarnes hearty manner gudrid was a little comforted and returned to the house to complete her preparation of snorros supper while hake gave the alarm to karlsefin who accompanied by leif and a body of men at once went off to scour the woods in every direction  of course they searched in vain for their attention was at first directed to the woods near home in which it was naturally enough supposed that olaf might have lost his way in returning  not finding them there karlsefin became thoroughly alive to the extreme urgency of the case and the necessity for a thorough and extended plan of search  come hither hake said he  this may be a longer business than we thought for  run back to the huts call out all the men except the homeguards  let them come prepared for a night in the woods each man with a torch and one meal in his pouch at least  besides portions for the twenty men already out suggested hake  right right lad and tell them to meet me at the pine ridgeaway if ever thy legs rivalled the wind let them do so now  hake sprang off at a pace which appeared satisfactory even to the anxious father  in half an hour karlsefin was joined at the pine ridge by all the available strength of the colony and there he organised and despatched parties in all directions appointing the localities they were to traverse the limits of their search and the time and place for the next rendezvous  this last was to be on the identical ridge whence poor olaf had taken his departure into the unknown land  karlsefin knew well that it was his favourite haunt and intended to search carefully up to it never dreaming that the boy would go beyond it after the strict injunctions he had received not to do so and the promises he had made  im not so sure as you seem to be that olaf has not gone beyond the ridge observed leif to karlsefin after the men had left them  why not asked the latter  he is a most trustworthy boy  i know itwho should know it so well as his own father returned leif but he is very young  i have known him give way to temptation once or twice before now  he may have done it again  i trust not said karlsefin but come let us make direct for the ridge while the others continue the search we can soon ascertain whether he has wandered beyond it  i know his favourite tree doubtless his footsteps will guide us  already it had begun to grow dark so that when they reached the ridge it was necessary to kindle the torches before anything could be ascertained  here are the footsteps cried karlsefin after a brief search  leif who was searching in another direction hurried towards his friend torch in hand  see there is olafs footprint on that soft ground said karlsefin moving slowly along with the torch held low but there is no sign of snorros little feet  olaf always carried himyetah here they are on this patch of sand look  they had halted hereprobably to rest perhaps to change snorros position  ive lost them againno here they are but only olafs  he must have lifted the child again no doubt  look here cried leif who had again strayed a little from his friend are not these footsteps descending the ridge  karlsefin hastily examined them  they are he cried and then they go down towards the wooday into it  without doubt olaf has broken his promise but let us make sure  a careful investigation convinced both parents that the children had entered that part of the forest and that therefore all search in any other direction was useless  karlsefin immediately reascended the ridge and putting both hands to his mouth gave the peculiar halloo which had been agreed upon as the signal that some of the searchers had either found the children or fallen upon their tracks  youll have to give them another shout said leif  karlsefin did so and immediately after a faint and very distant halloo came back in reply  thats biarne observed karlsefin as they stood listening intently hist there is another  a third and fourth halloo followed quickly showing that the signal had been heard by all and in a very short time the searchers came hurrying to the rendezvous one after another  have you found them was of course the first eager question of each followed by a falling of the countenance when the reply no was given but there was a rising of hope again when it was pointed out that they must certainly be in some part of the tract of dense woodland just in front of them  there were some there howeverand these were the most experienced woodsmenwho shook their heads mentally when they gazed at the vast wilderness which in the deepening gloom looked intensely black and the depths of which they knew must be as dark as erebus at that hour  still no one expressed desponding feelings but each spoke cheerfully and agreed at once to the proposed arrangement of continuing the search all night by torchlight  when the plan of search had been arranged and another rendezvous fixed the various parties went out and searched the livelong night in every copse and dell in every bush and brake and on every ridge and knoll that seemed the least likely to have been selected by the lost little ones as a place of shelter  but the forest was wide  a party of ten times their number would have found it absolutely impossible to avoid passing many a dell and copse and height and hollow unawares  thus it came to pass that although they were once or twice pretty near the cave where the children were sleeping they did not find it  moreover the ground in places was very hard so that although they more than once discovered faint tracks they invariably lost them again in a few minutes  they shouted lustily too as they went along but to two such sleepers as olaf and snorro in their exhausted condition their wildest shouts were but as the whisperings of a sick mosquito  gradually the searchers wandered farther and farther away from the spot until they were out of sight and hearing  we say sight and hearing because though the children were capable of neither at that time there was in that wood an individual who was particularly sharp in regard to both  this was a scout of a party of natives who chanced to be travelling in that neighbourhood at the time the manwho had a reddishbrown body partially clad in a deerskin glittering black eyes and very stiff wiry black hair besides uncommonly strong and long white teeth in excellent orderchanced to have taken up his quarters for the night under a tree on the top of a knoll  when in the course of his slumbers he became aware of the fact that a body of men were going about the woods with flaring torches and shouting like maniacs he awoke not with a start or any such ridiculous exclamation as ho  ha or hist but with the mild operation of opening his saucerlike eyes until they were at their widest  no evil resulting from this cautious course of action he ventured to raise his head an inch off the groundwhich was his rather extensive pillowthen another inch and another until he found himself resting on his elbow and craning his neck over a low bush  being almost black and quite noiseless he might have been mistaken for a slowlymoving shadow  gradually he gained his knees then his feet and then peering into space he observed biarne and krake with several others ascending the knoll  for the shadow to sink again to its knees slope to its elbows recline on its face and glide into the heart of a thick bush and disappear did not seem at all difficult or unnatural  at any rate that is what it did and there it remained observing all that passed  ho hallo  olaf  snorro hiii shouted biarne on reaching the summit of the knoll  hooroo yelled krake in a tone that must have induced the shadow to take him for a halfbrother  nothing here said biarne holding up the torch and peering round in all directions  nothing whatever responded krake  he little knew at the time that the shadow was displaying his teeth and loosening in its sheath a long knife or dagger made of bone which from the spot where he lay he could have launched with unerring certainty into the heart of any of those who stood before him  it is well for man that he sometimes does not know what might be  after a brief inspection of the knoll and another shout or two they descended again into the brake and pushed on  the shadow rose and followed until he reached a height whence he could see that the torchbearers had wandered far away to the westward  as the friends and relatives for whom he acted the part of scout were encamped away to the eastward he returned to his tree and continued his nap till daybreak when he arose and shook himself yawned and scratched his head evidently he pondered the occurrences of the night and felt convinced that if so many strange men went about looking for something with so much care and anxiety it must undoubtedly be something that was worth looking for  acting on this idea he began to look  now it must be wellknown to most people that savages are rather smart fellows at making observations on things in general and drawing conclusions therefrom  the shouts led him to believe that lost human beings were being sought for  daylight enabled him to see little feet which darkness had concealed from the norsemen whence he concluded that children were being sought for  following out his clue with that singular power of following a trail for which savages are noted he came to the cave and peered through the bushes with his great eyes pounced upon the sleepers and had his pug nose converted into a romanall as related in the last chapter  sometime after sunrise the various searching parties assembled at the place of rendezvousfagged dispirited and hungry  come said karlsefin who would not permit his feelings to influence his conduct we must not allow ourselves to despond at little more than the beginning of our search  we will breakfast here lads and then return to the ridge where we first saw their footsteps  daylight will enable us to track them more easily  thank god the weather is warm and i daresay if they kept well under cover of the trees the dear children may have got no harm from exposure  they have not been fasting very long solet us to work  leif and biarne both fell in with karlsefins humour and cheered the spirits of the men by their tone and example so that when the hurried meal was finished they felt much refreshed and ready to begin the work of another day  it was past noon before they returned to the ridge and began the renewed search  daylight now enabled them to trace the little footsteps with more certainty and towards the afternoon they came to the cave where the children had slept  here have they spent the night said leif with breathless interest as he and karlsefin examined every corner of the place  but they are gone returned the other and it behoves us to waste no time  go biarne let the men spread outstayis not this the foot of a man who wears a shoe somewhat different from ours  tis a savage said biarne in a tone of great anxiety  karlsefin made no reply and the party being now concentrated they followed eagerly on finding the prints of the feet quite plain in many places  unquestionably they have been captured by a savage said leif  ay and he must have taken snorro on his shoulder and made poor olaf walk alongside observed biarne  following the trail with the perseverance and certainty of bloodhounds they at last came to the deserted encampment on the banks of the rivulet  that it had been forsaken only a short time before was apparent from the circumstance of the embers of the fires still smoking they examined the place closely and found the little footmarks of the children which were quite distinguishable from those of the native children by the difference in the form of the shoes  soon they came to marks on the bank of the stream which indicated unmistakeably that canoes had been launched there  and now for the first time the countenances of leif and karlsefin fell  you think there is no hope asked the latter  i wont say that replied leif but we know not what course they have taken and we cannot follow them on foot  true observed karlsefin in bitter despondency  the case is not so bad observed heika stepping forward at this point  you know we have a number of canoes captured from the savages some of us have become somewhat expert in the management of these  let a few of us go back and fetch them hither on our shoulders with provisions for a long journey and we shall soon be in a position to give chase  they cannot have gone far yet and we shall be sure to overtake them for what we lack in experience shall be more than made up by the strength of our arms and wills  thou art a good counsellor heika said karlsefin with a sad smile i will follow that advice  go thou and hake back to the huts as fast as may be and order the homeguard to make all needful preparation some of us will follow in thy steps more leisurely and others will remain here to rest until you return with the canoes  thus directed the brothers turned their powers of speed to good account so that when some of their comrades returned footsore and jaded for want of rest they not only found that everything was ready for a start but that a good meal had been prepared for them  while these remained in the settlement to rest and protect it the homeguards were ordered to get ready for immediate service  before night had closed in the brothers with torches in their hands headed a party of fresh men carrying three canoes and provisions on their shoulders  they reached the encampment again in the early morning and by daybreak all was ready for a start  karlsefin thorward and heika acted as steersmen krake tyrker and hake filled the important posts of bowmen  besides these there were six men in each canoe so that the entire party numbered twentyfour strong men fully armed with bow and arrow sword and shield and provisioned for a lengthened voyage  farewell friends said karlsefin to those who stood on the banks of the little stream  it may be that we shall never return from this enterprise  you may rest assured that we will either rescue the children or perish in the attempt  leif and biarne have agreed to remain in charge of the settlement  they are good men and true and well able to guide and advise you  tell gudrid that my last thoughts shall be of herif i do not return  but i do not anticipate failure for the god of the christians is with usfarewell  farewell responded the norsemen on the bank waving their hands as the canoes shot out into the stream  in a few minutes they reached the great river and turning upstream were soon lost to view in the depths of the wide wilderness    chapter nineteen  new experiencesdifficulties encountered and overcomethorward and tyrker make a joint effort with humbling results  it may be as well to remark here that the norsemen were not altogether ignorant of the course of the great river on which they had now embarked  during their sojourn in those regions they had as we have said sent out many exploring parties and were pretty well acquainted with the nature of the country within fifty miles or so in all directions  these expeditions however had been conducted chiefly on land only one of them by water  that one consisted of a solitary canoe manned by four men of whom heika was steersman while hake managed the bowpaddle these having proved themselves of all the party the most apt to learn the use of the paddle and management of the canoe  during the fight with the savages recorded in a previous chapter the brothers had observed that the man who sat in the bow was of quite as much importance in regard to steering as he who sat in the stern and when they afterwards ascended the river and found it necessary to shoot hither and thither amongst the surges crosscurrents and eddies of a rapid they then discovered that simple steering at one end of their frail bark would not suffice but that it was necessary to steer as it were at both ends  sometimes in order to avoid a stone or a dangerous whirlpool or a violent shoot it became necessary to turn the canoe almost on its centre as on a pivot or at least within its own length and in order to accomplish this the steersman had to dip his paddle as far out to one side as possible to draw the stern in that direction while the bowman did the same on the opposite side and drew the bow the other waythus causing the light craft to spin round almost instantly  the two guiding men thus acted in unison and it was only by thoroughly understanding each other in all conceivable situations that good and safe steering could be achieved  the canoes which had been captured from the savages were frail barks in the most literal sense of these words  they were made of the bark of the birchtree a substance which though tough was very easily split insomuch that a single touch upon a stone was sufficient to cause a bad leak  hence the utmost care was required in their navigation  but although thus easily damaged they were also easily repaired the materials for reparationor even if necessary reconstructionbeing always at hand in the forest  now although heika and his brother were as we have said remarkably expert it does not follow that those were equally so who managed the other two canoes of the expedition  on the contrary their experience in canoeing had hitherto been slight  karlsefin and his bowman krake were indeed tolerably expert having practised a good deal with the scottish brothers but thorward turned out to be an uncommonly bad canoeman nevertheless with the selfconfidence natural to a good seaman and one who was expert with the oar he scouted the idea that anything connected with freshwater voyaging could prove difficult to him and resolutely claimed and took his position as one of the steersmen of the expedition  his bowman tyrker as ill luck would have it turned out to be the worst man of them all in rough water although he had shown himself sufficiently good on the smooth lake to induce the belief that he might do well enough  but their various powers in this respect were not at first put to the test because for a very long way the river was uninterrupted by rapids and progress was therefore comparatively easy  the scenery through which they passed was rich and varied in the extreme  at one part the river ran between high banks which were covered to the waters edge with trees and bushes of different kinds many of them being exceedingly brilliant in colour  at another part the banks were lower with level spaces like lawns and here and there little openings where rivulets joined the river their beds affording farreaching glimpses of woodland in which deer might occasionally be seen gambolling elsewhere the river widened occasionally into something like a lake with wooded islets on its calm surface while everywhere the water earth and air teemed with animal lifefish flesh fowl and insect it was such a sight of gods beautiful earth as may still be witnessed by those who leaving the civilised world behind plunge into the vast wildernesses that exist to this day in north america  beautiful though it was however the norsemen had small leisure and not much capacity to admire it being preoccupied and oppressed by anxiety as to the fate of the children  still in spite of this a burst of admiration would escape them ever and anon as they passed rapidly along  the first night they came to the spot where the natives had encamped the night before and all hands were very sanguine of overtaking them quickly  they went about the encampment examining everything stirring up the embers of the fires which were still hot and searching for little footprints  hakes unerring bow had supplied the party with fresh venison and some wildgeese  while they sat over the fires that night roasting steaks and enjoying marrowbones they discussed their prospects  they have got but a short start of us said karlsefin looking thoughtfully into the fire before which he reclined on a couch of pinebranches and if we push on with vigour giving ourselves only just sufficient repose to keep up our strength we shall be sure to overtake them in a day or two  it may be so said thorward with a doubtful shake of the head but you know brother that a stern chase is usually a long one  thorward was one of those unfortunate men who get the credit of desiring to throw wet blankets and cold water upon everything whereas poor man his only fault was a tendency to view things critically so as to avoid the evil consequences of acting on the impulse of an oversanguine temperament  thorward was a safe adviser but was not a pleasant one to those who regard all objection as opposition and who dont like to look difficulties full in the face  however there is no question that it would have been better for him sometimes if he had been gifted with the power of holding his tongue  his friend karlsefin however fully appreciated and understood him  true said he with a quiet smile as you say a stern chase is a long one nevertheless we are not far astern and that is what i count on for shortening the chase  that is a just remark said thorward gravely applying a marrowbone to his lips and drinking the semiliquid fat therefrom as if from a cup but i think you might make it this is most excellent marrow a still shorter chase if you would take my adviceho  krake hand me another marrowbone  it seems to me that vinland deer have a peculiar sweetness which is not so obvious in those of norway though perchance it is hunger which gives the relish and yet can i truly say that i have been hungered in norway  however i care not to investigate reasons too closely while i am engaged in the actual practice of consumption  here he put another marrowbone to his lips and sucked out the contents with infinite gusto  and what may your advice be asked his friend laughing  ill wager that hake could tell you if his mouth were not too full replied thorward with a smile  say thou thrall before refilling that capacious cavern what had best be done in order to increase our speed  hake checked a piece of wildfowl on its passage to his mouth and after a moments consideration replied that in his opinion lightening the load of the canoe was the best thing to be done  and say continued thorward beginning to eat a large drumstick how may that be done  by leaving our provisions behind answered hake  ha did not i say that he could tell you growled thorward between his teeth which were at that moment conflicting with the sinewy part of the drumstick  there is something in that remarked karlsefin  something in it exclaimed thorward resting for a moment from his labours in order to wash all down with a cataract of water why there is everything in it  who ever heard of a man running a race with a full stomachmuch less winning it  if we would win we must voyage light besides what need is there to carry salt salmon and dried flesh with us when the woods are swarming with such as these and when we have a man in our company who can bring down a magpie on the wing  and thats true if anything ever was observed krake who had been too busy up to that point to do more than listen  hake nodded his approval of the sentiment and karlsefin said that he quite agreed with it and would act upon the advice next day  just take a very little salmon suggested tyrker with a sigh for fear this good fortune should perhaps come suddenly to an end  there was a general laugh at tyrkers caution and karlsefin said he was at liberty to fill his own pockets with salmon for his own use if he chose  sure it would be much better cried krake to eat a weeks allowance all at once and so save time and trouble  if i had your stomach krake i might try that retorted tyrker but mine is not big enough  well now returned krake if you only continue to overeat for a week or two as youre doing just now youll find it big enoughand more  we must sleep tonight and not talk said karlsefin gravely for he saw that the dispute was likely to wax hot  come get you all to rest i will call you two hours hence  every man of the expedition was sound asleep in a few minutes after that with the exception of their leader who was to keep the first halfhour watchthorward heika and hake being appointed to relieve him and each other in succession  the moon was shining brightly when the two hours had elapsed  this was very fortunate because they expected to arrive at the rapids ere long and would require light to ascend them  owing to recent heavy rains however the current was so strong that they did not reach the rapids till sunrise  before starting they had buried all their provisions in such a way that they might be dug up and used if necessary on their return  tis as well that we have daylight here observed karlsefin as he thorward and hake stood on a rocky part of the bank just below the rapids and surveyed the place before making the attempt  it might have been observed that thorwards face expressed some unusual symptoms of feeling as he looked up the river and saw there nothing but a turbulent mass of heaving surges dashing themselves wildly against sharp forbidding rocks which at one moment were grinning like black teeth amidst the white foam and the next were overwhelmed by the swelling billows  you dont mean to say we have to go up that maelstrom he said pointing to the river and looking at hake  i would there were any other road answered hake smiling but truly i know of none  the canoes are light and might be carried by land to the still water above the rapids but as you see the banks here are sheer up and down without foothold for a crow and if we try to go round by the woods on either side we shall have a march of ten miles through such a country that the canoes will be torn to pieces before the journey is completed  have you and heika ever ascended that mad stream cried thorward  aytwice  without overturning  yeswithout overturning  again thorward bestowed on the river a long silent gaze and his countenance wore an expression of blank surprise which was so amusing that karlsefin forgot for a moment the anxiety that oppressed him and burst into a hearty fit of laughter  ye have little to laugh at said thorward gravely  it is all very well to talk of seamanshipand truly if you will give me a good boat with a stout pair of oars and the roughest sea you ever saw i will show you what i can dobut who ever heard of a man going afloat in an eggshell on a monstrous kettle of boiling water  why hake says he has done it said karlsefin  when i see him do it i will believe it replied thorward doggedly  you will not i suppose object to follow if i lead the way asked hake  go to thrall  dost think i am afraid said thorward sternly and then as if he thought such talk trifling turned on his heel with a light laugh and was about to descend the bank of the river to the spot where the men stood in a group near the canoes when karlsefin called him back  softly not so fast thorward  although no doubt we are valiant sailorsand woe betide the infatuated man who shall venture to deny ityet must we put our pride in our pouches for once and accept instruction from hake  after all it is said that wise men may learn something from babesif so why may not seakings learn from thralls unless indeed we be not up to the mark of wise men  i am all attention said thorward  this then said hake pointing to a large rock in the middle of the stream is the course you must pursue if ye would reach the upper end of the rapid in a dry skin  see you yonder rockthe largestwhere the foam breaks most fiercely as if in wrath because it cannot overleap it well that is our first restingplace  if you follow my finger closely you will see near the foot of the rapid two smaller rocks one below the other they only show now and then as the surges rise and fall but each has an eddy or a tail of smooth water below it  do you see them  i see i see cried thorward becoming interested in spite of himself but truly if thou callest that part of the river smooth and a tail i hope i may never fall into the clutches of the smooth animal to which that tail belongs  it is smooth compared with the rest continued hake and has a backdraught which will enable us to rest there a moment  you will observe that the stone above has also a tail the end of which comes quite down to the head of the tail below  well then you must make such a bold dash at the rapid that you shall reach the lower eddy  that gained the men will rest a space and breathe but not cease paddling altogether else will you be carried down again  then make a dash into the stream and paddle might and main till you reach the eddy above  you will thus have advanced about thirty yards and be in a position to make a dash for the long eddy that extends from the big rock  that is all very plain observed thorward but does it not seem to you hake that the best way to explain matters would be to go and ascend while we look on and learn a lesson through our eyes  i am ready was the youths brief reply for he was a little hurt by the seamans tone and manner  thorward is right hake said karlsefin  go take your own canoe up we will watch you from this spot and follow if all goes well  the young scot at once sprang down the bank and in a few minutes his canoe with its six men and heika steering shot out from the bank towards the rapid  all tendency to jest forsook thorward as he stood beside his friend on the cliff with compressed lips and frowning brow gazing upon the corklike vessel which danced upon the troubled waters  in a minute it was at the foot of the broken water  then heikas voice rose above the roar of the stream as he gave a shout and urged on his men  the canoe sprang into the boiling flood  it appeared to remain stationary while the men struggled might and main  tis too strong for them cried thorward becoming excited  no they advance said karlsefin in a deep earnest tone  this was true but their progress was very small  gradually they overcame the power of the stream and shot into the first eddy amid the cheers of their comrades on shore  here they waited only a moment or two and then made a dash for the second eddy  there was a shout of disappointment from the men because they swept down so fast that it seemed as if all the distance gained had been lost but suddenly the canoe was caught by the extreme tail of the eddy the downward motion of its bow was stopped it was turned straight upstream and they paddled easily towards the second rock  another brief pause was made here and then a dash was made for the eddy below the large rock  this was more easily gained but the turbulence of the water was so great that there was much more danger in crossing from one eddy to the other than there had been before  under the large rock they rested for a few minutes and then dashing out into the rapid renewed the struggle  thus yard by yard taking advantage of every available rock and eddy they surmounted the difficulty and landed at the head of the rapids where they waved their caps to their friends below  its krake that wishes he was there observed that worthy wiping the perspiration from his brow and drawing a long deep breath for the mere sight of the struggle had excited him almost as much as if he had engaged in it  tis krake that will soon be there if all goes well remarked karlsefin with a laugh as he came forward and ordered his canoe to be pushed off  i will be ready to follow but you had better go first thorward  if anything befalls you i am here to aid  well come along lads cried thorward  get into the bow tyrker and see that you do your duty like a man  much depends on youmores the pity  he added the last words in a low voice for thorward being a very selfreliant man would like to have performed all the duties himself had that been possible  shove off  they shot from the bank and made for the rapid gallantly  thorwards shout quite eclipsed that of heika on taking the rapid  truly if strength of lung could have done it he might have taken his canoe up singlehanded for he roared like a bull of bashan when tyrker missed a stroke of his paddle thereby letting the bow sweep round so that the canoe was carried back to the point whence it had started  tremendous was the roar uttered by thorward when they faced the rapid the second time and fierce was the struggle of the men when in it and anxious was tyrker to redeem his errorso anxious in fact that he missed another stroke and wellnigh fell overboard  it is said that fortune favours the brave  there was no lack of bravery in tyrkeronly lack of experience and coolnessand fortune favoured him on this occasion  if he had not missed a stroke and fallen forward his miscalculation of aqueous forces would have sent the canoe past the mark in the opposite direction from the last time but the missed stroke was the best stroke of all for it allowed the canoe to shoot into the first eddy and converted a terrific roar of wrath from thorward into a hearty cheer  resting a few moments as heika and his crew had done they then addressed themselves to the second part of the rapid  here thorward steered so well that the canoe took the stream at the proper angle but tyrker never having perceived what the right angle was and strongly impressed with the belief that the bow was pointing too much up the river made a sudden stroke on the wrong side  the canoe instantly flew not only to the tail of the eddy but right across it into the wild surges beyond where it was all but upset first to one side then to the other after which it spun round like a teetotum and was carried with fearful violence towards one of those rocky ridges which we have described as being alternately covered and uncovered by the foam  on the crest of a bulging cascade they were fortunately borne right over this ridge which next moment showed its black teeth as if grinning at the dire mischief it might have done if it had only chosen to bite next instant the canoe overturned and left the men to flounder to land while it went careering down towards the gravelly shallows below  now karlsefin had anticipated this and was prepared for it  in the first place he had caused the arms etcetera to be removed from thorwards canoe before it set out saying that he would carry them up in his canoe so that his friends might go light  then having his vessel ready and manned he at once pushed out and intercepted the other canoe before it reached the gravelly shallows where it would have been much damaged if not dashed to pieces  that is bad luck observed thorward somewhat sulkily as after swimming ashore he wrung the water from his garments  not worse than might have been expected on a first trial said karlsefin laughing  besides that rascal tyrker deceived me  had i known he was so bad you should have had krake  poor tyrker very much crestfallen kept carefully away from the party and did not hear that remark  now it is my turn continued karlsefin  if we get up safely i will send heika down to take the bow of your canoe  karlsefin as we said was somewhat more expert than most of the men in managing canoes and krake besides having had more experience than many of his fellows had once before visited and ascended this rapid  they therefore made the ascent almost as well as the scots had done  arrived at the upper end hake and heika were ordered to remove everything out of their canoe and with a full crew to run down to the aid of their friends  karlsefin himself went with them as one of the crew so that he might take the steering paddle when heika should resign it in order to act as thorwards bowman  thus manned the second attempt was crowned with success and not long afterwards the three canoes swept into a smooth reach of the river above the rapids and proceeded on their way  but a great deal of time had been lost in this way and karlsefin felt that it must be made up for by renewed diligence and protracted labour    chapter twenty  remarkable experiences of olaf and snorrothe former suffers the pangs of remorse  a camp of savages is in some respects exceedingly unattractive indeed it may truly be said to be in many respects repulsive  there are usually odours in such a camp which are repellent to the nose dishes that are disgusting to the taste sights that are disagreeable to the eyes sounds that are abhorrent to the ear and habits that are uncongenial to the feelings  nevertheless there is much in such a camp that is deeply interesting the student of nature the mental and moral philosopher the anthropologist and the philanthropistay even the cynicmight each find much food here suited to his particular tastes and powers of mental digestion  at present however we have chiefly to do good reader with that which interests you and menamely olaf and snorro who were prisoners of war in a savage camp  the camp referred to was not the small affair already described as having taken sudden flight from the rivulet which flowed into the great river where we have left the norsemen doing battle with the waters  it was the great parent of which that little camp was but an offshootthe headquarters of a whole tribe of savages who dwelt in it to the extent of many hundreds  yet it was not a fixed camp  it was a moving village of leathern tents or wigwams pitched without any regard to order on the margin of what appeared to be a small lake but which was in reality a mere widening of the great river  hither olaf and snorro were brought by their captors and immediately conveyed to the tent of the chief who was an aged and whitehaired though vigorous and strongboned savage  whitepow for such curiously enough was his name opened his eyes uncommonly wide when he saw the children of the norsemen and sitting up on the couch of furs on which he had been reclining gazed at them for about five minutes without speaking almost without winking  snorro did not appear to relish this for he crept close to olafs side and tried to turn away his eyes but found this to be impossible for a sort of fascination kept them riveted on the countenance of the aged whitepow  at last the savage chief opened his mouth as well as his eyes and spoke to the savage who had brought the children into the royal presence that worthy rapidly related the circumstances of the captureat least so it is to be presumed but no one can now tell for certainafter which whitepow turned to olaf and said something which as near as possible resembled the words  whardeekum froyoul ittlsiner  i dont understand you answered olaf humbly  whitepow repeated the words and olaf reiterated his assurance that he could make nothing of them whatever  this concluded the interview at that time and whitepow gave an order which resulted in the children being conveyed to a tent where there were several women old and young to whom they were handed over with a message which we cannot record not knowing what it was  the reception which they met with from these native women was flattering if not in all respects pleasant  first they were placed in the centre of the group and gazed at in wondering admiration  then they were seized and kissed and hugged all round the circle  then they were examined carefully all over and under as well their white skins being as much a matter of interest as their clothing  after that their fair hair was smoothed and parted by not untender hands and they were hugged againjust as two new dolls might have been by a group of sisters on first making their acquaintance  of course there was an immense deal of talking and chatting and commenting also no small amount of giggling and once or twice one of the women addressed olaf but olaf shook his head and stuck to his first assurance that their words were incomprehensible  all this was borne by the captives with wonderful equanimity because neither was old enough to be much affected by dirtiness of person or garments and both were thoroughly able to appreciate kindness  finally a stout and not badlooking young woman took possession of snorro and robbed her own offspring in order to bestow on him a very acceptable drink of milk  this last act quite reconciled him to his fate and olaf though not so easily won over was somewhat mollified by a kindly old woman who placed him at her side and set before him a dish of dried berries  when this feeding process was concluded and the first blush of novelty began to wear off the children were turned out in front of the womens tent where seated together on a bit of wood they underwent the inspection of the whole tribe old and young male and female  this was a much more trying ordeal but in about an hour an order was issued which resulted in the dispersion of every one save a few boys who were either privileged individuals or rebellious subjects for they not only came back to gaze at the children but ventured at length to carry them off to play near the banks of the river  olaf was so far reconciled to his new friends that he did not object to witness and take an interest in their games though he resolutely refused to join fearing that if he did so his little charge might be spirited away while he was not watching  at last one of the boys whose head was very small and round and whose name appeared to be powlet came forward with a little red paint and offered to apply it to olafs face  all the boys faces were we may observe more or less painted with black red white and blue colours and their heads were decorated more or less with feathers  indeed these feathers constituted with the exception of a trifling shred of leather about the loins and some feathers in their hair all the clothing they wore at that season of the year  olaf refused to be painted whereupon powlet rubbed the red paint on the point of his own nose an operation which so tickled the fancy of snorro that he burst into a hearty fit of laughter to olafs ineffable joy  thats right snorrie he cried setting the child on his knee laugh again do it heartily it will cheer us both  it am so funny oaf said snorro repeating the laugh as he looked at the native boy  observing the success of his efforts to please powlet put a spot of the red paint under each eye and snorro laughed so much at this that all the other boys came crowding round to ascertain and enjoy the joke  powlet now offered to anoint snorro in the same way but snorro objected and pointing to his protector said with a look of glee  do oaf  nothing else would have induced olaf to submit but snorros wish was law to him  he therefore consented at once and powlet dipping his finger in the red paint which he carried in the hollow of his hand drew a thick stroke from olafs forehead down to the point of his nose where he made it terminate in a large round spot  there was a tremendous shout at this not only from snorro but from all the other boys and olaf was so pleased to see snorro happy that he turned to powlet pointed to his face and nodded his head by way of inviting further decoration  powlet was an intelligent boy  he understood him at once and went on with his work a boy coming up at the moment with some white paint in his hand and another with some blue  a white diamond was immediately planted on each cheek and a blue circle under each eye with a red spot in the centre of each  so far the work was very striking and suggestive but when powlet finished off by drawing a series of blue red and white lines over olafs eyes in the forms that usually indicate astonishment added a red oval to the chin with a blue spot in the middle of it and stuck some feathers in his hair the effect was absolutely tremendous for it caused the native boys to yell with delight and snorro almost to fall off his protectors knee in a fit of juvenile hysterics  dont overdo it snorrie said olaf in some alarm  oh  oaf oo is so funny he cried again giving way to mirth till the tears ran down his cheeks  at this point a tall savage came rushing out of the chiefs tent with glaring eyes and made for the spot where the boys were assembled  they seemed to know at once what was his errand for with one consent they scattered and fled  the tall savage singled out powlet caught him punched his head and flung him into the river after which he turned and without taking any notice of the captives further than to gaze at them returned leisurely to the regal tent  meanwhile powlet came to the surface swam like an otter to the shore and clambering up the bank ran into the woods seemingly none the worse of his bath  thus left alone olaf put snorro on his back and sauntered away into the woods along the banks of the river  forgetting his ridiculous appearance he began to think of home and to feel very sad while his charge overcome with his late exertions fell asleep on his back  the longer he walked the sadder he grew and at last he groaned rather than said what shall i do  suddenly it occurred to him that as the savages appeared to be very careless about watching him he might run away  it could do no harm to try and he would not be in a much worse position than when lost in the woods before  under the influence of this thought he stopped and looked cautiously round in all directions  no one was to be seen  he breathed hard turned off the track on tiptoe until he had got into what appeared to him to be a very dense and sequestered part of the woods then suddenly took to his heels and ran for his life  a loud laugh sounded in the bushes in front of him and he stopped short just as powlet appeared wagging his small head and laughing inordinately  poor olaf guessed at once that the boy had been set to watch him he therefore wheeled about and walked back to the river where going out on a spit of land that he might not be overheard he sat down on the ground and communed bitterly with himself  oh why why did i break my promise he murmured in deep despondency  after a long silence he began to think aloud  it all comes of disobedience he muttered  father used to say if you love me obey me  if you want to prove that you love gudrid obey her  thats it olaf  its there that the sin lies  he told me never to pass the ridge and i did pass the ridge even though i had promised not to and so owing to that little bit of disobedience here you are olafand snorrie toopoor snorrie and were likely to remain here for ever as far as i can see  oh that i had not done it  but what good can wishing do now  if i had loved father better perhaps i would have obeyed him better  it would almost seem as if olaf had heard of such a word as thisif ye love me keep my commandments  after a few minutes he broke forth againyes i know that i did not intend to disobey nevertheless i did it  and i did not think such awful things would followbut that does not mend the matter  what shall i do  snorrie i think i could gladly lay down my life if i could give you back once more to your mother  snorro heard not the remark  he was as sound as a top and olaf looked sadly at the little head that lay on his shoulder  then it struck him that it was high time to have the child put to bed so he rose and hurried back to the womens tent where he was received with as much kindness as before  very soon snorros little head reposed upon a pillow of rabbitskins and not long after that olaf went to rest beside him on a deerskin couch where lying on his back he could see the sky through the hole in the top of the tent whence the smoke of the fire escaped  as he lay there the burden of his thoughts was ever the sameoh why did i do it  why did i disobey  thus the poor boy lay selfcondemned and gazed upwards and pondered until sweet sleep came and carried heart and brain to the blessed refuge of oblivion    chapter twenty one  reinforcements sent off to karlsefinfoes discovered in the woodsa night attack and other warlike matters  we must return now for a little to the settlement of the norsemen which by the way had by this time come to be called by the name of leifsgaard  here from thorwards house there issued tones which indicated the existence of what is popularly known as a breeze  human breezes are usually irregular and blow after the manner of countercurrents but in thorwards habitation the breezes almost invariably blew in one direction and always issued from the lungs of freydissa who possessed a peculiar knack of keeping and enjoying all the breeze to herself some passive creature being the butt against which it impinged  on the present occasion that butt was bertha  indeed bertha was a species of practisingbutt at which freydissa exercised herself when all other butts failed or when she had nothing better to do  dont say to me that you cant help it she cried in her own amiably shrill tones  you can help it well enough if you choose  you are always at it morning noon and night im quite sick of you girl im sorry i brought you here id send you back to greenland tomorrow if i could  if the ship sank with you on the passage id rejoicei would  there dont say it again now youre going toi can see that by your whimpering look  dont say you cant help it  dont dont  do you hear  indeed indeed i cant  there  i knew you would shrieked freydissa as she raised herself from the washtub in which she had been manipulating some articles of clothing as if she were tearing bertha to pieceswhy cant you  it isnt easy to help weeping whimpered bertha as she continued to drive her spinningwheel when one thinks of all that has passed and poor  weeping weeping cried freydissa diving again into the tub do you call that weeping  i call it downright blubbering  why your face is as much begrutten as if you were a mere baby  this was true for what between her grief at the sudden disappearance of olaf and snorro and the ceaseless assaults of her mistress who was uncommonly cross that morning berthas pretty little face was indeed a good deal swelled and inflamed about the eyes and cheeks  she again took refuge in silence but this made no difference to freydissa or rather it acted if anything as a provocative of wrath  speak you hussy was usually her irate manner of driving the helpless little handmaid out of that refuge  what were you going to say  poor what she asked sharply after a few minutes silence  i was going to say that poor snorro and  oh its all very well to talk of poor snorro interrupted her mistress you know quite well that you took to snivelling long before snorro was lost  youre thinking of hake you are  you know you are and you darent deny it for your red face would give you the lie if you did  hake indeed  even though he is a thrall hes too good for such a silly thing as you  there be off with you till you can stop your weeping as you call it  go  freydissa enforced her command by sending a mass of soapy cloth which she had just wrung out after the retreating bertha  fortunately she was a bad shot  the missile flew past its intended object and hitting a hen which had ventured to intrude on the legs swept it with a terrific cackle into the road to the amazement not to say horror of the cock and chickens  as bertha disappeared biarne entered the roomhallo  freydissa stormy weathereh  you can go outside and see for yourself answered freydissa angrily  so i mean to returned biarne with a smile for the weather is pleasanter outside than in but i must first presume to put the question that brought me here  do you chance to know where leif is this morning  how should i know  by having become acquainted with the facts of the case somehow suggested biarne  well then i dont know so you can go study the weather  oho mistress i see that it is time we sent to iceland for another cat  this allusion to her husbands former treatment of her pet was almost the only thing that could calmor at least restrainthe storm freydissa bit her lips and flushed as she went on with her washing but she said nothing more  well goodmorning said biarne as he left the house to search for leif  he found him busily engaged in executing some repairs on board the snake  i have a thought in my head said biarne  out with it then replied leif wiping his brow because thoughts if kept long in the brain are apt to hatch and the chickenthoughts are prone to run away at the moment of birth and men have a tendency to chase the chickens to the utter forgetting of the original hens  what is thy thought biarne  that i should take as many of the men as you can spare he replied and go off by water to reinforce karlsefin  that is strange said leif  i sometimes think that there must be a mysterious influence which passes between mind and mind  the very same thought came into my head this morning when i was at work on this oar and i had intended to talk with you on the subject  but why do you think this course of action needful  just because the party of savages may turn out to be larger than we imagined or they may be joined by others and it has occurred to me that the force which is out with karlsefin is barely sufficient to make a good stand against heavy odds  with a small party heavy odds against you is a serious matter but with a large party heavy odds on the side of the enemy makes little weightunless indeed their men are willing to come on and be killed in large numbers which my experience of savages assures me that they are never willing to do  your reasons biarne are very much the same as my own therefore being of one mind we shall go about the business without delay for if our aid is to reach them at all it must be extended at once  go then select and collect your men i will be content to guard the place with the half of those that are now here and make haste biarne the more i think of it the more i fear delay  biarne was not slow to act  in a remarkably brief space of time he had selected his men prepared the canoes loaded them with arms and food and got everything ready so that before the afternoon had far advanced he was enabled to set off with four canoes and thirtytwo men  meanwhile leif had set those that remained to complete a small central point of defencea sort of fortalicewhich had been for some time in preparation as a last refuge for the colonists in the event of their ever being attacked by overwhelming numbers  karlsefin had long seen the propriety of building some such stronghold but the friendly relations that had existed for a considerable period between the norsemen and the natives had induced him to suspend building operations until several annoying misunderstandings and threats on the part of the savages had induced him to resume the work  at the time of which we write it was almost completed  this fortress was little more than a strong palisade of stout planks about twelve feet high placed close together with narrow slits on every side for the discharge of arrows and a platform all round the top inside on which men could stand to repel an assault or discharge stones and other missiles over the wall  but the chief strength of the place lay in its foundation which was the summit of a small isolated rocky mound in the centre of the hamlet  the mound was not more than thirty feet high but its sides were so steep that the top could not be reached without difficulty and its area was so small that the little fortification embraced the whole of it  it was large enough however to contain the whole population of the place exclusive of the cattle  to the completion then of this place of refuge leif addressed himself with all the energy of his nature  a large shed was erected in one corner of it with a strong plank roof to protect the women from stones arrows and javelins which were the only projectiles in vogue at that period of the worlds history  another shed was built just under the fortalice on the lake side for the safe housing of the live stock  arrows were made in great numbers by some of the men while others gathered and stored an immense supply of heavy ammunition in the shape of stones  besides this a large quantity of dried provisions was stored in the womens shed also a supply of water but in regard to the last being near the lake and within easy bowshot of their vessel they trusted to bold nightsallies for additional supplies of the indispensable fluid  finally the work was carried on with such vigour that eight days after biarnes departure it was finished  finishedand not a moment too soon  at the time when biarne started on his voyage the woods were unknown to the norsemen alive with savages fortunately these had not observed the departure of the canoes the whole of them being engaged at the time deep within the woods holding a council of war in which it was resolved to attack the white invaders of their land kill them all and appropriate their property  leif committed a slight mistake in not sending out scouts at this time to guard against surprise but he was so eager to have the works completed that he grudged sending away any of his small body of men  on the day when everything had been got ready he sent a man named hengler who was an expert bowman to procure some venison  in less than an hour hengler was seen running towards the hamlet at breakneck speed with his eyes almost starting out of his head his hair streaming in the breeze and two savages close on his heels  to arms men shouted leif as he snatched up a bow and without waiting to put on helmet or sword ran out to meet hengler  seeing this the savages stopped hastily fitted arrows to their bowstrings and discharged them the one at hengler the other at leif the first just grazed the flying norsemans ear the other fell short but before a second discharge was possible leif had sent an arrow whizzing at the first savage  it pierced his thigh  uttering a fierce yell he plucked the shaft out of the wound and turning round fled back to the woods followed by his companion  not a moment to lose gasped hengler as he ran into the hamlet there are hundreds of them everywhere  coming towards us asked leif  not when i saw them but doubtless when these two return they will come down like a mountain foss  quick get into the fort ladsstay hengler assist me with the women  do you think they really mean to attack us asked gudrid who with bertha and freydissa came forward at the moment  assuredly they do answered leif come follow hengler to the fort whatever they intended before the arrow in that fellows leg will settle the question  where are thora and astrid  in the dairy replied gudrid  away then i go to fetch them  would that i were a man exclaimed freydissa catching up a spear and shaking it as she strode along with the rest  id teach them to think twice before coming here to disturb peaceable folk  peaceable thought leif with a grim smile as he hurried towards the dairy but he said nothing for he deemed that to be a time for silence and action  in a few minutes nearly all the population of the place had taken refuge in the fort and soon afterwards the livestock was driven into the shed beside the rock  the gate was then shut and the men mounted the battlements or breastwork to watch for the expected foe  but no foe made his appearance  hour after hour passed away the sun descended behind the treetops and below the horizon the grey mantle of evening overspread the scene still the watchers stood on the battlements and gazed intently into the foreststill there was not the slightest sound or symptom of an enemy in the vast sleeping wilderness  now this is passing strange observed hengler who had been appointed second in command and stood beside leif  not so strange as ye suppose replied leif  many a time have i fought with men in the mountains of norway and on the plains of valland and invariably have i found that a surprise is never attempted save in the night  true returned hengler but when a very strong foe stands before a very weak one it seems to me childish to delay the assault  thine ignorance of war must be great hengler returned leif regarding the man with a smile if thou hast yet to learn that a body of men weak in numbers becomes passing strong when posted behind good walls with plenty of missiles and provender  my knowledge of war is not great said the man who was quite a youth but methinks it is like to improve now  i fear it is returned leif sadly but now i will give thee a job to perform that is necessary  from my experience of such matters i feel well assured that the savages intend an assault during the night when they doubtless expect that their numbers will more easily cope with and overcome us but in my judgment it is likely that they understand nothing of this fortwork therefore i shall give them a surprise instead of receiving one at their hands  go thou then with six of the most active among the men and slip as quietly as may be into the forest gather there as many pine cones as shall fill your shields to overflowing and bring them hither along with a quantity of birch bark if ye are attacked fight your way back and we will cover your retreat from the ramparts  while hengler and six men were absent on this duty another small party was sent to fetch into the fort a log about eighteen feet long which lay on the ground close at hand at the same time they were ordered to run down to the lake and bring up three or four old planks which had lain for a long time in the water and were quite sodden  these things were all secured and carried into the fortress in the course of a few minutes  the log was then set up on end and sunk deep into a hole in the ground so that it remained standing in the centre of the fort with the top just reaching a little above the walls  pegs were driven into it all the way up so that a man could easily ascend it  on the top of this pole was affixed a platform made of the soaked planks about six feet square with a hole left near the head of the pole through which a man could thrust himself  these norsemen were smart in using their hands and axes  the contrivance which we have taken so long to describe was erected in a very few minutes  it was wellnigh completed when hengler and his party returned with the pine cones and birch bark both of which substances are exceedingly resinous and inflammable  leif made the men carry them to the top of the pole and pile them on the platform  he then ordered a small fire to be kindled in a corner of the fort but to be kept very low and small so that the tiny wreath of smoke which arose from it might be dissipated before it reached the battlements  after that he called all the men to him  now my lads said he it is likely that these savages will try to take us by surprise  this they will not find it easy to do  from what i know of them they will come like the foxslilyand try to pounce upon us  we will let them come we will let them pounce and not show face until such time as i give the wordthen ye will know how to quit you like men  away all of you to resteach man with his shield above him and his sword by his side  i myself will do the part of sentinel  the men quietly obeyed this order  leif did not think it necessary to say more to them but to hengler and two others who had been selected as leaders he revealed more minutely the intended plan of action before they lay down  leaving hengler for a few minutes to guard the walls he entered the shed where the women were seated  you must keep well under cover gudrid he said for it is likely that these fellows will shower some arrows upon usperhaps something heavier but we are well prepared to receive them  are our enemies numerous asked gudrid anxiously  so it is said but that will do them little service so long as we are behind these walls  i wish i had my fingers in their chiefs hair muttered freydissa between her teeth  i echo the wish you expressed not long ago said leif laughing would that thou wert a man freydissa for assuredly a spirit like thine is invaluable on the field of battle  thankful am i that there are other fields besides battlefields where women may be useful observed bertha who was seated on a box beside astrid with her arm round her waist  freydissa merely cast on her handmaid a look of scorn for she was aware that neither the time nor place was suited to the exercise of her peculiar talents  i just looked in to assure you that all goes well said leif addressing the women generally and that you have nothing to fear  we fear nothing said freydissa answering for the rest  the somewhat flippant remark speak for yourself might have been appropriately made by some of her sisterhood but they were all too anxious about the impending danger to heed what she said  when leif rejoined hengler on the walls the shades of night had fallen on the forest  he advised his lieutenant to lie down but hengler begged and obtained permission to share his vigil  there was no moon that night and it became extremely darkjust such a night as was suited to the purpose of the natives  leif stood motionless like a statue leaning on his spear  his man sat on the rampart both gazed and listened with painful intensity  at last leif pointed to what appeared to be a moving object on the space of cleared ground that intervened between the slight wall of the hamlet and the edge of the forest  awake the men he whispered and let not a sound of voice or clank of sword be heard  hengler made no reply but glided silently away  one by one the men came up with the light tread of cats and manned the walls keeping well under cover of the parapeteach taking his appointed station beside his particular pile of stones and sheaf of arrows which lay on the platform while below a man with a bow was stationed at every slit  suddenly there arose on the night air a yell so fierce so prolonged and so peculiar that it made even the stout hearts of the norsemen quail for a momentit was so unearthly and so unlike any warcry they had ever before heard  again and again it was repeated then a rushing sound was heard and hundreds of dark objects were indistinctly seen leaping over the slight wall of felled trees that surrounded the hamlet  with furious shouts the savages surrounded the houses burst open the doors and rushed in but they rushed out again almost immediately and their yells were exchanged for exclamations of surprise as they went about searching in the dark for their concealed enemies  of course they came to the rockfortress almost immediately after and another warcry was uttered as they surrounded the place in hundreds but as there was still no sound or appearance of their expected foe they became suddenly silent as if under the impression that there was something mysterious in the affair which was not in accordance with their past experiences  they nevertheless clambered to the top of the rock and began to feel round the bottom of the wooden palisades for a door  at that moment while they were clustering thick as bees round the base of the building leif gave a preconcerted signal  one of the men applied a light to the pile of bark and fircones and a bright flash of flame shot upward as leif saidup lads in deep stern tones  instantly a shower of heavy stones descended on the pates of the savages who rolled down the steep sides of the mound with shrieks and cries and yells very different indeed from those which had characterised their assault  from all directions the savages now concentrated on the fortress  at the same time the fire suddenly shot up with such a glare that the whole scene was made nearly as light as day and from the parapets and every loophole of the fortress a very hail of arrows poured forth into the midst of them while their own shafts either quivered in the palisade or fell harmless from the shields and helmets of the norsemen  even in that hour of extreme danger leifs desire to spare life with a view to future proposals of peace was exemplified in his ordering the men to draw their bows slightly so as to wound without killing as much as possible and to aim as well as they could at the legs of the foe one result of this was that the wounded men were soon very numerous and as they fled away filled the woods with such howls of agony that their still unhurt comrades were more alarmed than they would probably have been if the ground had been strewn with the dead  at this point a vigorous sally from the fortress and a deeptoned norse cheer settled the question for the time being  the entire army of darkskinned warriors turned and fled into its native wilderness  there was not it may be well to remark here so much danger in this sally as we moderns might suppose for even though the savages had not run but had faced and surrounded their enemy these norsemen with their massive limbs sweeping swords large shields and defensive armour could have cut their way back again to the fort through hundreds of such halfnaked foes  of course leif had expected them to fly and had no intention of retiring immediately to the fort  he merely went the length of the outer wall and then with half of his men kept up a vigorous shouting to expedite the flight of the foe while the other half picked up as many arrows as they could find  leif was glad to learn on returning to the fort that only two dead men had been discovered on the ground  but the savages had not given in by any means as became pretty clear from the noise they made in the woods soon afterwards  this continued all night and leif ordered the fire to be extinguished lest they should be tempted by its light to send a flight of arrows among them which might wound some of his people when off their guard  when the first grey light of dawn appeared it became evident to the beleaguered norsemen what the savages had been about  not very far from the fortress an enormous pile of dry timber had been raised and although it was within easy bowshot the savages managed by dodging from tree to tree to get under its shelter with fresh logs on their shoulders and thus increased the pile continually  they mean to burn us out exclaimed hengler anxiously  rather to smoke us out observed one of the men  fire can never reach us from that distance  leif who was very grave shook his head and said  if they make the pile very big it may reach us well enough  they have plenty of hands and no lack of wood  see they are piling it to windward  god grant that the breeze may not increase else shall we have to forsake the fortress  nevertheless our good ship is at hand he added in a more cheerful tone and they will find us tough to deal with when we get upon the watercome lads we will at all events harass if we cannot stop them  so saying leif ordered the men to keep up a constant discharge of arrows whenever they obtained a glimpse of the savages and he himself headed a sally and drove them back to the woods  but as soon as he and his men had returned to the fortress out came the savages again like a swarm of bees and continued their work vigorously  thus the morning passed away and the pile of the intended bonfire despite the arrows and the frequent sallies of the norsemen continued slowly but steadily to grow    chapter twenty two  hake makes a bold venture but does not winthe norsemen find that there is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip  when karlsefin and his men had surmounted the rapid as before described they found their future advance unimpeded and in the natural course of thingsor of the riverarrived not long after the children at the lakelike expansion on the shores of which the native village stood  this village it must be understood was not a permanent one  the natives were nomads  their tents were merely poles cut as required from the neighbouring woods tied together at the top spread out in a circle at the base and covered with leather which coverings were the only parts of their habitations the natives deigned to carry about with them they were here today and away tomorrow stopping a longer or shorter time in each encampment according to fancy or to the measure of their success in procuring food  the particular tribe of natives which had captured the norsemens children had only just come to the locality they therefore knew nothing of the arrival of the white strangers in their land except what they had recently learned from their scouts as we have seen  karlsefins canoe led the way hence on turning sharp round a point of rock that jutted out into the stream krake was the first who caught sight of the smoke that rose above the treetops  hist hold on he exclaimed in a hoarse whisper looking over his shoulder as he backedwater suddenly  karlsefin and the men instantly did the same and sent the canoe back under the shelter of the point the other canoes of course followed suit  the skraelingers whispered krake  i saw the smoke of their fires  did you see tents asked the leader  no there was scarce time to see anything before we got back here  what do you advise asked karlsefin looking at thorward  go ashore and attack them at once he replied  ay thats it theres nothing like fighting it out at once muttered krake in an undertone  my advice said karlsefin is that we cross the river and get on yonder height which from its position must needs overlook the camp of the savages and there reconnoitre and form our plans  well i daresay your advice is best after all rejoined thorward with a smile  you were always a cautious and peaceful man though im bound in fairness to admit that you can fight passing well when it comes to that  thanks for your good opinion said karlsefin laughing quietly  so now lads turn about and follow me closely  keep silence and dip your paddles as lightly as may be  saying this he returned a considerable way down the river keeping very close in to the banks which were overhung with bushes until he reached a point where it seemed likely that the party could cross without being observed  there was a slight rapid at the place so that they had only to enter it at an angle with the bank and were swept across in a few moments almost without requiring to use their paddles  landing at the edge of a dense thicket they hauled the canoes out of the water secreted them carefully and then taking their arms made a detour through the forest in the direction of the cliff before referred to by karlsefin  in less than half an hour they reached it and found as had been anticipated that it commanded a view of the native encampment which to their dismay they now discovered was an immense one filled with many hundreds of men besides women and children  here prone on their breasts and scarce venturing to raise their heads above the grass the two leaders held a consultation while their men kept well in the background  this is an unfortunate business said karlsefin  truly it is replied thorward but the question is can this be the set of rascals who carried off the children  it seems to me that being a small band as we know they did not belong to the same set  that may be so thorwardbut i incline to the belief that the small party was but an offshoot from the large one and that our dear little ones are even now with the people before us  as if to put the matter beyond doubt olaf with snorro on his back issued at that moment from the woods on the opposite side of the river and went out upon the identical spit of sand where on the previous evening he had held such bitter communings with his own spirit  the norseman leaders recognised the children at once being almost within hail of them and it was with difficulty they restrained the impulse to spring to their feet and shout  thanks be to god for the sight of them at all events said karlsefin fervently see the dear boy has brought my darling there to amuse himah little dost thou know olaf the hold that thy kindness has given thee of his fathers heart  twould be well if he had a hold of the fathers hand just at this time drily observed thorward who was not gifted with much of a sentimental temperament  that is not easy of accomplishment returned the other  even you would scarcely methinks advise so small a band of men to make an open attack on five or six hundred savages  i would not advise it replied thorward nevertheless if it came to the worst i would do it  but what then is your advice  why until it comes to the worst we must try strategy answered karlsefin  i will call hake to our council the youth i have observed is a deep thinker and clearsighted  when hake was summoned and had laid himself down beside his leaders he remained for some time silently gazing on the busy scene below where some men in canoes were spearing fish in the bay and others were skinning and cutting up deer near the edge of the woods while women were cooking and engaged in other domestic duties at the doors of the tents and children and dogs were romping about everywhere  could we not get into our canoes suggested thorward make a dash at the spit of sand and carry off the children at a swoop before the brownskinned rascals were well aware of us  they would see us before we got halfway to the spit replied karlsefin carry the children into the woods and then be ready to receive us in hundreds on shorewhat think you hake can you suggest any plan of outwitting these savages  i have a plan answered the scot but i fear you will deem it foolish  out with it man foolish or otherwise said thorward who was beginning to chafe under difficulties that appeared to be insurmountable even by his favourite methodforce of arms  if ye approve of it returned hake i will cross the river alone and unarmed and walk straight to the spot where the children are now seated  much of the way is concealed by shrubs and when i saunter across the open part it may be that i shall scarce be noticed until i am near them  if i be then will i make a dash catch them up make for the rapid plunge in and on gaining the opposite bank run to meet you  we can then hasten to the canoesfight our way to them if need beand sweep down the river  we shall probably get a fair start and if so it will go hard but we reach leifsgaard before they overtake us if not why  hake touched the hilt of his sword by way of completing the sentence  a rare plan said thorward with a suppressed chuckle and how my bold youth if thou art observed and caught before getting hold of the children  i will then set my wits to devise some other plan  it may be of some advantage to them that i should be a captive along with the children and at most it is but one man lost to the expedition  ay but that would be a heavy loss said karlsefin nevertheless the plan seems to me not so unlikelyonly there are one or two points about which i have my doubts  in the first place although your legs are marvellously good i fear that with the additional weight of olaf and snorro on them the fleet runners among the savages of whom there must be many would soon overtake thee  with olaf on my back snorro under my left arm and the right arm free to swingi think not replied hake quietly but decidedly  then as to crossing how do you  i would swim replied hake  what with the weight and drag of wet garments to cumber you exclaimed thorward besides making it clear to the savages if they caught you that you had come from the opposite bank of the river where your friends might be expected to be waiting for you  i would tie my clothes in a tight bundle on the top of my head said hake  many a time have i crossed the streams of my native land in this manner  well ye have a ready answer for everything returned thorward nevertheless i like not the plan  if you cannot suggest a better i am disposed to let hake try it said karlsefin  thorward had no better plan to suggest  indeed the more he thought of it the more did he feel inclined to make a tremendous onslaught cut as many men to pieces as he could before having his own life taken and so have done with the whole affair for ever  fortunately for olaf and snorro his counsels were not followed  in a few minutes hake was ready  his brother was ordered to lead the men back to the canoes there to keep in close hiding and await further orders  meanwhile karlsefin remained on the cliff to watch the result  hake felt it to be a desperate venture but he was possessed of that species of spirit which rejoices in such and prefers danger to safety besides he saw at a glance that there would be no chance whatever of success if his leaders made up their minds to attempt an open attack against such fearful odds  with a light step the young scot descended to the river thinking of bertha as he went  a few minutes afterwards he was seenor rather his head with a bundle on itwas seen crossing the river by the watchers on the cliff  a few minutes later and he was on the opposite shore rapidly putting on his light garments  thereafter he entered the bushes and a glimpse could be caught of him ever and anon as he glided swiftly like the panther towards his prey  when the last point capable of affording concealment was gained hake assumed a careless air and with his head down as if in meditation sauntered towards the spit of land where olaf and snorro were still playing  well done exclaimed thorward with a look of admiration cleverly bravely done  there is no doubt that such was the case and that hake would have reached the children unobserved by the natives had not olaf chanced to notice him while he was yet about fifty yards off  he recognised him at once and with a shout of joy ran to meet him  hake dashed past him sprang toward snorro whom he caught up and stooping criedup olaf up for your life  olaf understood at once sprang on his back and held on tight while hake bending low sped away at a pace that defied pursuit though by that time a hundred savages were almost at his heels  it was obvious from the first that the lithe scot was well able to achieve his purpose  he was already nearing the rapid  his pursuers were far behind and karlsefin could scarcely restrain a shout of exultation as he rose to run round to his canoes when he observed that a party of more than a dozen natives who chanced to be ascending the rivers bank on foot met the fugitive  observing that he was a stranger and pursued by natives they crossed his path at once  hake stopped abruptly glanced at the bushes then turned to the river and was on the point of plunging in when a canoe with four savages in it shot out from the bank just below him  he saw at once that escape was impossible  feeling intuitively that submission was his best policy he set the children on the ground and quietly suffered himself to be taken prisoner  i knew it  i said it growled thorward between his teeth as he sprang up drew his sword and slashed down two small trees at a single stroke in his wrath then rushing through the woods he made for the canoes  karlsefin followed in a state of mind almost as furious  it was such a bitter disappointment to fail so signally on the very eve of success  the canoes were already in the water and manned when the leaders reached them for heika who had been left in charge knew well that whatever might be the result of the enterprise prompt action would be necessary  quick shove off cried karlsefin taking his place and driving his paddle into the water with such force that the light craft shot from the bank like an arrow  the men were not slow to obey  the fierce spirit of their leader seemed to be catching and the foam curled from their respective bows leaving a long white track behind as they rushed up the river and swept out upon the broad expanse above  of course they had been seen before reaching that point and the savages immediately lined the banks with armed men  they did not however go out upon the spit of sand where olaf and snorro had first been observed by their friends  that point was so high up the stream that it did not seem to be considered by any one as worthy of attention  this karlsefin observed at once and formed his plans accordingly  he advanced as if he were about to land below the spit but made no hostile demonstrations of any kind and paddled so quietly on nearing the shore that the savages did not seem to understand him and although ready with their arrows for instant action they remained passive  when within a short distance of the land karlsefin suddenly but still quietly turned the head of his canoe up the stream and made for the spit of sand  the other canoes followed  the natives perceiving the intention of the strangers uttered a wild shout and made for the same place along the shore but before they reached it karlsefin had landed with all his men and with their stalwart figures and strange arms presented such an imposing front that the natives stopped short  at this point the crowd opened a little to let some one pass and whitepow came to the front  judging him to be the chief karlsefin at once laid down his sword and stepping a few paces in front of his men held up his hands and made demonstrations of a peaceful kind  but whitepow was not peacefully inclined  although aged he was a sturdy fellow stood erect and carried a heavy club on his shoulder to the norsemans demonstrations he replied by frowning fiercely and shaking his head savagely as though to intimate that he was much too old a bird to be taken in with such chaff  then turning to those beside him he gave an order which resulted in hake being led to the front with his arms tightly bound to his sides  ah thought karlsefin if you had only brought the children to that spot i would have rescued them at all hazards  he did not however think it wise to make so desperate an attempt merely to rescue hake while the children were still concealed and at the mercy of the savages  he therefore put on his blandest looks and manner and again invited confidence but whitepow again shook his head pointed backwards as if in reference to the two children and then at hake after which he flung his club with such violence and precision at karlsefins head that the stout norseman would certainly have measured his length on the sand if he had not been very much on the alert  as it was he received the missile on his shield from which it glanced with a loud clang and went hissing into the river  karlsefin smiled as if that sort of thing rather amused him than otherwise and again held up his hands and even advanced a step or two nearer while the concourse of savages gave vent to a shout of surprise it is probable that whitepow was a hero whose artillery had hitherto been the messenger of certain death to foes  the failure of the club seemed to exasperate the old savage beyond endurance for he instantly seized a bow and let fly an arrow at the norseman leader  it was well aimed but was also caught on the shield and fell broken to the ground  seeing this some of the norsemen hastily drew their bows but karlsefin anticipating something of the kind turned about and bade them forbear  meanwhile whitepow had ordered his warriors to remove hake and to fall back a little  this they did and appeared to be awaiting further orders from their chief who had gone up towards the tents  the movement puzzled karlsefin who rejoined his men  it is my advice said thorward that we hesitate no longer  stand or fall we are in for a fight now so the sooner we begin the better  no doubt the odds are great but they dont seem to be able for muchat least if that old chap gave us a good specimen of their powers  most of the norsemen appeared to agree with this advice but karlsefin did not  you forget said he that this would not be a mere trial of strength if we once begin and chance to fail every man of us must die and our colony thus left so weak would stand a small chance of surviving in the midst of so many savages  besidesthe children would be lost for ever  it is my opinion that we should wait a little to see what this movement implies  perhaps that whitehaired old savage may have recovered his temper and senses by this time and is making up his mind to have peace instead of war  god grant that it may be so  instead of replying thorward frowned darkly and with something of a savage sneer on his lip pointed to a bend in the river above them round which at that moment a hundred canoes swept and came swiftly towards them  looks that like peace he said bitterly  karlsefins countenance fell  all is lost he muttered in a tone that was rather sad than fierce oh my tender little child  crushing down his feelings with a mighty effort he turned to the men and quietly but quickly arranged them in a circle with their faces outwards so that they presented a front in all directions  now ye men of norway and iceland he said the day has come at last when ye must prove yourselves worthy descendants of a noble race  our cause this day is a right cause and god is with the right whether it please him to send death or victory  quit you like men and let us teach these skraelingers how to fightif need be how to die  taking his stand on the landward side of his men and ordering thorward to do the same in the direction of the water he calmly awaited the onset  and now indeed it seemed as if a fierce and bloody battle were about to begin for when the canoes of their comrades swept round the point of land as already described the savages on shore constantly reinforced by new arrivals began to move steadily down in an overwhelming mass towards the spit of sand and the heroes who stood there though comparatively so few in number were with their superiority of weapons and courage certain to make a fearfully prolonged and bloody resistance  affairs had reached this critical point when a sudden and loud shout was heard down the river  all eyes were turned in that direction and there several canoes were seen coming round the bend of the river full of armed men  the descent of the native fleet was checked  the norsemen at once recognised their comrades and greeted their approach with a lusty cheer  in another minute the newcomers had leaped upon the sand  welcome welcome biarne exclaimed thorward seizing and wringing his friends hand in great delight  why man we had all but taken leave of each other but we shall have another tale to tell now  may god bless you biarne for coming so opportunely said karlsefin let your men join and extend the circle  there spread it out wider that will do  i wont trouble you with questions just now biarne as to what made you think of coming  we have more pressing work on hand  thus saying the leader busied himself in arranging his reinforcements while the savages held back and awaited the result of a consultation between whitepow and the chief men of the tribe    chapter twenty three  difficulties regarding intercommunicationthe power of finery displayedalso the power of song and sentiment  the additional force thus opportunely gained by the norsemen although hailed with so much enthusiasm did not very materially alter their position  true they now formed a company of above fifty stout and wellarmed men who in the hour of extremity could make a formidable resistance to any foe however numerous but what chance had they of ultimately escaping from upwards of a thousand savages every man of whom was an adept at bushwarfare could dart from tree to tree and harass and cut off in detail an enemy whom he would not dare or did not care to face in the open fieldwhich latter mode of warfare was more natural and congenial to the norsemen  this truth soon began to force itself upon karlsefins understanding but as he feared to damp the spirits of his less thoughtful comrades he kept his anxieties to himself and made the best disposition of his force that was possible in the circumstances  very soon there was a movement among the savages on shore and its object was not long of being apparent for presently a fleet of canoes was seen ascending the river  at the same time the other fleet renewed its advance from above while the men on shore moved once more towards the spit of sand  they mean to attack on all sides at once said biarne  let them come growled thorward  tis death or victory now lads  no one spoke but the eagle glances of the men and their firm grasp of sword and spear told that they were ready and once more it seemed as if the bloody fight were about to begin when again it was interrupted by a shout  this time the shout came from the woods from which a few minutes later a solitary savage was seen to issue  he appeared to be in haste and ran through the crowd of warriors who made way for him straight towards the whitehaired chief to whom he appeared to speak with great fervour and many gesticulations though he was too far off to be heard or his countenance to be distinctly seen by the norsemen  that fellow brings news of some sort or other  i should say remarked biarne  whatever his news may be replied karlsefin i dont think it will be likely to do much for us  the rascals figure seems not unfamiliar to me said thorward  at that moment the crowd of chiefs around whitepow shouted the word ho apparently in approbation of something that he had just remarked and immediately after the man whom thorward had styled a rascal began to talk and gesticulate again more violently than ever  what is the man after now said thorward  it seems to me that he is mad  the savage did indeed appear to be slightly deranged for in the midst of his talk he took an arrow and went through the pantomime of discharging it then he applied the point of it to his own back and fell down as if wounded whereupon he rose quietly and kneeled with a tender air as if in the act of succouring a wounded man and thereafter went on to perform other pantomimic acts which at last induced thorward to open his eyes very wide and whistle as he exclaimedwhy tis utway that fellow who was half killed in our first brush with the skraelingers  ay and who was so tenderly nursed by bertha added biarne  there can be no doubt of it said karlsefin in a cheerful voice and now have i some hope of a peaceful end to this affair for what else can he be doing but pleading our cause  im not so sure of that replied thorward  he may just as likely be telling them what lots of good things might be got by killing us all and taking possession of leifsgaard  the question will soon be settled thorward for here comes the savage said biarne  this was true  having finished his talk whatever it was and heard a brief reply from whitepow utway turned round and ran fearlessly towards the norsemen  i will go meet him said karlsefin  there may be danger in that suggested biarne  greater danger in showing distrust replied karlsefin  confidence should beget confidence  without more words he flung down sword and shield and advanced unarmed to meet the savage whom he shook warmly by the handa style of salutation which utway thoroughly understood having learned it while lying wounded in leifsgaard  they could not of course make use of speech but utway was such a powerful gesticulator that it was not difficult to make out his meaning after shaking hands he put his hand on his heart then laid it on karlsefins breast and pointed towards the old chief with an air that would have done credit to a courtier  karlsefin at once took the hand of the savage and walked with him through the midst of the native chiefs above whose heads he towered conspicuously until he stood before whitepow  taking off his iron helmet he bowed to the old chief an act which appeared to afford that worthy much satisfaction for although he did not venture to return the bow he exclaimed ho with solemn emphasis  this was all very pleasant but it was not much  karlsefin therefore tried his hand at a little gesticulation while the natives gazed at him with speechless interest  whitepow and utway then replied with a variety of energetic demonstrations some of which the norseman understood while of others he could make nothing at all but the result of it all was that utway made a final proposal which was very clear to the effect that the norsemen should approach the savages mingle with them and be friends  to this karlsefin returned a decided negative by shaking his head and frowning portentously  at the same time he stooped and held his hand about two feet from the ground as if to indicate something that stood pretty nearly that height  then he tenderly patted the top of the imaginary thing whatever it was and took it up in his arms kissed it and laid it on his breast  after that he indicated another thing somewhat higher which he also patted on the top  thereafter he pressed his arms close to his side and struggled as if to get loose from something but could not until he had taken hold of an imaginary knife cut the something which bound him and set his arms free  all this was apparently understood and immensely relished by the natives who nodded to each other and vociferated ho to such an extent that the repetition caused it to sound somewhat like a fiendish laugh  but here whitepow put in his veto shook his head and appeared inexorable whereupon karlsefin crossed his arms on his breast and looked frowningly on the ground  things had just reached this uncomfortable pass when karlsefins eye chanced to fall on the end of a piece of bright scarlet cloth with which gudrid had smilingly ornamented his neck before he set out on this expeditionjust as a young wife might in chivalrous ages have tied a scarf to her knights arm before sending him off to the wars  a sudden idea flashed upon him  he unfastened the strip of cloth and advancing presented it to whitepow with a bland smile  the aged chief was not proof against this  he gazed at the brilliant cloth with intense admiration and expressed as much delight at receiving it as if he had been a childwhich by the way he was in regard to such fabrics and in his inability to restrain his feelings  rejoiced to observe the good effect thus produced karlsefin did his best to assure the chief that there was plenty more of the same in his possession besides other thingsall of which utway corroboratedand signified that he whitepow should have large quantities thereof if he would restore the captives to their friends  in order to add force to what he said he drew from his pouch or wallet several small metal ornaments strung together like beads and presented these also to whitepow as well as to several of the chiefs who stood nearest to him at the same time he uncovered as if inadvertently a magnificent silver brooch which hung round his neck under his leathern warshirt  this brooch was by no means a trifling bauble  it was massive beautifully carved and hung round with little silver cups and diamondshaped pieces of silver about the size of a mans thumbnail it was much prized by its owner on account of being an heirloom of his family having been carried to iceland by his forefathers when they were expatriated from norway by king harald fairhair  whitepows eye at once fell on the brooch and he expressed a strong desire to possess it  karlsefin started as if in alarm seized the brooch with both hands held it aloft and gazed at it in a species of veneration then clasping it to his breast shook his head by way of an emphatic no  of course whitepow became doubly anxious to have it whereupon karlsefin again stooped and placing his hand about two feet from the ground patted the top of the thing indicated and said that he might have the brooch for that and the other things previously referred to  whitepow pondered a few minutes and utway said something very seriously to him which resulted in his giving an order to two of his chiefs who at once left the group  they quickly returned leading hake and the children between themthe former being still bound at the elbows  there was something quite startling in the shout of surprise that olaf gave on observing karlsefin  it was only equalled by the shriek of glee that burst from snorro when he recognised his father  olaf instantly seized snorro and ran towards him  karlsefin met them more than halfway and with an expression of deep thankfulness caught up his little one and strained him to his heart while olaf tightly embraced his leg  but recollecting himself instantly he set snorro down removed the silver brooch from his neck and placed it in the hand of the old chief at the same time he pointed to hakes bonds  whitepow understood him and drawing his stone knife cut these asunder  make no haste hake said his leader but take snorro in your arms and olaf by the hand and walk slowly but steadily towards your comrades  if any one offers to intercept you resist not but turn and come back hither  hake made no reply but did as he was bid and was soon in the midst of his comrades  meanwhile karlsefin whose joy almost prevented him from maintaining the dignity that was appropriate to the occasion took off every scrap in the shape of ornament that he possessed and presented all to whitepow even to the last bauble in the bottom of his wallet and he tried to make the old man understand that all his men had things of a similar kind to bestow which would be brought to him if he would order the great mass of his people to retire to a considerable distance retaining only about his person a party equal in numbers to the norsemen  to this the chief seemed inclined to object at first but again utways eloquence and urgency prevailed  the old man stood up shouted an order in the voice of a stentor and waved his hand  the whole multitude at once fell back to a considerable distance leaving only a few of the principal men around their chief  the active scot instantly bounded towards himnot less with desire to serve his deliverer than with delight at finding himself once more free  go back hake and tell the men to come quietly hither in a compact body leaving their bows and spears behind them only carrying each man his sword and shield  let a strong guard stay with the weapons and the children and see that biarne and thorward also remain with them quietly place the children in a canoe and do you and heika stand ready to man it  that has already been done said hake  by whose orders demanded karlsefin  at my suggestion replied hake  thou art a wise man hake  i thank thee  go i need not explain that two canoes at least would require to accompany you so as to repel attack by water and if it be necessary to flee while we guard the retreat  that has already been arranged said hake  good good  then whatever betide us the dear children are like to be safe  get you gone hake and harkee if we should not return be sure thou bear my love to gudridaway  hake bowed in silence and retired  in a few minutes the greater part of the norsemen stood before the old chief and by karlsefins command every man who chanced to have any trifling ornament of any kind about him took it off and presented it to the savages  whitepow in return ordered a package of furs to be brought and presented each man with a beautiful sable  karlsefin then made utway explain that he had seen much valuable cloth and many ornaments in the norsemens camp and that these would be given in exchange for such fursa piece of news which seemed to gratify the savages for they possessed an immense number of furs which were comparatively of little value to them  thus amicable relations were established but when whitepow invited the norsemen to accompany him to his village and feast karlsefin intimated that he intended to sup and pass the night on the spit of sand and that in the early morning he would return to his home whither he hoped the savages would soon follow him with their furs  that meanwhile a small number might accompany him if they chose to view his habitation and take back a report  this was agreed to and thus happily the conferences ended  that night the norsemen held high carousal on the spit of sand partly because they were rejoiced at the successful issue of the expedition as far as it had gone and partly because they wished to display a freeandeasy spirit to the savages  they drew a line at the narrowest part of the neck of land and there posted armed sentinels who resolutely refused to let any one pass  on the outward edge of the spit other sentinels were placed who checked all tendency to approach by water and whoin one or two instances when some obstinate natives attempted to force a landingoverturned the canoes and left the occupants to swim ashore the best way they could  the only exception to this rule was made in favour of utway and whitepow with the grandson of the latter little powlet  these three came down to the spit after the norsemen had kindled a magnificent bonfire of dry logs round which they sat and ate their supper told sagas sang songs cracked jokes and drank to absent friends in cans of pure water with an amount of dash fervour and uproarious laughter that evidently raised quite a new idea in the savage minds and filled them with amazement unutterable but not inexpressible for their glaring eyes and lengthened jaws and open mouths were the material embodiment of surprise  in fact the entire population sat on the surrounding banks and heights nearly the whole night with their hands and chins resting on their knees listening and gazing in silent admiration at the proceedings of the norsemen as a vast audience might witness the entertainments of an amphitheatre  the utmost hospitality was of course extended by the norsemen to their three visitors who partook of the food set before them with much relish  fortunately some of the men who had been left to guard the arms still possessed a few trinkets and pieces of bright cloth so that karlsefin was again enabled to gratify his new friends with a few more presents  snorro said karlsefin who sat beside whitepow in front of the fire with the child on his knee are you glad to see your father again  iss said snorro responding slightly to the tender embrace which he received  we are afraid that truth requires us to state that snorro had not quite reached the age of reciprocal attachmentat least in regard to men  of course we do not pretend to know anything about the mysterious feelings which he was reported to entertain towards his mother and nurse  all we can say is that up to this point in his history the affections of that firstborn of vinland appeared to centre chiefly in his stomachwho fed him best he loved most  it is but simple justice to add however that olaf was in snorros eye an exception to the rule  we really believe that if olaf had starved and beaten him during the first half of a day by way of experiment snorro would have clung to him and loved him throughout the other half  come hither olaf take this bit of cloth in your hand and present it to that little boy said karlsefin pointing to powlet  he seems fond of snorro and deserves something  fond of him exclaimed olaf laughing as he presented the cloth according to orders and then returned to snorros side  you should have seen the way he made snorro laugh one day by painting my face  here olaf went into a minute account of the operation referred to and told it with so much humour that the norsemen threw back their wild heads and shook their shaggy beards in fits of uproarious laughter which awakened the echoes of the opposite cliffs and caused the natives to think no doubt that the very rocks were merry  after this krake told a story and sang a rollicking song and of course hake was made to sing which he readily did giving them one of his native airs with such deep pathos that the very savagesunused though they were to musiccould not refrain from venting a murmur of admiration which rose on the night air like a mysterious throb from the hearts of the dark concourse  immediately after hakes song the old chief and his friends took their leave  the sentinels were now changed and doubled the fire was extinguished each norseman lay down with his hand on his swordhilt and his shield above him and the vast multitude of savages melted away to their respective places of repose    chapter twenty four  the burning on the fortressa threatened fight ends in a feast which leads to friendshiphappy reunion and proposed desertion  next morning according to arrangement the norsemen were up and away by daybreak but they did not start off alone  a much larger fleet than they had bargained for accompanied them  karlsefin however made no objection partly because objection would have been unavailing and partly because the natives were so genuinely welldisposed towards him that he felt assured there was no reason to distrust them or to fear their numbers  little did karlsefin think as they proceeded happily and leisurely down the stream at that time the urgent need there was for haste or the dire extremity to which his friends at leifsgaard had been reduced knowing of course nothing about this they descended by easy stages and encamped in good time at night in order to have their fires lighted and food cooked before daylight had quite disappeared so that they might have the more time to sit chatting by the light of the campfires and enjoying the fine summer weather  on the other hand had leif only known how soon his friends were to return he might have held the fortress longer than he did by continuing his desperate sallies to check the raising of the pile that was meant to burn him out but not being aware of this and finding that the necessity for constant vigilance and frequent sallies was wearing out his men he resolved to abandon the castle to its fate and take to the ship  watching his opportunity he had everything portable collected and during the darkest hour of a dark night quietly issued from the little fortress descended to the beach and got on board the snake with all the women and men without the savages being aware of the movement  once on board he fortified the vessel as well as he could and hung the shields round the bulwarks  curiously enough the savages had fixed on that very night for setting fire to their pile of timber which by that time towered to a height that made it almost equal to the fortress it was about to consume  at grey dawn the torch was applied to it  at the very same hour karlsefin and his men accompanied by their savage friends launched their canoes and left the encampment of the previous night  the leader of the fleet had purposely encamped when not very far from the settlement preferring with such a large and unexpected party rather to arrive in the morning than at night  great then was the surprise of the norsemen when soon after starting they saw a dense cloud of smoke rising in the far distance and deep was their anxiety when they observed that this cloud not only spread abroad and increased in density but appeared to float exactly over the place where the settlement lay  give way lads push on  there is something wrong at the gaard shouted karlsefin when he became thoroughly alive to the fact  there was little necessity for urging the men  each man became an impulsive volcano and drove his paddle into the water with such force and fury that the canoes almost leaped out of the river as well as over it  meanwhile the sun rose in splendour and with it rose the mighty flames of the bonfire which soon caught the neighbouring trees and licked them up as if they had been stubble  such intense heat could not be long withstood  the wooden fortress was soon in flames and then arose a yell of triumph from the savages which sent dismay to the hearts of those who were approaching and overawed the little band that still lay undiscovered on board the snake  but when it was ascertained that there was no one in the fortress a cry of fury followed the shout of triumph and the whole band at once suspecting that their enemies had taken to their vessel rushed down to the shores of the lake  there they found the norsemen ready to receive them but they found more than they had expected for just then karlsefin and his men swept round the point above the bay with a tremendous cheer and were followed by a continuous stream of the canoes of their savage friends whom they had outstripped in the mad race  karlsefin did not wait to ascertain how affairs stood  enough for him that the village seemed to be in flames  observing as he passed that his comrades and the women were safe on board the snake he ran the canoes high and dry on the beach and leaped ashore  drawing quickly up into a compact line the norsemen rushed with wild shout upon the foe the natives did not await the onset  surprise alone had kept them waiting there as long as they did  with one consent and a hideous yell they turned and fled like autumn leaves before the wind  returning to the friendly savages who had looked on at all this in some surprise and with no little concern karlsefin looked very sternly at them pointed to the woods into which his enemies had vanished shook his fist and otherwise attempted by signs to indicate his displeasure and to advise the instant interference of the friendly savages in the way of bringing about peaceful relations  the natives were intelligent enough and prompt in action  a party of them at once started off to the woods while karlsefin went on board the snake where he found leif and his friends right glad to meet him and the women in a state of the wildest delight almost devouring olaf and snorro who had been sent direct to the vessel when the men landed to attack the savages  tis good for the eyes to see thy sweet face gudrid he said giving his wife a hearty kiss and i am quite sure that snorro agrees with me in that  he does he does cried gudrid hugging the child who clung round her neck with a tenacity that he had never before exhibited having learned no doubt that absence makes the heart grow fonder  oh  i am so happy and so thankful  my sweet bairn  where did you find him  how did you rescue him  i felt sure you would do it  how did he look when he saw you and  hold gudrid cried karlsefin laughing joy has upset thy judgment i can answer but one question at a time  gudrid made no reply indeed she did not seem to expect an answer to her queries for she had turned again to snorro and olaf whom she overwhelmed with embraces endearing epithets and questions in all which she was ably assisted by bertha astrid and thora  even freydissa became soft for once kissed olaf and snorro several times in a passionate manner and was unusually gracious to thorward  ye came in the nick of time said leif as he and his friends retired to the poop for a brief consultation  so it would seem said biarne but it was more by good fortune than good planning for i left you weakhanded and if good luck had not brought us here just at the time we did methinks there would have been heavy hearts among us  a higher power than good luck brought us hither in time said karlsefin  that is true said leif with a nod and an earnest look at his friend  i doubt it not returned biarne and the same power doubtless led me to start off with a reinforcement in time to help you in the hour of need karlsefin  but it is my advice now that we go ashore and put the huts in a state of defence as quickly as may be  that is just my opinion replied karlsefin for it may be that the friendly natives will find it easier to be converted into foes than to turn our enemies into friends  what is your advice leif  that we land and do as biarne suggests without delay  and what if these villains come down in such overwhelming numbersas they now can easily dothat they shall carry all before them and drive us into the lake asked thorward  why man cried biarne with a touch of ire if i did not know thee well i would say that thou wert timid  knowing me well then as ye say returned thorward and reserving the matter of timidity for future discussion what reply have ye to make to my question  that we must make up our minds to be drowned like freydissas cat replied biarne  nay not quite that said leif with a smile we can at least have the comfort of leaving our bones on the land to mingle with those of as many savages as we can slay  the thought of that would prove a great comfort to the women no doubt when they were carried off by the savages returned thorward with a touch of sarcasm in his tone  i see what you mean said karlsefin that we should have the snake ready to fall back on if we chance to be beaten but to say truth the idea of being beaten by such miserable savages never entered my head  the consideration of your heads thickness then said thorward would be an additional element of comfort no doubt to the women in case of things going against us  at this karlsefin laughed and asked thorward what he would advise  my advice is said he that we not only get the snake ready for a long voyage but that we haul round my ship alsowhich by good fortune is here just nowand get her ready  there is no need to put our goods and chattels on board for if things went ill with us we could no doubt keep the savages at bay long enough to accomplish that by means of placing biarne at the post of danger with orders to die rather than give in but i would leave the women and children on board at any rate to keep them out of harms way  and it is my advice cried freydissa coming up at the moment that ye set about it at once without more talk else the women and children will have to set you the example  there was a general laugh at the tone and manner in which this was said and the four chiefs left the poop to carry out their plans  meanwhile an immense concourse of natives assembled on the neighbouring heights and for a long time carried on a discussion which to judge from the violence of their gesticulations must have been pretty hot  at last their meeting came to an abrupt close and a large band was seen to separate from the rest and move down towards the hamlet  before they reached it the norsemen had manned the defences and awaited them  they come on a peaceful errand i think said karlsefin who stood at the principal opening  at least it seems to me that they carry no arms  what say you hake  your eyes are sharp  they are unarmed replied hake  this was found to be the case and when they had approached to within a long bowshot of the defences all doubt as to their intention was removed by their holding up their hands and making other peaceful demonstrations  judging it wise to meet such advances promptly and without suspicion karlsefin at once selected a number of his stoutest men and causing them to lay aside their arms issued forth to meet the savages  there was as on a former occasion a great deal of gesticulation and talking with the eyes the upshot of which was that the brown men and the white men vowed eternal friendship and agreed to inaugurate the happy commencement thereof with a feasta sort of picnic on a grand scalein which food was to be supplied by both parties arms were to be left at home on both sides and the scene of operations was to be a plot of open ground near to but outside the hamlet  it is easy to record all this briefly but it must not therefore be supposed that it was easy of arrangement on the part of the high contracting parties whose tongues were unavoidably useless in the consultation  krake proved himself to be the most eloquent speaker in signlanguage and the manner in which he made his meaning intelligible to the savages was worthy of philosophic study  it is however quite beyond the powers of description a great deal of it consisting not only of signs which might indeed be described but of soundsguttural and otherwise which could not be spelt  we are constrained therefore to leave it to the readers imagination  at the feast an immense quantity of venison and salmon was consumed as you may easily believe and a great number of speeches were made by both partiesthe men of each side approving and applauding their own speakers and listening to those of the other side with as much solemnity of attention as if they understood every word  there were two points of great interest connected with this feast which we must not omit to mention  one was the unexpected arrival in the middle of it of the old chief whitepow in a canoe with utway and a few of his principal men and his grandson powlet  these were hailed by both parties with great delight because they formed an additional bond of union between them  it had been arranged by karlsefin for the sake of security that the savages and norsemen should not intermingle but that they should sit in two distinct groups opposite to each other  whitepow however ignorant of or indifferent to such arrangements passed over at once to the norsemen on his arrival and went through the ceremony which he had so recently acquired of shaking hands all round  powlet also followed his example and so did utway  they then sat down and the latter did good service in the cause of peace by making an enthusiastic speech which the norsemen could see from his pantomimic motions related to his own good treatment at their hands in time past  powlet also unwittingly aided in the same good cause by running up to olaf and bestowing on him a variety of attentions which were all expressive of goodwill and joy at meeting with him again  he also shouted the name of snorro several times with great energy but olaf could only reply by shaking his head and pointing towards the hamlet where snorro and the women had been left under a strong and trusty guard  the other point of interest to which we have alluded was that a number of the savages became particularly earnest and eager when the eating was concluded in their endeavours to impress something on their new friends which they could not for a long time be made to understand even by the most graphic and energetic signs  i fear krake that you have eaten too much or by some other means have spoilt your powers of interpretation said leif with a laugh as the puzzled interpreter shook his head for the fifth time at an energetic young savage with a red spot on his chin and a blue stripe on his nose who had been gesticulatingwe might almost say agonising before him for some time  tis beyond my powers entirely said krake  try it again bluenose he added turning once more to the savage with resolute intensity of concentration drive about your limbs and looks a little harder  ill make ye out if its in the power of man  thus adjured the young savage opened his mouth wide pointed with his finger down his throat then up at the sky spread both hands abroad in a vague manner and exclaimed ho as though to say thats plain enough surely  oh for shame  is it eaten too much ye have  is that what ye want to say  that was evidently not what he wanted to say for the poor savage looked round with quite a disconsolate aspect  come hither powlet cried biarne youre a smart boy see if you can make the matter somewhat plainer  powlet at all events understood his name and biarnes beckoning finger for he rose and went to him  biarne confronted him with the young savage and told the two to talk with each other by means of signs which consisted in his touching the lips of both and thrusting their heads together  the young savage smiled intelligently and spoke to powlet who thereupon turned to biarne and rolling his eyes for a few seconds uttered a low wail  sure it isnt pains youre troubled with asked krake in a voice of pity  i do believe it must be that they refer to some one whom we have wounded during the fight suggested leif and that they think we have him concealed in the hamlet  it seems to me said thorward that if they were troubled about a wounded or missing comrade they would have asked for him sooner  that is true replied leif  i wish we knew what it is they would communicate for they appear to be very anxious about it  as he spoke a tall savage with an unusually grave countenance stalked from among his fellows thrust powlet and the young man whom krake had styled bluenose aside and seated himself on the ground in imitation of the freeandeasy manner of the norsemen  suddenly his face lighted up he clapped both hands to his chest and breathed hard then raised his hands aloft looked enthusiastically up at the sky rolled his eyes in a fearful manner opened his mouth wide and gave utterance to a series of indescribable howls  checking himself in the midst of one of these he suddenly resumed his grave aspect looked straight at krake and said ho  that he thought he had hit the mark and conveyed the meaning of himself and his friends precisely was made evident by the other savages who nodded their heads emphatically and exclaimed ho with earnestness  hm tis easy to say ho replied krake more perplexed than ever and if ho would be a satisfactory answer id give ye as much as ye liked of that but i cant make head or tail of what it is ye would be at  stay exclaimed hake stepping quickly forward i think i know what they want  saying this he looked earnestly at the grave savage and ran over one or two notes of a song  no words in any language could convey such a powerful meaning as did the beam of intelligence and delight which overspread the faces of these sons of the wilderness  the ho ho hos and noddings were repeated with such energy that krake advised them to stop that lest their heads should come off altogether  i thought so said hake turning away from them they want you to give them a song krake  they shall have that and welcome cried the jovial norseman striking up the danish kings at once with all the fire of his nature  the natives sat in rapt solemnity and when the norsemen joined laughingly in the chorus they allowed a faint smile to play for a moment on their faces and murmured their satisfaction to each other when the song was done  but it was evident that they wanted something more for they did not seem quite satisfied until one of their number rose and going up to hake touched his lips with his finger  ha  i thought so exclaimed krake in contempt  its bad taste ye have to want a song from him after hearing me  but what else could we expect from ye  hake willingly complied with their wish and it then became evident that the savages had gained their point at last for they listened with halfclosed eyes and more than halfopened mouths while he was singing and heaved a deep sigh when he had finished  thus pleasantly was the feast concluded and thus they sealed their friendship  but there was something still more satisfactory in store for the norsemen for it was soon afterwards discovered that the savages possessed a large quantity of beautiful furs with which of course they were willing to part for the merest trifle in the shape of a shred of brilliant cloth or an ornamental bauble  this was not only fortunate as affording an opportunity for the norsemen to procure full and valuable cargoes for both their ships but as creating a busy and interesting occupation which would prevent the natives from growing weary of inaction and perhaps falling into those forms of mischief which proverbially lie ready to idle hands  it seems to me friends said leif one evening shortly after the feast just described while he was seated in the chief hall polishing his iron headpiece and occasionally watching the active hands of gudrid and thora as they busied themselves about domestic affairs while bertha sat beside him dandling snorro on her kneeit seems to me that we have got together such a rich cargo that the sooner we send our ships to greenland the better  they can then return with fresh supplies of such things as are needed in good time  for myself i will go with the ships and overlook the loading of them in greenland  oh may i go with you exclaimed bertha looking up suddenly with much eagerness  hake who was seated at the lower end of the hall busily engaged in making a bow paused abruptly in his work but did not raise his head  i have no objection if freydissa has none answered leif  freydissa will be only too glad to get rid of her replied that amiable woman who was engaged in the manufacture of a leathern tunic for snorro she is tired of milkandwater  and yet milkandwater is more likely to agree with you than anything resembling beer said biarne with a laugh  i should be sorry to leave vinland returned bertha but i am very very anxious to see my dear father again  besidesi can return hither  hakes hand was suddenly released and resumed its occupation  if you go leif asked karlsefin will you return and spend the winter with us  i will not promise that replied leif with a smile  there was silence for some minutes which was broken at length by a very small voice saying  norro go to geenland too  poor snorro was as regardless of the s in his own name as he was of the l in olafs  norro may go if gudrid will allow him answered leif patting the childs curly pate  and oaf too added snorro  of course i must go if snorrie goes cried olaf who had just entered the hall  we could not live separatecould we snorrie  he caught up the child and placed him on his back in his wonted fashion  just think he continued what would it do in greenland without oaf to give it rides and take it out for long walks  ay and go lost with it in the woods added biarne  olaf blushed but replied promptlythat would be impossible biarne for there are no woods in greenland  if snorro goes so must i said thora  he could not get on without his nurse  methinks we had better all go together to greenland said astrid who was busy preparing supper  not bad advice observed biarne somewhat seriously  do you mean what you say asked karlsefin  i half mean it replied biarne  there was a pause here  karlsefin then saidit seems to me friends that our minds are all jumping together  i have thought for a long time of leaving vinland for it is plain to me that as we stand just now we cannot make much headway  many of our men are longing to get back to their families some to their sweethearts and some to their native land while from what you have said it would seem that none of us are very anxious to remain  do not speak for all said thorward  well dost thou wish to stay  it may be that i do  at any rate we have had much trouble in coming hither and settling ourselves and it would be a pity to lose all our labours unless we cant help it  there may be others of my way of thinking in the colony  it is my advice that before we discuss such a matter we had better call a thing an assembly for discussion and do it in an orderly way  by all means said karlsefin let us discuss the matter for decision in a thing yet our discussing here for amusement is not disorderly  after a little more conversation it was finally arranged that a thing or general assembly of the people should be called on the following day to discuss and decide on the propriety of forsaking vinland and returning home    chapter twenty five  the first congress and the last farewell  at the gathering of the vinland colonists next day a number of able speeches were made by various individuals for the norsemen of old were accustomed to the free discussion of public affairs at a time when nearly all europe was crushed under the yoke of feudalism  some of the speeches were humorous and some had a good deal of sound about them without much weight of mattera peculiarity by the way which marks many of the speeches made in the national and general assemblies of mankind in the present day not less perhaps rather more than in the olden time  all the men of the colony were entitled to raise their voices in the council except the thralls so that the brothers hake and heika took no part in the discussion  these two therefore held a private confabulation of their own on the margin of the lake  thorward was among the first speakers at the assembly  it is my opinion he said in the tone of a man who expects to have his opinion opposed that we have not yet given vinland a fair trial we are only just beginning to discover the value of the land  ye know now that it is not a small island as was at first supposed but a vast country of unknown extent  who knows but that it may be as large as norway  this lake and river on which we dwell do not owe their birth to an insignificant country any man with half the vision of one eye remaining may see that  the woods supply all that man can desire the waters swarm with fish the climate is delightful our ships are even now loaded to the bulwarks with costly furs and the natives are friendly  what would ye more  it seems to me that we might if we chose lay the foundation of a new nation that would rival iceland perchance equal old norway itself if we take advantage of the great opportunities that have fallen to our hands  but if we get frightened at the yell of every savage that makes his appearance or grow weary of good vigorous hard work and begin to sigh like children for home then there is small chance of our doing anything and it will doubtless be the fate of a bolder race of men to people this land at some future time  there was a good deal of applause from some of the people when thorward finished this speech which was uttered with great decision but it was observable that those who thought with him though noisy were not numerous  the moment thorward sat down krake started up and said somewhat warmlytis all very well for thorward to speak in this way and ask what would ye more seeing that he has got in his house a handsome and sweettempered wife but i will tell him of something more that i want and that i havent got just now and am not likely to get as long as i remain in vinland  there is a comely little woman in iceland who was born in that best of countries ireland and who forsook the land and her father and mother and kith and kin all for the sake of a redheaded thrallfor he was no better at that timecalled krake now i want that sweet little irishwoman  moreover theres a stout curlyheaded boy in iceland whos an elegant chip of the ancient tree and the born image of his motheri want that curlyheaded boy  then there are six other curlyheaded boys in icelandonly that three of them are girls and the youngest had the curls in prospect when i saw it last bein as bare on the head as the palm of my handall of them descending in size one after another from the first curlyheaded boy i want these  besides which there is a sweet little hut in iceland at the edge of a swamp with the spouting waters not far off and the boilin waters quite handy to cook your dinner without firin and a lovely prospect of the burnin hill behindi want all that and i want to know how thorward would feel if he wanted all that and couldnt get it and was advised to go on wantin it and if he couldnt keep himself easy to try his best to keep as easy as he could  there was some laughter and great applause at this point  moreover continued krake with increasing energy it dont give me a scrap of comfort to be told that this is a vast country full of all thats desirable and the best of livin when i cant enjoy it along with my sweet little kathleen and the curlyheaded boys and girls before mentioned  what does krake care for stuffing his own ugly carcase full when mayhap the wife and bairns are dyin for wantanyhow dyin to see their husband an father  and what does krake care to be the beginning of a new nation  no more than he does to be the middle of it and if left to himself hed far sooner be the end of it by not beginning it at all  as for being frightened by the yells of savages its not worth my while to mention that but when thorward talks about beginning to sigh like children for home he misses his mark entirely  its not sighing i am for home but roaring bellowing howling for it in my wearied spirit and its my opinion comrades as i gaze round upon your speaking faces that theres a good many here howling along with me  there could be no doubt that krakes sentiments were largely entertained and appreciated for his speech was followed by prolonged and enthusiastic applause in which the norsemen not only raised their voices but rattled their arms on their shields by way of emphasis thorward smiled grimly and shrugged his shoulders but made no reply  after several others had spoken in various strainsa few in favour of thorwards opinion but many more in sympathy with krakeleif made a short speech advising immediate return to greenland biarne followed suit and karlsefin wound up with a few remarks in which he urged among other things that although the savages were friendly just then it was not likely they would remain so very long and in the event of a quarrel it was certain considering their great numbers that the infant colony would be kept in perpetual hot water if not actual warfare  he suggested moreover that the proper way to establish a colony that would have some chance to survive and flourish would be to organise it thoroughly in iceland or norway and induce so many married men with their families to emigrate that they would be able to feel at home in the new land and thus wish to remain  he concluded by saying that those who now desired to remain in vinland might join together and devote their energies to the getting up of such a band of colonists if so disposed  for his own part since the majority were evidently in favour of returning home he was free to confess that he had no taste for colonising  the ocean was his home and when that failed him he hoped that god might permit him to end his days and lay his bones in iceland  it was finally agreed that the country should be abandoned and that having made up their minds they should set about preparations without delay  we have said that the scottish brothers had gone to the margin of the lake to hold a little consultation by themselves while the affairs of the nation were being settled in the grand parliament  what think you  will these men of iceland decide to return home or to remain here said hake seating himself on a bank of wildflowers which he began to pluck and scatter with an absent air  they will decide to forsake vinland answered heika  you appear to be very sure brother  i am because i have been watching the men for some time past and occasionally leading them on to talk about the matter  which way do you hope they will decide asked hake  i hope they will leave  do you  for my part i care but little  it seems to me that we have as small a chance of escaping from greenland as from this land  brother ye think in this way because you are content to remain where bertha dwells  if bertha were with emma in bonny scotland your wits would be sharp enough to perceive that the voyage from vinland to scotland with an unknown sea between would be a more hazardous venture than a voyage from greenland to scotland with iceland between  that may be true brother but methinks my wits are sharp enough to perceive that neither voyage concerns us seeing that we have no ship and are not likely to succeed in persuading a whale to carry us over  nevertheless replied heika i mean to go over to scotland this summer if i can  hake looked earnestly in his brothers face  from your tones and words said he i know that you have some plan in your head  that have i rejoined heika firmly yet with a look of sadnesslisten hake the thought that i shall never more see emma or my father is more than i can bear  i will now make the effort to escape from greenlandfor well assured am i that we shall soon be there againor die in the attempt  of what value is a thralls life  the plan that i have in my head is this  you know that when in greenland we were often sent out beyond the fiord to fish and to hunt the walrus and the sealsometimes in large sometimes in small boats  the boats on erics fiord are numerous now  the absence of one for a time would not be much noticed  there is a man there whose life i saved not long before we set sail for vinland  he has a good boat which i will borrow take it round to the western skerries to which our men seldom go and there quietly fit it out for a long voyage  when a fitting time arrives i will set sail for scotland  hake shook his head  what wild thoughts are these brother  who ever heard of a man crossing the ocean in a small boat  the thing may be done replied heika  it is risky no doubt but is not everything more or less risky  besides i had rather die than remain in thraldom  he paused and hake gazed at the ground in silence  i see he continued sadly you do not like my project and will not aid me in the enterprise  after all how could i expect that you would be willing to forsake bertha and face so great a danger  hake still continued to gaze in silence and with a strangely perplexed air at the ground  well well hake resumed the other in a tone of reproach i did not expect that ye would go with me on this venture but truly i had counted on your sympathy and counsel as well as your aid  ye do wrong me cried hake suddenly starting up and seizing his brothers hand i not only sympathise with you but i will go with you it is not easy all at once to make up ones mind on a point of such importance  forsake bertha i never will as long as one drop of scottish blood flows in my veins for i know that she loves me though her sense of duty keeps her alooffor which i love her all the more nevertheless i will leave her for a time  i will make this venture with you  if we perish we perish  if we succeed i will return to greenland with a force that will either induce or compel the surrender of my bride  thou art a bold lover said heika smiling  what wilt thou carry her off whether she will or no  not so but i will carry her off whether leif or karlsefin or biarne or thorward or all greenland put together will or no  nay brother that may not be  it were the maddest venture of all  i will run this risk alone  for some time the brothers disputed upon this point and held out against each other pretty stoutly  at length heika reluctantly gave in and it was finally agreed that hake should join him in the proposed attempt to regain his liberty  it did not take long to make the necessary arrangements for leaving vinland  the little colony had not struck its roots very deeply into the soil  they were easily torn out without damage to the feelings of any one for little snorro as krake said was the only creature that had to bid farewell to his native landalways excepting some of the cattle and chickensand he was too young to take it much to heart  in a few weeks the snake and thorwards ship the dragon were loaded with everything that was of value in the colony including much even of the rude furniture of the huts  before leaving karlsefin resolved to give a last grand feast to the savages  he therefore called them together and explained as he best could that he and his friends were going to leave them but that perhaps some of them might return again with large supplies of the gay cloth and ornaments they were so fond of and he recommended them in the meantime to make as large a collection of furs as they could in order to be ready to trade when the white men returned  he then spread before them the most sumptuous feast the land could provide including a large quantity of dairy produce which the savages regarded as the most luxurious of fare  after the feast he presented whitepow utway and powlet with a large quantity of brightcoloured cloth and a few silver and iron ornaments to be distributed among the members of the tribe as they should see fit after helping themselves  he also gave them a few cattle and domestic fowls after which weighing anchors putting out the oars and hoisting their sails the norsemen bade farewell to leifsgaard  as they swept round the point which shut it out from view they gave vent to one vigorous parting cheer which was replied to by the savages with a feeble imitation and a waving of arms  dropping down the river they passed the spit of sand where the first night in vinland had been spent so pleasantly caught an offshore breeze that carried them swiftly beyond the island betwixt which and the shore they had captured the whale and finally leaped out upon the swell of the great ocean  aha now am i at home exclaimed karlsefin with heightened colour and sparkling eyes as he stood at the helm and glanced from the bulging sail to the heaving swell where thorwards dragon was bending over to the breeze about a cables length to leewardnow am i at home once more  so am not i murmured poor bertha whose white face betrayed the miserable emotionsor commotionswithin  all the women we may remark had expressed a desire to keep together during the voyage hence they had embarked in the snake which was a better seaboat than thorwards vessel  of course you are not at home  you are never contented or at home anywhere cried freydissa sharply  hake wished with all his heart that bertha was at home in scotland and that her home was his and snorro who was seated on olafs knee said  never mind berta oos be a tome soon  there was a general laugh at this consolatory remark even bertha smiled faintly as she patted snorros head while astrid and thoranot to mention gudridagreed between themselves that he was the dearest sweetest and in every way the most delightful vinlander that had ever been born  of that there can be no doubt said leif with a laugh since he is the only white vinlander that ever was born  but although the party assembled on the poop indulged at first in a few humorous remarks they soon became silent and sad for they were fast leaving behind them a spot which with all its drawbacks had been a pleasant and happy home for upwards of three years  as they stood leaning on the rails that guarded the poop and gazed regretfully on the lessening hills each recalled many pleasant or stirring incidents which had occurred there incidents which would remainhowever far or long that land might be left behindfor ever engraven on their memories  and long after twilight and distance had concealed the coast from view the norsemen continued to strain their vision towards the horizon mentally bidding a long and last farewell to vinland    chapter twenty six  changes in brattalidthe scots continue to plot and plan  greenland again  flatface standing on the wharf at brattalid anders beside him groups of norse men women and children and skraelingers around and scattered along the bay  what a commotion there was in the colony to be sure when it was discovered that two large ships were sailing up the fiord and what a commotion it created in the breasts of those on board these ships when it was discovered that two other large ships were already at anchor in the harbour  it is not necessary to detain the reader with the details of question and reply by which the truth was at last elicited on both sides suffice it to say that the two ships were found to be merchantvessels from iceland and that among other colonists they had brought out several men whose purpose was to teach and plant the new religion already a small building had been set up with a short tower on the roof which the norsemen were told was a church and in which some of the services of the christian religion were performed  elsewhere several new houses had been built and everywhere there were signs of increasing population and prosperity  leif was half pleased half disappointed at all this  it was gratifying to find things prospering so well but it was not pleasant to see the old place so greatly changed and to have much of the old homefeeling done away  however little was said on the subject  the vinland colonists were too busy at first meeting with relations and old companions and being introduced to new friends to say or think much about the matter  after a few days they became reconciled to the change and settled down into a regular busy life  one evening heika went to the house of his friend edwinsson who owned the boat that he wished to become possessed of  he found that the man was not at home but there was a servingwoman in the house  edwinsson no longer lives here said the girl  he has gone to live with old haraldson and manage his boats for the old man is not able for that work now  do you mean berthas father asked heika  yes haraldson is berthas father  heika went at once to search for his friend  by the way he chanced to meet with his brother  come hake said he i want you to go with me to find edwinsson  with all my heart said hake  they soon came to old haraldsons house which lay at the extreme west of brattalid and when heika opened the door there he saw the old man seated in a large chair propped up with eiderdown pillows  bertha was seated on a stool at his feet holding one of his hands  come in heika she cried springing up and hasting forward with pleasure  i have been trying to tell dear father about the whale you killed in vinland  she stopped abruptly on observing that hake was behind his brother recovering herself quickly however she welcomed him also with a slight blush  i want you heika she continued to tell the story to my father  ay sit down here young man and tell it me said haraldson in a tremulous voice  i love to hear anything about vinland especially what pleases bertha  dear bertha  i have become very frail since she went awayvery frail and it has been a weary timea weary time  but come tell me about the whale  gladly would i do that said heika but i have business with your man edwinssonbusiness which i want to put out of hands at once  but hake will tell the story of the whale  he is a better sagaman than i  let hake tell it then returned the old man  you will find edwinsson somewhere about among my boats  hake gladly sat down beside bertha and began the story of the whale while his brother went down to the beach where he found his friend  edwinsson said heika after some conversation had passed between them you have a good boat near leifs wharf  will you lend it to me  right willingly replied his friend  but i am bound on an excursion that may chance to end in the wreck of the boat said heika  will you hold me responsible if i lose it  twill be difficult to hold thee responsible returned edwinsson laughing if ye lose your life along with it  but that matters not  i gift thee the boat if thou wilt have it  i count it a small gift to the man who saved my life  thanks edwinssonthanks  i accept the gift and if my venture is successful i shall try to let you share the benefit in some way or other  hast discovered a new fishingground heika  what venture do ye intend asked the other  that i will keep secret just now said heika laughing carelessly  i dont want to be followed at first  ye shall know all about it soon but hearken friend make no mention of it  one does not like to be laughed at if one fails you know  so saying heika went off to leifs wharf loosed the boat which he found there hoisted the sail and dropped down with the tide to the mouth of the fiord  here a light breeze was blowing under the influence of which he soon ran round the point of land that divided ericsfiord from heriulfness  in the course of another hour he reached the western skerries  the skerries or islets in question were little better than bare rocks which lay about fifty yards from the mainland along which they formed a sort of breakwater for a distance of nearly a quarter of a mile  within this breakwater there were several narrow and wellsheltered inlets into one of these heika ran his boat and made it fast in a place which was so well overshadowed by rocks that the boat could neither be seen from the land nor from the sea  on the landward side this inlet could be reached by a path which though it appeared somewhat rugged was nevertheless easy to traverse up this path heika hastened after making the boat fast intending to return to brattalid by land  the distance over land was much shorter than by water so that he could soon reach leifs house and his brief absence would attract no attention  just as the scot issued from behind the rocks which concealed the path to the inlet he was suddenly bereft almost of the power to move by the unexpected sight of leif himself advancing towards him  poor heikas heart died within him  he felt that all his longcherished and deeplylaid plans were crushed just as they were about to be carried into effect and a feeling of fierce despair prompted him for a moment to commit some wild deed of violence but he observed that leifs head was bent forward and his eyes rested on the ground as he advanced slowly like one who meditates  heika drew swiftly back behind the rock from the shelter of which he had barely passed and breathed freely again when leif passed by without showing any symptom of having observed him  waiting till he had sauntered beyond the next turn in the path he started at his utmost speed and was soon beyond the reach of leifs eyes and back in brattalid with a relieved mind  had the scot waited to observe the motions of his master after passing the turn in the path above mentioned he would not have experienced so much mental relief for no sooner had leif got behind a small but thick bush than he turned abruptly raised his head with an intelligent smile lay down behind the bush and looked quietly through its foliage  he saw heika issue from behind the rock observed his cautious glances from side to side and with something like a chuckle witnessed his rapid flight in the direction of the settlement  hem something i the wind muttered leif rising and walking towards the spot whence his thrall had issued  he found the rugged path descended to the inlet discovered the boat and stood looking at it with a perplexed air for full ten minutes thereafter he shook his head once or twice smiled in a grave manner and slowly sauntered home absorbed in meditation  hake whispered heika to his brother that night as they sat down together in the little sleepingcloset off leifs hall that had been allotted to their use all my hopes and plans were on the point of being ruined today  ruined brother  how was that  heika related to him all that had occurred at the inlet near the western skerries  art thou sure he saw thee not asked hake earnestly  there can be no doubt of that replied heika for he had no cause to suspect that anything was wrong and if he had seen me as i first stood before him motionless with surprise he would doubtless have hailed me no no something was working very hard in his brain for he passed on without the least sign of having seen me  that is well brother yet i do not feel easy for it is wellknown that leif is a shrewd man with great command over his feelings  but now tell me how best i shall aid you in this enterprise  that is best done by using your bow well for we shall require a large supply of dried meat for the voyage and we must work diligently as well as secretly during our few hours of leisure if we would get ready in time to sail before the rough winds of autumn set in  there are some tight casks in leifs old store which i mean to take possession of at the last for water  our service will more than pay for these and any other trifles we may find it needful to appropriate  hake thought in his heart that the enterprise was a wild and foolish one but having promised to engage in it he resolved not to cast the slightest hindrance in the way or to say a single word of discouragement  he therefore approved of all that heika suggested and said that he would give his aid most vigorously  moreover he continued i have had some consolation today which will spur me on for i have got bertha to admit that she loves me and to promise that if i can obtain my freedom she will wed me  she even gave me to understand that she would wed me as a thrall if only leif and karlsefin would give their consent  but that shall not be  bertha shall never be a thralls bride  i will return and claim her as i have said  heika made no reply but continued to gaze at the floor in silence  methinks ye are perplexed by something brother said hake  i am thinking replied heika that it is a pity we cannot use those curious marks made on skins wherewith we are told men can communicate one with another when they are absent from each other  what causes the regret just now  i grudge to quit leif without a parting word returned heika looking at his brother with peculiar earnestness it seems so ungrateful so unkind to one who has ever treated us well  i think with you in that brother said hake  it would be so easy too continued heika to have some method of letting him know what i think if we could only agree about the signs or signals beforehand  hake laughed softly  that would not be easy for we could scarcely go to him and say leif when you see these particular marks on a certain stone you are to understand that we take leave of you for ever with hearty goodwill  i fear that his suspicions might be aroused thereby  nay but i only express regret that we have not some such mode of intercourse returned heika smiling  ye know the sign of the split arrow which tells of war  why might we not multiply such signs  for instance by laying a billet of firewood across a mans bed one might signify that he bade him farewell with tender affection and goodwill  why brother said hake laughing ye look at me as earnestly as if you had said something smart whereas i regard your idea as but a clumsy one  a billet of wood laid across your friends bed might more fitly suggest that you wanted to knock out his brains or damage his skin or burn him alive  heika laughed heartily and said that he feared he had nothing of the spirit of the skald about him and that his power of invention was not great  but i have more news to give thee brother besides that regarding bertha said hake  do you know there is a countryman of ours on board of one of the ships that brought out the men of the new religion and he has but lately seen our father and emma  heika started and laid his hand on his brothers arm while he gazed earnestly into his face  it is ill jesting on such a subject he said somewhat sternly  so think i brother therefore i recommend you not to jest returned hake gravely  nay but is it true  ay true as that the sky is over our heads  i have had a long talk with him and when he found i was a countryman he gave me a hug that made my ribs bend  his name is sawneysson a very giant of a man with hair that might have grown on the back of a greenland bear only that it is red instead of white  he told me that he knew our father well by sight and last saw him taking a ramble on dunedin hill whither he had walked from our village on the forth which shows that the old mans vigour has improved  emma was with him too so sawneysson said looking beautiful but somewhat sad  how knew he her name asked heika  he knew it not replied hake  he did but say that a fair maiden walked with our father and i knew at once from his description that it was emma  but you can inquire for yourself at his own mouth for this countryman of ours is an enthusiastic fellow and fond of talking about home  brother said heika with a sad but earnest look i must give this man the cold shoulder  nay then disappointment must have changed thee much said hake in surprise for that is the last thing i had expected thee to say  it is not disappointment but caution that makes me speak and think as i do  if we seem to be too eager about our native land it may tend to make leif more watchful of us which of all things would be the greatest misfortune that could befall us just at this time  there is something in that returned hake but will it not suffice to exercise a little caution and selfrestraint without giving our countryman the cold shoulder  i know not replied heika with a troubled air but i would that he had not turned up just now though i confess it gladdens me to hear of our father and emmanow hake we must to bed if we would be up betimes to secure a little leisure for the carrying out of our enterprise  without further conversation the brothers threw off their coats and shoes and lay down together with the rest of their clothing on so as to be ready for an early start  the shield and helmet of each hung on the wall just over the bed and their two swords leaned against the bed itself within reach of their hands for thus guardedly did men deem it necessary to take their rest in the warlike days of old    chapter twenty seven  disappointment terminates in unlookedfor success and the saga comes to an end  during some weeks after the events narrated in the last chapter the scottish brothers continued quietly stealthily and steadily to collect provisions and all things necessary for the projected voyage across the atlantic  during the same period the general business of the settlement was prosecuted with activity  the christian missionaries not only instructed the people in the new faith and baptised those that believed but assisted and guided them in the building of huts and houses the planning of wharves and the laying out of townships see note at end of chapter while the crews of the two recently arrived ships having found it necessary to make up their minds to winter in greenland busied themselves in collecting fats oil skins feathers etcetera to be packed and got ready for shipment in the following spring  karlsefin also made preparations for a voyage in spring to iceland and thorward biarne krake and the other vinland heroes assisted in that work or in some other of the multifarious duties that had to be attended to in the colony while olaf undertook the responsible duty of superintending the education mental and physical of that rampant little vinlander snorro the son of karlsefin  leif ericsson exercised a sort of general superintendence of the whole colony  it seemed to be tacitly agreed on and admitted that he was the national chief or governor and as no one was disposed to dispute his claim to that position all was peace and harmony  nevertheless there was something unusual in leifs manner at that time which rather perplexed his friends and quite puzzled anders his majordomo  that free and easy individual could not understand the dreamy moods into which his master fell still less could he comprehend the gleams of quiet humour and expressions of intense seriousness with other contradictory appearances which occasionally manifested themselves in leifs visage and demeanour  it was plain that there was much on his mind and that much of that was gay as well as grave  anders made several attempts to find out what was the matter but was met at one time with grave evasion at another with quiet jocularity which left him as wise as before  towards the scottish brothers leif maintained an unvarying aspect of reserve which filled them with uneasiness but with the female members of his household and the children he was all gentleness and often playful  leif said karlsefin to him one day it appears to me that something weighs on your mind or else ye have left some of your wits in vinland  think ye not that the cares of such a large and growing colony are sufficient to account for any new wrinkles that may appear on my brow replied leif with a peculiar smile and a glance from the corner of his eye  well i daresay that might account for it and yet things are swimming on so well that these cares do not seem to be much increased  sometimes domestic cares trouble a man more than public ones karlsefin  look at thy friend thorward now  tis little that he would care for a mountain of outside troubles on his broad shoulders if he might only drop them when he crossed the threshold of his own door  that is true returned the other if a man have not peace in his own house there is no peace for him on earth  nevertheless my friend thorward is not in such a bad case  freydissa has improved vastly of late and thorward has also grown more amiable and less contradictions add to which he and she love each other dearly  but leif there can be no domestic troubles in your case for your household is well ordered  thank god there are none said leif seriously  it was the first time that leif had used that expression and his friend heard it with some surprise and pleasure but said nothing  still continued leif i am not destitute of troubles  has not that thrall hake overturned the peace of my sweet kinswoman bertha  the girl loves the thralli can see that as plain as i can see the vane on yonder mastheadand there is no cure for love  karlsefin looked earnestly at his friend as if about to speak but observing the stern frown on leifs countenance he forbore  in a minute or so karlsefin remarked quietly that hake was a faithful thrall  im not so sure of that as ye seem to be returned leif with increasing sternness but whether faithful or not no thrall shall ever wed bertha  what is that you say about bertha asked biarne coming up just then  nothing of moment replied leif  what news bring you biarne for that ye bring news is plain by the glance of your eye  my eye is an incorrigible telltale cried biarne laughing however it has not much to tell at present  only that you are about to receive a visit from some old friends and that anders will have to keep his kettles full for some time to come  a band of skraelingers are  but here they come to speak for themselves  at that moment a troop of the greenland savages came round the point the identical point where they had received such a terrible shock some years beforewith flatface dancing joyously in front of them  flatface had heard of their coming had gone out to meet them had found several of his relations among them and was now returning scarce able to contain himself with delight as he made their mouths water by dilating at great length on the delicious things contained in anderss capacious kettles  while leif and the others went to meet the skraelingers heika and his brother sat in their own sleepingcloset talking in a low tone and making the final arrangements for their flight  now are ye sure that all is on boardnothing omitted asked hake for it will be hard to obtain anything once we are out on the sea and we cant well return to fetch what we have forgotten  all is ready answered heika sadly  i cannot tell how much it grieves me to go away in this fashion but freedom must be regained at any price  now remember meet me exactly when the moon shows its upper edge above the sea tonight  not later and not sooner for the longer ye can remain about the hall the less likely will any one be to inquire after me  i will be sure not to fail you but heika is that not a little too late  the floodtide will be past and if there is any sea on it will be ill passing the skerries many of which are but little covered even at high water  trust me hake it will not be too late  be sure that ye come no soonerelse evil may ensue  my heart sinks when i think of bertha said hake with a deep sigh it will seem so cold so hard so unaccountable to leave her without one word one farewell  think better of it brother said heika eagerly i am prepared to start alone even now  never exclaimed hake flushingwhat shall i draw back like a coward at the last moment after pledging my word to go and shall i leave you to face this enterprise alone  nay heika we have suffered for many years together we shall triumph now togetheror perish  my poor brother said heika grasping hakes hand and kissing it with deep feelingbut go now to the hall and leave me i hear them laying the tables for supper  the window is easily removed i will hasten at once and get things ready  take good care not to reenter this closet after leaving it for the carls are moving about the hall and may chance to observe that it is empty  be circumspect brother  they squeezed hands again and hake went into the hall where he mingled with the housecarls and chatted carelessly about the events of the day  the instant he was gone heika rose and removed the parchment window took a billet of firewood and laid it across the bed then leaping out he walked smartly towards the west end of the village  it was beginning to grow dark and few of the people were about  to those whom he passed heika nodded familiarly but did not stop  the moment he had rounded the cliff which hid brattalid from view he ran westward at full speed  meanwhile supper was laid in the hall and all were awaiting the entrance of the master of the house and karlsefin but there was no appearance of either  after a quarter of an hour had passed and they were beginning to wonder what had become of them the door opened and biarne entered saying that leif had sent him to say that as he had business which would keep him out late they were not to wait supper for him  hake began to feel somewhat uneasy at this and when supper was finished he resolved to leave the house a little before the appointed time  for that purpose he entered the sleepingcloset intending to pass out by the window  the first thing that caught his eye was the billet of firewood lying across the bed  his heart almost stood still at the sight for this coupled with heikas display of deep feeling and their recent conversation about signs caused the truth to flash upon him  with one bound he passed through the window and flew westward like the windround the point over the ridge and down towards the appointed rendezvous at the skerries  but to return to heika  when he neared the inlet he changed his pace to a rapid walk and glanced cautiously from side to side to make quite sure that he was not observed by any one who might chance to have wandered in that direction  now it is a wellknown fact in the affairs of this world that many strange things occur in a most unaccountable manner  who can tell how it was or why it was that just a few minutes before heika approached the inlet from the landward side a small boat entered it from the seaward side out of which stepped leif ericsson and karlsefin  they drew their boat into a corner in deep shadow and then going to another corner also in deep shadow sat down on a ledge of rock without uttering a single word  they had never been in that inlet before had never seen it probably never thought of it before yet there they were quietly seated in it and just in the nick of time  from the place where they sat neither their own boat nor leifs could be seenonly the landward opening of the inlet  presently approaching footsteps were heard  the two friends rose  a moment later and heika stood before them  he stopped abruptly on beholding them and his eyes blazed with astonishment rage and despair  suddenly he looked round as if in search of a weapon or of a way of escape  be wise lad said leif kindly yet very gravely no evil will come of it if ye are wise and take your misfortunes like a man  heika was subdued by the gentle tone  he crossed his arms on his heaving chest and stood erect before them with his head slightly drooped and a look of profound sadness rather than disappointment on his countenance  come hither heika said leif pointing seaward i have somewhat to show thee  they went down the beach till they stood beside the boat which was ready for sea  this is a strange sight he continued here is an excellent boat well found well loaded well busked in every way for a long voyage knowest thou aught in regard to it heika  i know answered the scot bitterly that if ye had come hither only halfanhour later that boat would have been on its way with me to scotland  what with you alone  aywith me alone  that is strange said leif somewhat perplexed i had fancied that you brothers loved each other passing well but i suppose that a man who can be guilty of ingratitude is not to be much depended on in the matter of affection  heika winced at these wordsnot that the charge of ingratitude affected him but he could not submit calmly to the unjust supposition that in his contemplated flight he had been actuated by selfish indifference to his brother  at the same time he would not condescend to give any explanation of his conduct  drawing himself up he looked leif full in the face  norseman he said small is the gratitude i owe to thee  tis true ye have treated me and my brother kindly since we came hither and for that i owe thee thanks and would gladly have paid this debt before leaving had such been consistent with flight but kindness however great is not a worthy price for liberty and when king olaf tryggvisson sent me to thee i made no promise to sell my liberty at such a price but in regard to hake  ay in regard to hake go on why dost thou stop said leif in a stern tone  there is some truth in what ye say about gratitude but what of hake  the scot still remained silent with his lips compressed and dropped his eyes sternly on the ground  this seems to me a bad business said karlsefin who had hitherto listened with an expression of anxiety and disappointment gradually deepening on his countenance  i had thought better of thee heika surely hakes longing to be free and in his own native land must be to the full as strong as thine  i am puzzled moreover for two were better than one in the mad voyage ye thought to undertake  heika smiled at this  truly he said my brother loves his native land and freedom nevertheless he prefers bondage to freedom and greenland to his native land  and yet would he fain have sacrificed his preference and resigned his bondage out of love to me if i would have allowed him  resigned his bondage heika exclaimed leif  ye speak in riddles man what mean you  instead of replying the scot looked at leif with an intelligent smile and held up his forefinger as if to call attention  at the same moment the sound as if of some one running at full speed was heard faintly in the distance  leif and karlsefin looked at the scot in surprise  it is my brother he said sadly  in a few seconds the steps were close at hand  leif seized karlsefin by the arm and dragged him swiftly under the deep shadow of the cliffs just as hake came through the narrow opening with such a rush that on seeing heika he could not avoid plunging violently into his extended arms  was this right in thee brother he cried laying his hand on heikas shoulder on recovering himself was it wise to treat me thus like a child  it was kindly meant said heika much perplexed as to how he should act in existing circumstances  kindly meant exclaimed hake vehemently  ay well do i know that yet it was not wisely kind to forsake me after promising to take me with you when ye knew that i did but leave bertha for a time and meant to come back and win or demand her from  hush brother hush cried heika laying his hand on the others mouth  whatever i thought or meant to do matters little now for i have found it impossible to undertake this voyage after all  impossible echoed hake why what craven spirit has come over thee is not the boat ready am not i ready and is not the opportunity favourable  all is ready no doubt replied heika hesitating but  but the truth is cried leif as he and karlsefin issued from their place of concealment laughing heartily the truth is that the opportunity is not favourable for i have some objection to either of you leaving me at presentthough the objection is not so strong but that it might give way if ye desired it greatly  come hither all of you  he went a few steps towards the boat and pointing to it saidtell me hake for thou art not a bad counsellor at need dost think that vessel there is a sufficiently large one to venture a voyage in it on these northern seas at this time of year  it is large enough for men who would be free replied hake moodily for his astonishment on first beholding his master had given place to deep mortification now that he perceived his brothers hopes and plans were frustrated  nay as to being free returned leif with a laugh thy brother hinted not long ago something about thy preference for thraldom in regard to which i now perceive some glimmering of reason but i ask thee for a matteroffact opinion  dost think there would be much risk in the voyage thy brother contemplated  there would be some risk doubtless yet not so much but that we would have run it for the sake of freedom  hm  in my opinion it would have been a mad venture rejoined leif what say you karlsefin  a useless venture as well as mad he replied for death not freedom would have been the end of it  so i think returned leif and that is my only objection to your undertaking it hake  nevertheless if you and heika are still willing to venture ye may do so  there lies the boat a fair wind is blowing outside get on board shove off hoist the sail and away to bonny scotland if you will for i grant you freedom to go  it is ill to jest with thralls said heika looking sternly at his master  nay i do not jestnor are ye thralls replied leif assuming a look and tone of unwonted seriousness  give me your attention friends and thou karlsefin take note of what i say for i care not to talk much on this subject until my mind is more clear upon it  my opinion is that this new religion which we hear so much of just now is true  it is of godnot of man and i believe that jesus christ my lord has come in the flesh to save his people from their sins  many things have led me to this opinion in regard to which i will not speak  i have thought and heard much for some years past and woefully have i been staggered as well as helped on by the men who have been sent to greenland with the good news  some have by their conduct squaring with their profession led me to believe  others have by their conduct belying their profession hindered me  but the lord himself has led me into a certain measure of light and there is one law of his in particular which just now comes home to me with much power namely thiswhatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so unto them  this law i am persuaded is of god  long have i lived and never before have i seen it acted on till these christians came amongst us  they do not indeed always practise as they teach but they are imperfect therefore they cannot practise fully as they teach because they teach perfection  this law i shall henceforth follow as i best can  i follow it today  if i were in thraldom to you heika just now i would wish you to set me free therefore i now set you and your brother free  the rule is very simple of application it only wants a willing spirit  and let me addye have to thank the lord not me for your freedom  the brothers stood speechless with surprise on hearing this but karlsefin grasped leifs hand and said very earnestlyye have done well brother  long have i thought to urge thee to this and frequently have i asked of him that it might be as it has turned out  now my prayer is answered  but what say heika and hake to this  never mind what they say returned leif brusquely  doubtless their thoughts interfere with their speech at present  and hark ee all as i said before i desire to have no further talk at present on this point  ye are welcome to tell whom ye please what i have said and what i have done and why i have done itthere let the matter rest  so now heika and hake he added in a gay tone i mean what i say  there lies the boat and ye are free to go if it please you  only if ye will accept my advice you will make up your minds to spend this winter in greenland as my guests and in spring there will be better weather and a more fitting craft to carry you over the sea to scotland  meanwhile hake will have ample opportunity to woo win and wedwithout demandingthe fair bertha  need we say that the brothers gladly accepted this generous invitation and endeavoured in spite of leifs prohibition to express their gratitude in a few earnest though broken sentences  great was the surprise that night in brattalid when it was made known that leif ericsson had given freedom to his thralls out of regard to the christian religion  leif afterwards told his friends that it was out of regard to the founder of that religion but it was long before many of the people could see a distinction in that  numerous were the theological discussions too which this act of emancipation called forth in every household and great was the joy which it created in one or two hearts  to say nothing of the young scots themselves it caused the heart of timid little bertha to sing for joy while gudrid astrid and thora rejoiced sympathetically and looked forward with pleasant anticipation to the approaching marriage  even freydissa opened out in a new light on the occasion and congratulated her handmaiden heartily telling her with real sincerity that marriage was the only thing she was fit for  but it was olaf who displayed the greatest amount of feeling on the occasion and it was snorro on whom he expended himself  on the morning after the great event he hoisted snorro on his back with his wonted care and tenderness and hurried off with him to the solitude of the seashorefor alas there were no umbrageous solitudes in greenland  there not far from the spot where flatface and his friends had once been made to wriggle their coattails with terror he set snorro down and sitting on a rock beside him said  now old man it is going to have a talk with me  iss replied snorro very contentedly  does it know what has happened to hake and heika  snorro shook his head  well my father has set them both free  bof fee repeated snorro with a puzzled look  yes both  wats fee asked snorro  olaf was greatly perplexed for he knew not how to convey an idea of the meaning of that word to his little friend  he made various attempts however by means of simple illustrations and words to explain it but without successas was made plain by snorros usually intelligent countenance remaining a perfect blank  at last he seized the child by both wrists and held him fast for a few seconds  snorro he said you are not free while i hold you  now he added releasing the wrists you are free  snorros countenance was no longer blank but on the contrary extremely perplexed  leif he said no hold heika an hake by e hands  no replied olaf but he holds them by the spirit  wats spiwit asked snorro  olaf was in despair  well well he cried after stroking his chin and pulling his nose and knuckling his forehead in the vain hope of hitting on some other mode of explaining his meaning it dont matter old man  they are free and that has made them very happy and oh  i am very glad because i am so fond of hake  dont you remember how he came to save us from the skraelingers and nearly did it too  and he is going to be married to bertha  isnt that nice  it knows what married means dont it  no said snorro  well no matter its what seems to make everybody very happy and bertha is very happy and so am i for im fond of bertha as well as of hake and so is snorro isnt he  iss replied snorro with a very decided nod  well thats all very pleasant continued olaf running on with the subject until it led him into another subject which led him into a third and fourth and so on with the evervarying moods of his gay and fanciful mind until he was led in spirit to vinland where he and snorro remained lost in the woods perfectly contented and happy for the remainder of the day  and now patient reader we must lead you in spirit away from the scenes on which we have dwelt so long across the wide ocean to scotland  there on the heights of a lionlike hill stand heika and hake  a precipitous crag rises behind them  in front towers a rock from which edwins castle frowns down on the huts of an embryo city  the undulating woodland between resounds with the notes of the huntsmans horn  away in the distance lie the clear waters of the fiord of forth and the background of scotias highland hills mingling with the sky  the brothers stand in rapt and silent admiration of the scene as well they may for it is surpassingly beautiful  but they do not stand alone  bertha leans on hakes arm and a tall girl with dark hair leans on heikas  beside them stands a finelooking though somewhat delicate old man whose benignant gaze seems to be more attracted by the young people than the scenery  need we say that this is the scottish earl the father of our fleetfooted thralls and that the darkhaired girl is emma  we will not violate your sense of propriety gentle reader by talking of mrs heika nor will we venture to make reference to the little heikas left at home  but these are not all the party  karlsefin biarne and thorward are thereon a visit to the earlwith gudrid and freydissa and away on the fiord they can see their two norse galleys towering like quaint giants at rest among the small craft that ply and skim about there  shall we listen to what our friends say  we think not  too long already have we caused them to break the silence which they have maintained for the last eight hundred years  let us rather bid their shades depart with a kind farewell  but before the memory of them is quite gone let us say a word or two in conclusion  whether the norsemen ever returned again to vinland is a matter of uncertainty for the saga is silent on that point and it is to be feared that snorro the first american did not return to take possession of his native land for when the great continent was rediscovered about five hundred years later only redskins were found there and the pilgrim fathers make no mention of having met with descendants of any colony of white men  what ultimately became of snorro and olaf is we regret to say unknown this however is certain that karlsefin according to his oftexpressed intention retired to iceland where he dwelt happily with gudrid leif biarne and thorward for many years  it is therefore probable that snorro and olaf took to a seafaring life which was almost the only life open to enterprising men in those days  if they did they distinguished themselvesthere can be no doubt whatever upon that point  as to the other personages who have figured in our tale we can only surmiseat least hopethat they lived long and happily for the saga relates nothing as to the end of their respective careers  but of this we are quite sure that wherever they went or however long they lived they never failed to retain a lively recollection of that romantic period of their lives when they sojourned in the pleasant groves of vinlandthat mighty continent which all unsuspected by these men of old was destined in the course of time to play such a grand and important part in the worlds history  thus ends all that we have got to tell of the adventures of the norsemen in the west and the discovery of america before columbus  the end    note  an important christian colony existed in greenland for nearly 400 yearsfrom some time in the tenth to near the end of the fourteenth centurya colony in which in the fourteenth century there were 190 townships and a town called garda in which were a cathedral bishops seat and twelve or thirteen churches besides other christian establishments with a regular succession of bishops for their superintendence of whom seventeen are named in the sagas  this colony strange to say was obliterated no one knew how or when and its very existence was forgotten by the civilised world  it was chronicled however in the icelandic sagas and brought to light by antiquaries of the highest authority  the statistical details given by the sagas have been corroborated by the actual discovery in greenland in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries of vast ecclesiastical and other buildings  these are facts which do not admit of reasonable doubtso writes samuel laing in his translation of the heimskringla or chronicle of the kings of norway volume one page 141
