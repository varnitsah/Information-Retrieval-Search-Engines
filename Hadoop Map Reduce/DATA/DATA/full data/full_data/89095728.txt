       manet alt√¢ mente repostum                                    amboyna   the tragedy of amboyna as it was justly termed by the english of the seventeenth century was of itself too dreadful to be heightened by the mimic horrors of the stage the reader may be reminded that by three several treaties in the years 1613 1615 and 1619 it was agreed betwixt england and holland that the english should enjoy onethird of the trade of the spice islands for this purpose factories were established on behalf of the english east india company at the molucca islands at banda and at amboyna at the latter island the dutch had a castle with a garrison both of europeans and natives it has been always remarked that the dutchman in his eastern settlements loses the mercantile probity of his european character while he retains its coldblooded phlegm and avaricious selfishness of this the amboyna government gave a notable proof about the 11th of feb 1622 old stile under pretence of a plot laid between the english of the factory and some japanese soldiers to seize the castle the former were arrested by the dutch and subjected to the most horrible tortures to extort confession of their pretended guilt upon some they poured water into a cloth previously secured round their necks and shoulders until suffocation ensued others were tortured with lighted matches and torches applied to the most tender and sensible parts of the body but i will not pollute my page with this monstrous and disgusting detail upon confessions inconsistent with each other with common sense and ordinary probability extorted also by torments of the mind or body or both captain gabriel towerson and nine other english merchants of consideration were executed and to add insult to atrocity the bloody cloth on which towerson kneeled at his death was put down to the account of the english company the reader may find the whole history in the second volume of purchass pilgrim the news of this horrible massacre reached king james while he was negociating with the dutch concerning the assistance which they then implored against the spaniards and the affairs of his soninlaw the elector palatine appeared to render an union with holland so peremptorily necessary that the massacre of amboyna was allowed to remain unrevenged  but the dutch war which was declared in 1672 the object of which seems to have been the annihilation of the united provinces as an independent state a century sooner than providence had decreed that calamitous event met with great opposition in england and every engine was put to work to satisfy the people of the truth of the lord chancellor shaftesburys averment that the states of holland were englands eternal enemies both by interest and inclination dryden with the avowed intention of exasperating the nation against the dutch assumed from choice or by command the unpromising subject of the amboyna massacre as the foundation of the following play exclusive of the horrible nature of the subject the colours are laid on too thick to produce the desired effect the monstrous caricatures which are exhibited as just paintings of the dutch character unrelieved even by the grandeur of wickedness and degraded into actual brutality must have produced disgust instead of an animated hatred and detestation for the horrible spectacle of tortures and mangled limbs exhibited on the stage the author might plead the custom of his age a stage direction in ravenscrofts alteration of titus andronicus bears a curtain drawn discovers the heads and hands of demetrius and chiron hanging up against the wall their bodies in chairs in bloody linen and in an interlude called the cruelty of the spaniards in peru written by davenant a doleful pavin is played to prepare the change of the scene which represents a dark prison at a great distance and farther to the view are discerned racks and other engines of torment with which the spaniards are tormenting the natives and english mariners who may be supposed to be lately landed there to discover the coast two spaniards are likewise discovered sitting in their cloaks and appearing more solemn in ruffs with rapiers and daggers by their sides the one turning a spit while the other is basting an indian prince who is roasted at an artificial fire1 the rape of isabinda is stated by langbaine to have been borrowed from a novel in the decamerone of cinthio giraldi  this play is beneath criticism and i can hardly hesitate to term it the worst production dryden ever wrote it was acted and printed in 1673   footnote 1 this extraordinary kitchen scene did not escape the ridicule of the    wits of that merry age           o greater cruelty yet          like a pig upon a spit      here lies one there another boiled to jelly          just as the people stare          at an ox in the fair      roasted whole with a pudding ins belly           a little further in          hung a third by his chin

                       the right honourable                                   the                              lord clifford                                    of                              chudleigh1   my lord  after so many favours and those so great conferred on me by your lordship these many yearswhich i may call more properly one continued act of your generosity and goodnessi know not whether i should appear either more ungrateful in my silence or more extravagantly vain in my endeavours to acknowledge them for since all acknowledgements bear a face of payment it may be thought that i have flattered myself into an opinion of being able to return some part of my obligements to youthe just despair of which attempt and the due veneration i have for his person to whom i must address have almost driven me to receive only with a profound submission the effects of that virtue which is never to be comprehended but by admiration and the greatest note of admiration is silence it is that noble passion to which poets raise their audience in highest subjects and they have then gained over them the greatest victory when they are ravished into a pleasure which is not to be expressed by words to this pitch my lord the sense of my gratitude had almost raised me to receive your favours as the jews of old received their law with a mute wonder to think that the loudness of acclamation was only the praise of men to men and that the secret homage of the soul was a greater mark of reverence than an outward ceremonious joy which might be counterfeit and must be irreverent in its tumult neither my lord have i a particular right to pay you my acknowledgements you have been a good so universal that almost every man in the three nations may think me injurious to his propriety that i invade your praises in undertaking to celebrate them alone and that i have assumed to myself a patron who was no more to be circumscribed than the sun and elements which are of public benefit to human kind  as it was much in your power to oblige all who could pretend to merit from the public so it was more in your nature and inclination if any went illsatisfied from the treasury while it was in your lordships management it proclaimed the want of desert and not of friends you distributed your masters favour with so equal hands that justice herself could not have held the scales more even but with that natural propensity to do good that had that treasure been your own your inclination to bounty must have ruined you no man attended to be denied no man bribed for expedition want and desert were pleas sufficient by your own integrity and your prudent choice of those whom you employed the king gave all that he intended and gratuities to his officers made not vain his bounty this my lord you were in your public capacity of high treasurer to which you ascended by such degrees that your royal master saw your virtues still growing to his favours faster than they could rise to you both at home and abroad with your sword and with your counsel you have served him with unbiassed honour and unshaken resolution making his greatness and the true interest of your country the standard and measure of your actions fortune may desert the wise and brave but true virtue never will forsake itself2 it is the interest of the world that virtuous men should attain to greatness because it gives them the power of doing good but when by the iniquity of the times they are brought to that extremity that they must either quit their virtue or their fortune they owe themselves so much as to retire to the private exercise of their honourto be great within and by the constancy of their resolutions to teach the inferior world how they ought to judge of such principles which are asserted with so generous and so unconstrained a trial  but this voluntary neglect of honours has been of rare example in the world3 few men have frowned first upon fortune and precipitated themselves from the top of her wheel before they felt at least the declination of it we read not of many emperors like dioclesian and charles the fifth who have preferred a garden and a cloister before a crowd of followers and the troublesome glory of an active life which robs the possessor of his rest and quiet to secure the safety and happiness of others seneca with the help of his philosophy could never attain to that pitch of virtue he only endeavoured to prevent his fall by descending first and offered to resign that wealth which he knew he could no longer hold he would only have made a present to his master of what he foresaw would become his prey he strove to avoid the jealousy of a tyrantyou dismissed yourself from the attendance and privacy of a gracious king our age has afforded us many examples of a contrary nature but your lordship is the only one of this it is easy to discover in all governments those who wait so close on fortune that they are never to be shaken off at any turn such who seem to have taken up a resolution of being great to continue their stations on the theatre of business to change with the scene and shift the vizard for another partthese men condemn in their discourses that virtue which they dare not practise but the sober part of this present age and impartial posterity will do right both to your lordship and to them and when they read on what accounts and with how much magnanimity you quitted those honours to which the highest ambition of an english subject could aspire will apply to you with much more reason what the historian said of a roman emperor multi diutius imperium tenuerunt nemo fortius reliquit  to this retirement of your lordship i wish i could bring a better entertainment than this play which though it succeeded on the stage will scarcely bear a serious perusal it being contrived and written in a month the subject barren the persons low and the writing not heightened with many laboured scenes the consideration of these defects ought to have prescribed more modesty to the author than to have presented it to that person in the world for whom he has the greatest honour and of whose patronage the best of his endeavours had been unworthy but i had not satisfied myself in staying longer and could never have paid the debt with a much better play as it is the meanness of it will shew at least that i pretend not by it to make any manner of return for your favours and that i only give you a new occasion of exercising your goodness to me in pardoning the failings and imperfections of    my lord      your lordships       most humble most obliged         most obedient servant           john dryden   footnotes 1 sir thomas clifford just then created lord clifford of chudleigh    and appointed lord high treasurer was one of the six ministers    the initials of whose names furnished the word cabal by which    their junto was distinguished he was the most virtuous and honest    of the junto but a catholic and what was then synonymous a warm    advocate for arbitrary power he is said to have won his promotion    by advising the desperate measure of shutting the exchequer in    1671 the hint of which he is said to have stolen from shaftesbury    this piece may have been undertaken by his command for even at    the very time of the triple alliance he is reported to have said    for all this we must have another dutch war upon the defection    of lord shaftesbury from the court party and the passing of the    test act lord clifford resigned his office retired to the    country and died in september 1673 shortly after receiving this    dedication  2 in this case drydens praise which did not always occur survived    the temporary occasion even in a little satirical effusion he    tells us       clifford was fierce and brave     clifford had been comptroller and treasurer of the household and    one of the commissioners of the treasury he had served in the    dutch wars  3 alluding to lord cliffords resignation of an office he could not    hold without a change of religion                                   prologue     this poem was written as far back as 1662 and was then termed a                       satire against the dutch    as needy gallants in the scriveners hands   court the rich knave that gripes their mortgaged lands   the first fat buck of all the seasons sent   and keeper takes no fee in compliment   the dotage of some englishmen is such   to fawn on those who ruin themthe dutch   they shall have all rather than make a war   with those who of the same religion are   the straits the guinea trade the herrings too   nay to keep friendship they shall pickle you   some are resolved not to find out the cheat   but cuckold like love him who does the feat   what injuries soeer upon us fall   yet still the same religion answers all   religion wheedled you to civil war   drew english blood and dutchmens now would spare   be gulled no longer for youll find it true   they have no more religion faiththan you   interests the god they worship in their state   and you i take it have not much of that   well monarchies may own religions name   but states are atheists in their very frame   they share a sin and such proportions fall   that like a stink tis nothing to them all   how they love england you shall see this day   no map shews holland truer than our play   their pictures and inscriptions well we know1   we may be bold one medal sure to show   view then their falsehoods rapine cruelty   and think what once they were they still would be   but hope not either language plot or art   twas writ in haste but with an english heart   and least hope wit in dutchmen that would be   as much improper as would honesty

fisc these i confess are pretty tricks but will not do our business we must ourselves be ruined at long run if they have any trade here i know our charge at length will eat us out i would not let

thats my maxim  van her nay brother i am not too obstinate for saving englishmen twas but a qualm of conscience which profit will dispel i have as true a dutch antipathy to england as the proudest he in amsterdam thats a bold word now  har we are secure of our superiors there well they may give the king of great britain a verbal satisfaction and with submissive fawning promises make shew to punish

faces shewed the difference betwixt their country and ours for they look in spain as if they were roasted and in england as if they were sodden  jul ill not believe your description  fisc yet our observations of them in holland are not much unlike it ive known a great don at the hague with the gentleman of his horse his major domo and two secretaries all dine at four tables on the quarters of a single pullet the victuals of the under servants were weighed out in ounces by the don himself with so much garlic in the other scale a thin slice of bacon went through the family a week together for it was daily put into the pot for pottage was served in the midst of the dish at dinners and taken out and weighed by the steward at the end of every meal to see how much it lost till at length looking at it against the sun it appeared transparent and then he would have whipped it up as his own fees at a morsel but that his lord barred the dice and reckoned it to him for a part of his board wages  beam in few words madam the general notion we had of them was that they were very frugal of their spanish coin and very liberal of their neapolitan  jul i see gentlemen you are in the way of

of you i know not how truly that for your fishery at home youre like dogs in the manger you will neither manage it yourselves nor permit your neighbours so that for your sovereignty of the narrow seas if the inhabitants of them the herrings were capable of being judges they would certainly award it to the english because they were then sure to live undisturbed and quiet under you  beam very good proceed sir  fisc tis true you gave us aid in our time of need but you paid yourselves with our cautionary towns and that you have since delivered them up we can never give sufficient commendation

acknowledgment sweet sir go on  fisc for your trade abroad if you should obtain it you are so horribly expensive that you would undo yourselves and all christendom for you would sink under your very profit and the gains of the universal world would beggar you you devour a voyage to the indies by the multitude of mouths with which you man your vessels providence has contrived it well that the indies are managed by us an industrious and frugal people who distribute its merchandise to the rest of europe and suffer it not to be consumed in england that the other members might be starved while you of great britain as you call it like a rickety head would only swell and grow bigger by it  jul i have heard enough of england have you nothing to return upon the netherlands  beam faith very

a word however  beam in the first place you shewed your ambition when you began to be a state for not being gentlemen you have stolen the arms of the best families of europe and wanting a name you made bold with the first of the divine attributes and called yourselves the high and mighty though let me tell you that besides the blasphemy the title is ridiculous for high is no more proper for the netherlands than mighty is for seven little rascally provinces no bigger in all than a shire in england for my main theme your ingratitude you have in part acknowledged it by your laughing at our easy delivery of your cautionary towns the best is we are used by you as well as your own princes of the house of orange we and they have set you up and you undermine their power and circumvent our trade  fisc and good reason if our interest requires it  beam that leads me to your religion which is only made up of interest at home you tolerate all worships in them who can pay for it and abroad you were lately so civil to the emperor of pegu as to do open sacrifice to his idols  fisc yes and by the same token you english were such precise fools as to refuse it  beam for frugality in trading we confess we cannot compare with you for our merchants live like noblemen your gentlemen if you have any live like boors you traffic for all the rarities of the world and dare use none of them yourselves so that in effect you are the millhorses of mankind that labour only for the wretched provender you eat a pot of butter and a pickled herring is all your riches and in short you have a good title to cheat all europe because in the first place you cozen your own backs and bellies  fisc we may enjoy more whenever we please  beam your liberty is a grosser cheat than any of the rest for you

oath to heaven how clear your son how criminal this man  col towerson could do nothing but what was noble  beam we know his native worth  fisc his worth behold it on the murderers hand a robber first he took degrees in mischief and grew to what he is know you that diamond and whose it was see if he dares deny it  tow sir it was your sons that freely i acknowledge but how i came by it  har no it is too much ill hear no more  fisc the devil of jealousy and that of avarice both i believe possest him or your son was innocently talking with his wife and he perhaps had found them this i guess but saw it not because i came too late i only viewed the sweet youth just expiring and towerson stooping down to take the ring she kneeling by to help him when he saw me he would you may be sure have sent me after because i was a witness of the fact this on my soul is true  tow false as that soul each word each syllable the ring he put upon my hand this night when in this wood unknown and near this place without my timely help he had been slain  fisc see this unlikely story what enemies had he who should assault him or is it probable that very man who actually did kill him afterwards should save his life so little time before  isab base man thou knowest the reason of his death he had committed on my person sir an impious rape first tied me to that tree and there my husband found me whose revenge was such as heaven and earth will justify  har i know not what heaven will but earth shall not  beam her story carries such a face of truth ye cannot but believe it  col the other a malicious illpatched lie  fisc yes you are proper judges of his crime who with the rest of your accomplices your countrymen and towerson the chief whom we too kindly used would have surprised the fort and made us slaves that shall be proved more soon than you imagine i found it out this evening  tow sure the devil has lent thee all his stock of falsehood and must be forced hereafter to tell truth  beam sir it is impossible you should believe it  har seize them all  col you cannot be so base  har ill be so just till i can hear your plea against this plot which if not proved and fully you are quit mean

ungrateful dutch  har see them conveyed apart to several prisons lest they combine to forge some specious lie in their excuse let towerson and that woman too be parted  isab was ever such a sad divorce made on a bridal night but we before were parted neer to meet farewell farewell my last and only love  tow curse on my fond credulity to think there could be faith or honour in the dutch farewell my isabinda and farewell my much wronged countrymen remember yet that no unmanly weakness in your sufferings disgrace the native honour of our isle   for you i mourn grief for myself were

sorrow cannot be so soon digested for losing of a son i loved so well but i consider great advantages must with some loss be bought as this rich trade which i this day have purchased with his death yet let me lie revenged and i shall still live on and eat and drink down all my griefs now to the matter fiscal  fisc since we may freely speak among ourselves all i have said of towerson was most false you were consenting sir as well as i that perez should be hired to murder him which he refusing when he was engaged tis dangerous to let him longer live  van her dispatch him he will be a shrewd witness against us if he returns to europe  fisc i have thought better if you pleaseto kill him by form of law as accessary to the english plot which i have long been forging  har send one to seize him strait exit a messenger but what you said that towerson was guiltless of my sons death i easily believe and never thought otherwise though i dissembled  van her nor i but it was well done to feign that story  1 dutch the true one was too foul  2 dutch and afterwards to draw the english off from his concernment to their own i think twas rarely managed that  har so far twas well now to proceed for i would gladly know whether the grounds are plausible enough of this pretended plot  fisc with favour of this honourable court give me but leave to smooth the way before you some two or three nights since it matters not a japan soldier under captain perez came to a centinel upon the guard and in familiar talk did question him about this castle of its strength and how he thought it might be taken this discourse the other told me early the next morning i thereupon did issue private orders to rack the japanese myself being present  har but whats this to the english  fisc you shall hear i asked him when his pains were strongest on him if towerson or the english factory had never hired him to betray the fort he answered as it was true they never had nor was his meaning more in that discourse than as a soldier to inform himself and so to pass the time  van her did he confess no more  fisc you interrupt me i told him i was certainly informed the english had designs upon the castle and if he frankly would confess their plot he should not only be released from torment but bounteously rewarded present pain and future hope in fine so wrought upon him he yielded to subscribe whatever i pleased and so he stands committed  har well contrived a fair way made upon this accusation to put them all to torture  2 dutch by his confession all of them shall die even to their general towerson  har he stands convicted of another crime for which he is to suffer  fisc this does well to help it though for towerson is here a person publicly employed from england and if he should appeal as sure he will you have no power to judge him in amboyna  van her but in regard of the late league and union betwixt the nations how can this be answered  1 dutch to torture subjects to so great a king a pain never heard of in their happy land will sound but ill in europe  fisc their english laws in england have their force and we have ours different from theirs at home it is enough they either shall confess or we will falsify their hands to make them then for the apology let me alone i have it writ already to a title of what they shall subscribe this i will publish and make our most unheard of cruelties to seem most just and legal  har then in the name of him who put it first into thy head to form this damned false plot proceed we to the execution of it and to begin first seize we their

state of innocence c   the paradise lost of milton is a work so extraordinary in conception and execution that it required a lapse of many years to reconcile the herd of readers and of critics to what was almost too sublime for ordinary understandings the poets in particular seemed to have gazed on its excellencies like the inferior animals on drydens immortal hind and incapable of fully estimating a merit which in some degree they could not help feeling many were their absurd experiments to lower it to the standard of their own comprehension one author deeming the paradise lost deficient in harmony was pleased painfully to turn it into rhyme and more than one conceiving the subject too serious to be treated in verse of any kind employed their leisure in humbling it into prose the names of these welljudging and considerate persons are preserved by mr todd in his edition of miltons poetical works  but we must not confound with these effusions of gratuitous folly an alteration or imitation planned and executed by john dryden although we may be at a loss to guess the motives by which he was guided in hazarding such an attempt his reverence for milton and his high estimation of his poetry had already called forth the wellknown verses in which he attributes to him the joint excellencies of the two most celebrated poets of antiquity and if other proofs of his veneration were wanting they may be found in the preface to this very production had the subject been of a nature which admitted its being actually represented we might conceive that dryden who was under engagements to the theatre with which it was not always easy to comply might have been desirous to shorten his own labour by adopting the story sentiments and language of a poem which he so highly esteemed and which might probably have been new to the generality of his audience but the costume of our first parents had there been no other objection must have excluded the state of innocence from the stage and accordingly it was certainly never intended for representation the probable motive therefore of this alteration was the wish so common to genius to exert itself upon a subject in which another had already attained brilliant success or as dryden has termed a similar attempt the desire to shoot in the bow of ulysses some circumstances in the history of miltons immortal poem may have suggested to dryden the precise form of the present attempt it is reported by voltaire and seems at length to be admitted that the original idea of the paradise lost was supplied by an italian mystery or religious play which milton witnessed when abroad1 and it is certain that he intended at first to mould his poem into a dramatic form2 it seems therefore likely that dryden conscious of his own powers and enthusiastically admiring those of milton was induced to make an experiment upon the forsaken plan of the blind bard which with his usual rapidity of conception and execution he completed in the short space of one month the spurious copies which got abroad and perhaps the desire of testifying his respect for his beautiful patroness the duchess of york form his own apology for the publication it is reported by mr aubrey that the step was not taken without drydens reverence to milton being testified by a personal application for his permission the aged poet conscious that the might of his versification could receive no addition even from the flowing numbers of dryden is stated to have answered with indifferenceay you may tag my verses if you will  the structure and diction of this opera as it is somewhat improperly termed being rather a dramatic poem strongly indicate the taste of charles the seconds reign for what was ingenious acute and polished in preference to the simplicity of the true sublime the judgment of that age as has been already noticed is always to be referred rather to the head than to the heart and a poem written to please mere critics requires an introduction and display of art to the exclusion of natural beautythis explains the extravagant panegyric of lee on drydens play    milton did the wealthy mine disclose   and rudely cast what you could well dispose   he roughly drew on an oldfashioned ground   a chaos for no perfect world was found   till through the heap your mighty genius shined   he was the golden ore which you refined   he first beheld the beauteous rustic maid   and to a place of strength the prize conveyed   you took her thence to court this virgin brought   dressed her with gems newweaved her hardspun thought   and softest language sweetest manners taught   till from a comet she a star did rise   not to affright but please our wondering eyes  doubtless there were several critics of that period who held the heretical opinion above expressed by lee and the imitation was such as to warrant that conclusion considering the school in which it was formed the scene of the consultation in pandemonium and of the soliloquy of satan on his arrival in the newlycreated universe would possess great merit did they not unfortunately remind us of the majestic simplicity of milton but there is often a sort of ovidian point in the diction which seems misplaced thus asmodeus tells us that the devils ascending from the lake of fire    shake off their slumber first and next their fear  and with drydens usual hate to the poor dutchmen the council of pandemonium are termed    most high and mighty lords who better fell   from heaven to rise states general of hell  there is one inconvenience which as this poem was intended for perusal only the author one would have thought might have easily avoided this arises from the stage directions which supply the place of the terrific and beautiful descriptions of milton what idea except burlesque can we form of the expulsion of the fallen angels from heaven literally represented by their tumbling down upon the stage or what feelings of terror can be excited by the idea of an opera hell composed of pasteboard and flaming rosin if these follies were not actually to be produced before our eyes it could serve no good purpose to excite the image of them in our imaginations they are circumstances by which we feel that scenic deception must be rendered ridiculous and ought to be avoided even in a drama intended for perusal only since they cannot be mentioned without exciting ludicrous combinationseven in describing the primitive state of our first parents dryden has displayed some of the false and corrupted taste of the court of charles eve does not consent to her union with adam without coquettish apprehensions of his infidelity which circumstances rendered rather improbable and even in the state of innocence she avows the love of sway and of self which in a loose age is thought the principal attribute of her daughters it may be remembered that the adam of milton when first experiencing the powers of slumber thought    i then was passing to my former state   insensible and forthwith to dissolve  the eve of dryden expresses the same apprehensions of annihilation upon a very different occasion these passages form a contrast highly favourable to the simplicity and chastity of miltons taste the school logic employed by adam and the angels in the first scene of the fourth act however misplaced may be paralleled if not justified by similar instances in the paradise lost  on the other hand the state of innocence contains many passages of varied and happy expression peculiar to our great poet and the speech of lucfier in paradise act third scene first approaches in sublimity to his prototype in milton indeed altered as this poem was from the original in order to accommodate it to the taste of a frivolous age it still retained too much fancy to escape the raillery of the men of wit and fashion more disposed to laugh at extravagance than to sympathise with feelings of grandeur the companion to the theatre mentions an objection started by the more nice and delicate critics against the anachronism and absurdity of lucifer conversing about the world its form and vicissitudes at a time previous to its creation or at least to the possibility of his knowing any thing of it but to this objection which applies to the paradise lost also it is sufficient to reply that the measure of intelligence competent to supernatural beings being altogether unknown to us leaves the poet at liberty to accommodate its extent to the purposes in which he employs them without which poetic license it would be in vain to introduce them dryden moved by this and similar objections has prefixed to the drama an apology for heroic poetry and the use of what is technically called the machinery employed in it  upon the whole it may be justly questioned whether dryden shewed his judgment in the choice of a subject which compelled an immediate parallel betwixt milton and himself upon a subject so exclusively favourable to the powers of the former indeed according to dennis notwithstanding drydens admiration of milton he evinced sufficiently by this undertaking what he himself confessed twenty years afterwards that he was not sensible of half the extent of his excellence in the town and country mouse mr bayes is made to term milton a rough unhewen fellow and dryden himself even in the dedication to the translation from juvenal a work of his advanced life alleges that though he found in that poet a true sublimity and lofty thoughts clothed with admirable grecisms he did not find the elegant turn of words and expression proper to the italian poets and to spenser in the same treatise he undertakes to excuse but not to justify milton for his choice of blank verse affirming that he possessed neither grace nor facility in rhyming a consciousness of the harmony of his own numbers and a predilection for that kind of verse in which he excelled seemed to have encouraged him to think he could improve the paradise lost baker observes but too truly that the state of innocence recals the idea reprobated by marvell in his address to milton    or if a work so infinite be spanned   jealous i was lest some less skilful hand   such as disquiet always what is well   and by illimitating would excel   might hence presume the whole creations day   to change in scenes and shew it in a play  the state of innocence seems to have been undertaken by dryden during a cessation of his theatrical labours and was first published in 1674 shortly after the death of milton which took place on the 8th of november

ambition is so far from being a vice in poets that it is almost impossible for them to succeed without it imagination must be raised by a desire of fame to a desire of pleasing and they whom in all ages poets have endeavoured most to please have been the beautiful and the great beauty is their deity to which they sacrifice and greatness is their guardian angel which protects them both these are so eminently joined in the person of your royal highness that it were not easy for any but a poet to determine which of them outshines the other but i confess madam i am already biassed in my choice i can easily resign to others the praise of your illustrious family and that glory which you derive from a longcontinued race of princes famous for their actions both in peace and war i can give up to the historians of your country the names of so many generals and heroes which crowd their annals and to our own the hopes of those which you are to produce for the british chronicle i can yield without envy to the nation of poets the family of este to which ariosto and tasso have owed their patronage and to which the world has owed their poems but i could not without extreme reluctance resign the theme of your beauty to another hand give me leave madam to acquaint the world that i am jealous of this subject and let it be no dishonour to you that after having raised the admiration of mankind you have inspired one man to give it voice but with whatsoever vanity this new honour of being your poet has filled my mind i confess myself too weak for the inspiration the priest was always unequal to the oracle the god within him was too mighty for his breast he laboured with the sacred revelation and there was more of the mystery left behind than the divinity itself could enable him to express i can but discover a part of your excellencies to the world and that too according to the measure of my own weakness like those who have surveyed the moon by glasses i can only tell of a new and shining world above us but not relate the riches and glories of the place tis therefore that i have already waved the subject of your greatness to resign myself to the contemplation of what is more peculiarly yours greatness is indeed communicated to some few of both sexes but beauty is confined to a more narrow compass tis only in your sex tis not shared by many and its supreme perfection is in you alone and here madam i am proud that i cannot flatter you have reconciled the differing judgments of mankind for all men are equal in their judgment of what is eminently best the prize of beauty was disputed only till you were seen but now all pretenders have withdrawn their claims there is no competition but for the second place even the fairest of our island which is famed for beauties not daring to commit their cause against you to the suffrage of those who most partially adore them fortune has indeed but rendered justice to so much excellence in setting it so high to public view or rather providence has done justice to itself in placing the most perfect workmanship of heaven where it may be admired by all beholders had the sun and stars been seated lower their glory had not been communicated to all at once and the creator had wanted so much of his praise as he had made your condition more obscure but he has placed you so near a crown that you add a lustre to it by your beauty you are joined to a prince who only could deserve you whose conduct courage and success in war whose fidelity to his royal brother whose love for his country whose constancy to his friends whose bounty to his servants whose justice to merit whose inviolable truth and whose magnanimity in all his actions seem to have been rewarded by heaven by the gift of you you are never seen but you are blest and i am sure you bless all those who see you we think not the day is long enough when we behold you and you are so much the business of our souls that while you are in sight we can neither look nor think on any else there are no eyes for other beauties you only are present and the rest of your sex are but the unregarded parts that fill your triumph our sight is so intent on the object of its admiration that our tongues have not leisure even to praise you for language seems too low a thing to express your excellence and our souls are speaking so much within that they despise all foreign conversation every man even the dullest is thinking more than the most eloquent can teach him how to utter thus madam in the midst of crowds you reign in solitude and are adored with the deepest veneration that of silence tis true you are above all mortal wishes no man desires impossibilities because they are beyond the reach of nature to hope to be a god is folly exalted into madness but by the laws of our creation we are obliged to adore him and are permitted to love him too at human distance tis the nature of perfection to be attractive but the excellency of the object refines the nature of the love it strikes an impression of awful reverence tis indeed that love which is more properly a zeal than passion tis the rapture which anchorites find in prayer when a beam of the divinity shines upon them that which makes them despise all worldly objects and yet tis all but contemplation they are seldom visited from above but a single vision so transports them that it makes up the happiness of their lives mortality cannot bear it often it finds them in the eagerness and height of their devotion they are speechless for the time that it continues and prostrate and dead when it departs that ecstacy had need be strong which without any end but that of admiration has power enough to destroy all other passions you render mankind insensible to other beauties and have destroyed the empire of love in a court which was the seat of his dominion you have subverted may i dare to accuse you of it even our fundamental laws and reign absolute over the hearts of a stubborn and freeborn people tenacious almost to madness of their liberty the brightest and most victorious of our ladies make daily complaints of revolted subjects if they may be said to be revolted whose servitude is not accepted for your royal highness is too great and too just a monarch either to want or to receive the homage of rebellious fugitives yet if some few among the multitude continue stedfast to their first pretensions tis an obedience so lukewarm and languishing that it merits not the name of passion their addresses are so faint and their vows so hollow to their sovereigns that they seem only to maintain their faith out of a sense of honour they are ashamed to desist and yet grow careless to obtain like despairing combatants they strive against you as if they had beheld unveiled the magical shield of your ariosto which dazzled the beholders with too much brightness they can no longer hold up their arms they have read their destiny in your eyes    splende lo scudo a guisa di piropo   e luce altra non √© tanto lucente   cader in terra a lo splendor fu dvopo   con gli occhi abbacinati e senza mente  and yet madam if i could find in myself the power to leave this argument of your incomparable beauty i might turn to one which would equally oppress me with its greatness for your conjugal virtues have deserved to be set as an example to a less degenerate less tainted age they approach so near to singularity in ours that i can scarcely make a panegyric to your royal highness without a satire on many others but your person is a paradise and your soul a cherubim within to guard it if the excellence of the outside invite the beholders the majesty of your mind deters them from too bold approaches and turns their admiration into religion moral perfections are raised higher by you in the softer sex as if men were of too coarse a mould for heaven to work on and that the image of divinity could not be cast to likeness in so harsh a metal your person is so admirable that it can scarce receive addition when it shall be glorified and your soul which shines through it finds it of a substance so near her own that she will be pleased to pass an age within it and to be confined to such a palace  i know not how i am hurried back to my former theme i ought and purposed to have celebrated those endowments and qualities of your mind which were sufficient even without the graces of your person to render you as you are the ornament of the court and the object of wonder to three kingdoms but all my praises are but as a bullrush cast upon a stream if they sink not tis because they are borne up by the strength of the current which supports their lightness but they are carried round again and return on the eddy where they first began i can proceed no farther than your beauty and even on that too i have said so little considering the greatness of the subject that like him who would lodge a bowl upon a precipice either my praise falls back by the weakness of the delivery or stays not on the top but rolls over and is lost on the other side i intended this a dedication but how can i consider what belongs to myself when i have been so long contemplating on you be pleased then madam to receive this poem without entitling so much excellency as yours to the faults and imperfections of so mean a writer and instead of being favourable to the piece which merits nothing forgive the presumption of the author who is with all possible veneration    your royal highnesss     most obedient most humble       most devoted servant         john dryden   footnote 1 mary of este daughter of the duke of modena and second wife to    james duke of york afterwards james ii she was married to him by    proxy in 1673 and came over in the year following notwithstanding    her husbands unpopularity and her own attachment to the roman    catholic religion her youth beauty and innocence secured her    from insult and slander during all the stormy period which preceded    her accession to the crown even burnet reluctantly admits the    force of her charms and the inoffensiveness of her conduct but    her beauty produced a more lasting effect on the young and gallant    than on that austere and stubborn partizan and its force must be    allowed since it was extolled even when mary was dethroned and    exiled granville lord lansdowne has praised her in the progress    of beauty and i cannot forbear transcribing some of the verses    on account of the gallant spirit of the author who scorned to    change with fortune and continued

enough will still remain to justify the    stricture of johnson who observes that drydens dedication is an    attempt to mingle earth and heaven by praising human excellence    in the language of

 this fairest labour of your teeming brain   i would embrace but not with flattry stain   something i would to your vast virtue raise   but scorn to daub it with a fulsome praise   that would but blot

of those who will give themselves the trouble of reading the ensuing poem i think myself obliged to render them a reason why i publish an opera which was never acted in the first place i shall not be ashamed to own that my chiefest motive was the ambition which i acknowledged in the epistle i was desirous to lay at the feet of so beautiful and excellent a princess a work which i confess was unworthy her but which i hope she will have the goodness to forgive i was also induced to it in my own defence many hundred copies of it being dispersed abroad without my knowledge or consent so that every one gathering new faults it became at length a libel against me and i saw with some disdain more nonsense than either i or as bad a poet could have crammed into it at a months warning in which time it was wholly written and not since revised after this i cannot without injury to the deceased author of paradise lost but acknowledge that this poem has received its entire foundation part of the design and many of the ornaments from him what i have borrowed will be so easily discerned from my mean productions that i shall not need to point the reader to the places and truly i should be sorry for my own sake that any one should take the pains to compare them together the original being undoubtedly one of the greatest most noble and most sublime poems which either this age or nation has produced and though i could not refuse the partiality of my friend who is pleased to commend me in his verses i hope they will rather be esteemed the effect of his love to me than of his deliberate and sober judgment his genius is able to make beautiful what he pleases yet as he has been too favourable to me i doubt not but he will hear of his kindness from many of our contemporaries for we are fallen into an age of illiterate censorious and detracting people who thus qualified set up for critics  in the first place i must take leave to tell them that they wholly mistake the nature of criticism who think its business is principally to find fault criticism as it was first instituted by aristotle was meant a standard of judging well the chiefest part of which is to observe those excellencies which should delight a reasonable reader if the design the conduct the thoughts and the expressions of a poem be generally such as proceed from a true genius of poetry the critic ought to pass his judgement in favour of the author it is malicious and unmanly to snarl at the little lapses of a pen from which virgil himself stands not exempted horace acknowledges that honest homer nods sometimes he is not equally awake in every line but he leaves it also as a standing measure for our judgments    non ubi plura nitent in carmine paucis   offendi maculis quas aut incuria fudit   aut humana par√πm cavit natura  and longinus who was undoubtedly after aristotle the greatest critic amongst the greeks in his twentyseventh chapter greek peri hupsous has judiciously preferred the sublime genius that sometimes errs to the middling or indifferent one which makes few faults but seldom or never rises to any excellence he compares the first to a man of large possessions who has not leisure to consider of every slight expence will not debase himself to the management of every trifle particular sums are not laid out or spared to the greatest advantage in his economy but are sometimes suffered to run to waste while he is only careful of the main on the other side he likens the mediocrity of wit to one of a mean fortune who manages his store with extreme frugality or rather parsimony but who with fear of running into profuseness never arrives to the magnificence of living this kind of genius writes indeed correctly a wary man he is in grammar very nice as to solecism or barbarism judges to a hair of little decencies knows better than any man what is not to be written and never hazards himself so far as to fall but plods on deliberately and as a grave man ought is sure to put his staff before him in short he sets his heart upon it and with wonderful care makes his business sure that is in plain english neither to be blamed nor praisedi could says my author find out some blemishes in homer and am perhaps as naturally inclined to be disgusted at a fault as another man but after all to speak impartially his failings are such as are only marks of human frailty they are little mistakes or rather negligences which have escaped his pen in the fervour of his writing the sublimity of his spirit carries it with me against his carelessness and though apollonius his argonauts and theocritus his idyllia are more free from errors there is not any man of so false a judgment who would chuse rather to have been apollonius or theocritus than homer  it is worth our consideration a little to examine how much these hypercritics in english poetry differ from the opinion of the greek and latin judges of antiquity from the italians and french who have succeeded them and indeed from the general taste and approbation of all ages heroic poetry which they condemn has ever been esteemed and ever will be the greatest work of human nature in that rank has aristotle placed it and longinus is so full of the like expressions that he abundantly confirms the others testimony horace as plainly delivers his opinion and particularly praises homer in these verses    trojani belli scriptorem maxime lolli   dum tu declamas rom√¶ pr√¶neste relegi   qui quid sit pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non   plenius ac melius chrysippo et crantore dicit  and in another place modestly excluding himself from the number of poets because he only writ odes and satires he tells you a poet is such an one    cui mens divinior atque os   magna soniturum  quotations are superfluous in an established truth otherwise i could reckon up amongst the moderns all the italian commentators on aristotles book of poetry and amongst the french the greatest of this age boileau and rapin the latter of which is alone sufficient were all other critics lost to teach anew the rules of writing any man who will seriously consider the nature of an epic poem how it agrees with that of poetry in general which is to instruct and to delight what actions it describes and what persons they are chiefly whom it informs will find it a work which indeed is full of difficulty in the attempt but admirable when it is well performed i write not this with the least intention to undervalue the other parts of poetry for comedy is both excellently instructive and extremely pleasant satire lashes vice into reformation and humour represents folly so as to render it ridiculous many of our present writers are eminent in both these kinds and particularly the author of the plain dealer whom i am proud to call my friend has obliged all honest and virtuous men by one of the most bold most general and most useful satires which has ever been presented on the english theatre i do not dispute the preference of tragedy let every man enjoy his taste but it is unjust that they who have not the least notion of heroic writing should therefore condemn the pleasure which others receive from it because they cannot comprehend it let them please their appetites in eating what they like but let them not force their dish on all the table they who would combat general authority with particular opinion must first establish themselves a reputation of understanding better than other men are all the flights of heroic poetry to be concluded bombast unnatural and mere madness because they are not affected with their excellencies it is just as reasonable as to conclude there is no day because a blind man cannot distinguish of light and colours ought they not rather in modesty to doubt of their own judgments when they think this or that expression in homer virgil tasso or miltons paradise to be too far strained than positively to conclude that it is all fustian and mere nonsense it is true there are limits to be set betwixt the boldness and rashness of a poet but he must understand those limits who pretends to judge as well as he who undertakes to write and he who has no liking to the whole ought in reason to be excluded from censuring of the parts he must be a lawyer before he mounts the tribunal and the judicature of one court too does not qualify a man to preside in another he may be an excellent pleader in the chancery who is not fit to rule the common pleas but i will presume for once to tell them that the boldest strokes of poetry when they are managed artfully are those which most delight the reader  virgil and horace the severest writers of the severest age have made frequent use of the hardest metaphors and of the strongest hyperboles and in this case the best authority is the best argument for generally to have pleased and through all ages must bear the force of universal tradition and if you would appeal from thence to right reason you will gain no more by it in effect than first to set up your reason against those authors and secondly against all those who have admired them you must prove why that ought not to have pleased which has pleased the most learned and the most judicious and to be thought knowing you must first put the fool upon all mankind if you can enter more deeply than they have done into the causes and resorts of that which moves pleasure in a reader the field is open you may be heard but those springs of human nature are not so easily discovered by every superficial judge it requires philosophy as well as poetry to sound the depth of all the passions what they are in themselves and how they are to be provoked and in this science the best poets have excelled aristotle raised the fabric of his poetry from observation of those things in which euripides sophocles and √Üschylus pleased he considered how they raised the passions and thence has drawn rules for our imitation from hence have sprung the tropes and figures for which they wanted a name who first practised them and succeeded in them thus i grant you that the knowledge of nature was the original rule and that all poets ought to study her as well as aristotle and horace her interpreters but then this also undeniably follows that those things which delight all ages must have been an imitation of nature which is all i contend therefore is rhetoric made an art therefore the names of so many tropes and figures were invented because it was observed they had such and such effect upon the audience therefore catachreses and hyperboles have found their place amongst them not that they were to be avoided but to be used judiciously and placed in poetry as heightenings and shadows are in painting to make the figure bolder and cause it to stand off to sight    nec retia cervis   ulla dolum meditantur  says virgil in his eclogues and speaking of leander in his georgics    nocte natat c√¶ca serus freta quem super ingens   porta tonat c√¶li et scopulis illisa reclamant   √Üquora  in both of these you see he fears not to give voice and thought to things inanimate  will you arraign your master horace for his hardness of expression when he describes the death of cleopatra and says she didasperos tractare serpentes ut atrum corpore combiberet cenenumbecause the body in that action performs what is proper to the mouth  as for hyperboles i will neither quote lucan nor statius men of an unbounded imagination but who often wanted the poize of judgment the divine virgil was not liable to that exception and yet he describes polyphemus thus    graditurque per √¶quor   jam medium necdum fluctus latera ardua tinxit  in imitation of this place our admirable cowley thus paints goliah    the valley now this monster seemed to fill   and we methought looked up to him from our hill  where the two words seemed and methought have mollified the figure and yet if they had not been there the fright of the israelites might have excused their belief of the giants stature1  in the eighth of the √Üneids virgil paints the swiftness of camilla thus    ilia vel intact√¶ segetis per summa volaret   gramina nec teneras cursu l√¶sisset aristas   vel mare per medium fluctu suspensa tumenti   ferret iter celeres nec tingeret √¶quore plantas  you are not obliged as in history to a literal belief of what the poet says but you are pleased with the image without being cozened by the fiction  yet even in history longinus quotes herodotus on this occasion of hyperboles the lacedemonians says he at the straits of thermopyl√¶ defended themselves to the last extremity and when their arms failed them fought it out with their nails and teeth till at length the persians shooting continually upon them they lay buried under the arrows of their enemies it is not reasonable continues the critic to believe that men could defend themselves with their nails and teeth from an armed multitude nor that they lay buried under a pile of darts and arrows and yet there wants not probability for the figure because the hyperbole seems not to have been made for the sake of the description but rather to have been produced from the occasion  it is true the boldness of the figures is to be hidden sometimes by the address of the poet that they may work their effect upon the mind without discovering the art which caused it and therefore they are principally to be used in passion when we speak more warmly and with more precipitation than at other times for then si vis me flere dolendum est primum ipsi tibi the poet must put on the passion he endeavours to represent a man in such an occasion is not cool enough either to reason rightly or to talk calmly aggravations are then in their proper places interrogations exclamations hyperbata or a disordered connection of discourse are graceful there because they are natural the sum of all depends on what before i hinted that this boldness of expression is not to be blamed if it be managed by the coolness and discretion which is necessary to a poet  yet before i leave this subject i cannot but take notice how disingenuous our adversaries appear all that is dull insipid languishing and without sinews in a poem they call an imitation of nature they only offend our most equitable judges who think beyond them and lively images and elocution are never to be forgiven  what fustian as they call it have i heard these gentlemen find out in mr cowleys odes i acknowledge myself unworthy to defend so excellent an author neither have i room to do it here only in general i will say that nothing can appear more beautiful to me than the strength of those images which they condemn  imaging is in itself the very height and life of poetry it is as longinus describes it a discourse which by a kind of enthusiasm or extraordinary emotion of the soul makes it seem to us that we behold those things which the poet paints so as to be pleased with them and to admire them  if poetry be imitation that part of it must needs be best which describes most lively our actions and passions our virtues and our vices our follies and our humours for neither is comedy without its part of imaging and they who do it best are certainly the most excellent in their kind this is too plainly proved to be denied but how are poetical fictions how are hippocentaurs and chimeras or how are angels and immaterial substances to be imaged which some of them are things quite out of nature others such whereof we can have no notion this is the last refuge of our adversaries and more than any of them have yet had the wit to object against us the answer is easy to the first part of it the fiction of some beings which are not in nature second notions as the logicians call them has been founded on the conjunction of two natures which have a real separate being so hippocentaurs were imaged by joining the natures of a man and horse together as lucretius tells us who has used this word of image oftener than any of the poets    nam cert√® ex vivo centauri non fit imago   nulla fuit quoniam talis natura animai   ver√πm ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago   h√¶rescit facil√® extempl√≤ c  the same reason may also be alleged for chimeras and the rest and poets may be allowed the like liberty for describing things which really exist not if they are founded on popular belief of this nature are fairies pigmies and the extraordinary effects of magic for it is still an imitation though of other mens fancies and thus are shakespeares tempest his midsummer nights dream and ben jonsons masque of witches to be defended for immaterial substances we are authorised by scripture in their description and herein the text accommodates itself to vulgar apprehension in giving angels the likeness of beautiful young men thus after the pagan divinity has homer drawn his gods with human faces and thus we have notions of things above us by describing them like other beings more within our knowledge  i wish i could produce any one example of excellent imaging in all this poem perhaps i cannot but that which comes nearest it is in these four lines which have been sufficiently canvassed by my wellnatured censors    seraph and cherub careless of their charge   and wanton in full ease now live at large   unguarded leave the passes of the sky   and all dissolved in hallelujahs lie  i have heard says one of them of anchovies dissolved in sauce but never of an angel in hallelujahs a mighty witticism if you will pardon a new word but there is some difference between a laugher and a critic he might have burlesqued virgil too from whom i took the image invadunt urbem somno vinoque sepultam a citys being buried is just as proper on occasion as an angels being dissolved in ease and songs of triumph mr cowley lies as open too in many places    where their vast courts the mother waters keep c  for if the mass of waters be the mothers then their daughters the little streams are bound in all good manners to make courtesy to them and ask them blessing how easy it is to turn into ridicule the best descriptions when once a man is in the humour of laughing till he wheezes at his own dull jest but an image which is strongly and beautifully set before the eyes of the reader will still be poetry when the merry fit is over and last when the other is forgotten  i promised to say somewhat of poetic licence but have in part anticipated my discourse already poetic licence i take to be the liberty which poets have assumed to themselves in all ages of speaking things in verse which are beyond the severity of prose it is that particular character which distinguishes and sets the bounds betwixt oratio soluta and poetry this as to what regards the thought or imagination of a poet consists in fiction but then those thoughts must be expressed and here arise two other branches of it for if this licence be included in a single word it admits of tropes if in a sentence or proposition of figures both which are of a much larger extent and more forcibly to be used in verse than prose this is that birthright which is derived to us from our great forefathers even from homer down to ben and they who would deny it to us have in plain terms the foxs quarrel to the grapesthey cannot reach it  how far these liberties are to be extended i will not presume to determine here since horace does not but it is certain that they are to be varied according to the language and age in which an author writes that which would be allowed to a grecian poet martial tells you would not be suffered in a roman and it is evident that the english does more nearly follow the strictness of the latter than the freedoms of the former connection of epithets or the conjunction of two words in one are frequent and elegant in the greek which yet sir philip sidney and the translator of du bartas have unluckily attempted in the english though this i confess is not so proper an instance of poetic licence as it is of variety of idiom in languages  horace a little explains himself on this subject of licentia poetica in these verses    pictoribus atque poetis   quidlibet audendi semper fuit √¶qua potestas    sed non ut placidis coeant immitia non ut   serpentes avibus geminentur tigribus h√¶di  he would have a poem of a piece not to begin with one thing and end with another he restrains it so far that thoughts of an unlike nature ought not to be joined together that were indeed to make a chaos he taxed not homer nor the divine virgil for interesting their gods in the wars of troy and italy neither had he now lived would he have taxed milton as our false critics have presumed to do for his choice of a supernatural argument but he would have blamed my author who was a christian had he introduced into his poem heathen deities as tasso is condemned by rapin on the like occasion and as camo√´ns the author of the lusiads ought to be censured by all his readers when he brings in bacchus and christ into the same adventure of his fable  from that which has been said it may be collected that the definition of wit which has been so often attempted and ever unsuccessfully by many poets is only this that it is a propriety of thoughts and words or in other terms thoughts and words elegantly adapted to the subject if our critics will join issue on this definition that we may convenire in aliquo tertio if they will take it as a granted principle it will be easy to put an end to this dispute no man will disagree from anothers judgment concerning the dignity of style in heroic poetry but all reasonable men will conclude it necessary that sublime subjects ought to be adorned with the sublimest and consequently often with the most figurative expressions in the mean time i will not run into their fault of imposing my opinions on other men any more than i would my writings on their taste i have only laid down and that superficially enough my present thoughts and shall be glad to be taught better by those who pretend to reform our poetry   footnote 1 with all this mitigation the passage seems horrible bombast                                      the                           state of innocence                                   and

aurengzebe   aurengzebe or the ornament of the throne for such is the interpretation of his name was the last descendant of timur who enjoyed the plenitude of authority originally vested in the emperor of india his father shajehan had four sons to each of whom he delegated the command of a province darasha the eldest superintended the district of delhi and remained near his fathers person sultansujah was governor of bengal aurengzebe of the decan and morat bakshi of guzerat it happened that shajehan being exhausted by the excesses of the haram a report of his death became current in the provinces and proved the signal for insurrection and discord among his children morat bakshi possessed himself of surat after a long siege and sultansujah having declared himself independent in bengal advanced as far as lahor with a large army darasha the legitimate successor of the crown was the only son of shajehan who preferred filial duty to the prospect of aggrandisement he dispatched an army against sultansujah checked his progress and compelled him to retreat but aurengzebe the third and most wily of the brethren had united his forces to those of morat bakshi and advancing against darasha totally defeated him and dissipated his army aurengzebe availed himself of the military reputation and treasures acquired by his success to seduce the forces of morat bakshi whom he had pretended to assist and seizing upon his person at a banquet imprisoned him in a strong fortress meanwhile he advanced towards agra where his father had sought refuge still affecting to believe that the old emperor was dead the more pains shajehan took to contradict this report the more obstinate was aurengzebe in refusing to believe that he was still alive and although the emperor dispatched his most confidential servants to assure his dutiful son that he was yet in being the incredulity of aurengzebe could only be removed by a personal interview the issue of which was shajehans imprisonment and speedy death during these transactions darasha who after his defeat had fled with his treasures to lahor again assembled an army and advanced against the conqueror but being deserted by his allies defeated by aurengzebe and betrayed by an omrah whom he trusted in his flight he was delivered up to his brother and by his command assassinated aurengzebe now assumed the throne and advanced against sultansujah his sole remaining brother he seduced his chief commanders routed the forces who remained faithful and drove him out of bengal into the pagan countries adjacent where after several adventures he perished miserably in the mountains aurengzebe also murdered one or two nephews and a few other near relations but in expiation of his complicated crimes renounced the use of flesh fish and wine living only upon barleybread vegetables and confections although scrupling no excesses by which he could extend and strengthen his usurped power1  dr johnson has supposed that in assuming for his subject a living prince dryden incurred some risque as should aurengzebe have learned and resented the freedom our indian trade was exposed to the consequences of his displeasure it may however be safely doubted whether a monarch who had actually performed the achievements above narrated would have been scandalized by those imputed to him in the text in other respects the distance and obscurity of the events gave a poet the same authority over them as if they had occurred in the annals of past ages a circumstance in which drydens age widely differed from ours when so much has our intimacy increased with the oriental world that the transactions of delhi are almost as familiar to us as those of paris  the tragedy of aurengzebe is introduced by the poets declaration in the prologue that his taste for heroic plays was now upon the wane    but he has now another taste of wit   and to confess a truth though out of time   grows weary of his longloved mistress rhyme   passions too fierce to be in fetters bound   and nature flies him like enchanted ground   what verse can do he has performed in this   which he presumes the most correct of his  agreeably to what might be expected from this declaration the verse used in aurengzebe is of that kind which may be most easily applied to the purposes of ordinary dialogue there is much less of ornate structure and emphatic swell than occurs in the speeches of almanzor and maximin and dryden though late seems to have at length discovered that the language of true passion is inconsistent with that regular modulation to maintain which the actor must mouth each couplet in a sort of recitative the ease of the verse in aurengzebe although managed with infinite address did not escape censure in the just remonstrance of affronted that transmitted to the spectator the offended conjunction is made to plead what great advantage was i of to mr dryden in his indian emperor    you force me still to answer you in that   to furnish out a rhime to morat  and what a poor figure would mr bayes have made without his egad and all that but by means of this easy flow of versification in which the rhime is sometimes almost lost by the pause being transferred to the middle of the line dryden in some measure indemnified himself for his confinement and at least muffled the clank of his fetters still however neither the kind of verse nor perhaps the poet himself were formed for expressing rapid and ardent dialogue and the beauties of aurengzebe will be found chiefly to consist in strains of didactic morality or solemn meditation the passage descriptive of life has been distinguished by all the critics down to dr johnson    aur when i consider life tis all a cheat   yet fooled with hope men favour the deceit   trust on and think tomorrow will repay   tomorrows falser than the former day   lies worse and while it says we shall be blest   with some new joys cuts off what we possest   strange cozenage none would live past years again   yet all hope pleasure in what yet remain   and from the dregs of life think to receive   what the first sprightly running could not give   im tired with waiting for this chemic gold   which fools us young and beggars us when old  nor is the answer of nourmahal inferior in beauty    nour tis not for nothing that we life pursue   it pays our hopes with something still thats new   each days a mistress unenjoyed before   like travellers were pleased with seeing more   did you but know what joys your way attend   you would not hurry to your journeys end  it might be difficult to point out a passage in english poetry in which so common and melancholy a truth is expressed in such beautiful verse varied with such just illustration the declamation on virtue also has great merit though perhaps not equal to that on the vanity of life    aur how vain is virtue which directs our ways   through certain danger to uncertain praise   barren and airy name thee fortune flies   with thy lean train the pious and the wise   heaven takes thee at thy word without regard   and lets thee poorly be thy own reward   the world is made for the bold impious man   who stops at nothing seizes all he can   justice to merit does weak aid afford   she trusts her balance and neglects her sword   virtue is nice to take whats not her own   and while she long consults the prize is gone  to this account may be added the following passage from davies dramatic miscellanies  drydens last and most perfect rhiming tragedy was aurengzebe in this play the passions are strongly depicted the characters well discriminated and the diction more familiar and dramatic than in any of his preceding pieces hart and mohun greatly distinguished themselves in the characters of aurengzebe and the old emperor mrs marshall was admired in nourmahal and kynaston has been much extolled by cibber for his happy expression of the arrogant and savage fierceness in morat booth in some part of this character says the same critical historian was too tame from an apprehension of raising the mirth of the audience improperly  though i pay great deference to cibbers judgment yet i am not sure whether booth was not in the right and i cannot help approving the answer which this actor gave to one who told him he was surprised that he neglected to give a spirited turn to the passage in question    nour twill not be safe to let him live an hour   mor ill do it to shew my arbitrary power  sir said booth it was not through negligence but by design that i gave no spirit to that ludicrous bounce of morat i know very well that a laugh of approbation may be obtained from the understanding few but there is nothing more dangerous than exciting the laugh of simpletons who know not where to stop the majority is not the wisest part of the audience and therefore i will run no hazard  the court greatly encouraged the play of aurengzebe the author tells us in his dedication that charles ii altered an incident in the plot and pronounced it to be the best of all drydens tragedies it was revived at drurylane about the year 1726 with the public approbation the old emperor mills wilkes aurengzebe booth morat indamora mrs oldfield melesinda the first wife of theophilus cibber a very pleasing actress in person agreeable and in private life unblemished she died in 1733vol i p 157  the introduction states all that can be said in favour of the management of the piece and it is somewhat amusing to see the anxiety which dryden uses to justify the hazardous experiment of ascribing to emperors and princesses the language of nature and of passion he appears with difficulty to have satisfied himself that the decorum of the scene was not as peremptory as the etiquette of a court aurengzebe was received with the applause to which it is certainly entitled it was acted and printed in 1676   footnote 1 voyages de tavernier seconde partie livre seconde

ought not in reason to have any expectations of favour from them and that it is kindness enough if they leave us in possession of our own the boldness of the censure shows the free spirit of the author and the subjects of england may justly congratulate to themselves that both the nature of our government and the clemency of our king secure us from any such complaint i in particular who subsist wholly by his bounty am obliged to give posterity a far other account of my royal master than what montaigne has left of his those accusations had been more reasonable if they had been placed on inferior persons for in all courts there are too many who make it their business to ruin wit and montaigne in other places tells us what effects he found of their good natures he describes them such whose ambition lust or private interest seem to be the only end of their creation if good accrue to any from them it is only in order to their own designs conferred most commonly on the base and infamous and never given but only happening sometimes on welldeservers dulness has brought them to what they are and malice secures them in their fortunes but somewhat of specious they must have to recommend themselves to princes for folly will not easily go down in its own natural form with discerning judges and diligence in waiting is their gilding of the pill for that looks like love though it is only interest it is that which gains them their advantage over witty men whose love of liberty and ease makes them willing too often to discharge their burden of attendance on these officious gentlemen it is true that the nauseousness of such company is enough to disgust a reasonable man when he sees he can hardly approach greatness but as a moated castle he must first pass through the mud and filth with which it is encompassed these are they who wanting wit affect gravity and go by the name of solid men and a solid man is in plain english a solid solemn fool another disguise they have for fools as well as knaves take other names and pass by an alias and that is the title of honest fellows but this honesty of theirs ought to have many grains for its allowance for certainly they are no farther honest than they are silly they are naturally mischievous to their power and if they speak not maliciously or sharply of witty men it is only because god has not bestowed on them the gift of utterance they fawn and crouch to men of parts whom they cannot ruin quote their wit when they are present and when they are absent steal their jests but to those who are under them and whom they can crush with ease they shew themselves in their natural antipathy there they treat wit like the common enemy and giving no more quarter than a dutchman would to an english vessel in the indies they strike sail where they know they shall be mastered and murder where they can with safety  this my lord is the character of a courtier without wit and therefore that which is a satire to other men must be a panegyric to your lordship who are a master of it if the least of these reflections could have reached your person no necessity of mine could have made me to have sought so earnestly and so long to have cultivated your kindness as a poet i cannot but have made some observations on mankind the lowness of my fortune has not yet brought me to flatter vice and it is my duty to give testimony to virtue it is true your lordship is not of that nature which either seeks a commendation or wants it your mind has always been above the wretched affectation of popularity a popular man is in truth no better than a prostitute to common fame and to the people he lies down to every one he meets for the hire of praise and his humility is only a disguised ambition even cicero himself whose eloquence deserved the admiration of mankind yet by his insatiable thirst of fame he has lessened his character with succeeding ages his action against catiline may be said to have ruined the consul when it saved the city for it so swelled his soul which was not truly great that ever afterwards it was apt to be overset with vanity and this made his virtue so suspected by his friends that brutus whom of all men he adored refused him a place in his conspiracy a modern wit has made this observation on him that coveting to recommend himself to posterity he begged it as an alms of all his friends the historians to remember his consulship and observe if you please the oddness of the event all their histories are lost and the vanity of his request stands yet recorded in his own writings how much more great and manly in your lordship is your contempt of popular applause and your retired virtue which shines only to a few with whom you live so easily and freely that you make it evident you have a soul which is capable of all the tenderness of friendship and that you only retire yourself from those who are not capable of returning it your kindness where you have once placed it is inviolable and it is to that only i attribute my happiness in your love this makes me more easily forsake an argument on which i could otherwise delight to dwell i mean your judgment in your choice of friends because i have the honour to be one after which i am sure you will more easily permit me to be silent in the care you have taken of my fortune which you have rescued not only from the power of others but from my worst of enemies my own modesty and laziness which favour had it been employed on a more deserving subject had been an effect of justice in your nature but as placed on me is only charity yet withal it is conferred on such a man as prefers your kindness itself before any of its consequences and who values as the greatest of your favours those of your love and of your conversation from this constancy to your friends i might reasonably assume that your resentments would be as strong and lasting if they were not restrained by a nobler principle of good nature and generosity for certainly it is the same composition of mind the same resolution and courage which makes the greatest friendships and the greatest enmities and he who is too lightly reconciled after high provocations may recommend himself to the world for a christian but i should hardly trust him for a friend the italians have a proverb to that purpose to forgive the first time shows me a good catholic the second time a fool to this firmness in all your actions though you are wanting in no other ornaments of mind and body yet to this i principally ascribe the interest your merits have acquired you in the royal family a prince who is constant to himself and steady in all his undertakings one with whom that character of horace will agree    si fractus illabatur orbis   impavidum ferient ruin√¶2  such an one cannot but place an esteem and repose a confidence on him whom no adversity no change of courts no bribery of interests or cabals of factions or advantages of fortune can remove from the solid foundations of honour and fidelity    ille meos primus qui me sibi junxit amores   abstulit ille habeat secum servetque sepulcro  how well your lordship will deserve that praise i need no inspiration to foretell you have already left no room for prophecy your early undertakings have been such in the service of your king and country when you offered yourself to the most dangerous employment that of the sea when you chose to abandon those delights to which your youth and fortune did invite you to undergo the hazards and which was worse the company of common seamen that you have made it evident you will refuse no opportunity of rendering yourself useful to the nation when either your courage or conduct shall be required3 the same zeal and faithfulness continue in your blood which animated one of your noble ancestors to sacrifice his life in the quarrels of his sovereign4 though i hope both for your sake and for the public tranquillity the same occasion will never be offered to your lordship and that a better destiny will attend you but i make haste to consider you as abstracted from a court which if you will give me leave to use a term of logic is only an adjunct not a propriety of happiness the academics i confess were willing to admit the goods of fortune into their notion of felicity but i do not remember that any of the sects of old philosophers did ever leave a room for greatness neither am i formed to praise a court who admire and covet nothing but the easiness and quiet of retirement i naturally withdraw my sight from a precipice and admit the prospect be never so large and goodly can take no pleasure even in looking on the downfal though i am secure from the danger methinks there is something of a malignant joy in that excellent description of lucretius    suave mari magno turbantibus √¶quora ventis   e terr√¢ magnum alterius spectare laborem   non quia vexari quenquam est jucunda voluptas   sed quibus ipse malis careas quia cernere suave est  i am sure his master epicurus and my better master cowley preferred the solitude of a garden and the conversation of a friend to any consideration so much as a regard of those unhappy people whom in our own wrong we call the great true greatness if it be any where on earth is in a private virtue removed from the notion of pomp and vanity confined to a contemplation of itself and centering on itself    omnis enim per se div√ªm natura necesse est   immortali √¶vo summ√¢ cum pace fruatur   cur√¢ semota metuque   ipsa suis pollens opibus5  if this be not the life of a deity because it cannot consist with providence it is at least a godlike life i can be contented and i am sure i have your lordship of my opinion with an humbler station in the temple of virtue than to be set on the pinnacle of it    despicere unde queas alios passimque videre   errare atque viam palantes qu√¶rere vit√¶  the truth is the consideration of so vain a creature as man is not worth our pains i have fool enough at home without looking for it abroad and am a sufficient theatre to myself of ridiculous actions without expecting company either in a court a town or a playhouse it is on this account that i am weary with drawing the deformities of life and lazars of the people where every figure of imperfection more resembles me than it can do others if i must be condemned to rhyme i should find some ease in my change of punishment i desire to be no longer the sisyphus of the stage to roll up a stone with endless labour which to follow the proverb gathers no moss and which is perpetually falling down again i never thought myself very fit for an employment where many of my predecessors have excelled me in all kinds and some of my contemporaries even in my own partial judgement have outdone me in comedy some little hopes i have yet remaining and those too considering my abilities may be vain that i may make the world some part of amends for many ill plays by an heroic poem your lordship has been long acquainted with my design the subject of which you know is great the story english and neither too far distant from the present age nor too near approaching it such it is in my opinion that i could not have wished a nobler occasion to do honour by it to my king my country and my friends most of our ancient nobility being concerned in the action6 and your lordship has one particular reason to promote this undertaking because you were the first who gave me the opportunity of discoursing it to his majesty and his royal highness they were then pleased both to commend the design and to encourage it by their commands but the unsettledness of my condition has hitherto put a stop to my thoughts concerning it as i am no successor to homer in his wit so neither do i desire to be in his poverty i can make no rhapsodies nor go a begging at the grecian doors while i sing the praises of their ancestors the times of virgil please me better because he had an augustus for his patron and to draw the allegory nearer you i am sure i shall not want a mec√¶nas with him it is for your lordship to stir up that remembrance in his majesty which his many avocations of business have caused him i fear to lay aside and as himself and his royal brother are the heroes of the poem to represent to them the images of their warlike predecessors as achilles is said to be roused to glory with the sight of the combat before the ships for my own part i am satisfied to have offered the design and it may be to the advantage of my reputation to have it refused me  in the mean time my lord i take the confidence to present you with a tragedy the characters of which are the nearest to those of an heroic poem it was dedicated to you in my heart before it was presented on the stage some things in it have passed your approbation and many your amendment you were likewise pleased to recommend it to the kings perusal before the last hand was added to it when i received the favour from him to have the most considerable event of it modelled by his royal pleasure it may be some vanity in me to add his testimony then and which he graciously confirmed afterwards that it was the best of all my tragedies in which he has made authentic my private opinion of it at least he has given it a value by his commendation which it had not by my writing  that which was not pleasing to some of the fair ladies in the last act of it as i dare not vindicate so neither can i wholly condemn till i find more reason for their censures the procedure of indamora and melesinda seems yet in my judgment natural and not unbecoming of their characters if they who arraign them fail not more the world will never blame their conduct and i shall be glad for the honour of my country to find better images of virtue drawn to the life in their behaviour than any i could feign to adorn the theatre i confess i have only represented a practical virtue mixed with the frailties and imperfections of human life i have made my heroine fearful of death which neither cassandra nor cleopatra would have been and they themselves i doubt it not would have outdone romance in that particular yet their mandana and the cyrus was written by a lady was not altogether so hardhearted for she sat down on the cold ground by the king of assyria and not only pitied him who died in her defence but allowed him some favours such perhaps as they would think should only be permitted to her cyrus7 i have made my melesinda in opposition to nourmahal a woman passionately loving of her husband patient of injuries and contempt and constant in her kindness to the last and in that perhaps i may have erred because it is not a virtue much in use those indian wives are loving fools and may do well to keep themselves in their own country or at least to keep company with the arrias and portias of old rome some of our ladies know better things but it may be i am partial to my own writings yet i have laboured as much as any man to divest myself of the selfopinion of an author and am too well satisfied of my own weakness to be pleased with any thing i have written but on the other side my reason tells me that in probability what i have seriously and long considered may be as likely to be just and natural as what an ordinary judge if there be any such among those ladies will think fit in a transient presentation to be placed in the room of that which they condemn the most judicious writer is sometimes mistaken after all his care but the hasty critic who judges on a view is full as liable to be deceived let him first consider all the arguments which the author had to write this or to design the other before he arraigns him of a fault and then perhaps on second thoughts he will find his reason oblige him to revoke his censure yet after all i will not be too positive homo sum humani √† me nihil alienum puto as i am a man i must be changeable and sometimes the gravest of us all are so even upon ridiculous accidents our minds are perpetually wrought on by the temperament of our bodies which makes me suspect they are nearer allied than either our philosophers or schooldivines will allow them to be i have observed says montaigne that when the body is out of order its companion is seldom at his ease an ill dream or a cloudy day has power to change this wretched creature who is so proud of a reasonable soul and make him think what he thought not yesterday and homer was of this opinion as cicero is pleased to translate him for us    tales sunt hominum mentes quali pater ipse   jupiter auctifer√¢ lustravit lampade terras  or as the same author in his tusculan questions speaks with more modesty than usual of himself nos in diem vivimus quodcunque animos nostros probabilitate percussit id dicimus it is not therefore impossible but that i may alter the conclusion of my play to restore myself into the good graces of my fair critics and your lordship who is so well with them may do me the office of a friend and patron to intercede with them on my promise of amendment the impotent lover in petronius though his was a very unpardonable crime yet was received to mercy on the terms i offer summa excusationis me√¶ h√¶c est placebo tibi si culpam emendare permiseris  but i am conscious to myself of offering at a greater boldness in presenting to your view what my meanness can produce than in any other error of my play and therefore make haste to break off this tedious address which has i know not how already run itself into so much of pedantry with an excuse of tullys which he sent with

the reigns of charles ii of his unfortunate successor of    william the third and of queen anne his bravery as a soldier and    abilities as a statesman seem to have been unquestioned but for    his poetical reputation he was probably much indebted to the    assistance of those wits whom he relieved and patronized as    however it has been allowed a sufficient proof of wisdom in a    monarch that he could chuse able ministers so it is no slight    commendation to the taste of this rhyming peer that in youth he    selected dryden to supply his own poetical deficiencies and in age    became the friend and the eulogist of pope we may observe    however a melancholy difference betwixt the manner in which an    independent man of letters is treated by the great and that in    which they think themselves entitled to use one to whom their    countenance is of consequence in addressing pope sheffield    contents himself with launching out into boundless panegyric while    his praise of dryden in his essay on poetry is qualified by a    gentle sneer at the hind and panther our bards most laboured    production his lordship is treating of satire       the laureat here may justly claim our praise      crowned by mack flecnoe with immortal bays      yet once his pegasus has borne dead weight      rid by some lumpish minister of state     lord mulgrave to distinguish him by his earliest title certainly    received considerable assistance from dryden in the essay on    satire which occasioned rochesters base revenge and was    distinguished by the name of the rosealley satire from the    place in which dryden was waylaid and beaten by the hired bravoes    of that worthless profligate it is probable that the patronage    which dryden received from mulgrave was not entirely of an empty    and fruitless nature it is at least certain that their friendship    continued uninterrupted till the death of our poet the discourse    upon epic poetry is dedicated to lord mulgrave then duke of    buckingham and in high favour with queen anne for whom he is    supposed to have long cherished a youthful passion after the grave    of dryden had remained twenty years without a memorial this    nobleman had the honour to raise the present monument at his own    expence being the latest and certainly one of the most honourable    acts of his life     mr malone from mackys secret services gives the following    character of sheffield duke of buckinghamhe is a nobleman of    learning and good natural parts but of no principles violent for    the high church yet seldom goes to it very proud insolent and    covetous and takes all advantages in paying his debts unwilling    and is neither esteemed nor beloved for notwithstanding his great    interest at court it is certain he has none in either house of    parliament or in the country he is of a middle stature of a    brown complexion with a sour lofty look swift sanctioned this    severe character by writing on the margin of his copy of mackys    book this character is the truest of any to so bitter a    censure let us contrast the panegyric of pope       muse tis enough at length thy labour ends      and thou shalt live for buckingham commends      let crowds of critics now my verse assail      let dennis write and nameless numbers rail      this more than pays whole years of thankless pain      time health and fortune are not lost in vain      sheffield approves consenting phoebus bends      and i and malice from this hour are friends     it may be worth the attention of the great to consider the value of    that genius which can hand them down to posterity in an    interesting and amiable point of view in spite of their own    imbecilities errors and vices while the personal character of    mulgrave has nothing to recommend it and his poetical effusions    are sunk into oblivion we still venerate the friend of pope and    the protector of dryden     sheffield duke of buckingham marquis of normanby and earl of    mulgrave was born in 1649 and died in 1720 he was therefore    twentyseven years old when he received this dedication  2 on perusing such ill applied flattery i know not whether we ought    to feel most for charles ii or for dryden  3 the earl of mulgrave in the dutch war of 1672 served as a    volunteer on board the victory commanded by the earl of ossory he    behaved with distinguished courage himself and has borne witness    to that of his unfortunate admiral james duke of york his    intrepid coolness appears from a passage in his memoirs containing    the observations he made during the action on the motion of cannon    bullets in the recoil and their effect when passing near the human    body his bravery was rewarded by his promotion to command the    katharine the second best ship in the fleet this vessel had been    captured by the dutch during the action but was retaken by the    english crew before she could be carried into harbour lord

 all for love   the prologue to the preceding play has already acquainted us that drydens taste for rhyming or heroic plays was then upon the wane and accordingly aurengzebe was the last tragedy which he formed upon that once admired model henceforth a series of new times began for when given up by the only writer whose command of flowing and powerful numbers had rendered it impressive that department of the drama was soon abandoned by the inferior class of playwriters to whom it presented multiplied difficulties without a single advantage the new taste which our author had now decidedly adopted was founded upon the stile of shakespeare of whose works he appears always to have been a persevering student and at length an ardent admirer accordingly he informs us in the introduction that this play is professedly written in imitation of the divine shakespeare as if to bring this more immediately under the eye of the reader he has chosen a subject upon which his immortal original had already laboured and perhaps the most proper introduction to all for love may be a parallel betwixt it and shakespeares antony and cleopatra  the first point of comparison is the general conduct or plot of the tragedy and here dryden having to use his own language undertaken to shoot in the bow of ulysses imitates the wily antinous in using art to eke out his strength and suppling the weapon before he attempted to bend it  shakespeare with the license peculiar to his age and character had diffused the action of his play over italy greece and egypt but dryden who was well aware of the advantage to be derived from a simplicity and concentration of plot has laid every scene in the city of alexandria by this he guarded the audience from that vague and puzzling distraction which must necessarily attend a violent change of place it is a mistake to suppose that the argument in favour of the unities depends upon preserving the deception of the scene they are necessarily connected with the intelligibility of the piece it may be true that no spectator supposes that the stage before him is actually the court of alexandria yet when he has once made up his mind to let it pass as such during the representation it is a cruel tax not merely on his imagination but on his powers of comprehension if the scene be suddenly transferred to a distant country time is lost before he can form new associations and reconcile their bearings with those originally presented to him and if he be a person of slow comprehension or happens to lose any part of the dialogue announcing the changes the whole becomes unintelligible confusion in this respect and in discarding a number of uninteresting characters the plan of drydens play must be unequivocally preferred to that of shakespeare in point of coherence unity and simplicity it is a natural consequence of this more artful arrangement of the story that dryden contents himself with the concluding scene of antonys history instead of introducing the incidents of the war with cneius pompey the negociation with lepidus death of his first wife and other circumstances which in shakespeare only tend to distract our attention from the main interest of the drama the union of time as necessary as that of place to the intelligibility of the drama has in like manner been happily attained and an interesting event is placed before the audience with no other change of place and no greater lapse of time than can be readily adapted to an ordinary imagination  but having given dryden the praise of superior address in managing the story i fear he must be pronounced in most other respects inferior to his grand prototype antony the principal character in both plays is incomparably grander in that of shakespeare the majesty and generosity of the military hero is happily expressed by both poets but the awful ruin of grandeur undermined by passion and tottering to its fall is far more striking in the antony of shakespeare love it is true is the predominant but it is not the sole ingredient in his character it has usurped possession of his mind but is assailed by his original passions ambition of power and thirst for military fame he is therefore often and it should seem naturally represented as feeling for the downfall of his glory and power even so intensely as to withdraw his thoughts from cleopatra unless considered as the cause of his ruin thus in the scene in which he compares himself to black vespers pageants he runs on in a train of fantastic and melancholy similes having relation only to his fallen state till the mention of egypt suddenly recalls the idea of cleopatra but dryden has taken a different view of antonys character and more closely approaching to his title of all for lovehe seems not now that awful antony his whole thoughts and being are dedicated to his fatal passion and though a spark of resentment is occasionally struck out by the reproaches of ventidius he instantly relapses into lovesick melancholy the following beautiful speech exhibits the romance of despairing love without the deep and mingled passion of a dishonoured soldier and dethroned emperor    ant throwing himself down   lie there thou shadow of an emperor   the place thou pressest on thy mother earth   is all thy empire now now it contains thee   some few days hence and then twill be too large   when thourt contracted in the narrow urn   shrunk to a few cold ashes then octavia   for cleopatra will not live to see it   octavia then will have thee all her own   and bear thee in her widowed hand to c√¶sar   c√¶sar will weep the crocodile will weep   to see his rival of the universe   lie still and peaceful there ill think no more ont   give me some music look that it be sad   ill sooth my melancholy till i swell   and burst myself with sighing                       soft music   tis somewhat to my humour stay i fancy   im now turned wild a commoner of nature   of all forsaken and forsaking all   live in a shady forests sylvan scene   stretched at my length beneath some blasted oak   i lean my head upon the mossy bark   and look just of a piece as i grew from it   my uncombed locks matted like misletoe   hang oer my hoary face a murmuring brook   runs at my foot    ven methinks i fancy   myself there too    ant the herd come jumping by me   and fearless quench their thirst while i look on   and take me for their fellowcitizen  even when antony is finally ruined the power of jealousy is called upon to complete his despair and he is less sensible to the idea of c√¶sars successful arms than to the risque of dolabellas rivalling him in the affections of cleopatra it is true the antony of shakespeare also starts into fury upon cleopatra permitting thyreus to kiss her hand but this is not jealousy it is pride offended that she for whom he had sacrificed his glory and empire should already begin to court the favour of the conqueror and vouchsafe her hand to be saluted by a jack of c√¶sars hence enobarbus the witness of the scene alludes immediately to the fury of mortified ambition and falling power    tis better playing with a lions whelp   than with an old one dying  having however adopted an idea of antonys character rather suitable to romance than to nature or history we must not deny dryden the praise of having exquisitely brought out the picture he intended to draw he has informed us that this was the only play written to please himself and he has certainly exerted in it the full force of his incomparable genius antony is throughout the piece what the author meant him to be a victim to the omnipotence of love or rather to the infatuation of one engrossing passion1  in the cleopatra of dryden there is greatly less spirit and originality than in shakespeares the preparation of the latter for death has a grandeur which puts to shame the same scene in dryden and serves to support the interest during the whole fifth act although antony has died in the conclusion of the fourth no circumstance can more highly evince the power of shakespeares genius in spite of his irregularities since the conclusion in dryden where both lovers die in the same scene and after a reconciliation is infinitely more artful and better adapted to theatrical effect  in the character of ventidius dryden has filled up with ability the rude sketches which shakespeare has thrown off in those of sc√¶va and eros the rough old roman soldier is painted with great truth and the quarrel betwixt him and antony in the first act is equal to any single scene that our author ever wrote excepting perhaps that betwixt sebastian and dorax an opinion in which the judgment of the critic coincides with that of the poet it is a pity as has often been remarked that this dialogue occurs so early in the play since what follows is necessarily inferior in force dryden while writing this scene had unquestionably in his recollection the quarrel betwixt brutus and cassius which was justly so great a favourite in his time and to which he had referred as inimitable in his prologue to aurengzebe2  the inferior characters are better supported in dryden than in shakespeare we have no low buffoonery in the former such as disgraces enobarbus and is hardly redeemed by his affecting catastrophe even the egyptian alexas acquires some respectability from his patriotic attachment to the interests of his country and from his skill as a wily courtier he expresses by a beautiful image the effeminate attachment to life appropriated to his character and country    o that i less could fear to lose this being   which like a snowball in my coward hand   the more tis grasped the faster melts away  the octavia of dryden is a much more important personage than in the antony and cleopatra of shakespeare she is however more cold and unamiable for in the very short scenes in which the octavia of shakespeare appears she is placed in rather an interesting point of view but dryden has himself informed us that he was apprehensive the justice of a wifes claim upon her husband would draw the audience to her side and lessen their interest in the lover and the mistress he seems accordingly to have studiedly lowered the character of the injured octavia who in her conduct towards her husband shews much duty and little love and plainly intimates that her rectitude of conduct flows from a due regard to her own reputation rather than from attachment to antonys person or sympathy with him in his misfortunes it happens therefore with octavia as with all other very good selfish kind of people we think it unnecessary to feel any thing for her as she is obviously capable of taking very good care of herself i must not omit that her scolding scene with cleopatra although anxiously justified by the author in the preface seems too coarse to be in character and is a glaring exception to the general good taste evinced throughout the rest of the piece  it would be too long a task to contrast the beauties of these two great poets in point of diction and style but the reader will doubtless be pleased to compare the noted descriptions of the voyage of cleopatra down the cydnus it is thus given in shakespeare    the barge she sat in like a burnished throne   burned on the water the poop was beaten gold   purple the sails and so perfumed that   the winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver   which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made   the water which they beat to follow faster   as amorous of their strokes for her own person   it beggared all description she did lie   in her pavilion cloth of gold of tissue   oerpicturing that venus where we see   the fancy outwork nature on each side her   stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling cupids   with diverse coloured fans whose wind did seem   to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool   and what they undid did   her gentlewomen like the nereids   so many mermaids tended her i the eyes   and made their bends adornings at the helm   a seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle   swells with the touches of those flowersoft hands   that yarely frame the office from the barge   a strange invisible perfume hits the sense   of the adjacent wharfs the city cast   her people out upon her and antony   enthroned in the marketplace did sit alone   whistling to the air which but for vacancy   had gone to gaze on cleopatra too   and made a gap in nature                                antony and cleopatra act i scene 2  the parallel passage in dryden runs thus    the tackling silk the streamers waved with gold   the gentle winds were lodged in purple sails   her nymphs like nereids round her couch were placed   where she another seaborn venus lay    dola no more i would not hear it    ant o you must   she lay and leant her cheek upon her hand   and cast a look so languishingly sweet   as if secure of all beholders hearts   neglecting she could take them boys like cupids   stood fanning with their painted wings the winds   that played about her face but if she smiled   a darting glory secured to blaze abroad   that mens desiring eyes were never wearied   but hung upon the object to soft flutes   the silver oars kept time and while they played   the hearing gave new pleasure to the sight   and both to thought twas heaven or somewhat more   for she so charmed all hearts that gazing crowds   stood panting on the shore and wanted breath   to give their welcome voice   then dolabella where was then thy soul   was not thy fury quite disarmed with murder   didst thou not shrink behind me from those eyes   and whisper in my ear oh tell her not   that i accused her of my brothers death  in judging betwixt these celebrated passages we feel almost afraid to avow a preference of dryden founded partly upon the easy flow of the verse which seems to soften with the subject but chiefly upon the beauty of the language and imagery which is flowery without diffusiveness and rapturous without hyperbole i fear shakespeare cannot be exculpated from the latter fault yet i am sensible it is by sifting his beauties from his conceits that his imitator has been enabled to excel him  it is impossible to bestow too much praise on the beautiful passages which occur so frequently in all for love having already given several examples of happy expression of melancholy and tender feelings i content myself with extracting the sublime and terrific description of an omen presaging the downfall of egypt    serap last night between the hours of twelve and one   in a lone isle of the temple while i walked   a whirlwind rose that with a violent blast   shook all the dome the doors around me clapt   the iron wicket that defends the vault   where the long race of ptolemies is laid   burst open and disclosed the mighty dead   from out each monument in order placed   an armed ghost starts up the boyking last   reared his inglorious head a peal of groans   then followed and a lamentable voice   criedegypt is no more my blood ran back   my shaking knees against each other knocked   on the cold pavement down i fell entranced   and so unfinished left the horrid scene  having quoted so many passages of exquisite poetry and having set this play in no unequal opposition to that of shakespeare it is perhaps unnecessary to mention by what other poets the same subject has been treated daniel mary countess of pembroke may and sir charles sedley each produced a play on the fortunes of anthony of these pieces i have never read the three former and will assuredly never read the last a second time3  all for love as the most laboured performance of our author received the full tribute of applause and popularity which had often graced his less perfect and more hurried performances davies gives us the following account of its first representation  in drydens all for love booths dignified action and forcible elocution in the part of antony attracted the public to that heavy though in many parts well written play six nights successively without the assistance of pantomime or farce which at that time was esteemed something extraordinarybut indeed he was well supported by an oldfield in his cleopatra who to a most harmonious and powerful voice and fine person added grace and elegance of gesture when booth and oldfield met in the second act their dignity of deportment commanded the applause and approbation of the most judicious critics when antony said to cleopatra    you promised me your silence and you break it   ere i have scarce begun  this check was so well understood by oldfield and answered with such propriety of behaviour that in shakespeares phrase her bendings were adornings  the elder mills acted ventidius with the true spirit of a rough and generous old soldier to render the play as acceptable to the public as possible wilkes took the trifling part of dolabella nor did colley cibber disdain to appear in alexas these parts would scarcely be accepted now by thirdrate actors still to add more weight to the performance octavia was a short character of a scene or two in which mrs porter drew not only respect but the more affecting approbation of tears from the audience since that time all for love has gradually sunk into forgetfulness  if this last observation be true it is under mr davies favour a striking illustration of the caprice of the public taste the play of all for love was first acted and printed in 1678   footnotes 1 dryden has himself in the prologue alluded to this predominance    of sentiment in his heros character       his hero whom you wits his bully call      bates of his mettle and scarce rants at all      hes somewhat lewd but a well meaning mind      weeps much fights little but is wondrous kind  2   but spite of all his pride a secret shame      invades his breast at shakespeares sacred name      awed when he hears his godlike romans rage      he in a just despair would quit the stage      and to an age less polished more unskilled      does with disdain the foremost honours yield  3 lest any reader should have anticipated better things of sedleys    noble muse the lisideius of our authors dialogue on dramatic    poetry i subjoin a specimen taken at hazard       gape hell and to thy dismal bottom take      the lost antonius this was our last stake      warned by my ruin let no roman more      set foot on the inhospitable shore      cowards and traitors filled this impious land      faithless and fearful without heart or hand      some ran to c√¶sar like a headlong tide      the rest their fear made useless on our side     this passion with the death of a dear friend would go nigh to    make one sad yet some of the authors of the day held a very    different doctrine shadwell in his dedication to a true widow    tells sedley you have in that mulberry garden shewn the true wit    humour and satire of a comedy and in antony and cleopatra the    true spirit of a tragedy  the only one except two of jonsons and    one of shakespeares wherein romans are made to speak and do like    romans there are to be found the true characters of antony and    cleopatra as they were whereas a french author would have made    the egyptian and roman both become french under his pen and even    our english authors are too much given to make history in these    plays romantic and impossible but in this play the romans are    true romans and their style is such and i dare affirm that there    is not in any play of this age so much of the spirit of the classic    authors as in your antony and cleopatra i cannot help suspecting    that much of this hyperbolical praise of sedley was obliquely    designed to mortify dryden                                       to                           the right honourable                          thomas earl of danby                  viscount latimer and baron osborne of                         kiveton in yorkshire                     lord high treasurer of england               one of his majestys most honourable privy                 council and knight of the most noble                        order of the garter1   my lord  the gratitude of poets is so troublesome a virtue to great men that you are often in danger of your own benefits for you are threatened with some epistle and not suffered to do good in quiet or to compound for their silence whom you have obliged yet i confess i neither am or ought to be surprised at this indulgence for your lordship has the same right to favour poetry which the great and noble have ever had    carmen amat quisquis carmine digna gerit  there is somewhat of a tie in nature betwixt those who are born for worthy actions and those who can transmit them to posterity and though ours be much the inferior part it comes at least within the verge of alliance nor are we unprofitable members of the commonwealth when we animate others to those virtues which we copy and describe from you  it is indeed their interest who endeavour the subversion of governments to discourage poets and historians for the best which can happen to them is to be forgotten but such who under kings are the fathers of their country and by a just and prudent ordering of affairs preserve it have the same reason to cherish the chroniclers of their actions as they have to lay up in safety the deeds and evidences of their estates for such records are their undoubted titles to the love and reverence of afterages your lordships administration has already taken up a considerable part of the english annals and many of its most happy years are owing to it his majesty the most knowing judge of men and the best master has acknowledged the ease and benefit he receives in the incomes of his treasury which you found not only disordered but exhausted all things were in the confusion of a chaos without form or method if not reduced beyond it even to annihilation so that you had not only to separate the jarring elements but if that boldness of expression might be allowed me to create them your enemies had so embroiled the management of your office that they looked on your advancement as the instrument of your ruin and as if the clogging of the revenue and the confusion of accounts which you found in your entrance were not sufficient they added their own weight of malice to the public calamity by forestalling the credit which should cure it your friends on the other side were only capable of pitying but not of aiding you no farther help or counsel was remaining to you but what was founded on yourself and that indeed was your security for your diligence your constancy and your prudence wrought more surely within when they were not disturbed by any outward motion the highest virtue is best to be trusted with itself for assistance only can be given by a genius superior to that which it assists and it is the noblest kind of debt when we are only obliged to god and nature this then my lord is your just commendation that you have wrought out yourself a way to glory by those very means that were designed for your destruction you have not only restored but advanced the revenues of your master without grievance to the subject and as if that were little yet the debts of the exchequer which lay heaviest both on the crown and on private persons have by your conduct been established in a certainty of satisfaction2 an action so much the more great and honourable because the case was without the ordinary relief of laws above the hopes of the afflicted and beyond the narrowness of the treasury to redress had it been managed by a less able hand it is certainly the happiest and most unenvied part of all your fortune to do good to many while you do injury to none to receive at once the prayers of the subject and the praises of the prince and by the care of your conduct to give him means of exerting the chiefest if any be the chiefest of his royal virtues his distributive justice to the deserving and his bounty and compassion to the wanting the disposition of princes towards their people cannot be better discovered than in the choice of their ministers who like the animal spirits betwixt the soul and body participate somewhat of both natures and make the communication which is betwixt them a king who is just and moderate in his nature who rules according to the laws whom god has made happy by forming the temper of his soul to the constitution of his government and who makes us happy by assuming over us no other sovereignty than that wherein our welfare and liberty consists a prince i say of so excellent a character and so suitable to the wishes of all good men could not better have conveyed himself into his peoples apprehensions than in your lordships person who so lively express the same virtues that you seem not so much a copy as an emanation of him moderation is doubtless an establishment of greatness but there is a steadiness of temper which is likewise requisite in a minister of state so equal a mixture of both virtues that he may stand like an isthmus betwixt the two encroaching seas of arbitrary power and lawless anarchy the undertaking would be difficult to any but an extraordinary genius to stand at the line and to divide the limits to pay what is due to the great representative of the nation and neither to enhance nor to yield up the undoubted prerogatives of the crown these my lord are the proper virtues of a noble englishman as indeed they are properly english virtues no people in the world being capable of using them but we who have the happiness to be born under so equal and so well poised a governmenta government which has all the advantages of liberty beyond a commonwealth and all the marks of kingly sovereignty without the danger of a tyranny both my nature as i am an englishman and my reason as i am a man have bred in me a loathing to that specious name of a republic that mock appearance of a liberty where all who have not part in the government are slaves and slaves they are of a viler note than such as are subjects to an absolute dominion for no christian monarchy is so absolute but it is circumscribed with laws but when the executive power is in the lawmakers there is no farther check upon them and the people must suffer without a remedy because they are oppressed by their representatives if i must serve the number of my masters who were born my equals would but add to the ignominy of my bondage the nature of our government above all others is exactly suited both to the situation of our country and the temper of the natives an island being more proper for commerce and for defence than for extending its dominions on the continent for what the valour of its inhabitants might gain by reason of its remoteness and the casualties of the seas it could not so easily preserve and therefore neither the arbitrary power of one in a monarchy nor of many in a commonwealth could make us greater than we are it is true that vaster and more frequent taxes might be gathered when the consent of the people was not asked or needed but this were only by conquering abroad to be poor at home and the examples of our neighbours teach us that they are not always the happiest subjects whose kings extend their dominions farthest since therefore we cannot win by an offensive war at least a land war the model of our government seems naturally contrived for the defensive part and the consent of a people is easily obtained to contribute to that power which must protect it felices nimium bona si sua n√≥rint angligen√¶ and yet there are not wanting malecontents amongst us who surfeiting themselves on too much happiness would persuade the people that they might be happier by a change it was indeed the policy of their old forefather when himself was fallen from the station of glory to seduce mankind into the same rebellion with him by telling him he might yet be freer than he was that is more free than his nature would allow or if i may so say than god could make him we have already all the liberty which freeborn subjects can enjoy and all beyond it is but licence but if it be liberty of conscience which they pretend the moderation of our church is such that its practice extends not to the severity of persecution and its discipline is withal so easy that it allows more freedom to dissenters than any of the sects would allow to it in the mean time what right can be pretended by these men to attempt innovation in church or state who made them the trustees or to speak a little nearer their own language the keepers of the liberty of england if their call be extraordinary let them convince us by working miracles for ordinary vocation they can have none to disturb the government under which they were born and which protects them he who has often changed his party and always has made his interest the rule of it gives little evidence of his sincerity for the public good it is manifest he changes but for himself and takes the people for tools to work his fortune yet the experience of all ages might let him know that they who trouble the waters first have seldom the benefit of fishing as they who began the late rebellion enjoyed not the fruit of their undertaking but were crushed themselves by the usurpation of their own instrument neither is it enough for them to answer that they only intend a reformation of the government but not the subversion of it on such pretence all insurrections have been founded it is striking at the root of power which is obedience every remonstrance of private men has the seed of treason in it and discourses which are couched in ambiguous terms are therefore the more dangerous because they do all the mischief of open sedition yet are safe from the punishment of the laws these my lord are considerations which i should not pass so lightly over had i room to manage them as they deserve for no man can be so inconsiderable in a nation as not to have a share in the welfare of it and if he be a true englishman he must at the same time be fired with indignation and revenge himself as he can on the disturbers of his country and to whom could i more fitly apply myself than to your lordship who have not only an inborn but an hereditary loyalty the memorable constancy and sufferings of your father almost to the ruin of his estate for the royal cause were an earnest of that which such a parent and such an institution would produce in the person of a son but so unhappy an occasion of manifesting your own zeal in suffering for his present majesty the providence of god and the prudence of your administration will i hope prevent that as your fathers fortune waited on the unhappiness of his sovereign so your own may participate of the better fate which attends his son the relation which you have by alliance to the noble family of your lady serves to confirm to you both this happy augury for what can deserve a greater place in the english chronicle than the loyalty and courage the actions and death of the general of an army fighting for his prince and country the honour and gallantry of the earl of lindsey is so illustrious a subject that it is fit to adorn an heroic poem for he was the protomartyr of the cause and the type of his unfortunate royal master3  yet after all my lord if i may speak my thoughts you are happy rather to us than to yourself for the multiplicity the cares and the vexations of your employment have betrayed you from yourself and given you up into the possession of the public you are robbed of your privacy and friends and scarce any hour of your life you can call your own those who envy your fortune if they wanted not goodnature might more justly pity it and when they see you watched by a crowd of suitors whose importunity it is impossible to avoid would conclude with reason that you have lost much more in true content than you have gained by dignity and that a private gentleman is better attended by a single servant than your lordship with so clamorous a train pardon me my lord if i speak like a philosopher on this subject the fortune which makes a man uneasy cannot make him happy and a wise man must think himself uneasy when few of his actions are in his choice  this last consideration has brought me to another and a very seasonable one for your relief which is that while i pity your want of leisure i have impertinently detained you so long a time i have put off my own business which was my dedication till it is so late that i am now ashamed to begin it and therefore i will say nothing of the poem which i present to you because i know not if you are like to have an hour which with a good conscience you may throw away in perusing it and for the author i have only to beg the continuance of your protection to him who is    my lord      your lordships most obliged       most humble and         most obedient servant           john dryden   footnotes 1 the person to whom these high titles now belonged was sir thomas    osburne a baronet of good family and decayed estate part of    which had been lost in the royal cause he was of a bold undaunted    character and stood high for the prerogative hence he was thought    worthy of being sworn into the privy council during the    administration of the famous cabal and when that was dissolved by    the secession of shaftesbury and the resignation of clifford he    was judged a proper person to succeed the latter as lord high    treasurer he was created earl of danby and was supposed to be    deeply engaged in the attempt to newmodel our constitution on a    more arbitrary plan having been even heard to say when sitting in    judgment that a new proclamation from the crown was superior to an    old act of parliament nevertheless he was persecuted as well by    the faction of the duke of york to whom he was odious for having    officiously introduced the famous popish plot to the consideration    of parliament as by the popular party who hated him as a    favourite minister accordingly in 1678 he was impeached by a    vote of the house of commons and in consequence notwithstanding    the countenance of the king was deprived of all his offices and    finally committed to the tower where he remained for four years    sir john reresby has these reflections on lord danbys greatness    and sudden fall it was but a few months before that few things    were transacted at court but with the privity or consent of this    great man the kings brother and favourite mistress were glad to    be fair with him and the general address of all men of business    was to him who was not only treasurer but prime minister also    who not only kept the purse but was the first and greatest    confident in all affairs of state but now he is neglected of    all forced to hide his head as a criminal and in danger of losing    all he has got and his life therewith his family raised from    privacy to the degree of marquis a patent was then actually    passing to invest him with that dignity is now on the brink of    falling below the humble stand of a yeoman nor would almost the    meanest subject change conditions with him now whom so very lately    the greatest beheld with envy memoirs p 85     as he was obnoxious to all parties lord danby would probably have    been made a sacrifice had not the disturbances which arose from    the various plots of the time turned the attention of his enemies    to other subjects he was liberated in 16834 survived the    revolution was created duke of leeds and died in 1712 his    character was of the most decided kind he was fertile in    expedients and had always something new to substitute for those    which failed a faculty highly acceptable to charles who loved to    be relieved even were it but in idea from the labour of business    and the pressure of difficulty in other points he was probably    not very scrupulous since even dryden found cause to say at    length that       danbys matchless impudence      helped to support the knave  2 this alludes to the stop of payments in exchequer in 16712 a    desperate measure recommended by clifford to secure money for the    war against holland  3 the earl of lindsey was general in chief for king charles i at the    breaking out of the civil war as an evil omen of the royal cause    he was mortally wounded and made prisoner at the battle of    edgehill the very first which was fought betwixt the king and    parliament clarendon says he had very many friends and very few    enemies and died generally lamented his son montague bertie    earl of lindsey was a sufferer in the same cause lord danby was    married to the lady bridget the second daughter of that nobleman                                    preface   the death of antony and cleopatra is a subject which has been treated by the greatest wits of our nation after shakespeare and by all so variously that their example has given me the confidence to try myself in this bow of ulysses amongst the crowd of shooters and withal to take my own measures in aiming at the mark i doubt not but the same motive has prevailed with all of us in this attempt i mean the excellency of the moral for the chief persons represented were famous patterns of unlawful love and their end accordingly was unfortunate all reasonable men have long since concluded that the hero of the poem ought not to be a character of perfect virtue for then he could not without injustice be made unhappy nor yet altogether wicked because he could not then be pitied i have therefore steered the middle course and have drawn the character of antony as favourably as plutarch appian and dion cassius would give me leave the like i have observed in cleopatra that which is wanting to work up the pity to a greater heighth was not afforded me by the story for the crimes of love which they both committed were not occasioned by any necessity or fatal ignorance but were wholly voluntary since our passions are or ought to be within our power the fabric of the play is regular enough as to the inferior parts of it and the unities of time place and action more exactly observed than perhaps the english theatre requires particularly the action is so much one that it is the only of the kind without episode or underplot every scene in the tragedy conducing to the main design and every act concluding with a turn of it the greatest error in the contrivance seems to be in the person of octavia for though i might use the privilege of a poet to introduce her into alexandria yet i had not enough considered that the compassion she moved to herself and children was destructive to that which i reserved for antony and cleopatra whose mutual love being founded upon vice must lessen the favour of the audience to them when virtue and innocence were oppressed by it and though i justified antony in some measure by making octavias departure to proceed wholly from herself yet the force of the first machine still remained and the dividing of pity like the cutting of a river into many channels abated the strength of the natural stream but this is an objection which none of my critics have urged against me and therefore i might have let it pass if i could have resolved to have been partial to myself the faults my enemies have found are rather cavils concerning little and not essential decencies which a master of the ceremonies may decide betwixt us the french poets i confess are strict observers of these punctilios they would not for example have suffered cleopatra and octavia to have met or if they had met there must have only passed betwixt them some cold civilities but no eagerness of repartee for fear of offending against the greatness of their characters and the modesty of their sex this objection i foresaw and at the same time contemned for i judged it both natural and probable that octavia proud of her newgained conquest would search out cleopatra to triumph over her and that cleopatra thus attacked was not of a spirit to shun the encounter and it is not unlikely that two exasperated rivals should use such satire as i have put into their mouths for after all though the one were a roman and the other a queen they were both women it is true some actions though natural are not fit to be represented and broad obscenities in words ought in good manners to be avoided expressions therefore are a modest clothing of our thoughts as breeches and petticoats are of our bodies if i have kept myself within the bounds of modesty all beyond it is but nicety and affectation which is no more but modesty depraved into a vice they betray themselves who are too quick of apprehension in such cases and leave all reasonable men to imagine worse of them than of the poet  honest montaigne goes yet farther nous ne sommes que ceremonie la ceremonie nous emporte et laissons la substance des choses nous nous tenons aux branches et abandonnons le tronc et le corps nous avons appris aux dames de rougir oyans seulement nommer ce quelles ne craignent aucunement √† faire nous nesons appeller √† droict nos membres et ne craignons pas de les employer √† toute sorte de debauche la ceremonie nous defend dexprimer par paroles les choses licites et naturelles et nous len croyons la raison nous defend de nen faire point dillicites et mauvaises et personne ne len croit my comfort is that by this opinion my enemies are but sucking critics who would fain be nibbling ere their teeth are come  yet in this nicety of manners does the excellency of french poetry consist their heroes are the most civil people breathing but their good breeding seldom extends to a word of sense all their wit is in their ceremony they want the genius which animates our stage and therefore it is but necessary when they cannot please that they should take care not to offend but as the civillest man in the company is commonly the dullest so these authors while they are afraid to make you laugh or cry out of pure good manners make you sleep they are so careful not to exasperate a critic that they never leave him any work so busy with the broom and make so clean a riddance that there is little left either for censure or for praise for no part of a poem is worth our discommending where the whole is insipid as when we have once tasted of palled wine we stay not to examine it glass by glass but while they affect to shine in trifles they are often careless in essentials thus their hippolitus is so scrupulous in point of decency that he will rather expose himself to death than accuse his stepmother to his father and my critics i am sure will commend him for it but we of grosser apprehensions are apt to think that this excess of generosity is not practicable but with fools and madmen this was good manners with a vengeance and the audience is like to be much concerned at the misfortunes of this admirable hero but take hippolitus out of his poetic fit and i suppose he would think it a wiser part to set the saddle on the right horse and chuse rather to live with the reputation of a plainspoken honest man than to die with the infamy of an incestuous villain1 in the mean time we may take notice that where the poet ought to have preserved the character as it was delivered to us by antiquity when he should have given us the picture of a rough young man of the amazonian strain a jolly huntsman and both by his profession and his early rising a mortal enemy to love he has chosen to give him the turn of gallantry sent him to travel from athens to paris taught him to make love and transformed the hippolitus of euripides into monsieur hippolite i should not have troubled myself thus far with french poets but that i find our chedreux2 critics wholly form their judgments by them but for my part i desire to be tried by the laws of my own country for it seems unjust to me that the french should prescribe here till they have conquered our little sonetteers who follow them have too narrow souls to judge of poetry poets themselves are the most proper though i conclude not the only critics but till some genius as universal as aristotle shall arise one who can penetrate into all arts and sciences without the practice of them i shall think it reasonable that the judgment of an artificer in his own art should be preferable to the opinion of another man at least where he is not bribed by interest or prejudiced by malice and this i suppose is manifest by plain inductions for first the crowd cannot be presumed to have more than a gross instinct of what pleases or displeases them every man will grant me this but then by a particular kindness to himself he draws his own stake first and will be distinguished from the multitude of which other men may think him one but if i come closer to those who are allowed for witty men either by the advantage of their quality or by common fame and affirm that neither are they qualified to decide sovereignly concerning poetry i shall yet have a strong party of my opinion for most of them severally will exclude the rest either from the number of witty men or at least of able judges but here again they are all indulgent to themselves and every one who believes himself a wit that is every man will pretend at the same time to a right judgeing but to press it yet farther there are many witty men but few poets neither have all poets a taste of tragedy and this is the rock on which they are daily splitting poetry which is a picture of nature must generally please but it is not to be understood that all parts of it must please every man therefore is not tragedy to be judged by a witty man whose taste is only confined to comedy nor is every man who loves tragedy a sufficient judge of it he must understand the excellencies of it too or he will only prove a blind admirer not a critic from hence it comes that so many satires on poets and censures of their writings fly abroad men of pleasant conversation at least esteemed so and endued with a trifling kind of fancy perhaps helped out with some smattering of latin are ambitious to distinguish themselves from the herd of gentlemen by their poetry    rarus enim ferm√® sensus communis in ill√¢   fortun√¢  and is not this a wretched affectation not to be contented with what fortune has done for them and sit down quietly with their estates but they must call their wits in question and needlessly expose their nakedness to public view not considering that they are not to expect the same approbation from sober men which they have found from their flatterers after the third bottle if a little glittering in discourse has passed them on us for witty men where was the necessity of undeceiving the world would a man who has an ill title to an estate but yet is in possession of it would he bring it of his own accord to be tried at westminster we who write if we want the talent yet have the excuse that we do it for a poor subsistence but what can be urged in their defence who not having the vocation of poverty to scribble out of mere wantonness take pains to make themselves ridiculous horace was certainly in the right where he said that no man is satisfied with his own condition a poet is not pleased because he is not rich and the rich are discontented because the poets will not admit them of their number thus the case is hard with writers if they succeed not they must starve and if they do some malicious satire is prepared to level them for daring to please without their leave but while they are so eager to destroy the fame of others their ambition is manifest in their concernment some poem of their own is to lie produced and the slaves are to be laid flat with their faces on the ground that the monarch may appear in the greater majesty3  dionysius and nero had the same longing but with all their power they could never bring their business well about tis true they proclaimed themselves poets by sound of trumpet and poets they were upon pain of death to any man who durst call them otherwise the audience had a fine time ont you may imagine they sat in a bodily fear and looked as demurely as they could for it was a hanging matter to laugh unseasonably and the tyrants were suspicious as they had reason that their subjects had them in the wind so every man in his own defence set as good a face upon the business as he could it was known beforehand that the monarchs were to be crowned laureats but when the show was over and an honest man was suffered to depart quietly he took out his laughter which he had stifled with a firm resolution never more to see an emperors play though he had been ten years a making it in the mean time the true poets were they who made the best markets for they had wit enough to yield the prize with a good grace and not contend with him who had thirty legions4 they were sure to be rewarded if they confessed themselves bad writers and that was somewhat better than to be martyrs for their reputation lucans example was enough to teach them manners and after he was put to death for overcoming nero the emperor carried it without dispute for the best poet in his dominions no man was ambitious of that grinning honour for if he heard the malicious trumpeter proclaiming his name before his betters he knew there was but one way with him mec√¶nas took another course and we know he was more than a great man for he was witty too but finding himself far gone in poetry which seneca assures us was not his talent he thought it his best way to be well with virgil and with horace that at least he might be a poet at the second hand and we see how happily it has succeeded with him for his own bad poetry is forgotten and their panegyricks of him still remain but they who should be our patrons are for no such expensive ways to fame they have much of the poetry of mec√¶nas but little of his liberality they are for persecuting horace and virgil in the persons of their successors for such is every man who has any part of their soul and fire though in a less degree some of their little zanies yet go farther for they are persecutors even of horace himself as far as they are able by their ignorant and vile imitations of him by making an unjust use of his authority and turning his artillery against his friends but how would he disdain to be copied by such hands i dare answer for him he would be more uneasy in their company than he was with crispinus their forefather in the holy way and would no more have allowed them a place amongst the critics than he would demetrius the mimic and tigellius the buffoon    demetri teque tigelli   discipulorum inter jubeo plorare cathedras  with what scorn would he look down on such miserable translators who make doggrel of his latin mistake his meaning misapply his censures and often contradict their own he is fixed as a landmark to set out the bounds of poetry    saxum antiquum ingens   limes agro positus litem ut discerneret arvis  but other arms than theirs and other sinews are required to raise the weight of such an author and when they would toss him against their enemies    genua labant gelidus concrevit frigore sanguis   tum lapis ipse viri vacuum per inane volutus   nec spatium evasit totum nec pertulit ictum5  for my part i would wish no other revenge either for myself or the rest of the poets from this rhyming judge of the twelvepenny gallery this legitimate son of sternhold than that he would subscribe his name to his censure or not to tax him beyond his learning set his mark for should he own himself publicly and come from behind the lions skin they whom he condemns would be thankful to him they whom he praises would chuse to be condemned and the magistrates whom he has elected would modestly withdraw from their employment to avoid the scandal of his nomination6 the sharpness of his satire next to himself falls most heavily on his friends and they ought never to forgive him for commending them perpetually the wrong way and sometimes by contraries if he have a friend whose hastiness in writing is his greatest fault horace would have taught him to have minced the matter and to have called it readiness of thought and a flowing fancy for friendship will allow a man to christen an imperfection by the name of some neighbour virtue    vellem in amiciti√¢ sic erraremus et isti   errori nomen virtus posuisset honestum  but he would never have allowed him to have called a slow man hasty or a hasty writer a slow drudge7 as juvenal explains it    canibus pigris scabieque vetust√¢   l√¶vibus et sicc√¶ lambentibus ora lucern√¶   nomen erit pardus tygris leo si quid adhuc est   quod fremit in terris violentius8  yet lucretius laughs at a foolish lover even for excusing the imperfections of his mistress    nigra greek melichroos est immunda et foetida greek akosmos   balba loqui non quit greek traulizei muta pudens est c  but to drive it ad √Üthiopem cygnum is not to be endured i leave him to interpret this by the benefit of his french version on the other side and without farther considering him than i have the rest of my illiterate censors whom i have disdained to answer because they are not qualified for judges it remains that i acquaint the reader that i have endeavoured in this play to follow the practice of the ancients who as mr rymer has judiciously observed are and ought to be our masters9 horace likewise gives it for a rule in his art of poetry    vos exemplaria gr√¶ca   nocturn√¢ versate manu versate diurn√¢  yet though their models are regular they are too little for english tragedy which requires to be built in a larger compass i could give an instance in the oedipus tyrannus which was the master piece of sophocles but i reserve it for a more fit occasion which i hope to have hereafter in my style i have professed to imitate the divine shakespeare which that i might perform more freely i have disincumbered myself from rhyme not that i condemn my former way but that this is more proper to my present purpose i hope i need not to explain myself that i have not copied my author servilely words and phrases must of necessity receive a change in succeeding ages but it is almost a miracle that much of his language remains so pure and that he who began dramatic poetry amongst us untaught by any and as ben jonson tells us without learning should by the force of his own genius perform so much that in a manner he has left no praise for any who come after him the occasion is fair and the subject would be pleasant to handle the difference of styles betwixt him and fletcher and wherein and how far they are both to be imitated but since i must not be overconfident of my own performance after him it will be prudence in me to be silent yet i hope i may affirm and without vanity that by imitating him i have excelled myself throughout the play and particularly that i prefer the scene betwixt antony and ventidius in the first act to any thing which i have written in this kind   footnotes 1 that the reader may himself judge of the justice of drydens    censure i subjoin the argument on this knotty point as it is

veteran    in the gentlemans magazine for 1745 that our author as he    advanced in reputation assumed the fashionable chedreux periwig  3 this passage though doubtless applicable to many of the men of    rank at the court of charles ii was particularly levelled at lord    rochester with whom our author was now on bad terms it is hardly    fair to enquire how far this description of the discourse and    talents of a person of wit and honour agrees with that given in the    dedication to marriage alamode when in compliment to the same    nobleman we are told that wit seems to have lodged itself more    nobly in this age than in any of the former and that his lordship    had but another step to make from the patron of wit to become its    tyrant this last observation seems to have been made in the    spirit of prophecy  4 such is said to have been the answer of a philosopher to a friend    who upbraided him with giving up a dispute to the emperor adrian  5 this passage alludes to an imitation of horace quaintly entitled    an allusion to the tenth satire of his first book which was the    production of rochester as however it appeared without a name it    may have been for a time imputed to some of the inferior wits whom    his lordship patronized it contains a warm attack on dryden part    of which has been already quoted dryden probably knew the real    author of this satire although he chose to impute it to one of the    zanies of the great at least it seems unlikely that he should    take crown for the author as has been supposed by mr malone for    in the imitation we have these lines       for by that rule i might as well admit      crowns heavy scenes for poetry and wit     crown could hardly be charged as author of a poem in which this    sarcasm occurred  6 alluding probably to the concluding lines of the satire       i loath the rabble tis enough for me      if sedley shadwell shepherd wycherley      godolphin butler buckhurst buckingham      and some few more whom i omit to name      approve my sense i count their censure fame  7 dryden alludes to the censure past on himself where it is said       five hundred verses in a morning writ      prove him no more a poet than a wit  8 this refers to the characters of shadwell and wycherley which    according to dryden the satirist seems to have misunderstood       of all our modern wits none seems to me      once to have touched upon true comedy      but hasty shadwell and slow wycherley      shadwells unfinished works do yet impart      great proofs of force of nature none of art      with just bold strokes he dashes here and there      shewing great mastery with little care      but wycherley earns hard whateer he gains      he wants no judgment and he spares no pains      he frequently excels and at the least      makes fewer faults than any of the rest  9 i have chiefly considered the fable or plot which all conclude    to be the soul of a tragedy which with the ancients is all ways    to be found a reasonable soul but with us for the most part a    brutish and often worse than brutish     and certainly there is not required much learning or that a man    must be some aristotle and doctor of subtilties to form a right    judgement in this particular common sense suffices and rarely    have i known womenjudges mistaken in these points where they have    patience to think and left to their own heads they decide with    their own sense but if people are prepossessed if they will judge    of rollo by othello and one crooked line by another we can never    have a certainty     the tragedies of the last age considered in a letter to fleetwood    shepherd by thomas rymer edit 1678 p 4                                   prologue     what flocks of critics hover
