toads came from do you see anything queer about him he asked if he dont watch out hell blow up and bust exclaimed jimmy his funny little tongue darted out and the fly was gone cant talk with common folks any more he muttered i am a little warm replied mr toad in his most polite manner     the adventures of old mr toad     i   jimmy skunk is puzzled  old mother west wind had just come down from the purple hills and turned loose her children the merry little breezes from the big bag in which she had been carrying them they were very lively and very merry as they danced and raced across the green meadows in all directions for it was good to be back there once more old mother west wind almost sighed as she watched them for a few minutes she felt that she would like to join them always the springtime made her feel this wayyoung mad carefree and happy but she had work to do she had to turn the windmill to pump water for farmer browns cows and this was only one of many mills standing idle as they waited for her so she puffed her cheeks out and started about her business  jimmy skunk sat at the top of the hill that overlooks the green meadows and watched her out of sight then he started to amble down the lone little path to look for some beetles he was ambling along in his lazy way for you know he never hurries when he heard some one puffing and blowing behind him of course he turned to see who it was and he was greatly surprised when he discovered old mr toad yes sir it was old mr toad and he seemed in a great hurry he was quite short of breath but he was hopping along in the most determined way as if he were in a great hurry to get somewhere  now it is a very unusual thing for mr toad to hurry very unusual indeed as a rule he hops a few steps and then sits down to think it over jimmy had never before seen him hop more than a few steps unless he was trying to get away from danger from mr blacksnake for instance of course the first thing jimmy thought of was mr blacksnake and he looked for him but there was no sign of mr blacksnake nor of any other danger then he looked very hard at old mr toad and he saw right away that old mr toad didnt seem to be frightened at all only very determined and as if he had something important on his mind  well well exclaimed jimmy skunk whatever has got into those long hind legs of yours to make them work so fast  old mr toad didnt say a word but simply tried to get past jimmy and keep on his way jimmy put out one hand and turned old mr toad right over on his back where he kicked and struggled in an effort to get on his feet again and looked very ridiculous  dont you know that it isnt polite not to speak when you are spoken to demanded jimmy severely though his eyes twinkled  ii beg your pardon i didnt have any breath to spare panted old mr toad you see im in a great hurry  yes i see replied jimmy but dont you know that it isnt good for the health to hurry so now pray what are you in such a hurry for i dont see anything to run away from  im not running away retorted old mr toad indignantly ive business to attend to at the smiling pool and im late as it is  business exclaimed jimmy as if he could hardly believe his ears what business have you at the smiling pool  that is my own affair retorted old mr toad but if you really want to know ill tell you i have a very important part in the spring chorus and im going down there to sing i have a very beautiful voice  that was too much for jimmy skunk he just lay down and rolled over and over with laughter the idea of any one so homely almost uglylooking as mr toad thinking that he had a beautiful voice ha ha ha ho ho ho roared jimmy  when at last he stopped because he couldnt laugh any more he discovered that old mr toad was on his way again hop hop hippertyhop hop hop hippertyhop went mr toad jimmy watched him and he confessed that he was puzzled     ii   jimmy skunk consults his friends  jimmy skunk scratched his head thoughtfully as he watched old mr toad go down the lone little path hop hop hippertyhop towards the smiling pool he certainly was puzzled was jimmy skunk if old mr toad had told him that he could fly jimmy would not have been more surprised or found it harder to believe than that old mr toad had a beautiful voice the truth is jimmy didnt believe it he thought that old mr toad was trying to fool him  presently peter rabbit came along he found jimmy skunk sitting in a brown study he had quite forgotten to look for fat beetles and when he forgets to do that you may make up your mind that jimmy is doing some hard thinking  hello old stripedcoat what have you got on your mind this fine morning cried peter rabbit  him said jimmy simply pointing down the lone little path  peter looked do you mean old mr toad he asked  jimmy nodded do you see anything queer about him he asked in his turn  illustration do you see anything queer about him he asked  peter stared down the lone little path no he replied except that he seems in a great hurry  thats just it jimmy returned promptly did you ever see him hurry unless he was frightened  peter confessed that he never had  well he isnt frightened now yet just look at him go retorted jimmy says he has got a beautiful voice and that he has to take part in the spring chorus at the smiling pool and that he is late  peter looked very hard at jimmy to see if he was fooling or telling the truth then he began to laugh old mr toad sing the very idea he cried he can sing about as much as i can and that is not at all  jimmy grinned i think hes crazy if you ask me said he and yet he was just as earnest about it as if it were really so i think he must have eaten something that has gone to his head theres unc billy possum over there lets ask him what he thinks  so jimmy and peter joined unc billy and jimmy told the story about old mr toad all over again unc billy chuckled and laughed just as they had at the idea of old mr toads saying he had a beautiful voice but unc billy has a shrewd little head on his shoulders after a few minutes he stopped laughing  ah done learn a right smart long time ago that ah don know all there is to know about mah neighbors said he weuns done think of brer toad as uglylookin fo so long that weuns may have overlooked something ah don reckon brer toad can sing but ah lows that perhaps he thinks he can what do youalls say to weuns going down to the smiling pool and finding out what he really is up to  the very thing cried peter kicking up his heels you know peter is always ready to go anywhere or do anything that will satisfy his curiosity  jimmy skunk thought it over for a few minutes and then he decided that as he hadnt anything in particular to do and as he might find some fat beetles on the way he would go too so off they started after old mr toad peter rabbit in the lead as usual unc billy possum next grinning as only he can grin and in the rear jimmy skunk taking his time and keeping a sharp eye out for fat beetles     iii   the hunt for old mr toad  now though old mr toad was hurrying as fast as ever he could and was quite out of breath he wasnt getting along very fast compared with the way peter rabbit or jimmy skunk or unc billy possum could cover the ground you see he cannot make long jumps like his cousin grandfather frog but only little short hops  so peter and jimmy and unc billy took their time about following him they stopped to hunt for fat beetles for jimmy skunk and at every little patch of sweet clover for peter rabbit to help himself once they wasted a lot of time while unc billy possum hunted for a nest of carol the meadow lark on the chance that he would find some fresh eggs there he didnt find the nest for the very good reason that carol hadnt built one yet peter was secretly glad you know he doesnt eat eggs and he is always sorry for his feathered friends when their eggs are stolen  half way across the green meadows they stopped to play with the merry little breezes and because it was very pleasant there they played longer than they realized when at last they started on again old mr toad was out of sight you see all the time he had kept right on going hop hop hippertyhop  never mind said peter we can catch up with him easy enough hes such a slowpoke  but even a slowpoke who keeps right on doing a thing without wasting any time always gets somewhere sooner or later very often sooner than those who are naturally quicker but who waste their time so it was with old mr toad he kept right on hop hop hippertyhop while the others were playing and so it happened that when at last peter and jimmy and unc billy reached the smiling pool they hadnt caught another glimpse of old mr toad  do you suppose he hid somewhere and we passed him asked peter  unc billy shook his head ah don reckon so said he weuns done been foolin away our time an brer toad done stole a march on us ah reckons weuns will find him sittin on the bank here somewhere  so right away the three separated to look for old mr toad all along the bank of the smiling pool they looked they peeped under old leaves and sticks they looked in every place where old mr toad might have hidden but not a trace of him did they find    tralalalee okachee okachee   happy am i as i can be  sang mr redwing as he swayed to and fro among the bulrushes  say mr redwing have you seen old mr toad called peter rabbit  no replied mr redwing is that whom you fellows are looking for i wondered if you had lost something what do you want with old mr toad  peter explained how they had followed old mr toad just to see what he really was up to of course we know that he hasnt any more voice than i have declared peter but we are curious to know if he really thinks he has and why he should be in such a hurry to reach the smiling pool it looks to us as if the spring has made old mr toad crazy  oh thats it is it replied mr redwing his bright eyes twinkling some people dont know as much as they might ive been wondering where old mr toad was and im ever so glad to learn that he hasnt forgotten that he has a very important part in our beautiful spring chorus then once more mr redwing began to sing     iv   peter rabbit finds old mr toad  it isnt often that peter rabbit is truly envious but sometimes in the joyousness of spring he is he envies the birds because they can pour out in beautiful song the joy that is in them the only way he can express his feelings is by kicking his long heels jumping about and such foolish things while that gives peter a great deal of satisfaction it doesnt add to the joy of other people as do the songs of the birds and you know to give joy to others is to add to your own joy so there are times when peter wishes he could sing  he was wishing this very thing now as he sat on the bank of the smiling pool listening to the great spring chorus    tralalalee okachee okachee   theres joy in the spring for you and for me  sang redwing the blackbird from the bulrushes  from over in the green meadows rose the clear lilt of carol the meadow lark and among the alders just where the laughing brook ran into the smiling pool a flood of happiness was pouring from the throat of little friend the song sparrow winsome bluebirds sweet almost plaintive whistle seemed to fairly float in the air so that it was hard to say just where it did come from and in the top of the big hickorytree welcome robin was singing as if his heart were bursting with joy even sammy jay was adding a beautiful belllike note instead of his usual harsh scream as for the smiling pool it seemed as if the very water itself sang for a mighty chorus of clear piping voices from unseen singers rose from all around its banks peter knew who those singers were although look as he would he could see none of them they were hylas the tiny cousins of stickytoes the tree toad  listening to all these joyous voices peter forgot for a time what had brought him to the smiling pool but jimmy skunk and unc billy possum didnt forget they were still hunting for old mr toad  well old mr dreamer have you found him yet asked jimmy skunk stealing up behind peter and poking him in the back  peter came to himself with a start no said he i was just listening and wishing that i could sing too dont you ever wish you could sing jimmy  no replied jimmy i never waste time wishing i could do things it was never meant i should do its funny where old mr toad is he said that he was coming down here to sing and redwing the blackbird seemed to be expecting him ive looked everywhere i can think of without finding him but i dont believe in giving up without another try stop your dreaming and come help us hunt  so peter stopped his dreaming and joined in the search now there was one place where neither peter nor jimmy nor unc billy had thought of looking that was in the smiling pool itself they just took it for granted that old mr toad was somewhere on the bank presently peter came to a place where the bank was very low and the water was shallow for quite a little distance out in the smiling pool from out of that shallow water came the piping voice of a hyla and peter stopped to stare trying to see the tiny singer  suddenly he jumped right up in the air with surprise there was a familiarlooking head sticking out of the water peter had found old mr toad     v   old mr toads music bag    never think that you have learned     all there is to know   thats the surest way of all     ignorance to show  ive found old mr toad cried peter rabbit hurrying after jimmy skunk  where demanded jimmy  in the water declared peter hes sitting right over there where the water is shallow and he didnt notice me at all lets get unc billy and then creep over to the edge of the smiling pool and watch to see if old mr toad really does try to sing  so they hunted up unc billy possum and the three stole very softly over to the edge of the smiling pool where the bank was low and the water shallow sure enough there sat old mr toad with just his head out of water and while they were watching him something very strange happened  whatwhats the matter with him whispered peter his big eyes looking as if they might pop out of his head  if he dont watch out hell blow up and bust exclaimed jimmy  illustration if he dont watch out hell blow up and bust exclaimed jimmy  listen whispered unc billy possum do mah ol ears hear right pears to me that that song is coming right from where brer toad is sitting  it certainly did appear so and of all the songs that glad spring day there was none sweeter indeed there were few as sweet the only trouble was the song was so very short it lasted only for two or three seconds and when it ended old mr toad looked quite his natural self again just as commonplace almost ugly as ever peter looked at jimmy skunk jimmy looked at unc billy possum and unc billy looked at peter and no one had a word to say then all three looked back at old mr toad  and even as they looked his throat began to swell and swell and swell until it was no wonder that jimmy skunk had thought that he was in danger of blowing up and then when it stopped swelling there came again those beautiful little notes so sweet and tremulous that peter actually held his breath to listen there was no doubt that old mr toad was singing just as he had said he was going to and it was just as true that his song was one of the sweetest if not the sweetest of all the chorus from and around the smiling pool it was very hard to believe but peter and jimmy and unc billy both saw and heard and that was enough their respect for old mr toad grew tremendously as they listened  how does he do it whispered peter  with that bag under his chin of course replied jimmy skunk dont you see its only when that is swelled out that he sings its a regular music bag and i didnt know he had any such bag there at all  i wish said peter rabbit feeling of his throat that i had a music bag like that in my throat  and then he joined in the laugh of jimmy and unc billy but still with something of a look of wistfulness in his eyes     vi   peter discovers something more    there are stranger things in the world today     than ever you dreamed could be   theres beauty in some of the commonest things     if only youve eyes to see  ever since peter rabbit was a little chap and had first ran away from home he had known old mr toad and never once had peter suspected that he could sing also he had thought old mr toad almost uglylooking and he knew that most of his neighbors thought the same way they were fond of old mr toad for he was always goodnatured and attended strictly to his own affairs but they liked to poke fun at him and as for there being anything beautiful about him such a thing never entered their heads  now that they had discovered that he really has a very beautiful voice they began to look on him with a great deal more respect this was especially so with peter he got in the habit of going over to the smiling pool every day when the way was clear just to sit on the bank and listen to old mr toad  why didnt you ever tell us before that you could sing he asked one day as old mr toad looked up at him from the smiling pool  what was the use of wasting my breath demanded old mr toad you wouldnt have believed me if i had you didnt believe me when i did tell you  peter knew that this was true and he couldnt find any answer ready at last he ventured another question why havent i ever heard you sing before  you have replied old mr toad tartly i sang right in this very place last spring and the spring before and the spring before that youve sat on that very bank lots of times while i was singing the trouble with you peter is that you dont use your eyes or your ears  peter looked more foolish than ever but he ventured another question it wouldnt be peter to let a chance for questions go by have i ever heard you singing up on the meadows or in the old orchard  no replied old mr toad i only sing in the springtime thats the time for singing i just have to sing then in the summer it is too hot and in the winter i sleep i always return to my old home to sing you know i was born here all my family gathers here in the spring to sing so of course i come too  old mr toad filled out his queer music bag under his chin and began to sing again peter watched him now it just happened that old mr toad was facing him and so peter looked down straight into his eyes he never had looked into mr toads eyes before and now he just stared and stared for it came over him that those eyes were very beautiful very beautiful indeed  oh he exclaimed what beautiful eyes you have mr toad  so ive been told before replied old mr toad my family always has had beautiful eyes there is an old saying that every toad has jewels in his head but of course he hasnt not real jewels it is just the beautiful eyes excuse me peter but im needed in that chorus old mr toad once more swelled out his throat and began to sing  peter watched him a while longer then hopped away to the dear old briarpatch and he was very thoughtful  never again will i call anybody homely and ugly until i know all about him said peter which was a very wise decision dont you think so     vii   a shadow passes over the smiling pool    heres what mr toad says     heed it well my dear   time to watch for clouds is    when the sky is clear  he says that that is the reason that he lives to a good old age does old mr toad i suppose he means that when the sky is cloudy everybody is looking for rain and is prepared for it but when the sun is shining most people forget that there is such a thing as a storm so when it comes suddenly very few are prepared for it it is the same way with danger and trouble so old mr toad very wisely watches out when there seems to be the least need of it and he finds it always pays  it was a beautiful spring evening over back of the purple hills to which old mother west wind had taken her children the merry little breezes and behind which jolly round red mr sun had gone to bed there was still a faint clear light but over the green meadows and the smiling pool the shadows had drawn a curtain of soft dusk which in the green forest became black the little stars looked down from the sky and twinkled just to see their reflections twinkle back at them from the smiling pool and there and all around it was perfect peace jerry muskrat swam back and forth making little silver lines on the surface of the smiling pool and squeaking contentedly for it was the hour which he loves best little friend the song sparrow had tucked his head under his wing and gone to sleep among the alders along the laughing brook and redwing the blackbird had done the same thing among the bulrushes all the feathered songsters who had made joyous the bright day had gone to bed  but this did not mean that the glad spring chorus was silent oh my no no indeed the green meadows were silent and the green forest was silent but as if to make up for this the sweet singers of the smiling pool the hylas and the frogs and old mr toad were pouring out their gladness as if they had not been singing most of the departed day you see it was the hour they love best of all the hour which seems to them just made for singing and they were doing their best to tell old mother nature how they love her and how glad they were that she had brought back sweet mistress spring to waken them from their long sleep  it was so peaceful and beautiful there that it didnt seem possible that danger of any kind could be lurking near but old mr toad swelling out that queer music bag in his throat and singing with all his might never once forgot that wise saying of his and so he was the first to see what looked like nothing so much as a little detached bit of the blackness of the green forest floating out towards the smiling pool instantly he stopped singing now that was a signal when he stopped singing his nearest neighbor stopped singing then the next one and the next and in a minute there wasnt a sound from the smiling pool save the squeak of jerry muskrat hidden among the bulrushes that great chorus stopped as abruptly as the electric lights go out when you press a button  back and forth over the smiling pool this way and that way floated the shadow but there was no sign of any living thing in the smiling pool after awhile the shadow floated away over the green meadows without a sound  hooty the owl didnt get one of us that time said old mr toad to his nearest neighbor with a chuckle of satisfaction then he swelled out his music bag and began to sing again and at once as abruptly as it had stopped the great chorus began again as joyous as before for nothing had happened to bring sadness as might have but for the watchfulness of old mr toad     viii   old mr toads babies    the smiling pools a nursery     where all the sunny day   a thousand funny babies     are taught while at their play  really the smiling pool is a sort of kindergarten one of the most interesting kindergartens in the world little joe otters children learn to swim there so do jerry muskrats babies and those of billy mink the trout and minnow babies and a lot more and there you will find the children and grandchildren of grandfather frog and old mr toad  peter rabbit had known for a long time about the frog babies but though he knew that old mr toad was own cousin to grandfather frog he hadnt known anything about toad babies except that at a certain time in the year he was forever running across tiny toads especially on rainy days and each little toad was just like old mr toad except for his size peter had heard it said that toads rain down from the sky and sometimes it seems as if this must be so of course he knew it couldnt be but it puzzled him a great deal there wouldnt be a toad in sight then it would begin to rain and right away there would be so many tiny toads that it was hard work to jump without stepping on some  he remembered this as he went to pay his daily call on old mr toad in the smiling pool and listen to his sweet song he hadnt seen any little toads this year but he remembered his experiences with them in other years and he meant to ask about them  old mr toad was sitting in his usual place but he wasnt singing he was staring at something in the water when peter said good morning old mr toad didnt seem to hear him he was too much interested in what he was watching peter stared down into the water to see what was interesting old mr toad so much but he saw nothing but a lot of wriggling tadpoles  what are you staring at so mr sobersides asked peter speaking a little louder than before  old mr toad turned and looked at peter and there was a look of great pride in his face im just watching my babies arent they lovely said he  peter stared harder than ever but he couldnt see anything that looked like a baby toad  where are they asked he i dont see any babies but those of grandfather frog and if you ask me i always did think tadpoles about the homeliest things in th world  old mr toad grew indignant those are not grandfather frogs children theyre mine he sputtered and ill have you know that they are the most beautiful babies in th world  peter drew a hand across his mouth to hide a smile i beg your pardon mr toad said he ii thought all tadpoles were frog babies they all look alike to me  well theyre not declared old mr toad how any one can mistake my babies for their cousins i cannot understand now mine are beautiful while  chugarum interrupted the great deep voice of grandfather frog what are you talking about why your babies are no more to be compared with my babies for real beauty than nothing at all ill leave it to peter if they are  but peter wisely held his tongue to tell the truth he couldnt see beauty in any of them to him they were all just wriggling pollywogs they were more interesting now because he had found out that some of them were toads and some were frogs and he hadnt known before that baby toads begin life as tadpoles but he had no intention of being drawn into the dispute now waxing furious between grandfather frog and old mr toad     ix   the smiling pool kindergarten    play a little learn a little grow a little too   thats what every pollywoggy tries his best to do  of course thats what a kindergarten is for and you may be sure that the babies of grandfather frog and old mr toad and stickytoes the tree toad did all of these things in the kindergarten of the smiling pool they looked considerably alike did these little cousins for they were all pollywogs to begin with peter rabbit came over every day to watch them always he had thought pollywogs just homely wriggling things not the least bit interesting but since he had discovered how proud of them were grandfather frog and old mr toad he had begun to wonder about them and then to watch them  theres one thing about them and that is they are not in danger the way any babies are said peter talking to himself as is his way when there is no one else to talk to just then a funny little black pollywog wriggled into sight and while peter was watching him a stoutjawed waterbeetle suddenly rushed from among the water grass seized the pollywog by his tail and dragged him down peter stared could it be that that uglylooking bug was as dangerous an enemy to the baby toad as reddy fox is to a baby rabbit he began to suspect so and a little later he knew so for there was that same little pollywog trying hard to swim and making bad work of it because he had lost half of his long tail  that set peter to watching sharper than ever and presently he discovered that pollywogs have to keep their eyes open quite as much as do baby rabbits if they would live to grow up there were several kinds of queer uglylooking bugs forever darting out at the wriggling pollywogs hungrylooking fish lay in wait for them and longlegs the blue heron seemed to have a special liking for them but the pollywogs were spry and seemed to have learned to watch out they seemed to peter to spend all their time swimming and eating and growing they grew so fast that it seemed to him that he could almost see them grow and just imagine how surprised peter was to discover one day that that very pollywog which he had seen lose his tail had grown a new one that puzzled peter more than anything he had seen in a long time  why i couldnt do that he exclaimed right out loud  do what demanded jerry muskrat who happened along just then  why grow a new tail like that pollywog replied peter and told jerry all that he had seen jerry laughed  youll see queerer things than that if you watch those pollywogs long enough said he they are a queer lot of babies and very interesting to watch if youve got the time for it i havent this smiling pool is a great kindergarten and theres something happening here every minute theres no place like it  are those great big fat pollywogs grandfather frogs children or old mr toads asked peter  grandfather frogs last years children replied jerry theyll grow into real frogs this summer if nothing happens to them  where are old mr toads last years children asked peter  dont ask me replied jerry they hopped away last summer never saw anything like the way those toad youngsters grow those toad pollywogs you see now will turn into real toads and be leaving the smiling pool in a few weeks people think old mr toad is slow but there is nothing slow about his children look at that little fellow over there hes begun to grow legs already  peter looked and sure enough there was a pollywog with a pair of legs sprouting out they were his fore legs and they certainly did make him look funny and only a few days before there hadnt been a sign of legs  my gracious exclaimed peter what a funny sight i thought my babies grew fast but these beat them     x   the little toads start out to see the world    the world is a wonderful great big place     and in it the young must roam   to learn what their elders have long since learned     theres never a place like home  it had been some time since peter rabbit had visited the smiling pool to watch the pollywogs but one cloudy morning he happened to think of them and decided that he would run over there and see how they were getting along so off he started lippertylippertylip he wondered if those pollywog children of old mr toad would be much changed the last time he saw them some of them had just begun to grow legs although they still had long tails  he had almost reached the smiling pool when great big drops of rain began to splash down and with those first raindrops something funny happened anyway it seemed funny to peter right away he was surrounded by tiny little toads everywhere he looked he saw toads tiny little toads just like old mr toad only so tiny that one could have sat comfortably on a tencent piece and still had plenty of room  peters big eyes grew round with surprise as he stared where had they all come from so suddenly a minute before he hadnt seen a single one and now he could hardly move without stepping on one it seemed it really seemed as if each raindrop turned into a tiny toad the instant it struck the ground of course peter knew that that couldnt be but it was very puzzling and all those little toads were bravely hopping along as if they were bound for some particular place  peter watched them for a few minutes then he once more started for the smiling pool on the very bank whom should he meet but old mr toad he looked rather thin and his back was to the smiling pool yes sir he was hopping away from the smiling pool where he had been all the spring singing in the great chorus peter was almost as surprised to see him as he had been to see the little toads but just then he was most interested in those little toads  good morning old mr toad said peter in his most polite manner can you tell me where all these little toads came from  illustration can you tell me where all these little toads came from  certainly replied old mr toad they came from the smiling pool of course where did you suppose they came from  ii didnt know there wasnt one to be seen and then it began to rain and right away they were everywhere itit almost seemed as if they had rained down out of the sky  old mr toad chuckled theyve got good sense if i must say it about my own children said he they know that wet weather is the only weather for toads to travel in they left the smiling pool in the night while it was damp and comfortable and then when the sun came up they hid like sensible children under anything they could find sticks stones pieces of bark grass the minute this shower came up they knew it was good traveling weather and out they popped  but what did they leave the smiling pool for peter asked  to see the great world replied old mr toad foolish very foolish of them but they would do it i did the same thing myself when i was their age couldnt stop me any more than i could stop them they dont know when theyre well off but young folks never do fine weather isnt it     xi   old mr toads queer tongue    old mother nature doth provide     for all her children large or small   her wisdom foresees all their needs     and makes provision for them all  if you dont believe it just you go ask old mr toad as peter rabbit did how such a slowmoving fellow as he is can catch enough bugs and insects to keep him alive perhaps youll learn something just as peter did peter and old mr toad sat in the rain watching the tiny toads who you know were mr toads children leaving their kindergarten in the smiling pool and starting out to see the great world when the last little toad had passed them old mr toad suddenly remembered that he was hungry very hungry indeed  didnt have time to eat much while i was in the smiling pool he explained couldnt eat and sing too and while i was down there i was supposed to sing now that it is time to quit singing i begin to realize that ive got a stomach to look out for as well as a voice see that bug over there on that leaf watch him  peter looked and sure enough there was a fat bug crawling along on an old leaf he was about two inches from old mr toad and he was crawling very fast and right while peter was looking at him he disappeared peter turned to look at old mr toad he hadnt budged he was sitting exactly where he had been sitting all the time but he was smacking his lips and there was a twinkle of satisfaction in his eyes peter opened his eyes very wide  whawhat he began  nice bug interrupted old mr toad nicest bug ive eaten for a longtime  but i didnt see you catch him protested peter looking at old mr toad as if he suspected him of joking  anything wrong with your eyes inquired old mr toad  no replied peter just a wee bit crossly my eyes are just as good as ever  then watch me catch that fly over yonder said old mr toad he hopped towards a fly which had lighted on a blade of grass just ahead about two inches from it he stopped and so far as peter could see he sat perfectly still but the fly disappeared and it wasnt because it flew away either peter was sure of that as he told mrs peter about it afterwards it was there and then it wasnt and that was all there was to it  old mr toad chuckled didnt you see that one go peter he asked  peter shook his head i wish you would stop fooling me said peter the joke is on me but now youve had your laugh at my expense i wish you would tell me how you do it please mr toad  now when peter said please that way of course old mr toad couldnt resist him nobody could  here comes an ant this way now you watch my mouth instead of the ant and see what happens said old mr toad  peter looked and saw a big black ant coming then he kept his eyes on old mr toads mouth suddenly there was a little flash of red from it so tiny and so quick that peter couldnt be absolutely sure that he saw it but when he looked for the ant it was nowhere to be seen peter looked at old mr toad very hard  do you mean to tell me mr toad that youve got a tongue long enough to reach way over to where that ant was he asked  old mr toad chuckled again with every insect swallowed he felt better natured youve guessed it peter said he handy tongue isnt it  i think its a very queer tongue retorted peter and i dont understand it at all if its so long as all that where do you keep it when it isnt in use i should think youd have to swallow it to get it out of the way or else leave it hanging out of your mouth  ha ha ha ha ha laughed old mr toad my tongue never is in the way and its the handiest tongue in the world ill show it to you     xii   old mr toad shows his tongue    to show ones tongue as you well know     is not considered nice to do   but if it were like mr toads     id want to show itwouldnt you  im quite sure you would you see if it were like old mr toads it would be such a wonderful tongue that i suspect you would want everybody to see it old mr toad thinks his tongue the most satisfactory tongue in the world in fact he is quite sure that without it he couldnt get along at all and i dont know as he could and yet very few of his neighbors know anything about that tongue and how different it is from most other tongues peter rabbit didnt until old mr toad showed him after peter had puzzled and puzzled over the mysterious way in which bugs and flies disappeared whenever they happened to come within two inches or less of old mr toad  what peter couldnt understand was what old mr toad did with a tongue that would reach two inches beyond his mouth he said as much  ill show you my tongue and then youll wish you had one just like it said old mr toad with a twinkle in his eyes  he opened his big mouth and slowly ran his tongue out its full length why whyee exclaimed peter its fastened at the wrong end  no such thing replied old mr toad indignantly if it was fastened at the other end how could i run it out so far  but mine and all other tongues that i ever have seen are fastened way down in the throat protested peter yours is fastened at the other end way in the very front of your mouth i never heard of such a thing  there are a great many things you have never heard of peter rabbit replied old mr toad drily mine is the right way to have a tongue because it is fastened way up in the front of my mouth that way i can use the whole of it you see it goes out its full length then when i draw it in with a bug on the end of it i just turn it over so that the end that was out goes way back in my throat and takes the bug with it to just the right place to swallow  peter thought this over for a few minutes before he ventured another question i begin to understand said he but how do you hold on to the bug with your tongue  my tongue is sticky of course mr stupid replied old mr toad looking very much disgusted just let me touch a bug with it and hes mine every time  peter thought this over then he felt of his own tongue mine isnt sticky said he very innocently  old mr toad laughed right out perhaps if it was you couldnt ask so many questions said he now watch me catch that fly his funny little tongue darted out and the fly was gone  illustration his funny little tongue darted out and the fly was gone  it certainly is very handy said peter politely i think we are going to have more rain and id better be getting back to the dear old briarpatch very much obliged to you mr toad i think you are very wonderful  not at all replied old mr toad ive simply got the things i need in order to live just as you have the things you need i couldnt get along with your kind of a tongue but no more could you get along with mine if you live long enough you will learn that old mother nature makes no mistakes she gives each of us what we need and each one has different needs     xiii   peter rabbit is impolite  peter rabbit couldnt get old mr toad off his mind he had discovered so many interesting things about old mr toad that he was almost on the point of believing him to be the most interesting of all his neighbors and his respect for old mr toad had become very great indeed of course who wouldnt respect any one with such beautiful eyes and such a sweet voice and such a wonderful tongue yet at the same time peter felt very foolish whenever he remembered that all his life he had been acquainted with old mr toad without really knowing him at all there was one comforting thought and that was that most of his neighbors were just as ignorant regarding old mr toad as peter had been  funny mused peter how we can live right beside people all our lives and not really know them at all i suppose that is why we should never judge people hastily i believe i will go hunt up old mr toad and see if i can find out anything more  off started peter lippertylippertylip he didnt know just where to go now that old mr toad had left the smiling pool but he had an idea that he would not be far from their meeting place of the day before when old mr toad had explained about his wonderful tongue but when he got there peter found no trace of old mr toad you see it had rained the day before and that is just the kind of weather that a toad likes best for traveling peter ought to have thought of that but he didnt he hunted for awhile and finally gave it up and started up the crooked little path with the idea of running over for a call on johnny chuck in the old orchard  jolly round bright mr sun was shining his brightest and peter soon forgot all about old mr toad he scampered along up the crooked little path thinking of nothing in particular but how good it was to be alive and occasionally kicking up his heels for pure joy he had just done this when his ears caught the sound of a queer noise a little to one side of the crooked little path instantly peter stopped and sat up to listen there it was again and it seemed to come from under an old piece of board it was just a little rustling sound hardly to be heard  theres some one under that old board thought peter and peeped under all he could see was that there was something moving instantly peter was all curiosity whoever was there was not very big he was sure of that of course that meant that he had nothing to fear so what do you think peter did why he just pulled that old board over and when he did that he saw whom do you think why old mr toad to be sure  but such a sight as old mr toad was peter just stared for a full minute he couldnt find his voice old mr toad was changing his clothes yes sir that is just what old mr toad was doing he was taking off his old suit and under it was a brand new one but such a time as he was having he was opening and shutting his big mouth and drawing his hind legs under him and rubbing them against his body then peter saw a strange thing he saw that old mr toads old suit had split in several places and he was getting it off by sucking it into his mouth  in a few minutes his hind legs were free of the old suit and little by little it began to be pulled free from his body all the time old mr toad was working very hard to suck it at the corners of his big mouth he glared angrily at peter but he couldnt say anything because his mouth was too full he looked so funny that peter just threw himself on the ground and rolled over and over with laughter this made old mr toad glare more angrily than ever but he couldnt say anything not a word  when he had got his hands free by pulling the sleeves of his old coat off inside out he used his hands to pull the last of it over his head then he gulped very hard two or three times to swallow his old suit and when the last of it had disappeared he found his voice  dont you know that it is the most impolite thing in the world to look at people when they are changing their clothes he sputtered     xiv   old mr toad disappears    admit your fault when youve done wrong   and dont postpone it over long  peter rabbit didnt blame old mr toad a bit for being indignant because peter had watched him change his suit it wasnt a nice thing to do old mr toad had looked very funny while he was struggling out of his old suit and peter just couldnt help laughing at him but he realized that he had been very impolite and he very meekly told old mr toad so  you see it was this way explained peter i heard something under that old board and i just naturally turned it over to find out what was there  hump grunted old mr toad  i didnt have the least idea that you were there continued peter when i found who it was and what you were doing i couldnt help watching because it was so interesting and i couldnt help laughing because you really did look so funny but im sorry mr toad truly i am i didnt mean to be so impolite i promise never to do it again i dont suppose mr toad that it seems at all wonderful to you that you can change your suit that way but it does to me i had heard that you swallowed your old suits but i never half believed it now i know it is so and just how you do it and i feel as if i had learned something worth knowing do you know i think you are one of the most interesting and wonderful of all my neighbors and ill never laugh at or tease you again mr toad  hump grunted old mr toad again but it was very clear that he was a little flattered by peters interest in him and was rapidly recovering his good nature  there is one thing i dont understand yet said peter and that is where you go to to sleep all winter do you go down into the mud at the bottom of the smiling pool the way grandfather frog does  certainly not retorted old mr toad use your common sense peter rabbit if i had spent the winter in the smiling pool do you suppose i would have left it to come way up here and then have turned right around and gone back there to sing im not so fond of long journeys as all that  thats so peter looked foolish i didnt think of that when i spoke  the trouble with you and with a lot of other people is that you speak first and do your thinking afterward when you do any thinking at all grunted old mr toad now if i wanted to i could disappear right here  you mean that you would hide under that old board just as you did before said peter with a very wise look  nothing of the sort snapped old mr toad i could disappear and not go near that old board not a step nearer than i am now  peter looked in all directions carefully but not a thing could he see under which old mr toad could possibly hide except the old board and he had said he wouldnt hide under that i dont like to doubt your word mr toad said he but youll have to show me before i can believe that  old mr toads eyes twinkled here was a chance to get even with peter for watching him change his suit if youll turn your back to me and look straight down the crooked little path for five minutes ill disappear said he more than that i give you my word of honor that i will not hop three feet from where i am sitting  all right replied peter promptly turning his back to old mr toad ill look down the crooked little path for five minutes and promise not to peek  so peter sat and gazed straight down the crooked little path it was a great temptation to roll his eyes back and peep behind him but he had given his word that he wouldnt and he didnt when he thought the five minutes were up he turned around old mr toad was nowhere to be seen peter looked hastily this way and that way but there was not a sign of old mr toad he had disappeared as completely as if he never had been there     xv   old mr toad gives peter a scare    if you play pranks on other folks     you may be sure that they   will take the first chance that they get     a joke on you to play  old mr toad was getting even with peter for laughing at him while peters back had been turned old mr toad had disappeared  it was too much for peter look as he would he couldnt see so much as a chip under which old mr toad might have hidden excepting the old board and old mr toad had given his word of honor that he wouldnt hide under that nevertheless peter hopped over to it and turned it over again because he couldnt think of any other place to look of course old mr toad wasnt there of course not he had given his word that he wouldnt hide there and he always lives up to his word peter should have known better than to have looked there  old mr toad had also said that he would not go three feet from the spot where he was sitting at the time so peter should have known better than to have raced up the crooked little path as he did but if old mr toad had nothing to hide under of course he must have hopped away reasoned peter he couldnt hop far in five minutes that was sure and so peter ran this way and that way a great deal farther than it would have been possible for old mr toad to have gone but it was a wholly useless search and presently peter returned and sat down on the very spot where he had last seen old mr toad peter never had felt more foolish in all his life he began to think that old mr toad must be bewitched and had some strange power of making himself invisible  for a long time peter sat perfectly still trying to puzzle out how old mr toad had disappeared but the more he puzzled over it the more impossible it seemed and yet old mr toad had disappeared suddenly peter gave a frightened scream and jumped higher than he ever had jumped before in all his life a voice the voice of old mr toad himself had said well now are you satisfied and that voice had come from right under peter do you wonder that he was frightened when he turned to look there sat old mr toad right where he himself had been sitting a moment before peter rubbed his eyes and stared very foolishly  whwhwhere did you come from he stammered at last  old mr toad grinned ill show you said he and right while peter was looking at him he began to sink down into the ground until only the top of his head could be seen then that disappeared old mr toad had gone down and the sand had fallen right back over him peter just had to rub his eyes again he had to then to make sure he began to dig away the sand where old mr toad had been sitting in a minute he felt old mr toad who at once came out again  old mr toads beautiful eyes twinkled more than ever i guess we are even now peter said he  peter nodded more than that mr toad i think you have a little the best of it he replied now wont you tell me how you did it  old mr toad held up one of his stout hind feet and on it was a kind of spur theres another just like that on the other foot said he and i use them to dig with you go into a hole headfirst but i go in the other way i make my hole in soft earth and back into it at the same time this way he began to work his stout hind feet and as he kicked the earth out he backed in at the same time when he was deep enough the earth just fell back over him for you see it was very loose and not packed down at all when he once more reappeared peter thanked him then he asked one more question  is that the way you go into winter quarters  old mr toad nodded and its the way i escape from my enemies     xvi   jimmy skunk is surprised  jimmy skunk ambled along the crooked little path down the hill he didnt hurry because jimmy doesnt believe in hurrying the only time he ever hurries is when he sees a fat beetle trying to get out of sight then jimmy does hurry but just now he didnt see any fat beetles although he was looking for them so he just ambled along as if he had all the time in the world as indeed he had he was feeling very goodnatured was jimmy skunk and why shouldnt he there was everything to make him feel goodnatured summer had arrived to stay on every side he heard glad voices bumble the bee was humming a song best of all jimmy had found three beetles that very morning and he knew that there were more if he could find them so why shouldnt he feel good  jimmy had laughed at peter rabbit for being so anxious for summer to arrive but he was just as glad as peter that she had come although he wouldnt have said so for the world his sharp little eyes twinkled as he ambled along and there wasnt much that they missed as he walked he talked quite to himself of course because there was nobody near to hear and this is what he was saying    beetle beetle smooth and smug   you are nothing but a bug   bugs were made for skunks to eat   so come out from your retreat  hello theres a nice big piece of bark over there that looks as if it ought to have a dozen fat beetles under it its great fun to pull over pieces of bark and see fat beetles run all ways at once ill just have to see what is under that piece  jimmy tiptoed softly over to the big piece of bark and then as he made ready to turn it over he began again that foolish little verse    beetle beetle smooth and smug   you are nothing but a bug  as he said the last word he suddenly pulled the piece of bark over  whos a bug asked a funny voice and it sounded rather cross jimmy skunk nearly tumbled over backward in surprise and for a minute he couldnt find his tongue there instead of the fat beetles he had been so sure of sat old mr toad and he didnt look at all pleased  whos a bug he repeated  instead of answering jimmy skunk began to laugh whos a bug demanded old mr toad more crossly than before  there isnt any bug mr toad and i beg your pardon replied jimmy remembering his politeness i just thought there was you see i didnt know you were under that piece of bark i hope you will excuse me mr toad have you seen any fat beetles this morning  no said old mr toad grumpily and yawned and rubbed his eyes  why exclaimed jimmy skunk i believe you have just waked up  what if i have demanded old mr toad  oh nothing nothing at all mr toad replied jimmy skunk only you are the second one ive met this morning who had just waked up  who was the other asked old mr toad  mr blacksnake replied jimmy he inquired for you  old mr toad turned quite pale ii think ill be moving along said he     xvii   old mr toads mistake  if is a very little word to look at but the biggest word you have ever seen doesnt begin to have so much meaning as little if if jimmy skunk hadnt ambled down the crooked little path just when he did if he hadnt been looking for fat beetles if he hadnt seen that big piece of bark at one side and decided to pull it over if it hadnt been for all these ifs why old mr toad wouldnt have made the mistake he did and you wouldnt have had this story but jimmy skunk did amble down the crooked little path he did look for beetles and he did pull over that big piece of bark and when he had pulled it over he found old mr toad there  old mr toad had crept under that piece of bark because he wanted to take a nap but when jimmy skunk told him that he had seen mr blacksnake that very morning and that mr blacksnake had asked after old mr toad the very last bit of sleepiness left old mr toad yes sir he was wide awake right away you see he knew right away why mr blacksnake had asked after him he knew that mr blacksnake has a fondness for toads he turned quite pale when he heard that mr blacksnake had asked after him and right then he made his mistake he was in such a hurry to get away from that neighborhood that he forgot to ask jimmy skunk just where he had seen mr blacksnake he hardly waited long enough to say goodby to jimmy skunk but started off as fast as he could go  now it just happened that old mr toad started up the crooked little path and it just happened that mr blacksnake was coming down the crooked little path now when people are very much afraid they almost always seem to think that danger is behind instead of in front of them it was so with old mr toad instead of watching out in front as he hopped along he kept watching over his shoulder and that was his second mistake he was so sure that mr blacksnake was somewhere behind him that he didnt look to see where he was going and you know that people who dont look to see where they are going are almost sure to go headfirst right into trouble  old mr toad went hopping up the crooked little path as fast as he could which wasnt very fast because he never can hop very fast and all the time he kept looking behind for mr blacksnake presently he came to a turn in the crooked little path and as he hurried around it he almost ran into mr blacksnake himself it was a question which was more surprised for just a wee second they stared at each other then mr blacksnakes eyes began to sparkle  good morning mr toad isnt this a beautiful morning i was just thinking about you said he  but poor old mr toad didnt say good morning he didnt say anything he couldnt because he was too scared he just gave a frightened little squeal turned around and started down the crooked little path twice as fast as he had come up mr blacksnake grinned and started after him not very fast because he knew that he wouldnt have to run very fast to catch old mr toad and he thought the exercise would do him good  and this is how it happened that summer morning that jolly bright mr sun looking down from the blue blue sky and smiling to see how happy everybody seemed suddenly discovered that there was one of the little meadow people who wasnt happy but instead was terribly terribly unhappy it was old mr toad hopping down the crooked little path for his life while after him and getting nearer and nearer glided mr blacksnake     xviii   jimmy skunk is just in time  jimmy skunk ambled slowly along chuckling as he thought of what a hurry mr toad had been in when he had heard that mr blacksnake had asked after him it had been funny very funny indeed to see mr toad try to hurry  suddenly jimmy stopped chuckling then he stopped ambling along the crooked little path he turned around and looked back and as he did so he scratched his head thoughtfully he had just happened to think that old mr toad had gone up the crooked little path and it was up the crooked little path that mr blacksnake had shown himself that morning  if hes still up there thought jimmy old mr toad is hopping right straight into the very worst kind of trouble how stupid of him not to have asked me where mr blacksnake was well its none of my business i guess ill go on  but he had gone on down the crooked little path only a few steps when he stopped again you see jimmy is really a very kindhearted little fellow and somehow he didnt like to think of what might happen to old mr toad  i hate to go way back there he grumbled for you know he is naturally rather lazy still the green meadows wouldnt be quite the same without old mr toad i should miss him if anything happened to him i suppose it would be partly my fault too for if i hadnt pulled over that piece of bark he probably would have stayed there the rest of the day and been safe  maybe he wont meet mr blacksnake said a little voice inside of jimmy  and maybe he will said jimmy right out loud and with that he started back up the crooked little path and strange to say jimmy hurried  he had just reached a turn in the crooked little path when who should run right plump into him but poor old mr toad he gave a frightened squeal and fell right over on his back and kicked foolishly as he tried to get on his feet again but he was all out of breath and so frightened and tired that all he could do was to kick and kick he hadnt seen jimmy at all for he had been looking behind him and he didnt even know who it was he had run into  right behind him came mr blacksnake of course he saw jimmy and he stopped short and hissed angrily  what were you going to do to mr toad demanded jimmy  none of your business hissed mr blacksnake get out of my way or youll be sorry  jimmy skunk just laughed and stepped in front of poor old mr toad mr blacksnake coiled himself up in the path and darted his tongue out at jimmy in the most impudent way then he tried to make himself look very fierce then he jumped straight at jimmy skunk with his mouth wide open but he took great care not to jump quite far enough to reach jimmy you see he was just trying to scare jimmy but jimmy didnt scare he knows all about mr blacksnake and that really he is a coward so he suddenly gritted his teeth in a way not at all pleasant to hear and started for mr blacksnake mr blacksnake didnt wait no sir he didnt wait he suddenly turned and glided back up the crooked little path hissing angrily jimmy followed him a little way and then he went back to old mr toad  oh panted mr toad you came just in time i couldnt have hopped another hop  i guess i did replied jimmy now you get your breath and come along with me and old mr toad did     xix   old mr toad gets his stomach full    pray do not tip your nose in scorn     at things which others eat   for things to you not good at all     to others are most sweet  there are ants for instance you wouldnt want to eat them even if you were dreadfully hungry but old mr toad and buster bear think there is nothing much nicer now buster bear had found old mr toad catching ants one at a time as he kept watch beside their home and it had pleased buster to find some one else who liked ants right away he invited old mr toad to dine with him but poor old mr toad was frightened almost to death when he heard the deep grumblyrumbly voice of buster bear for he had been so busy watching the ants that he hadnt seen buster coming  he fell right over on his back which wasnt at all dignified and made buster bear laugh that frightened mr toad more than ever you see he didnt have the least doubt in the world that buster bear meant to eat him and when buster invited him to dinner he was sure that that was just a joke on busters part  but there was no way to escape and after a little old mr toad thought it best to be polite because you know it always pays to be polite so he said in a very faint voice that he would be pleased to dine with buster then he waved his feet feebly trying to get on his feet again buster bear laughed harder than ever it was a low deep grumblyrumbly laugh and sent cold shivers all over poor old mr toad but when buster reached out a great paw with great cruellooking claws mr toad quite gave up he didnt have strength enough left to even kick he just closed his eyes and waited for the end  what do you think happened why he was rolled over on to his feet so gently that he just gasped with surprise it didnt seem possible that such a great paw could be so gentle  now said buster bear in a voice which he tried to make sound pleasant but which was grumblyrumbly just the same i know where there is a fine dinner waiting for us just a little way from here you follow me and well have it in no time  so buster bear led the way and old mr toad followed as fast as he could because he didnt dare not to presently buster stopped beside a big decayed old log if you are ready mr toad we will dine now said he  old mr toad didnt see anything to eat his heart sank again and he shook all over iim not hungry said he in a very faint voice  buster bear didnt seem to hear he hooked his great claws into the old log and gave a mighty pull over rolled the log and there were ants and ants and ants hurrying this way and scurrying that way more ants than mr toad had seen in all his life before  help yourself said buster bear politely  old mr toad didnt wait to be told twice he forgot all about his fright he forgot all about buster bear he forgot that he wasnt hungry he forgot his manners he jumped right in among those ants and for a little while he was the busiest toad ever seen buster bear was busy too he swept his long tongue this way and he swept it that way and each time he drew it back into his mouth it was covered with ants at last old mr toad couldnt hold another ant then he remembered buster bear and looked up a little fearfully buster was smacking his lips and there was a twinkle in each eye  good arent they said he  the best i ever ate declared old mr toad with a sigh of satisfaction  come dine with me again said buster bear and somehow this time old mr toad didnt mind because his voice sounded grumblyrumbly  thank you i will replied old mr toad     xx   old mr toad is puffed up  old mr toad hopped slowly down the lone little path he usually does hop slowly but this time he hopped slower than ever you see he was so puffed up that he couldnt have hopped fast if he had wanted to and he didnt want to in the first place his stomach was so full of ants that there wasnt room for another one no sir old mr toad couldnt have swallowed another ant if he had tried of course they made his stomach stick out but it wasnt the ants that puffed him out all over oh my no it was pride thats what it waspride you know nothing can puff any one up quite like foolish pride  old mr toad was old enough to have known better it is bad enough to see young and foolish creatures puffed up with pride but it is worse to see any one as old as old mr toad that way he held his head so high that he couldnt see his own feet and more than once he stubbed his toes presently he met his old friend danny meadow mouse he tipped his head a little higher puffed himself out a little more and pretended not to see danny  hello mr toad said danny  mr toad pretended not to hear danny looked puzzled then he spoke again and this time he shouted hello mr toad i havent seen you for some time  it wouldnt do to pretend not to hear this time oh how do you do danny said old mr toad with a very grand air and pretending to be much surprised sorry i cant stop but ive been dining with my friend buster bear and now i must get home when he mentioned the name of buster bear he puffed himself out a little more  danny grinned as he watched him hop on down the lone little path cant talk with common folks any more he muttered ive heard that pride is very apt to turn peoples heads but i never expected to see old mr toad proud  illustration cant talk with common folks any more he muttered  mr toad kept on his way and presently he met peter rabbit peter stopped to gossip as is his way but old mr toad took no notice of him at all he kept right on with his head high and all puffed out peter might have been a stick or a stone for all the notice old mr toad took of him peter looked puzzled then he hurried down to tell danny meadow mouse about it  oh said danny hes been to dine with buster bear and now he has no use for his old friends  pretty soon along came johnny chuck and he was very much put out because he had been treated by old mr toad just as peter rabbit had striped chipmunk told the same story so did unc billy possum it was the same with all of old mr toads old friends and neighbors excepting bobby coon who you know is buster bears little cousin to him old mr toad was very polite and talked a great deal about buster bear and thought that bobby must be very proud to be related to buster  at first everybody thought it a great joke to see old mr toad so puffed up with pride but after a little they grew tired of being snubbed by their old friend and neighbor and began to say unpleasant things about him then they decided that what old mr toad needed was a lesson so they put their heads together and planned how they would teach old mr toad how foolish it is for any one to be puffed up with pride     xxi   old mr toad receives another invitation  the friends and neighbors of old mr toad decided that he needed to be taught a lesson at first you know every one had laughed at him because he had grown too proud to speak to them but after a little they grew tired of being treated so and some of them put their heads together to think of some plan to teach old mr toad a lesson and what a very very foolish thing false pride is the very next day jimmy skunk went into the green forest to look for buster bear you know jimmy isnt afraid of buster he didnt have to look long and when he had found him the very first thing he did was to ask buster if he had seen any fat beetles that morning you know jimmy is very fond of fat beetles and the first thing he asks any one he may happen to meet is if they have seen any  buster bear grinned and said he thought he knew where there might be a few and he would be pleased to have jimmy go with him to see sure enough under an old log he found five fat beetles and these jimmy gobbled up without even asking buster if he would have one jimmy is usually very polite but this time he quite forgot politeness i am afraid he is rather apt to when fat beetles are concerned but buster didnt seem to mind when the last beetle had disappeared jimmy smacked his lips and then he told buster bear what he had come for of course at first buster had thought it was for the fat beetles but it wasnt no sir it wasnt for the fat beetles at all it was to get buster bears help in a plan to teach old mr toad a lesson  first jimmy told buster all about how puffed up old mr toad was because he had dined with buster and how ever since then he had refused even to speak to his old friends and neighbors it tickled buster bear so to think that little homely old mr toad could be proud of anything that he laughed and laughed and his laugh was deep and grumblyrumbly then jimmy told him the plan to teach old mr toad a lesson and asked buster if he would help busters eyes twinkled as he promised to do what jimmy asked  then jimmy went straight to where old mr toad was sitting all puffed up taking a sunbath  buster bear has just sent word by me to ask if you will honor him by dining with him tomorrow at the rotted chestnut stump near the edge of the green forest said jimmy in his politest manner  now if old mr toad was puffed up before just think how he swelled out when he heard that jimmy skunk was actually afraid that he would burst  you may tell my friend buster bear that i shall be very happy to honor him by dining with him replied old mr toad with a very grand air  jimmy went off to deliver his reply and old mr toad sat and puffed himself out until he could hardly breathe honor him by dining with him said he over and over to himself i never was so flattered in my life     xxii   old mr toad learns a lesson    pride is like a great big bubble     youll find theres nothing in it   prick it and for all your trouble     it has vanished in a minute  old mr toad was so puffed out with pride as he started for the green forest to dine with buster bear that those who saw him wondered if he wouldnt burst before he got there everybody knew where he was going and this made old mr toad feel more important and proud than ever he might not have felt quite so puffed up if he had known just how it had come about that he received this second invitation to dine with buster bear when jimmy skunk brought it to him jimmy didnt tell him that buster had been asked to send the invitation and that it was all part of a plan on the part of some of old mr toads old friends and neighbors to teach him a lesson no indeed jimmy didnt say anything at all about that  so old mr toad went hopping along and stumbling over his own feet because his head was held so high and he was so puffed out that he couldnt see where he was going he could think of nothing but how important buster bear must consider him to invite him to dinner a second time and of the delicious ants he was sure he would have to eat  what very good taste buster bear has thought he and how very fortunate it is that he found out that i also am fond of ants  he was so busy with these pleasant thoughts and of the good dinner that he expected to have that he took no notice of what was going on about him he didnt see his old friends and neighbors peeping out at him and laughing because he looked so foolish and silly he was dressed in his very best which was nothing at all to be proud of for you know old mr toad has no fine clothes and being puffed up so he was homelier than ever which is saying a great deal for at best mr toad is anything but handsome  he was beginning to get pretty tired by the time he reached the green forest and came in sight of the rotted old chestnut stump where he was to meet buster bear  buster was waiting for him how do you do this fine day you look a little tired and rather warm mr toad said he  i am a little warm replied mr toad in his most polite manner although he couldnt help panting for breath as he said it i hope you are feeling as well as you are looking mr bear  illustration i am a little warm replied mr toad in his most polite manner  buster bear laughed a great grumblyrumbly laugh i always feel fine when there is a dinner of fat ants ready for me said he it is fine of you to honor me by coming to dine  here mr toad put one hand on his stomach and tried to make a very grand bow peter rabbit hiding behind a nearby tree almost giggled aloud he looked so funny  i have ventured to invite another to enjoy the dinner with us continued buster bear mr toads face fell you see he was selfish he wanted to be the only one to have the honor of dining with buster bear hes a little late went on buster but i think he will be here soon and i hope you will be glad to meet him ah there he comes now  old mr toad looked in the direction in which buster bear was looking he gave a little gasp and turned quite pale all his puffiness disappeared he didnt look like the same toad at all the newcomer was mr blacksnake oh cried old mr toad and then without even asking to be excused he turned his back on buster bear and started back the way he had come with long frightened hops  ha ha ha shouted peter rabbit jumping out from behind a tree  ho ho ho shouted jimmy skunk from behind another  hee hee hee shouted johnny chuck from behind a third  then old mr toad knew that his old friends and neighbors had planned this to teach him a lesson     xxiii   old mr toad is very humble  when old mr toad saw mr blacksnake and turned his back on buster bear and the fine dinner to which buster had invited him he had but just one idea in his head and that was to get out of sight of mr blacksnake as soon as possible he forgot to ask buster bear to excuse him he forgot that he was tired and hot he forgot all the pride with which he had been so puffed up he forgot everything but the need of getting out of sight of mr blacksnake as soon as ever he could so away went old mr toad hop hop hippertyhop hop hop hippertyhop he heard peter rabbit and jimmy skunk and johnny chuck and others of his old friends and neighbors shouting with laughter yes and he heard the deep grumblyrumbly laugh of buster bear but he didnt mind it not then anyway he hadnt room for any feeling except fear of mr blacksnake  but old mr toad had to stop after a while you see his legs were so tired they just wouldnt go any longer and he was so out of breath that he wheezed he crawled under a big piece of bark and there he lay flat on the ground and panted and panted for breath he would stay there until jolly round bright mr sun went to bed behind the purple hills then mr blacksnake would go to bed too and it would be safe for him to go home now lying there in the dark for it was dark under that big piece of bark old mr toad had time to think little by little he began to understand that his invitation to dine with buster bear had been part of a plan by his old friends and neighbors whom he had so snubbed and looked down on when he had been puffed up with pride to teach him a lesson at first he was angry very angry indeed then he began to see how foolish and silly he had been and shame took the place of anger as he remembered the deep grumblyrumbly laughter of buster bear the feeling of shame grew  i deserve it thought old mr toad yes sir i deserve every bit of it the only thing that i have to be proud of is that im honest and work for my living yes sir thats all  when darkness came at last and he crawled out to go home he was feeling very humble peter rabbit happened along just then old mr toad opened his mouth to speak but peter suddenly threw his head up very high and strutted past as if he didnt see old mr toad at all mr toad gulped and went on pretty soon he met jimmy skunk jimmy went right on about his business and actually stepped right over old mr toad as if he had been a stick or a stone old mr toad gulped again and went on the next day he went down to see danny meadow mouse he meant to tell danny how ashamed he was for the way he had treated danny and his other friends but danny brushed right past without even a glance at him old mr toad gulped and started up to see johnny chuck the same thing happened again so it did when he met striped chipmunk  at last old mr toad gave up and went home where he sat under a big mullein leaf the rest of the day feeling very miserable and lonely he didnt have appetite enough to snap at a single fly late that afternoon he heard a little noise and looked up to find all his old friends and neighbors forming a circle around him suddenly they began to dance and shout    old mr toad is a jolly good fellow   his temper is sweet disposition is mellow   and now that his bubble of pride is quite busted   we know that he knows that his friends can be trusted  then old mr toad knew that all was well once more and presently he began to dance too the funniest dance that ever was seen  this is all for now about homely old mr toad because i have just got to tell you about another homely fellowprickly porky the porcupinewho carries a thousand little spears the next book will tell you all about his adventures   the end
