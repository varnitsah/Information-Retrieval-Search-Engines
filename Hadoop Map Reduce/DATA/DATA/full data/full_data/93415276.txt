story of english history at the death of richard the first and continues it to the time of the deposition and death of richard the second with a view of presenting as complete a picture as is possible

the english throne  richard i is known and celebrated in history as richard the crusader he was the sovereign ruler not only of england but of all the norman part of france and from both of his dominions he raised a vast army and went with it to the holy land where he fought many years against the saracens with a view of rescuing jerusalem and the other holy places there from the dominion of unbelievers he met with a great many remarkable adventures in going to the holy land and with still more remarkable ones on his return home all of which are fully related in the volume of this series entitled king richard i  richard ii did not succeed richard i immediately several reigns intervened the monarch who immediately succeeded richard i was john john was richards brother and had been left in command in england as regent during the kings absence in the holy land  after john came henry iii and the three edwards and when the third edward died his son richard ii was heir to the throne he was however too young at that time to reign for he was only ten years old  the kings in these days were wild and turbulent men always engaged in wars with each other and with their nobles while all the industrial classes were greatly depressed the nobles lived in strong castles in various places about the country and owned or claimed to own very large estates which the laboring men were compelled to cultivate for them some of these castles still remain in a habitable state but most of them are now in ruinsand very curious objects the ruins are to see  illustration ruins of an ancient castle  the kings held their kingdoms very much as the nobles did their estatesthey considered them theirs by right and the people generally thought so too the king had a right as they imagined to live in luxury and splendor and to lord it over the country and compel the mass of the people to pay him nearly all their earnings in rent and taxes and to raise armies whenever he commanded them to go and fight for him in his quarrels with his neighbors because his father had done these things before him and what right had his father to do these things why because his father had done them before him very well but to go back to the beginning what right had the first man to assume this power and how did he get possession of it this was a question that nobody could answer for nobody knew then and nobody knows now who were the original founders of these noble families or by what means they first came into power people did not know how to read and write in the days when kings first began to reign and so no records ere made and no accounts kept of public transactions and when at length the countries of europe in the middle ages began to emerge somewhat into the light of civilization these royal and noble families were found every where established the whole territory of europe was divided into a great number of kingdoms principalities dukedoms and other such sovereignties over each of which some ancient family was established in supreme and almost despotic power nobody knew how they originally came by their power  the people generally submitted to this power very willingly in the first place they had a sort of blind veneration for it on account of its ancient and established character then they were always taught from infancy that kings had a right to reign and nobles a right to their estates and that to toil all their lives and allow their kings and nobles to take in rent and taxes and in other such ways every thing that they the people earned except what was barely sufficient for their subsistence was an obligation which the god of nature had imposed upon them and that it would be a sin in them not to submit to it whereas nothing can be more plain than that the god of nature intends the earth for man and that consequently society ought to be so organized that in each generation every man can enjoy something at least like his fair share of the products of it in proportion to the degree of industry or skill which he brings to bear upon the work of developing these products  there was another consideration which made the common people more inclined to submit to these hereditary kings and nobles than we should have supposed they would have been and that is the government which they exercised was really in many respects of great benefit to the community they preserved order as far as they could and punished crimes if bands of robbers were formed the nobles or the king sent out a troop to put them down if a thief broke into a house and stole what he found there the government sent officers to pursue and arrest him and then shut him up in jail if a murder was committed they would seize the murderer and hang him it was their interest to do this for if they allowed the people to be robbed and plundered or to live all the time in fear of violence then it is plain that the cultivation of the earth could not go on and the rents and the taxes could not be paid so these governments established courts and made laws and appointed officers to execute them in order to protect the lives and property of their subjects from all common thieves and murderers and the people were taught to believe that there was no other way by which their protection could be secured except by the power of the kings we must be contented as we are they said to themselves and be willing to go and fight the kings battles and to pay to him and to the nobles nearly every thing that we can earn or else society will be thrown into confusion and the whole land will be full of thieves and murderers  in the present age of the world means have been devised by which in any country sufficiently enlightened for this purpose the people themselves can organize a government to restrain and punish robbers and murderers and to make and execute all other necessary laws for the promotion of the general welfare but in those ancient times this was seldom or never done the art of government was not then understood it is very imperfectly understood at the present day but in those days it was not understood at all and accordingly there was nothing better for the people to do than to submit to and not only to submit to but to maintain with all their power the government of these hereditary kings and nobles  it must not be supposed however that the power of these hereditary nobles was absolute it was very far from being absolute it was restricted and curtailed by the ancient customs and laws of the realm which customs and laws the kings and nobles could not transgress without producing insurrections and rebellions their own right to the power which they wielded rested solely on ancient customs and of course the restrictions on these rights which had come down by custom from ancient times were as valid as the rights themselves  notwithstanding this the kings were continually overstepping the limits of their power and insurrections and civil wars were all the time breaking out in consequence of which the realms over which they reigned were kept in a perpetual state of turmoil these wars arose sometimes from the contests of different claimants to the crown if a king died leaving only a son too young to rule one of his brothers perhapsan uncle of the young princewould attempt to seize the throne under one pretext or another and then the nobles and the courtiers would take sides some in favor of the nephew and some in favor of the uncle and a long civil war would perhaps ensue this was the case immediately after the death of richard i when he died he designated as his successor a nephew of his who was at that time only twelve years old the name of this young prince was arthur he was the son of geoffrey a brother of richards older than john and he was accordingly the rightful heir but john having been once installed in power by his brotherfor his brother had made him regent when he went away on his crusade to the holy landdetermined that he would seize the crown himself and exclude his nephew from the succession  so he caused himself to be proclaimed king he was in normandy at the time but he immediately put himself at the head of an armed force and went to england  the barons of the kingdom immediately resolved to resist him and to maintain the cause of the young arthur they said that arthur was the rightful king and that john was only a usurper so they withdrew every man to his castle and fortified themselves there  in cases like this where in any kingdom there were two contested claims for the throne the kings of the neighboring countries usually came in and took part in the quarrel they thought that by taking sides with one of the claimants and aiding him to get possession of the throne they should gain an influence in the kingdom which they might afterward turn to account for themselves the king of france at this time was named philip he determined to espouse the cause of young arthur in this quarrel his motive for doing this was to have a pretext for making war upon john and in the war of conquering some portion of normandy and annexing it to his own dominions  so he invited arthur to come to his court and when he arrived there he asked him if he would not like to be king of england arthur said that he should like to be a king very much indeed well said philip i will furnish you with an army and you shall go and make war upon john i will go too with another army then whatever i shall take away from john in normandy shall be mine but all of england shall be yours  the situation of the country of normandy in relation to france and to england may be seen by the accompanying map  illustration situation of normandy  philip thought that he could easily seize a large part of normandy and annex it to his dominions while john was engaged in defending himself against arthur in england  arthur who was at this time only about fourteen years old was of course too young to exercise any judgment in respect to such questions as these so he readily agreed to what philip proposed and very soon afterward philip assembled an army and placing arthur nominally at the head of it he sent him forth into normandy to commence the war upon john of course arthur was only nominally at the head of the army there were old and experienced generals who really had the command though they did every thing in arthurs name  a long war ensued but in the end arthurs army was defeated and arthur himself was made prisoner john and his savage soldiery got possession of the town where arthur was in the night and they seized the poor boy in his bed the soldiers took him away with a troop of horse and shut him up in a dungeon in a famous castle called the castle of falaise you will see the position of falaise on the map  after a while john determined to visit arthur in his prison in order to see if he could not make some terms with him to accomplish his purpose more effectually he waited some time till he thought the poor boys spirit must be broken down by his confinement and his sufferings his design was probably to make terms with him by offering him his liberty and perhaps some rich estate if he would only give up his claims to the crown and acknowledge john as king but he found that arthur young as he was and helpless as was his condition in his lonely dungeon remained in heart entirely unsubdued all that he would say in answer to johns proposal was give me back my kingdom at length john finding that he could not induce the prince to give up his claims went away in a rage and determined to kill him if arthur were dead there would then he thought be no farther difficulty for all acknowledged that after arthur he himself was the next heir  there was another way too by which john might become the rightful heir to the crown it was a prevalent idea in those days that no person who was blind or deaf or dumb could inherit a crown to blind young arthur then would be as effectual a means of extinguishing his claims as to kill him and john accordingly determined to destroy the young princes right to the succession by putting out his eyes so he sent two executioners to perform this cruel deed upon the captive in his dungeon  the name of the governor of the castle was hubert he was a kind and humane man and he pitied his unhappy prisoner and so when the executioners came and hubert went to the cell to tell arthur that they had come and what they had come for arthur fell on his knees before him and began to beg for mercy crying out save me oh save me with such piteous cries that huberts heart was moved with compassion and he concluded that he would put off the execution of the dreadful deed till he could see the king again  john was very angry when he found that his orders had not been obeyed and he immediately determined to send arthur to another prison which was in the town of rouen the keeper of which he knew to be an unscrupulous and merciless man this was done and soon afterward it was given out through all the kingdom that arthur was dead every body was convinced that john had caused him to be murdered there were several different rumors in respect to the way in which the deed was done one story was that john being at rouen where arthur was imprisoned after having become excited with the wine which he had drunk at a carousal went and killed arthur himself with his own hand and that he then ordered his body to be thrown into the seine with heavy stones tied to the feet to make it sink the body however afterward they said rose to the surface and floated to the shore where some monks found it and buried it secretly in their abbey  another story was that john pretended to be reconciled to arthur and took him out one day to ride with him with other horsemen presently john rode on with arthur in advance of the party until late in the evening they came to a solitary place where there was a high cliff overhanging the sea here john drew his sword and riding up to arthur suddenly ran him through the body arthur cried aloud and begged for mercy as he fell from his horse to the ground but john dragged him to the edge of the precipice and threw him over into the sea while he was yet alive and breathing  a third story was that john had determined that arthur must die and that he came himself one night to the castle where arthur was confined in rouen on the seine a man went up to arthurs room and waking him from his sleep directed him to rise  rise said he and come with me  arthur rose and followed his guard with fear and trembling they descended the staircase to the foot of the tower where there was a portal that opened close upon the river on going out arthur found that there was a boat there at the stairs with his uncle and some other men in it arthur at once understood what these things meant and was greatly terrified he fell on his knees and begged his uncle to spare his life but john gave a sign and arthur was stabbed and then taken out a little way and thrown into the river some say that john killed him and threw him into the river with his own hand  which of these tales is true if either of them is so can now probably never be known all that is certain is that john in some way or other caused arthur to be murdered in order to remove him out of the way he justified his claim to the crown by pretending that king richard his brother on his deathbed bequeathed the kingdom to him but this nobody believes  at any rate john obtained possession of the crown and he reigned many years his reign however was a very troubled one his title indeed after arthurs death was no longer disputed but he was greatly abhorred and hated for his cruelties and crimes and at length nearly all the barons of his realm banded themselves together against him with the view of reducing his power as king within more reasonable bounds  illustration king john  the king fought these rebels as he called them for some time but he was continually beaten and finally compelled to yield to them they wrote out their demands in a full and formal manner upon parchment and compelled the king to sign it this document was called the magna charta which means the great charter the signing and delivering this deed is considered one of the most important events in english history it was the first great covenant that was made between the kings and the people of england and the stipulations of it have been considered binding to this day so that it is in some sense the original basis and foundation of the civil rights which the british people now enjoy  the place of assembly where king john came out to sign this covenant was a broad and beautiful meadow on the banks of the thames not far from windsor castle the name of the field is runny mead the word mead is a contraction for meadow  the act of once signing such a compact as this was however not sufficient it seems to bind the english kings there were a great many disputes and contests about it afterward between the kings and the barons as the kings one after another refused to adhere to the agreement made by john in their name on the ground perhaps of the deed not being a voluntary one on his part he was forced to sign it they said because the barons were stronger than he was of course when the kings thought that they in their turn were stronger than the barons they were very apt to violate the agreement one of the kings on one occasion obtained a dispensation from the pope absolving him from all obligation to fulfill this compact  in consequence of this want of good faith on the part of the kings there arose continually new quarrels and sometimes new civil wars between the kings and the barons in these contests the barons were usually successful in the end and then they always insisted on the vanquished monarchs ratifying or signing the magna charta anew it is said that in this way it was confirmed and reestablished not less than thirty times in the course of four or five reigns and thus it became at last the settled and unquestioned law of the land the power of the kings of england has been restricted and controlled by its provisions ever since  all this took place in the reigns preceding the accession of richard ii  besides these contests with the barons the kings of those times were often engaged in contentions with the people but the people having no means of combining together or otherwise organizing their resistance were almost always compelled to submit they were often oppressed and maltreated in the most cruel manner the great object of the government seems to have been to extort money from them in every possible way and to this end taxes and imposts were levied upon them to such an extent as to leave them enough only for bare subsistence the most cruel means were often resorted to to compel the payment of these taxes the unhappy jews were the special subjects of these extortions the jews in europe were at this time generally excluded from almost every kind of business except buying and selling movable property and lending money but by these means many of them became very rich and their property was of such a nature that it could be easily concealed this led to a great many cases of cruelty in the treatment of them by the government the government pretended often that they were richer than they really were while they themselves pretended that they were poorer than they were and the government resorted to the most lawless and atrocious measures sometimes to compel them to pay the following extract from one of the historians of the time gives an example of this cruelty and at the same time furnishes the reader with a specimen of the quaint and curious style of composition and orthography in which the chronicles of those days are written       furthermore about the same time the king taxed the jewes      and greeuouslie tormented and emprisoned them bicause divers      of them would not willinglie pay the summes that they were      taxed at amongst other there was one of them at bristow      who would not consent to give any fine for his deliverance      wherefore by the kings commandment he was put unto this      penance namely that eurie daie till he would agree to      give to the king those ten thousand marks that he was siezed      at he would have one of his teeth plucked out of his head      by the space of seaun daies together he stood stedfast      losing euerie of those days a tooth but on the eighth day      when he shuld come to have the eighth tooth and the last      for he had but eight in all draun out he paid the monie      to save that who with more wisedome and less paine might      have done so before and so have saved his seven teeth which      he lost with such torments for those homelie toothdrauers      used no great cunning in plucking them forth as may be      conjectured  the poor jews were entirely at the mercy of the king in these cases for they were so much hated and despised by the christian people of the land that nobody was disposed to defend them either by word or deed whatever injustice or cruelty they might suffer the most absurd and injurious charges were made against them by common rumor and were generally believed for there was nobody to defend them there was a story for example that they were accustomed every year to crucify a christian child one year a mother having missed her child searched every where for him and at length found him dead in the bottom of a well it was recollected that a short time before the child disappeared he had been seen playing with some jewish children before the door of a house where a certain jew lived called john lexinton the story was immediately circulated that this child had been taken by the jews and crucified it was supposed of course that john lexinton was intimately connected with the crime he was immediately seized by the officers and he was so terrified by their threats and denunciations that he promised to confess every thing if they would spare his life this they engaged to do and he accordingly made what he called his confession in consequence of this confession a hundred and two jews were apprehended and carried to london and shut up in the tower  but notwithstanding the confession that john lexinton had made and the promise that was given him it was determined that he should not be spared but should die upon hearing this he was greatly distressed and he offered to make more confessions so he revealed several additional particulars in regard to the crime and implicated numerous other persons in the commission of it all was however of no avail he was executed and eighteen other jews with him  judging from the evidence which we have in this case it is highly probable that the alleged crime was wholly imaginary confessions that are extorted by pain or fear are never to be believed they may be true but they are far more likely to be false it was the custom in ancient times and it still remains the custom among many ignorant and barbarous nations to put persons to torture in order to compel them to confess crimes of which they are suspected or to reveal the names of their accomplices but nothing can be more cruel or unjust than such a practice as this most men in such cases are so maddened with their agony and terror that they will say any thing whatever that they think will induce their tormentors to put an end to their sufferings  the common people could not often resist the acts of oppression which they suffered from their rulers for they had no power and they could not combine together extensively enough to create a power and so they were easily kept in subjection  the nobles however were much less afraid of the monarchs and often resisted them and bid them defiance it was the law in those days that all estates to which no other person had a legal claim escheated as they called it to the king of course if the king could find an estate in which there was any flaw in the title of the man who held it he would claim it for his own at one time a king asked a certain baron to show him the title to his estate he was intending to examine it to see if there was any flaw in it the baron instead of producing his parchment drew his sword and held it out before the king  this is my title to my estate said he your majesty will remember that william of normandy did not conquer this realm for himself alone  at another time a king wished to send two of his earls out of the country on some military expedition where they did not wish to go they accordingly declined the undertaking  by the almighty said the king you shall either go or hang  by the almighty replied one of the earls we will neither go nor hang  the nobles also often formed extensive and powerful combinations among each other against the king and in such cases they were almost always successful in bringing him to submit to their demands     chapter ii  quarrels  ad 1327  classes of quarrels in which the kings and the people were engagedthe popehis claim of

predecessors of king richard the second notwithstanding the claim made by the kings of a right on their part to reign on account of the influence exercised by their government in promoting law and order throughout the community the country was really kept in a continual state of turmoil by the quarrels which the different parties concerned in this government were engaged in with each other and with surrounding nations these quarrels were of various kinds       1 the kings as we have already seen were perpetually      quarreling with the nobles       2 the different branches of the royal family were often      engaged in bitter and cruel wars with each other arising      from their conflicting claims to the crown       3 the kings of different countries were continually making      forays into each others territories or waging war against      each other with fire and sword these wars arose sometimes      from a lawless spirit of depredation and sometimes were      waged to resent personal insults or injuries real or      imaginary       4 the pope of rome who claimed jurisdiction over the      church in england as well as elsewhere was constantly      coming into collision with the civil power  from some one or other of these several causes the kingdom of england in the time of richards predecessors was seldom at peace some great quarrel or other was continually going on there was a great deal of difficulty during the reigns that immediately preceded that of richard the second between the kings and the pope the pope as has already been remarked was considered the head of the whole christian church and he claimed rights in respect to the appointment of the archbishops and bishops and other ecclesiastics in england and in respect to the government and control of the monasteries and the abbeys and to the appropriation and expenditure of the revenues of the church which sometimes interfered very seriously with the views and designs of the king hence there arose continual disputes and quarrels the pope never came himself to england but he often sent a grand embassador called a legate who traveled with great pomp and parade and with many attendants and assumed in all his doings a most lofty and superior air in the contests in which these legates were engaged with the kings the legates almost always came off conquerors through the immense influence which the pope exercised over the consciences and religious fears of the mass of the people  sometimes the visits of the legates and their proceedings among the people led to open broils at one time for instance the legate was at oxford where the great university now so renowned throughout the world already existed he was lodged at an abbey there and some of the scholars of the university wishing to pay their respects to him as they said went in a body to the gates of the abbey and demanded admission but the porter kept them back and refused to let them in upon this a great noise and tumult arose the students pressing against the gates to get in and the porter assisted by the legates men whom he called to his assistance resisting them  in the course of the fray one or two of the students succeeded in forcing their way in as far as to the kitchen of the abbey and there one of them called upon a cook to help them but the cook instead of helping them dipped out a ladle full of hot broth from a kettle and threw it into the students face whereupon the other students cried out as the ancient chronicler relates it what meane we to suffer this villanie and taking an arrow he set it in his bow having caught up these weapons in the beginning of the fray and let it fly at the cook and killed him on the spot  this of course greatly increased the excitement more students came in and so great was the tumult and confusion that the legate was in terror for his life and he fled and concealed himself in the belfry of the abbey after lying in this place of concealment for some time until the tumult was in some measure appeased he crept out secretly fled across the thames and then mounting a horse made the best of his way to london  he made complaint to the king of the indignity which he had endured and the king immediately sent a troop of armed men with an earl at the head of them to rescue the remainder of the legates men that were still imprisoned in the abbey and also to seize all the students that had been concerned in the riot and bring them to london the earl proceeded to execute his commission he apprehended thirty of the students and taking them to a neighboring castle he shut them up there as prisoners  in the end besides punishing the individual students who had made this disturbance the regents and masters of the university were compelled to come to london and there to go barefooted through the principal street to a church where the legate was and humbly to supplicate his forgiveness for the indignity which he had suffered and so with great difficulty they obtained their pardon  the students in those days as students are apt to be in all countries and in all ages were a very impulsive and in some respects a lawless set whenever they deemed themselves injured they pursued the object of their hostility in the most reckless and relentless manner at one time a member of the university became so excited against the king on account of some injury real or imaginary which he had suffered that he resolved to kill him so he feigned himself mad and in this guise he loitered many days about the palace of woodstock where the king was then residing until at length he became well acquainted with all the localities then watching his opportunity he climbed by night through a window into a bedchamber where he thought the king was lying he crept up to the bedside and throwing back the clothes he stabbed several times into the bed with a dagger he however stabbed nothing but the bed itself and the pillow for the king that night as it happened lay in another chamber  as the student was making his escape he was spied by one of the chambermaids named margaret biset margaret immediately made a great outcry and the other servants coming up seized the student and carried him off to prison he was afterward tried and was convicted of treason in having made an attempt upon the kings life and was hanged before his death he said that he had been employed to kill the king by another man a certain william de marish who was a noted and prominent man of those days this william de marish was afterward taken and brought to trial but he solemnly denied that he had ever instigated the student to commit the crime he was however condemned and executed and according to the custom in those days in the case of persons convicted of treason his body was subjected after his death to extreme indignities and then was divided into four quarters one of which was sent to each of the four principal cities of the kingdom and publicly exhibited in them as a warning to all men of the dreadful consequences of attempting such a crime  great pains were taken in those days to instill into the minds of all men the idea that to kill a king was the worst crime that a human being could commit one of the writers of the time said that in wounding and killing a prince a man was guilty of homicide parricide christicide and even of deicide all in one that is that in the person of a king slain by the hand of the murderer the criminal strikes not only at a man but at his own father and at christ his savior and god  a great many strange and superstitious notions were entertained by the people in respect to kings these superstitions were encouraged even by the scholars and historians of those times who might be supposed to know better but it was so much for their interest to write what should be agreeable to the king and to his court that they were by no means scrupulous in respect to the tales which they told provided they were likely to be pleasing to those in authority and to strengthen the powers and prestige of the reigning families                                       the neighboring countries with which the kings of england were most frequently at war in those days were scotland wales and france these wars arose not from any causes connected with the substantial interests of the people of england but from the grasping ambition of the kings who wished to increase the extent of their territories and thus add to their revenues and to their power sometimes their wars arose from private and personal quarrels and in these cases thousands of lives were often sacrificed and great sums of money expended to revenge slights or personal injuries of comparatively little consequence  for instance one of the wars with wales broke out in this manner leolin who was then the reigning prince of wales sent to france and requested the king of france that he might have in marriage a certain lady named lady eleanor who was then residing in the french kings court the motive of leolin in making this proposal was not that he bore any love for the lady eleanor for very likely he had never seen her but she was the daughter of an english earl named montfort earl of leicester who was an enemy of the king of england and having been banished from the country had taken refuge in france leolin thought that by proposing and carrying into effect this marriage he would at once gratify the king of france and spite the king of england  the king of france at once assented to the proposed marriage but the king of england was extremely angry and he determined to prevent the marriage if he could he accordingly gave the necessary orders and the little fleet which was sent from france to convey eleanor to wales was intercepted off the scilly islands on the way and the whole bridal party were taken prisoners and sent to london  as soon as leolin heard this he of course was greatly enraged and he immediately set off with an armed troop and made a foray upon the english frontiers killing all the people that lived near the border plundering their property and burning up all the towns and villages that came in his way there followed a long war the english were on the whole the victors in the war and at the end of it a treaty was made by which leolins wife it is true was restored to him but his kingdom was brought almost completely under the power of the english kings  of course leolin was extremely dissatisfied with this result and he became more and more uneasy in the enthralled position to which the english king had reduced him and finally a new war broke out leolin was beaten in this war too and in the end in a desperate battle that was fought among the mountains he was slain he was slain near the beginning of the battle the man who killed him did not know at the time who it was that he had killed though he knew from his armor that he was some distinguished personage or other when the battle was ended this man went back to the place to see and finding that it was the prince leolin whom he had slain he was greatly pleased he cut off the head from the body and sent it as a present to the king the king sent the head to london there to be paraded through the streets on the end of a long pole as a token of victory after being carried in this manner through cheapsidethen the principal street of londonin order that it might be gazed upon by all the people it was set up on a high pole near the tower and there remained a long time a trophy as the king regarded it of the glory and renown of a victory but really an emblem of cruel injustice and wrong perpetrated by a strong against a weaker neighbor  not long after this the king of england succeeded in taking prince david the brother of leolin and under the pretense that he had been guilty of treason he cut off his head too and set it up on another pole at the tower of london by the side of his brothers  it must be admitted however that although these ancient warriors were generally extremely unjust in their dealings with each other and often barbarously cruel they were still sometimes actuated by high and noble sentiments of honor and generosity on one occasion for instance when this same edward the first who was so cruel in his treatment of leolin was at war in scotland and was besieging a castle there he wrote one day certain dispatches to send to his council in london and having inquired for a speedy and trusty messenger to send them by a certain welshman named lewin was sent to him the king delivered the package to lewin inclosed in a box and also gave him money to bear his expenses on the way and then sent him forth  lewin however instead of setting out on his journey went to a tavern and there with a party of his companions he spent the money which he had received in drink and passed the night carousing in the morning he said that he must set out on his journey but before he went he must go back to the castle and have one parting shot at the garrison under this pretext he took his crossbow and proceeded toward the castle wall but when he got there instead of shooting his arrows he called out to the wardens whom he saw on guard over the gate and asked them to let down a rope and draw him up into the castle as he had something of great importance to communicate to the governor of it  so the wardens let down a rope and drew lewin up and then took him to the governor who was then at breakfast lewin held out the box to the governor saying  here sir look in this box and you may read all the secrets of the king of england  he said moreover that he would like to have the governor give him a place on the wall and see whether he could handle a crossbow or not against the english army  gunpowder and guns had not been introduced as means of warfare at this time the most formidable weapon that was then employed was the crossbow with the crossbow a sort of squareheaded arrow was used called a quarrel  the governor instead of accepting these offers on the part of lewin immediately went out to one of the turrets on the wall and calling to the english soldiers whom he saw below he directed them to tell the king of england that one of his servants had turned traitor and had come into the castle with a box of dispatches  and tell him said the governor that if he will send some persons here to receive him i will let the man down to them over the wall and also restore the box of dispatches which i have not opened at all  immediately lord spencer one of the kings chief officers came to the wall and the governor of the castle let lewin down to him by a rope and also passed the box of letters down the king of england was so much pleased with this generosity on the part of the governor that he immediately ceased his operations against the castle though he caused lewin to be hanged on a gallows of the highest kind                                       but to return to wales after the death of leolin and his brother the kingdom of wales was annexed to england and has ever since remained a possession of the british crown the king of england partly induced the people of wales to consent to this annexation by promising that he would still give them a native of wales for prince they thought he meant by this that they should continue to be governed by one of their own royal family but what he really meant was that he would make his own son prince of wales this son of his was then an infant he was born in wales this happened from the fact that the king in the course of his conquests in that country had seized upon a place called caernarvon and had built a castle there in a beautiful situation on the straits of menai which separate the main land from the isle of anglesea  when his castle was finished the king brought the queen to caernarvon to see it and while she was there her child prince edward who afterward became edward the second was born  this was the origin of the title of prince of wales which has been held ever since by the oldest sons of the english sovereigns  illustration caernarvon castle  this first english prince of wales led a most unhappy life and his history illustrates in a most striking manner one of the classes of quarrels enumerated at the head of this chapter namely the disputes and contentions that often prevailed between the sovereign of the country and his principal nobles while he was a young man he formed a very intimate friendship with another young man named piers gaveston this gaveston was a remarkably handsome youth and very prepossessing and agreeable in his manners and he soon gained a complete ascendency over the mind of young edward he was however very wild and dissolute in his habits and the influence which he exerted upon edward was extremely bad as long as the common people only were injured by the lawless behavior of these young men the king seems to have borne with them but at last in a riot in which they were concerned they broke into the park of a bishop and committed damage there which the king could not overlook he caused his son the young prince to be seized and put into prison and he banished gaveston from the country and forbade his son to have any thing more to do with him this was in 1305 when the prince was twentyone years of age  in 1307 two years later the king died and the prince succeeded him under the title of king edward the second he immediately sent for gaveston to return to england where he received him with the greatest joy he made him a duke under the title of duke of cornwall and as for the bishop whose park he and gaveston had broken into and on whose complaint gaveston had been banished in order to punish him for these offenses the young king seized him and delivered him into gavestons hands as a prisoner and at the same time confiscated his estates and gave them to gaveston gaveston sent the bishop about from castle to castle as a prisoner according as his caprice or fancy dictated  these things made the barons and nobles of england extremely indignant for gaveston besides being a corrupt and dissipated character was in fact a foreigner by birth being a native of gascony in france his character seemed to grow worse with his exaltation and he and edward spent all their time in rioting and excess and in perpetrating every species of iniquity  edward had been for some time engaged to be married to the princess isabel the daughter of the king of france about six months after his accession to the throne he set off for france to be married it was his duty according to the ancient usages of the realm to appoint some member of the royal family or some prominent person from the ancient nobility of the country to govern the kingdom as regent during his absence but instead of this he put gaveston in this place and clothed him with all the powers of a viceroy  illustration portrait of edward the second  edward was married to isabel in paris with great pomp and parade isabel was very beautiful and was a general favorite it is said that there were four kings and three queens present at the marriage ceremony edward however seemed to feel very little interest either in his bride or in the occasion of his marriage but manifested a great impatience to get through with the ceremonies so as to return to england and to gaveston as soon as it was possible he set out on his return the bridal party were met at their landing by gaveston accompanied by all the principal nobility who came to receive and welcome them at the frontier the king was overjoyed to see gaveston again he fell into his arms hugged and kissed him and called him his dear brother while on the other hand he took very little notice of the nobles and high officers of state every body was surprised and displeased at this behavior but as edward was king there was nothing to be said or done  soon afterward the coronation took place and on this occasion all the honors were allotted to gaveston to the utter neglect of the ancient and hereditary dignitaries of the realm gaveston carried the crown and walked before the king and queen and acted in all respects as if he were the principal personage in the country the old nobles were of course extremely indignant at this hitherto they had expressed their displeasure at the kings favoritism by private murmurings and complaints but now they thought it was time to take some concerted public action to remedy the evil so they met together and framed a petition to be sent to the king in which though under the form of a request they in fact demanded that gaveston should be dismissed from his offices and required to leave the country  the king was alarmed he however could not think of giving his favorite up so he said that he would return them an answer to the petition byandby and he immediately began to pursue a more conciliatory course toward the nobles but the effect of his attempts at conciliation was spoiled by gavestons behavior he became more and more proud and ostentatious every day he appeared in all public places and every where he took precedence of the highest nobles of the land and prided himself on outshining them in the pomp and parade which he displayed he attended all the jousts and tournaments and as he was really a very handsome and wellformed man and well skilled in the warlike sports in fashion in those days he bore away most of the great prizes he thus successfully rivaled the other nobles in gaining the admiration of the ladies of the court and the applause of the multitude and made the nobles hate him more than ever  things went on in this way worse and worse until at last the general sentiment became so strong against gaveston that the parliament when it met took a decided stand in opposition to him and insisted that he should be expelled from the country a struggle followed but the king was obliged to yield gaveston was required to leave the country and to take an oath never to return it was only on these conditions that the parliament would uphold the government and thus the king saw that he must lose either his friend or his crown  gaveston went away the king accompanied him to the seashore and took leave of him there in the most affectionate manner promising to bring him back again as soon as he could possibly do it he immediately began to manoeuvre for the accomplishment of this purpose in the mean time as gaveston had only sworn to leave england the king sent him to ireland and made him governor general of that country and there gaveston lived in greater power and splendor than ever  at length in little more than a year gaveston came back his oath not to return was disposed of by means of a dispensation which king edward obtained for him from the pope absolving him from the obligation of it when he was reinstated in the kings court he behaved more scandalously than ever he revenged himself upon the nobles who had been the means of sending him away by ridiculing them and giving them nicknames one of them he called joseph the jew because his face was pale and thin and bore in some respects a jewish expression another the earl of warwick he called the black dog of ardenne when the earl heard of this he said clenching his fist very well ill make him feel the black dogs teeth yet  in a word the nobles were excited to the greatest pitch of rage and indignation against the favorite and after various struggles and contentions between them and the king they at length broke out into an open revolt the king at this time with gaveston and his wife were at newcastle which is in the north of england the barons fell upon him here with the intention of seizing gaveston both the king and gaveston however succeeded in making their escape gaveston fled to a castle and shut himself up there the king escaped by sea leaving his wife behind at the mercy of the conspirators the barons treated the queen with respect but they pressed on at once in pursuit of gaveston they laid siege to the castle where he sought refuge finding that the castle could not hold out long gaveston thought it best to surrender while it yet remained in his power to make terms with his enemies so he agreed to give himself up they stipulating that they would do him no bodily harm but only confine him and that the place of his confinement should be one of his own castles  when he came down into the courtyard of the castle after signing this stipulation he found there ready to receive him the earl of warwick the man to whom he had given the nickname of the black dog of ardenne the earl was at the head of a large force he immediately took gaveston into custody and galloped off with him at the head of his troop to his own castle the engraving represents a view of this fortress as it appeared in those days  when they had got gaveston safe into this castle the chiefs held a sort of council of war to determine what should be done with their prisoner while they were consulting on the subject intending apparently to spare his life as they had agreed some one called out  it has cost you a great deal of trouble to catch the fox and now if you let him go you will have a great deal more trouble in hunting him again  this consideration decided them so they took the terrified prisoner and in spite of his piteous cries for mercy they hurried him away to a solitary place a mile or two from the castle and there on a little knoll by the side of the road they cut off his head  illustration warwick castle  one would have supposed that by this time the king would have been cured of the folly of devoting himself to favorites but he was not he mourned over the death of gaveston at first with bitter grief and when this first paroxysm of his sorrow was passed it was succeeded with a still more bitter spirit of revenge he immediately took the field against his rebellious barons and a furious civil war ensued he soon too found a new favorite or rather two favorites they were brothers and their names were spencer they are called in history the spencers or the despensers the quarrels and wars which took place between the king and these favorites on one hand and the barons and nobles on the other were continued for many years the queen took sides with the nobles against her husband and the spencers she fled to france and there formed an intimacy with a young nobleman named mortimer who joined himself to her and thenceforth accompanied her and made common cause with her against her husband with this mortimer she raised an army and sailing from flanders she landed in england on landing she summoned the barons to join her and took the field against her husband the king was beaten in this war and fled again on board a vessel intending to make his escape by sea the two spencers one after the other were taken prisoners and both were hung on gibbets fifty feet high they were hung in their armor and after they were dead their bodies were taken down and treated as it was customary to treat the bodies of traitorsa  footnote a in cases of treason the condemned man was first disemboweled then his head was taken off then the body was cut into quarters the head and the four quarters of the body were then sent to various parts of the kingdom and set up in conspicuous places in large cities and towns  in the midst of these proceedings the barons held a sort of parliament and made a solemn declaration that the king by his flight had abdicated the throne and they proclaimed his son the young prince of wales then about fourteen years old king under the title of edward the third in the mean time the king himself who had attempted to make his escape by sea was tossed about in a storm for some days until at last he was driven on the coast in south wales he concealed himself for some days in the mountains here he was hunted about for a time until he was reduced to despair by his destitution and his sufferings when at length he came forth and delivered himself up to his enemies  illustration kenilworth castle  he was made prisoner and immediately sent to kenilworth castle and there secured afterward he was brought to trial he was accused of shameful indolence and incapacity and also of cowardice cruelty and oppression and of having brought the country by his vices and maladministration to the verge of ruin he was convicted on these charges and the queen his wife confirmed the verdict  not being quite sure after all that by these means the dethronement of the king was legally complete the parliament sent a solemn deputation to kenilworth castle to depose the monarch in form the king was brought out to meet this deputation in a great hall of the castle he came just as he was dressed in a simple black gown the deputation told him that he was no longer king that all allegiance had been withdrawn from him on the part of the people and that henceforth he must consider himself as a private man as they said this the steward of the household came forward and broke his white wand the badge of his office in token that the household was dissolved and he declared that by that act all the kings servants were discharged and freed this was a ceremony that was usually performed at the death of a king and it was considered in this case as completely and finally terminating the reign of edward  the delegation also exacted from him something which they considered as a resignation of the crown his son the young prince it was said was unwilling to ascend the throne unless the barons could induce his father voluntarily to abdicate his own rights to it they were the more desirous in this case of completely and forever extinguishing all of king edwards claims because they were afraid that there might be a secret party in his favor and that that party might gain strength and finally come out openly against them in civil war in which case if they were worsted they knew that they would all be hung as traitors  illustration a monk of those days  indeed soon after this time it began to appear that there were in fact some persons who were disposed to sympathize with the king his queen isabel who had been acting against him during the war was now joined with mortimer her favorite and they two held pretty much the whole control of the government for the new king was yet too young to reign many of the monks and other ecclesiastics of the time openly declared that isabel was guilty of great sin in thus abandoning her husband for the sake of another man they said that she ought to leave mortimer and go and join her husband in his prison and it was not long before it began to be rumored that secret plots were forming to attempt the kings deliverance from his enemies this alarmed the nobles more than ever the queen and some others wrote sharp letters to the keepers of the castle for dealing so gently with their prisoner and gave them hints that they ought to kill him in the end the fallen monarch was transported from one fortress to another until at length he came to berkeley castle the inducement which led mortimer and the queen to send the king to these different places was the hope that some one or other of the keepers of the castles would divine their wishes in regard to him and put him to death but no one did so the keeper of berkeley castle indeed instead of putting his prisoner to death seemed inclined to take compassion on him and to treat him more kindly even than the others had done accordingly after waiting some time mortimer seized an opportunity when lord berkeley having gone away from home was detained away some days by sickness to send two fierce and abandoned men named gourney and ogle to the castle with instructions to kill the king in some way or other but if possible in such a manner as to make it appear that he died a natural death these men tried various plans without success they administered poisons and resorted to various other diabolical contrivances at last one night dreadful outcries and groans were heard coming from the kings apartment they were accompanied from time to time with shrieks of terrible agony these sounds were continued for some time and they were heard in all parts of the castle and in many of the houses of the town the truth was the executioners whom mortimer had sent were murdering the king in a manner almost too horrible to be describedb the people in the castle and in the town knew very well what these dreadful outcries meant they were filled with consternation and horror at the deed and they spent the time in praying to god that he would receive the soul of the unhappy victim  footnote b they came to him while he was asleep and pressed him down with heavy feather beds which they cast upon him to stifle his cries and then thrust a redhot spit up into his bowels through a horn as some said or a part of the tube of a trumpet according to others so as to kill him by the internal burning without making any outward mark of the fire on his person notwithstanding their efforts to stifle his cries he struggled so desperately in his agony as partly to break loose from them and thus made his shrieks and outcries heard  illustration berkeley castle  after this mortimer and the queen for two or three years held pretty nearly supreme power in the realm though of course they governed in the name of the young king who was yet only fourteen or fifteen years of age there was however a great secret hatred of mortimer among all the old nobility of the realm this illwill ripened at last into open hostility a conspiracy was formed to destroy mortimer and to depose the queenmother from her power and to place young edward in possession of the kingdom mortimer discovered what was going on and he went for safety with edward and the queen to the castle of nottingham where he shut himself up and placed a strong guard at the gates and on the walls  this castle of nottingham was situated upon a hill on the side of which was a range of excavations which had been made in a chalky stone by some sort of quarrying there was a subterranean passage from the interior of one of these caves which led to the castle the castle itself was strongly guarded and every night isabel required the warden on locking the gates to bring the keys to her and she kept them by her bedside the governor of the castle however made an agreement with lord montacute who was the leader in the conspiracy against mortimer to admit him to the castle at night through the subterranean passage it seems that mortimer and the queen did not know of the existence of this communication they did not even know about the caves for the mouths of them were at that time concealed by rubbish and brambles  illustration caves in the hillside at nottingham castle  it was near midnight when montacute and the party who went with him entered the passage they crowded their way through the bushes and brambles till they found the entrance of the cave and then went in they were all completely armed and they carried torches to light their way they crept along the gloomy passageway until at last they reached the door which led up into the interior of the castle here the governor was ready to let them in as soon as they entered they were joined by young edward at the foot of the main tower they left their torches here and edward led them up a secret staircase to a dark chamber they crept softly into this room and listened they could hear in an adjoining hall the voices of mortimer and several of his adherents who were holding a consultation they waited a few minutes and then making a rush into the passageway which led to the hall they killed two knights who were on sentry there to guard the door and immediately bursting into the apartment made mortimer and all his friends prisoners  the queen who was in her bed in an adjoining room at this time rushed frantically out when she heard the noise of the affray and with piteous entreaties and many tears she begged and prayed edward her sweet son as she called him to spare the gentle mortimer her dearest friend her wellbeloved cousin the conspirators did spare him at that time they took him prisoner and bore him away to a place of safety he was soon afterward brought to trial on a charge of treason and hanged isabel was deprived of all her property and shut up in a castle as a prisoner of state in this castle she afterward lived nearly thirty years in lonely misery and then died  the adjoining engraving represents a near view of the subterranean passage by which

gaunt   the father of king richard the second was a celebrated prince of wales known in history as the black prince the black prince as his title prince of wales implies was the oldest son of the king of england his father was edward the third the black prince was of course heir to the crown and he would have been king had it not happened that he died before his father consequently when at last his father king edward died richard who was the oldest son of the prince and of course the grandson of the king succeeded to the throne although he was at that time only ten years old  the christian name of the black prince was edward he was called the black prince on account of the color of his armor the knights and warriors of those days were often named in this way from some peculiarity in their armor  edward being the oldest son of the king his father was prince of wales he was often called the prince of wales and often simply prince edward but inasmuch as there were several successive edwards each of whom was in his youth the prince of wales neither of those titles alone would be a sufficiently distinctive appellation for the purposes of history this edward accordingly as he became very celebrated in his day and inasmuch as on account of his dying before his father he never became any thing more than prince of wales is known in history almost exclusively by the title of the black prince  but although he never attained to a higher title than that of prince he still lived to a very mature age he was more than forty years old when he died he however began to acquire his great celebrity when he was very young he fought at the great battle of crecy in france as one of the principal commanders on the english side when he was only about seventeen years old  crecy or cressy as it is sometimes called is situated on the banks of the river somme in the northeast part of france the circumstances under which the battle in this place was fought are as follows the king of england edward the third the father of the black prince laid claim to the throne of france the ground of his claim was that through his grandmother isabel who was a daughter of the french king he was the nearest bloodrelation to the royal line all the other branches of the family nearer than his own being extinct now the people of france were of course very unwilling that the king of england should become entitled to the french crown and they accordingly made a certain prince philip the king who reigned under the title of philip the sixth philip was the nearest relative after edward and he derived his descent through males alone while edward claiming as he did through his grandmother isabel came through a female line  now there was an ancient law prevailing in certain portions of france called the salic lawc by which female children were excluded from inheriting the possessions of their fathers this principle was at first applied to the inheriting of private property but it was afterward extended to rights and titles of all sorts and finally to the descent of the crown of france indeed the right to rule over a province or a kingdom was considered in those days as a species of property which descended from father to child by absolute right over which the people governed had no control whatever  footnote c the salic law is very celebrated in history and questions growing out of it gave rise in ancient times to innumerable wars it derived its name from a tribe of people called saliens by whom it was first introduced  the chief reason why the salic law was applied to the case of the crown of france was not as it might at first be supposed because it was thought in those days that women were not qualified to reign but because by allowing the crown to descend to the daughters of the king as well as to the sons there was danger of its passing out of the country the princes of the royal family usually remained in their own land and if they married at all they married usually foreign princesses whom they brought home to live with them in their native land the princesses on the other hand when they grew up were very apt to marry princes of other countries who took them away to the places where they the princes respectively lived if now these princesses were allowed to inherit the crown and especially if the inheritance were allowed to pass through them to their children cases might occur in which the kingdom of france might descend to some foreignborn prince the heir or the actual ruler perhaps of some foreign kingdom  this was precisely what happened in edwards case the salic law had not then been fully established edward maintained that it was not law he claimed that the crown descended through isabel to him the french on the other hand insisted on passing him by and decided that philip who next to him was the most direct descendant and whose title came through a line of males should be king  in this state of things edward raised a great army and set out for france in order to possess himself of the french crown the war continued many years in the course of which edward fitted out several different expeditions into france  it was in one of these expeditions that he took his son the black prince then only seventeen years of age as one of his generals the prince was a remarkably fine young man tall and manly in form and possessed of a degree of maturity of mind above his years he was affable and unassuming too in his manners and was a great favorite among all the ranks of the army  the map on the following page shows the course of the expedition and the situation of crecy the fleet which brought the troops over landed there on a cape a little to the westward of the region shown upon the map from the place where they landed they marched across the country as seen by the track upon the map toward the seine they took possession of the towns on the way and plundered and wasted the country  illustration mapcampaign of crecy  illustration view of rouen from the west side of the river  they advanced in this manner until at length they reached the river opposite rouen which was then as now a very large and important town it stands on the eastern bank of the river on reaching rouen edward found the french army ready to meet him there was a bridge of boats there and edward had intended to cross the river by it and get into the town of rouen he found however on his arrival opposite the town that the bridge was gone the french king had destroyed it he then turned his course up the river keeping of course on the western and southern side of the stream and looking out for an opportunity to cross but as fast as he ascended on one side of the river philip ascended on the other and destroyed all the bridges before edwards armies could get to them in this way the two armies advanced each on its own side of the river until they reached the environs of paris the english burning and destroying every thing that came in their way there was a good deal of manoeuvring between the two armies near paris in the course of which edward contrived to get across the river he crossed at poissy by means of a bridge which philip had only partially destroyed while philip was away looking out for his capital paris which edward was threatening edward hastened back to get possession of the bridge repaired it and marched his army over before philip could return  both armies then struck across the country toward the river somme philip reached the river first he crossed at amiens and then went down on the right or eastern bank of the river destroying all the bridges on the way edward when he reached the river found no place to cross he tried at pont st remi at long and at other places but failed every where in the mean time while his own forces had gradually been diminishing philips had been rapidly increasing philip now divided his force he sent down one portion on the eastern side of the river to prevent the english from crossing with the other portion he came back to the left bank and began to follow edwards army down toward the mouth of the river edward went on in this way as far as oisemont and here he began to find himself in great danger of being hemmed in by philips army in a corner between the river and the sea  he sent scouts up and down to try to find some place where he could cross by a ford as the bridges were all down but no fordingplace could be found he then ordered the prisoners that he had taken to be all brought together and he offered liberty and a large reward in money to any one of them that would show him where there was a ford by which he could get his army across the river he thought that they being natives of the country would be sure to know about the fordingplaces if any there were one of the prisoners a countryman named gobin told him that there was a place a little lower down the river called white spot where people could wade across the river when the tide was low the tide ebbed and flowed in the river here on account of its being so near the sea  this was in the evening king edward was awake all night with anxiety expecting every moment that philip would come suddenly upon him he rose at midnight and ordered the trumpets to sound in order to arouse the men the officers were all on the alert the young prince among them all was movement and bustle in the camp as soon as the day dawned they commenced their march gobin leading the way he was well guarded they were all ready to cut him to pieces if he should fail to lead them to the ford which he had promised but he found the ford though at the time that the army reached the spot the tide was high so that they could not cross besides this the king saw that on the opposite bank there was a large body of french troops posted to guard the passage edward was obliged to wait some hours for the tide to go down being in a terrible state of suspense all the time for fear that philip should come down upon him in the rear in which case his situation would have been perilous in the extreme  at last the tide was low enough to make the river fordable and edward ordered his troops to dash forward into the river the men advanced but they were met in the middle of the stream by the troops that had been posted on the bank to oppose them there was a short and desperate conflict in the water but edward at last forced his way through and drove the french away  it then required some hours for all his army to cross they had barely time to accomplish the work before the tide came up again just at this time too philips army appeared but it was too late for them to cross the ford and so edward escaped with the main body of his army though a portion of those in the rear who were not able to get across in time fell into philips hands and were either killed or taken prisoners on the margin of the water  the young prince was of course as much rejoiced as his father at this fortunate escape the army were all greatly encouraged too by the result of the battle which they had fought on the bank of the river in landing and finally edward resolved that he would not retreat any farther he determined to choose a good position and draw up his army in array and so give philip battle if he chose to come on the place which he selected was a hill at crecy philip soon after came up and the battle was fought and thus it was that crecy became the scene of the great and celebrated conflict which bears its name  king edward arrayed his troops in successive lines on the declivity of the hill while he himself took his station with a large reserve on the summit of it he committed the general charge of the battle to his generals and knights and one of the chief in command was the young prince who was placed at the head of one of the most important lines although he was at this time as has already been said only seventeen years old  the king of france with an immense host came on toward the place where edward was encamped confident that as soon as he could come up with him he should at once overwhelm and destroy him his army was very large while edwards was comparatively small philips army however was not under good control the vast columns filled the roads for miles and when the front arrived at the place where edwards army was posted the officers attempted to halt them all but those behind crowded on toward those in front and made great confusion then there was disagreement and uncertainty among philips counselors in respect to the time of making the attack some were in favor of advancing at once but others were for waiting till the next day as the soldiers were worn out and exhausted by their long march  illustration genoese archer  there was a large body of genoese archers who fought with crossbows a very heavy but a very efficient weapon the officers who commanded these archers were in favor of waiting for the attack till the next day as their men were very weary from the fatigue of carrying their crossbows so far they had marched eighteen miles that day very heavily laden philip was angry with them for their unwillingness to go at once into battle  see he cried out see what we get by employing such scoundrels who fail us at the very moment when we want them  this made the archers very angry but nevertheless they formed in order of battle at the command of their officers and went forward to the van there went with them a large troop of horsemen under the french general the horses of this troop were splendidly equipped and were fierce for the fight  while these preparations were making a very black cloud was seen rising in the sky until the whole heavens were darkened by it the wind blew and immense flocks of crows flew screaming through the air over the heads of the army presently it began to rain the rain increased rapidly until it fell in torrents and every body was drenched there was however no possibility of shelter or escape from it and the preparations for the fight accordingly still went on  at length about five oclock it cleared up just as the battle was about to begin the genoese archers were in front with the horsemen but the english who had all this time remained calm and quiet at their posts poured such a volley of arrows into their ranks that they were soon broken and began to be thrown into confusion other english soldiers ran out from their ranks armed with knives set into the ends of long poles and they thrust these knives into the horses of the troop the horses terrified and maddened with the pain turned round and ran in among the genoese archers and trampled many of them under foot this made the whole body of archers waver and begin to fall back then philip who was coming on behind at the head of other bodies of troops fell into a great rage and shouted out in a thundering voice  kill me those scoundrels for they only stop our way without doing any good  of course this made the confusion worse than ever in the mean time the english soldiers under the command of prince edward and the other leaders pressed slowly and steadily forward and poured in such an incessant and deadly fire of darts and arrows upon the confused and entangled masses of their enemies that they could not rally or get into order again some of the french generals made desperate efforts in other parts of the field to turn the tide but in vain  at one time when the battle was very hot in the part of the field where the young english prince was fighting messengers went up the hill to the place where the king was stationed near a windmill whence he was watching the progress of the fight to ask him to send some succor to the troops that were fighting with the prince  is my son killed asked the king  no sire said the messenger  is he unhorsed or wounded asked the king  no sire replied the messenger he is safe thus far and is fighting with his troop but he is very hard beset  no matter for that said the king go and tell him he can not have any help from me i intend that the glory of this victory shall be for him alone and for those to whom i have intrusted him  things went on in this way for some time until at length the whole french army was thrown into utter confusion and the men were flying in all directions night was coming on and it was beginning to be impossible to distinguish friend from foe a french knight rode up to the king of france and seizing his horse by the bridle turned him away saying to the king  sire it is time to withdraw by remaining here any longer you will only sacrifice yourself to no purpose reserve yourself to win the victory some other day  so the king turned and fled a small party of his officers accompanying him he fled to a castle in the neighborhood called the castle of la broye and sought refuge there when the party arrived the gates were shut for it was late and dark they summoned the castellan or keeper of the castle he came out upon the battlements and demanded who was there  the king called out  open castellan open it is the fortune of france  the castellan knew the kings voice and ordered the gate to be opened and the drawbridge to be let down the king and his party which consisted of only five persons went in they remained at the castle only a short time to take some wine and other refreshment and then set out again at midnight with guides furnished them by the castellan and rode to amiens which being a large and wellfortified town was at least a temporary place of safety  but though the king himself thus made his escape a great many of the knights and generals in his army would not fly but remained fighting on the field until they were killed there was one of the kings allies the king of bohemia whose death if the legends which have come down to us respecting this battle are true occurred under very extraordinary circumstances he was present with the army not as a combatant for he was old and blind and thus completely helpless he came it would seem to accompany his son who was an active commander in philips army his son was dangerously wounded and forced to abandon the field and the old king was so overwhelmed with chagrin at the result of the battle and so enraged at the fate of his son that he determined to charge upon the enemy himself so he placed himself between two knights who interlaced the bridle of his horse with the bridles of theirs for the king himself could not see to guide the reins and in this manner they rode into the thickest of the fight where the black prince was contending they were all almost immediately killed  prince edward was so much struck with this spectacle that he adopted the motto on the old kings shield for his this motto was the german phrase ich dien under three plumes the words mean i serve this motto and device have been borne in the coat of arms of the prince of wales from that day to this  at the close of the battle the soldiers kindled up great fires on account of the darkness of the night and in the light of them king edward came down from his post on the hill his heart full of exultation and joy at the greatness of the victory which his army had achieved and at the glory of his son in front of the whole army he took his son in his arms and kissed him and said  my dear son god give you grace to persevere as you have begun you are my true son for loyally you have acquitted yourself this day and well do you deserve a crown  edward received these honors in a very modest and unassuming manner he bowed reverentially before his father and attributed to others rather than to himself the success of the day his modesty and generosity of demeanor connected with the undaunted bravery which he had really evinced in the fight caused the whole army to feel an enthusiastic admiration for him and as fast as tidings of these events extended all europe was filled with his fame  after gaining this great battle edward marched to calais a very important seaport on the coast to the northward of the mouth of the somme and laid siege to that town and although it was so strongly fortified that he could not force his way into it he succeeded at length in starving the inhabitants into a surrender he was so exasperated at the obstinate resistance of the people that at last when they were ready to surrender he declared that he would only spare their lives on condition that six of the principal inhabitants should come out to his camp barefooted bareheaded and with halters about their necks in order that they might be hung immediately these cruel terms were complied with six of the principal inhabitants of the town volunteered to give themselves up as victims they proceeded to edwards camp but their lives were saved by the interposition of philippa the queen prince edwards mother the king was exceedingly unwilling to spare them but he could not resist the entreaties of philippa though he said he wished she had been somewhere else so as not to have interfered with his revenge  edward and all his army with the queen and prince edward marched into calais with great pomp and parade soon after their entrance into the town a daughter was born to philippa who was called from the place of her nativity margaret of calais  besides this sister margaret prince edward had a brother born on the continent of europe his name was john and he was born in ghent he was called john of ghent or as the english historians generally wrote it john of gaunt  after the taking of calais there were other campaigns and battles and more victories some upon one side and some upon the other and then when both parties were so exhausted that their strength was gone while yet their hostility and hate continued unappeased a truce was made then after the truce came new wars and thus years rolled on during all this time the black prince distinguished himself greatly as one of the chief of his fathers generals he grew up to full manhood and while like the other warlike chieftains of those days his life was devoted to deeds of rapine and murder there was in his demeanor toward those with whom he was at peace and toward enemies who were entirely subdued a certain hightoned nobleness and generosity of character which combined with his undaunted courage and his extraordinary strength and prowess on the field of battle made him one of the greatest lights of chivalry of his age     chapter iv  the battle of poictiers  ad 13561360  the black prince sets out for

the black prince when he was about twentyfive years of age set out from england at the head of a large body of men to invade france on the southern and western side his first destination was gascony a country in the southern part of france between the garonne the pyrenees and the sead  footnote d see map on page 110  from london he went to plymouth where the fleet had been assembled in which he was to sail he was accompanied on his march by an immense number of nobles and barons all splendidly equipped and armed and full of enthusiastic expectations of the glory which they were to acquire in serving in such a campaign under so famed and brilliant a commander  the fleet which awaited the army at plymouth consisted of three hundred vessels the expedition was detained for a long time in the port waiting for a fair wind and good weather at length the favorable time arrived the army embarked and the ships set sail in sight of a vast assemblage formed by people of the surrounding country who crowded the shores to witness the spectacle  the ships of those times were not large and judging from some of the pictures that have come down to us they were of very odd construction on the adjoining page is a copy of one of these pictures from an ancient manuscript of about this time  these pictures however are evidently intended rather as symbols of ships as it were than literally correct representations of them still we can deduce from them some general idea of the form and structure actually employed in the naval architecture of those times  illustration ancient representation of english ships  prince edwards fleet had a prosperous voyage and his army landed safely in gascony soon after landing he commenced his march through the country to the eastward pillaging burning and destroying wherever he went the inhabitants of the country whom the progress of his march thus overwhelmed with ruin had nothing whatever to do with the quarrel between his father and the king of france it made very little difference to them under whose reign they lived it is not at all unlikely that far the greater portion of them had never even heard of the quarrel they were quietly engaged in their various industrial pursuits dreaming probably of no danger until the advance of this army coming upon them mysteriously no one knew whither like a plague or a tornado or a great conflagration drove them from their homes and sent them flying about the country in all directions in terror and despair the prince enjoyed the credit and the fame of being a generous and magnanimous prince but his generosity and magnanimity were only shown toward knights and nobles and princes like himself for it was only when such as these were the objects of these virtues that he could gain credit and fame by the display of them  in this march of devastation and destruction the prince overran all the southern part of france one of his attendants in this campaign a knight who served in the princes household in a letter which he wrote back to england from bordeaux gave the following summary of the results of the expedition       my lord rode thus abroad in the countrie of his enimies      eight whole weekes and rested not past eleven daies in all      those places where he came and know it for certeine that      since this warre began against the french king he had      never such losse or destruction as he hath had in this      journie for the countries and good townes which were wasted      in this journie found to the king of france everie yeare      more to the maintainance of his warre than half his realme      hath doon beside except c  illustration mapcampaign of poictiers  after having thus laid waste the southern coast the prince turned his course northward toward the heart of the country carrying devastation and destruction with him wherever he came he advanced through auvergne and berri two provinces in the central part of france his army was not very large for it consisted of only about eight thousand men it was however very compact and efficient and the prince advanced at the head of it in a very slow and cautious manner he depended for the sustenance of his soldiers on the supplies which he could obtain from the country itself accordingly he moved slowly from town to town so as not to fatigue his soldiers by too long marches nor exhaust them by too frequent battles when he was entered anie towne says the old chronicler that was sufficientlie stored of things necessarie he would tarrie there two or three daies to refresh his soldiers and men of warre and when they dislodged they would strike out the heads of the wine vessels and burne the wheat oats and barlie and all other things which they could not take with them to the intent that their enimies should not therewith be sustained and nourished  at length while the prince was advancing through the province of berri and approaching the river loire he learned that the king of france john had assembled a great army at paris and was coming down to meet him large detachments from this army had already advanced as far as the banks of the loire and all the important points on that river had been taken possession of and were strongly guarded by them the king himself at the head of the main force had reached chartres and was rapidly advancing the prince heard this news at a certain castle which he had taken and where he had stopped some days to refresh his men  a council of war was held to determine what should be done the prevailing voice at this council was in favor of not attempting to cross the loire in the face of such an enemy but of turning to the westward toward the province of poitou through which a way of retreat to the southward would be open in case a retreat should be necessary the prince determined to accept this advice and so he put his army in motion toward the town of romorantin  now the king of france had sent a detachment of his troops under the command of three famous knights across the loire this detachment consisted of about three hundred horsemen all armed from head to foot and mounted on swift chargers this squadron had been hovering in the neighborhood of the english army for some days watching for an opportunity to attack them but without success now foreseeing that edward would attempt to enter romorantin they pushed forward in a stealthy manner to the neighborhood of that town and placed themselves in ambush at the sides of a narrow and solitary gorge in the mountains through which they knew the english must necessarily pass  on the same day that the french knights formed this ambush several of the commanders in edwards army asked leave to take a troop of two hundred men from the english army and ride forward to the gates of the town in order to reconnoitre the place and ascertain whether the way was clear for the main body of the army to approach edward gave them permission and they set forward as might have been expected they fell into the snare which the french knights had laid for them the frenchmen remained quiet and still in their hidingplaces and allowed the english to pass on through the defile then as soon as they had passed the french rushed out and galloped after them with their spears in their rests all ready for a charge  the english troop hearing the sound of the galloping of horses in the road behind them turned round to see what was coming to their dismay they found that a troop of their enemies was close upon them and that they were hemmed in between them and the town a furious battle ensued the english though they were somewhat fewer in number than the french seem to have been made desperate by their danger and they fought like tigers for a time it was uncertain which way the contest would turn but at length while the victory was still undecided the van of the main body of the english army began to arrive upon the ground the french now saw that they were in danger of being overpowered with numbers and they immediately began to retreat they fled in the direction of the town the english followed them in a headlong pursuit filling the air with their shouts and with the clanking of their iron armor as the horses galloped furiously along  at length they reached the gates of the town and the whole throng of horsemen pursuers and pursued pressed in together the french succeeded in reaching the castle and as soon as they got in they shut the gates and secured themselves there but the english got possession of the town as soon as edward came in he sent a summons to the people in the castle to surrender they refused edward then ordered his men to prepare for an assault on the following day  accordingly on the following day the assault was made the battle was continued all day but without success on the part of the assailants and when the evening came on edward was obliged to call off his men  illustration storming of the castle of romorantin  the next morning at a very early hour the men were called to arms again a new assaulting force was organized and at sunrise the trumpet sounded the order for them to advance to the attack prince edward himself took the command at this trial and by his presence and his example incited the men to make the greatest possible efforts to batter down the gates and to scale the walls edward was excited to a high degree of resentment and rage against the garrison of the castle not only on account of the general obstinacy of their resistance but because on the preceding day a squire who was attendant upon him and to whom he was strongly attached was killed at his side by a stone hurled from the castle wall when he saw this man fall he took a solemn oath that he would never leave the place until he had the castle and all that were in it in his power  but notwithstanding all the efforts of his soldiers the castle still held out edwards troops thronged the margin of the ditch and shot arrows so incessantly at the battlements that the garrison could scarcely show themselves for an instant on the walls finally they made hurdles and floats of various kinds by means of which large numbers succeeded half by swimming and half by floating to get across the ditch and then began to dig in under the wall while the garrison attempted to stop their work by throwing down big stones upon their heads and pots of hot lime to eat out their eyes  at another part the besiegers constructed great engines such as were used in those days in the absence of cannon for throwing rocks and heavy beams of wood to batter the walls these machines also threw a certain extraordinary combustible substance called greek fire it was this greek fire that in the end turned the scale of victory for it caught in the lower court of the castle where it burned so furiously that it baffled all the efforts of the besieged to extinguish it and at length they were compelled to surrender edward made the principal commanders prisoners but he let the others go free the castle itself he utterly destroyed  having thus finished this work edward resumed his march passing on to the westward through touraine to avoid the french king who he knew was coming down upon him from the direction of chartres at the head of an overwhelming army king john advanced to the loire and sending different detachments of his army to different points with orders to cross at any bridges that they could find he himself came to blois where he crossed the river to amboise and thence proceeded to loches here he learned that the english were moving off to the westward through touraine in hopes to make their escape he set off after them at full speed  he had four sons with him in his army all young men their names were charles louis john and philip  at length the two armies began to approach each other near the town of poictiers  in the mean time while the crisis had thus been gradually approaching the pope who was at this time residing at avignon in france sent one of his cardinals to act as intercessor between the belligerents in hopes of bringing them to a peace at the time when the two armies had drawn near to each other and the battle seemed imminent the cardinal was at poictiers and just as the king of france was marshaling his troops in the order of battle and preparing for the onset the cardinal at the head of his suite of attendants galloped out to the kings camp and riding up to him at full speed he begged him to pause a moment that he might speak to him  the king gave him leave to speak and he thus began  most dear sire said he you have here with you a great and powerful army commanded by the flower of the knighthood of your whole kingdom the english compared with you are but a handful they are wholly unable to resist you you can make whatever terms with them you please and it will be far more honorable and praiseworthy in you to spare their lives and the lives of your gallant followers by making peace with them on such terms as you may think right without a battle than to fight with them and destroy them i entreat you therefore sire that before you proceed any farther you will allow me to go to the english camp to represent to the prince the great danger he is in and to see what terms you can make with him  very well replied the king we have no objection go but make haste back again  the cardinal immediately set off and rode with all speed into the english camp the english troops had posted themselves at a spot where they were in a great measure concealed and protected among hedges vineyards and groves the cardinal advanced through a narrow lane and came up to the english prince at last whom he found in a vineyard the prince was on foot and was surrounded by knights and armed men with whom he was arranging the plan of the battle  the prince received the cardinal very graciously and heard what he had to say the cardinal represented to him how overwhelming was the force which the king of france had brought against him and how imminent the danger was that he and all his forces would be totally destroyed in case of a conflict and urged him for the sake of humanity as well as from a proper regard for his own interest to enter into negotiations for peace  prince edward replied that he had no objection to enter into such negotiations and that he was willing to accept of terms of peace provided his own honor and that of his army were saved  the cardinal then returned to the king of france and reported to him what the prince had said and he entreated the king to grant a truce until the next morning in order to afford time for the negotiations  the knights and barons that were around the king were very unwilling that he should listen to this proposal they were fierce for the battle and could not brook the idea of delay but the cardinal was so urgent and he pleaded so strongly and so eloquently for peace that finally the king yielded  but we will not leave our posts said he we will remain on the ground ready for the onset tomorrow morning unless our terms are accepted before that time  so they brought the royal tent which was a magnificent pavilion of red silk and pitched it on the field for the king the army were dismissed to their quarters until the following day  the time when this took place was early in the morning the day was sunday during all the rest of the day the cardinal was employed in riding back and forth between the two armies conveying proposals and counterproposals and doing all in his power to effect an arrangement but all his efforts were unsuccessful king john demanded that four of the principal persons in edwards army should be given up unconditionally to his will and that the whole army should surrender themselves as prisoners of war this prince edward would not consent to he was willing he said to give up all the french prisoners that he had in custody and also to restore all the castles and towns which he had taken from the french he was also willing to bind himself for seven years not to take up arms against the king of france but all this did not satisfy john he finally offered that if the prince would surrender himself and one hundred knights as prisoners of war he would let the rest of the army go free and declared that that was his ultimatum prince edward positively refused to accept any such conditions and so the cardinal greatly disappointed at the failure of his efforts gave up the case as hopeless and returned with a sad and sorrowful heart to poictiers  an anecdote is related in this connection by one of the ancient chroniclers which illustrates curiously some of the ideas and manners of those times during the course of the day while the truce was in force and the cardinal was going back and forth between the two armies parties of knights belonging to the two encampments rode out from time to time from their own quarters along the lines of the enemy to see what was to be seen in these cases they sometimes met each other and held conversation together both parties being bound in honor by the truce not to commit any act of hostility there was a certain english knight named sir john chandos who in this way met a french knight named clermont both these knights were mounted and fully armed it was the custom in those days for each knight to have something peculiar in the style of his armor to distinguish him from the rest and it was particularly the usage for each one to have a certain device and motto on his shield or on some other conspicuous position of his clothing these devices and mottoes are the origin of the coats of arms in use at the present day  it happened that the device of these two knights was nearly the same it consisted of a representation of the virgin mary embroidered in blue and surrounded by a radiance of sunbeams clermont on perceiving that the device of chandos was so similar to his own called out to him when he came near demanding  how long is it sir since you have taken the liberty to wear my arms  it is you yourself who are wearing mine said chandos  it is false replied clermont and if it were not for the truce i would soon show you to whom that device rightfully belongs  very well replied chandos tomorrow when the truce is over you will find me on the field ready to settle the question with you by force of arms  with that the angry noblemen parted and each rode back to his own lines  early on monday morning both armies prepared for battle the cardinal however being extremely unwilling to give up all hope of preventing the conflict came out again at a very early hour to the french camp and made an effort to renew the negotiations but the king peremptorily refused to listen to him and ordered him to be gone he would not listen he said to any more pretended treaties or pacifications so the cardinal perceived that he must go away and leave the armies to their fate he called at prince edwards camp and bade him farewell saying that he had done all in his power to save him but it was of no avail he then returned to poictiers  the two armies now prepared for battle the king of france clothed himself in his royal armor and nineteen of his knights were armed in the same manner in order to prevent the enemy from being able to single out the king on the field this was a common stratagem employed on such occasions the english were strongly posted on a hill side among vineyards and groves the approach to their position was through a sort of lane bordered by hedges the english archers were posted along these hedges and when the french troops attempted to advance the archers poured such a shower of barbed arrows into the horses sides that they soon threw them into confusion the barbed arrows could not be withdrawn and the horses terrified with the stinging pain would rear and plunge and turn round upon those behind them until at length the lane was filled with horses and horsemen piled together in confusion now when once a scene of confusion like this occurred upon a field of battle it was almost impossible to recover from it for the iron armor which these knights wore was so heavy and so cumbersome that when once they were unhorsed they could not mount again and sometimes could not even rise but writhed and struggled helplessly on the ground until their squires came to relieve them  the battle raged for many hours but contrary to the universal expectation the english were every where victorious whether this was owing to the superior discipline of the english troops or to the reckless desperation with which their situation inspired them or to the compact disposition that the prince had made of his forces or to the shelter and protection afforded by the trees and hedges and vines among which they were posted or to the superior talents of the black prince as a commanding officer or to all these causes combined it is impossible to say the result was however that the french were every where overcome thrown into confusion and put to flight three of the french kings sons were led off early from the field their attendants excusing their flight by their anxiety to save the princes from being taken prisoners or put to death a large squadron were driven off on the road to poictiers the inhabitants of poictiers seeing them coming shut the gates to keep them out and the horsemen pursuers and pursued became jammed together in a confused mass at the gates and on the causeway leading to them where they trampled upon and killed each other by hundreds in every other direction too detached portions of the two armies were engaged in desperate conflicts and the air was filled with the clangor of arms the notes of the trumpets the shouts of the victors and the shrieks and groans of the wounded and dying  at length sir john chandos who had fought in company with prince edward all the day advanced to the prince and announced to him that he thought the battle was over  victory said he victory the enemy is beaten and driven wholly off the ground it is time to halt and to call in our men they are getting greatly scattered i have taken a survey of the ground and i do not see any where any french banners flying or any considerable bodies of french troops remaining the whole army is dispersed  so the king gave orders to halt and the trumpets blew the signal for the men to cease from the pursuit of their enemies and to gather again around the princes banner they set up the banner upon a high bush near where the prince was standing and the minstrels gathering around it began to play in honor of the victory while the trumpets in the distance were sounding to recall the men  the officers of the princes household brought the royal tent a beautiful pavilion of crimson silk and pitched it on the spot they brought wine too and other refreshments and as the knights and barons and other noble warriors arrived at the tent the prince offered them refreshments and received their congratulations on the great deliverance which they had achieved a great many prisoners were brought in by the returning knights to be held for ransom  while the knights and nobles were thus rejoicing together around the princes tent the prince asked if any one knew what had become of the king of france no one could answer so the prince dispatched two trusty barons to ride over the field and see if they could learn any tidings of him the barons mounted their horses at the door of the pavilion and rode away they proceeded first to a small hillock which promised to afford a good view when they reached the top of this hillock they saw at some distance a crowd of menatarms coming along together at a certain part of the field they were on foot and were advancing very slowly and there seemed to be some peculiar excitement among them for they were crowding and pushing each other in a remarkable manner the truth was that the men had got the king of france and his youngest son philip in their possession and were attempting to bring them in to the princes tent but were quarreling among themselves as they came along being unable to decide which of them was entitled to the custody of the prisoners the barons immediately put spurs to their horses and galloped down the hill to the spot and demanded what was the matter the people said that it was the king of france and his son who had been made prisoners and that there were no less than ten knights and squires that claimed them these men were wrangling and contending together with so much violence and noise that there was danger that the king and the young prince would be pulled to pieces by them the king in the mean time was entreating them to be quiet and begging them to deal gently with them and take them at once to prince edwards tent  gentlemen gentlemen said he i pray you to desist and conduct me and my son in a courteous manner to my cousin the prince and do not make such a riot about us there will be ransom enough for you all  the contending knights and barons however paid little heed to these words but went on vociferating it is i that took him  i tell you he is my prisoner  no no we took him let him alone he belongs to us  the two barons pressed their horses forward into the midst of the crowd and drove the knights back they ordered them all in the name of the prince to let go the prisoners and retire and they threatened to cut down on the spot any man who refused to obey the barons then dismounted and making a profound reverence before the king they took him and his son under their protection and conducted them to the princes tent  the prince received the royal prisoners in the kindest and most respectful manner he made a very low obeisance to the king and treated him in every respect with the utmost consideration he provided him with every thing necessary for his comfort and ordered refreshments to be brought which refreshments he presented to the king himself as if he were an honored and distinguished guest instead of a helpless prisoner  although there were so many english knights and barons who claimed the honor of having made the king of france prisoner the person to whom he really had surrendered was a french knight named denys denys had formerly lived in france but he had killed a man in a quarrel there and for this crime his property had been confiscated and he had been banished from the realm he had then gone to england where he had entered into the service of the king and finally had joined the expedition of the prince of wales this denys happened to be in the part of the field where the king of france and his son philip were engaged the king was desperately beset by his foes who were calling upon him all around in english to surrender they did not wish to kill him preferring to take him prisoner for the sake of the ransom the king was not willing to surrender to any person of inferior rank so he continued the struggle though almost overpowered just then denys came up and calling out to him in french advised him to surrender the king was much pleased to hear the sound of his own language and he called out  to whom shall i surrender who are you  i am a french knight said denys i was banished from france and i now serve the english prince surrender to me  where is the prince said the king if i could see him i would speak to him  he is not here said denys but you had better surrender to me and i will take you immediately to the part of the field where he is  so the king drew off his gauntlet and gave it to denys as a token that he surrendered to him but all the english knights who were present crowded around and claimed the prisoner as theirs denys attempted to conduct the king to prince edward all the knights accompanying him and struggling to get possession of the prisoner by the way it was while the contention between denys and these his competitors was going on that the two barons rode up and rescued the king and his son from the danger they were in                                       that night prince edward made a sumptuous supper for the king and his son the tables were spread in the princes pavilion the greater part of the french knights and barons who had been taken prisoners were invited to this banquet the king and his son with a few french nobles of high rank were placed at an elevated table superbly appointed and arranged there were side tables set for the squires and knights of lower degree prince edward instead of seating himself at the table with the king took his place as an attendant and served the king while he ate notwithstanding all the entreaties of the king that he would not do so he said that he was not worthy to sit at the table of so great a king and of so valiant a man as the king had shown himself to be that day  in a word in all his demeanor toward the king instead of triumphing over him and boasting of the victory which he had achieved he did every thing in his power to soothe and assuage the fallen monarchs sorrow and to diminish his chagrin  you must not allow yourself to be dejected sire said he because the fortune of war has turned against you this day by the manner in which you acquitted yourself on the field you have gained imperishable renown and though in the decision of divine providence the battle has gone against you for the moment you have nothing personally to fear either for yourself or for your son you may rely with perfect confidence upon receiving the most honorable treatment from my father i am sure that he will show you every attention in his power and that he will arrange for your ransom in so liberal and generous a spirit that you and he will henceforth become warm and constant friends  this kind and respectful treatment of his prisoners made a very strong impression upon the minds of all the french knights and nobles and they were warm in their praises of the magnanimity of their victorious enemy he treated these knights themselves too in the same generous manner he liberated a large number of them on their simple promise that they would send him the sums which he named respectively for their ransoms  although edward was thus on the whole victorious in this battle still many of the english knights were killed and quite a number were taken prisoners and carried off by the french to be held for ransom one of these prisoners a scotch knight named douglas made his escape after his capture in a very singular manner he was standing in his armor among his captors late in the evening at a place at some distance from the field where the french had taken him and some other prisoners for safety and the french were about to take off his armor which from its magnificence led them to suppose that he was a person of high rank and importance as he really was and that a grand ransom could be obtained for him when another scotch knight named ramsay suddenly fixing his eyes upon him pretended to be in a great rage and advancing toward him exclaimed  you miserable wretch how comes it that you dare to deck yourself out in this way in your masters armor you have murdered and robbed him i suppose come here and pull off my boots  douglas understood at once ramsays design and so with pretended tremblings and looks of guilt and fear he came to ramsay and pulled off one of his boots ramsay took up the boot and struck douglas upon the head with it the other english prisoners wondering asked ramsay what he meant  that is lord douglas said they  lord douglas repeated ramsay in a tone of contempt no such thing it is his servant he has killed his master i suppose and stolen his armor then turning to douglas and brandishing the boot over him again he cried out  off with you you villain go and look over the field and find your masters body and when you have found it come back and tell me that i may at least give him a decent burial  so saying he took out forty shillings and gave the money to the frenchmen as the ransom of the pretended servant and then drove douglas off beating him with the boot and saying  away with you begone  douglas bore this all very patiently and went away with the air of a detected impostor and soon got back safely to the english camp                                       after the battle of poictiers prince edward moved on toward the westward with his army taking with him his royal prisoners and stopping at all the large towns on his way to celebrate his victory with feastings and rejoicings at last he reached bordeaux on the coast and from bordeaux in due time he set sail with his prisoners for london in the mean time news of the victory and of the coming of the king of france as prisoner to england had reached london and great preparations were made there for the reception of the prince the prince took a fleet of ships and a large force of armed men with him on the voyage being afraid that the french would attempt to intercept him and rescue the prisoners the king of france and his suite had a ship to themselves the fleet landed at a place called sandwich on the southern coast of england and then the cortége of the prince proceeded by slow journeys to london  the party was received at the capital with great pomp and parade besides the cavalcades of nobles knights and barons which came out to meet them all the different trades and companies of london appeared in their respective uniforms with flags and banners and with the various emblems and insignia of their several crafts all london flocked into the streets to see the show  one would have supposed however from the arrangements which prince edward made in entering the city that the person whom all this pomp and parade was intended to honor was not himself but the king his captive for instead of riding at the head of the procession in triumph with the king of france and his son following as captives in his train he gave the king the place of honor while he himself took the station of one of his attendants the king was mounted on a white charger very splendidly caparisoned while prince edward rode a small black horse by his side the procession moved in this way through the principal streets of the city to a palace on the banks of the river at the west end which had been fitted up in the most complete and sumptuous manner for the kings reception soon after this the king of england prince edwards father came to pay his captive cousin a visit and though he retained him as a captive he treated him in other respects with every mark of consideration and honor  the king of france and his son remained captives in england for some time the king and the queen treated them with great consideration they often visited king john at his palace and they invited him to the most sumptuous entertainments and celebrations made expressly to do him honor  in the mean time the war between england and france still went on many battles were fought and many towns and castles were besieged and taken but after all no great progress was made on either side and at length when both parties had become wearied and exhausted in the struggle a peace was concluded and king john having paid a suitable ransom for himself and for those who were with him was allowed to return home he had been in captivity for about five years                                       the conduct of prince edward at the battles of crecy and of poictiers in both which contests the english fought against an immense superiority of numbers and the great eclat of such an achievement as capturing the french king and conducting him a prisoner to london joined to the noble generosity which he displayed in his treatment of his prisoners made his name celebrated throughout the world every body was sounding the praises of the black prince the heir apparent to the english throne and anticipating the greatness and glory to which england would attain when he should become king  this was an event which might occur at any time for king edward his father was drawing gradually into the later years of life and he himself was now nearly forty years of age     chapter v  childhood of richard  ad 13661370

at seapleasant and prosperous voyageportrait of edward iiirichards first entrance into england   the child of edward the black prince who afterward became richard the second king of england was born at bordeaux in the southwestern part of france in the year 1367 in the midst of a scene of great military bustle and excitement the circumstances were these  when peace was finally made between england and france after the wars described in the last chapter were over one of the results of the treaty which was made was that certain provinces in the southwestern part of france were ceded to england and formed into a principality called aquitaine and this principality was placed under the dominion of the black prince the title of the prince was thenceforth not only prince of wales but also prince of aquitaine the city of bordeaux near the mouth of the garonne as shown by the mape was the chief city of aquitaine there the prince established his court and reigned as it were for several years in great splendor the fame which he had acquired attracted to his court a great number of knights and nobles from all lands and whenever a great personage had any wrongs real or imaginary to be redressed or any political end to gain which required the force of arms he was very likely to come to the prince of aquitaine in order if possible to secure his aid prince edward was rather pleased than otherwise with these applications for he loved war much better than peace and though he evinced a great deal of moderation and generosity in his conduct in the treatment of his vanquished enemies he was none the less really excited and pleased with the glory and renown which his victories gained him  footnote e see map on page 110  about six months before richard was born while edward was living with the princess his wife in bordeaux he received an application for aid from a certain don pedro who claimed to be king of navarre in spain but who had been expelled from his kingdom by his brother there was also a certain james who claimed to be the king of majorca a large island in the mediterranean sea who was in much the same situation in respect to his kingdom prince edward promised to aid don pedro in recovering his throne and he forthwith began to make preparations to this end he also promised james that as soon as he had accomplished the work which he had undertaken for don pedro he would fit out an expedition to majorca and so restore him too to his kingdom  the preparations which he made for the expedition into spain were prosecuted in a very vigorous manner don pedro was destitute of means as well as of men and edward was obliged to raise a large sum of money for the provisioning and paying of his troops his vassals the nobles and barons of his principality were obliged to furnish the men it being the custom in those times that each vassal should bring to his lord in case of war as many soldiers as could be spared from among his own tenants and retainerssome fifty some one hundred and some two hundred or even more according to the extent and populousness of their estates one of the nobles in prince edwards service named lord dalbret had offered to bring a thousand men the prince had asked him on some public occasion in presence of other knights and noblemen how many men he could furnish for the expedition  my lord replied lord dalbret if you really wish for all the strength that i can furnish i can bring you a thousand lances and still have enough at home to guard the country  the prince was surprised at this answer he did not know it seems how powerful the barons of his principality were  by my head said he addressing lord dalbret and speaking in french which was of course the language of aquitaine that will be very handsome  he then turned to some english nobles who were near and speaking in english said it was worth while to rule in a country where one baron could attend his lord with a thousand lances he was ashamed not to accept this offer for according to the ideas of these times it would not be at all consistent with what was expected of a prince that he should not be able to maintain and pay as many troops as his barons could bring him so he said hastily turning to dalbret that he engaged them all  although in the end don pedro if he succeeded in regaining his kingdom was to refund the expenses of the war yet in the first instance it was necessary for the prince to raise the money and he soon found that it would be very difficult for him to raise enough he was unwilling to tax too heavily the subjects of his principality and so after collecting as much as he thought prudent in that way he sent to england to his father explaining the nature and design of the proposed expedition and soliciting his fathers approval of it and at the same time asking for aid in the way of funds king edward replied cordially approving of the enterprise he also promised to send on the princes brother john with a body of troops to accompany the expedition this john was the one who has already been mentioned as born in ghent and who was called on that account john of gaunt he was also duke of lancaster and is often designated by that name edward was very much attached to his brother john and was very much pleased to hear that he was coming to join him  the king of england also edwards father made arrangements for sending to his son a large sum of money this was of great assistance to him but still he had not money enough so he broke up his plate both gold and silver and caused it to be coined in order to assist in filling his treasury still notwithstanding all that he could do he found it difficult to provide sufficient funds for the purchase of the provisions that he required and for the pay of the men  it was rather late in the season when the prince first formed the plan of this expedition he was very anxious to set out as soon as possible for he had the pyrenees to cross in order to pass from france into spain and it would be impossible he knew to conduct an army over the mountains after the winter should set in so he hastened his preparations as much as possible he was kept in a continued fever by his impatience and by the various delays and disappointments which were constantly occurring in the mean while time moved on and it began at length to be doubtful whether he should be ready to march before the winter should set in  to add to his perplexity his wife begged him to postpone his departure till the spring in order that he might remain at home with her until after their child should be born she was dejected in spirits and seemed particularly sad and sorrowful at the thought of her husbands going away to leave her at such a time she knew too the undaunted recklessness with which he was accustomed to expose himself to danger in his campaigns and if he went away she could not but think that it was uncertain whether he would ever return  finally the prince concluded to put off his departure until spring this determination however in some sense increased his perplexities for now he had a large proportion of his force to maintain and pay through the winter this made it necessary that he should curtail his plans in some degree and among other things he resolved to notify the baron dalbret not to bring his whole complement of one thousand men it was a great humiliation to him to do this after having formally agreed to engage the men but he felt compelled by the necessity of the case to do so and he accordingly wrote to the baron the following letter       my lord dalbret       whereas out of our liberal bounty we have retained you      with a thousand lances to serve under us in the expedition      which through the grace of god we intend speedily to      undertake and briefly to finish having duly considered the      business and the costs and expenses we are at we have      resolved that several of our vassals should remain at home      in order to guard the territories for these causes it has      been determined in our council that you shall serve in this      expedition with two hundred lances only you will choose the      two hundred out from the rest and the remainder you will      leave at home to follow their usual occupations       may god have you under his holy protection       given at bordeaux the eighth day of december                           edward  this letter was sealed with the great seal of the prince and sent to dalbret who was in his own country busily engaged in assembling and equipping his men and making the other necessary preparations the baron was exceedingly indignant when he received the letter in those days every man that was capable of bearing arms liked much better to be taken into the service of some prince or potentate going to war than to remain at home to cultivate the ground in quiet industry dalbret knew therefore very well that his vassals and retainers would be all greatly disappointed to learn that four fifths of their whole number were after all to remain at home and then besides this his own importance in the campaign would be greatly diminished by reducing the force under his command from one thousand to two hundred men he was extremely angry when he read the letter  how is this he exclaimed my lord the prince of wales trifles with me when he orders me to disband eight hundred knights and squires whom by his command i have retained and have diverted from other means of obtaining profit and honor then he called for a secretary and said to him in a rage  write what i shall dictate to you  the secretary wrote as follows from his masters dictation       my dear lord       i am marvelously surprised at the contents of the letter      which you have sent me i do not know and can not imagine      what answer i can make your present orders will do me a      great injury and subject me to much blame for all the      menatarms whom i have retained by your command have      already made their preparations for entering your service      and were only waiting your orders to march by retaining      them for your service i have prevented them from seeking      honor and profit elsewhere some of the knights had actually      made engagements to go beyond sea to jerusalem to      constantinople or to russia in order to advance      themselves and now having relinquished these advantageous      prospects in order to join your enterprise they will be      extremely displeased if they are left behind i am myself      equally displeased and i can not conceive what i have done      to deserve such treatment and i beg you to understand my      lord that i can not be separated from my men nor will they      consent to be separated from each other i am convinced      that if i dismiss any of them they will all go  the baron added other words of the same tenor and then signing and sealing the letter sent it to the prince the prince was angry in his turn when he received this letter  by my faith said he this man dalbret is altogether too great a man for my country when he seeks thus to disobey an order from my council but let him go where he pleases we will perform this expedition if it please god without any of his thousand lances  this case presents a specimen of the perplexities and troubles in which the prince was involved during the winter while organizing his expedition and preparing to set out in the spring the want of money was the great difficulty for there was no lack of men don pedro agreed it is true that when he recovered his kingdom he would pay back the advances which edward had to make but he was so unprincipled a man that edward knew very well that he could not trust to his promises unless he gave some security so don pedro agreed to leave his three daughters in edwards hands as hostages to secure the payment of the money  the names of the three princesses thus pledged as collateral security for money borrowed were beatrice constance and isabel  at length on the third day of april the child was born the princess was in a monastery at the time called the monastery of st andrew whither she had retired for privacy and quiet immediately after the event prince edward having made every thing ready before gave orders that the expedition should set forward on the road to spain he himself was to follow as soon as the baptism of the child should be performed the day on which the child was born was wednesday and friday was fixed for the baptism the baptism took place at noon at a stone font in the church of the monastery the king of majorca whom the prince had promised to restore to his kingdom was one of the godfathers the child was named richard  on the sunday following the prince bade his wife and the little infant farewell and set out from bordeaux with great pomp at the head of an immense cavalcade and went on to join the expedition which was already on its way to spain  illustration richard receiving the visit of his uncle john  the birth of richard was an event of great importance for he was not only the son of the prince of aquitaine but he was the grandson of the king of england and of course every one knew that he might one day be the king of england himself still the probability was not very great that this would happen at least for a long period to come for though his father prince edward was the oldest son of the king of england he himself was not the oldest son of his father he had a brother who was some years older than himself and of course there were three lives that must be terminated before his turn should come to reign in englandhis grandfathers his fathers and his brothers  it happened that all these three lives were terminated in a comparatively brief period so that richard really became king of england before he grew up to be a man  the first important occurrence which took place at the monastery at bordeaux where little richard remained with his mother after his father had gone was the arrival of his uncle john that is john of gaunt the duke of lancaster who was on his way from england at the head of an army to accompany his brother into spain john stopped at bordeaux to see the princess and the infant child he was very joyfully received by the princess and by all the ladies in attendance upon her the princess was very fond of her brother and she was much pleased that he was going to join her husband in the war in spain besides he brought her late and full news from england the duke however did not remain long at bordeaux but after a brief visit to his sister he put himself again at the head of his troops and hurried forward to overtake the prince who was already far on his way toward the pyrenees and spain  little richard remained in bordeaux for three or four years during this time he had his brother for a playmate but he saw little of his father it was some time before his father returned from spain and when he did return he came home much depressed in spirits and harassed and vexed with many cares he had succeeded it is true in conquering don pedros enemies and in placing don pedro himself again upon the throne but he had failed in getting back the money that he had expended don pedro could not or would not repay him what prince edward did with the three daughters of the king that had been left with him as hostages i do not know at any rate he could not pay his debts with them or raise money by means of them to silence his clamorous troops he attempted to lay fresh taxes upon the people of aquitaine this awakened a great deal of discontent the barons who had had disagreements of any sort with edward before took advantage of this discontent to form plots against him and at last several of them dalbret among the rest whom he had mortally offended by countermanding his orders for the thousand men combined together and sent to the king of france complaining of the oppressions which they suffered under edwards rule and inviting him to come and help them free themselves the king at once determined that he would do this  this king of france was however not king john whom edward had made prisoner and sent to london king john had died and the crown had descended to his successor charles the fifth  king charles determined first to send two commissioners to summon the prince of aquitaine into his presence to give an account of himself he did this under the pretext that aquitaine was part of france and that consequently prince edward was in some sense under his jurisdiction  the two commissioners with their attendants left paris and set out on their journey to bordeaux people traveled very slowly in those days and the commissioners were a long time on the way at length however they reached bordeaux they arrived late in the evening and took up their quarters at an inn the next day they repaired to the monastery where the prince was residing  they informed the attendants who received them at the monastery that they had been sent by the king of france with a message to the prince the attendants who were officers of the princes court informed the prince of the arrival of the strangers and he ordered them to be brought into his presence  the commissioners on being brought before the prince bowed very low in token of reverence and presented their credentials the prince after reading the credentials and examining the seals of the king of france by which they were authenticated said to the commissioners  it is very well these papers show that you are duly commissioned embassadors from the king of france you are welcome to our court and you can now proceed to communicate the message with which you have been charged  of the two commissioners one was a lawyer and the other a knight the knight bore the singular name of caponnel de caponnal the lawyer of course was the principal speaker at the interview with the prince and when the prince called for the communication which had been sent from the king of france he drew forth a paper which he said contained what the king of france had to say and which he added they the commissioners had promised faithfully to read in the princes presence  the prince wondering greatly what the paper could contain ordered the lawyer to proceed with the reading of it  the lawyer read as follows       charles by the grace of god king of france to our nephew      the prince of wales and aquitaine health       whereas several prelates barons knights universities      fraternities and colleges of the country and district of      gascony residing and inhabiting upon the borders of our      realm together with many others from the country and duchy      of aquitaine have come before us in our court to claim      justice for certain grievances and unjust oppressions which      you through weak counsel and foolish advice have been      induced to do them and at which we are much astonished       therefore in order to obviate and remedy such things we      do take cognizance of their cause insomuch that we of our      royal majesty and sovereignty order and command you to      appear in our city of paris in person and that you show and      present yourself before us in our chamber of paris to hear      judgment pronounced upon the aforesaid complaints and      grievances done by you to our subjects who claim to be      heard and to have the jurisdiction of our court       let there be no delay in obeying this summons but set out      as speedily as possible after having heard this order read       in witness whereof we have affixed our seal to these      presents       given at paris the twentyfifth day of january 1369                           charles r  on hearing this letter read the prince was filled with astonishment and indignation he paused a moment with his eyes fixed upon the commissioners as if not knowing what to reply at length with an expression of bitter irony upon his countenance he said  we shall willingly appear at the appointed day at paris since the king of france sends for us but it will be with our helmet on our head and accompanied by sixty thousand men  the commissioners seeing how much the prince was displeased began immediately to entreat him not to be angry with them as the bearers of the message  oh no said the prince i am not in the least angry with you but only with those that sent you hither your master the king of france has been exceedingly ill advised in thus pretending to claim jurisdiction over our dominion of aquitaine and in taking the part of our discontented subjects against us their rightful sovereign when he surrendered the provinces to the king of england my father as he did by solemn treaty he relinquished forever all jurisdiction over them and in the exercise of my government i acknowledge no superior except my father tell the king of france that is what i claim and will maintain it shall cost a hundred thousand lives before it shall be otherwise  having spoken these words in a calm and quiet but very resolute and determined tone the prince walked off out of the apartment leaving the commissioners in a great state of astonishment and alarm they seemed to know not what to do  some of the courtiers came to them and advised them to withdraw it is useless said they for you to attempt any thing more you have delivered your message faithfully and the prince has given his answer it is the only answer that he will give you may depend and you may as well return with it to the king  so the messengers went back to the inn and on the evening of the same day they set out on their return to paris in the mean time prince edward continued to feel extremely indignant at the message which he had received the more he reflected upon it indeed the more angry he became he felt as if he had been insulted in having had such a summons from a foreign potentate served upon him by a lawyer in his own house the knights and barons around him sharing his anger proposed that they should pursue and seize the commissioners with a view of punishing them for their audacity in bringing such a message at first the prince was unwilling to consent to this as the persons of embassadors and messengers of all sorts sent from one sovereign to another were in those days as now considered sacred at last however he said that he thought the men were hardly to be considered as the messengers of the king of france  they are virtually said he the messengers of dalbret and the other factious and rebellious barons among our own subjects who complained to the king of france and incited him to interfere in our affairs and as such i should not be sorry to have them taken and punished  this was sufficient the knights who heard it immediately sent off a small troop of horsemen who overtook the commissioners before they reached the frontier in order not to compromise the prince they said nothing about having been sent by him but arrested the men on a charge of having taken a horse which did not belong to them from the inn under pretense of investigating this charge they took the men to a neighboring town and shut them up in a castle there  some of the attendants of the commissioners who had come with them from france made their escape and returning to paris they reported to the king of france all that had occurred it now came his turn to be angry and both parties began to prepare for war  the king of england took sides with his son and so was drawn at once into the quarrel various military expeditions were fitted out on both sides provinces were ravaged and towns and castles were stormed the prince of wales was overwhelmed with the troubles and perplexities which surrounded him his people were discontented his finances were low and the fortune of war often turned against him his health too began to fail him and he sank into a state of great dejection and despondency to complete the sum of his misfortunes his oldest son richards brother fell sick and died this was a fortunate event for richard for it advanced him to the position of the oldest surviving son and made him thus his fathers heir it brought him too one step nearer to the english throne richard was however at this time only four years old and thus was too young to understand these things and probably sympathizing with his father and mother he mourned his brothers death the parents at any rate were exceedingly grieved at the loss of their firstborn child and the despondency of the prince was greatly increased by the event  at last the physicians and counselors of edward advised that he should leave his principality for a time and repair to england they hoped that by the change of scene and air he might recover his spirits and perhaps regain his health the prince resolved on following this advice so he made arrangements for leaving his principality under the government and care of his brother john of gaunt and then ordered a vessel to be made ready at bordeaux to convey himself the princess and richard to england  when every thing was ready for his departure he convened an assembly of all the barons and knights of his dominions in a hall of audience at bordeaux and there solemnly committed the charge of the principality to his brother john in the presence of them all  he said in the speech that he made to them on that occasion that during all the time that he had been their prince he had always maintained them in peace prosperity and power so far as depended on him against all their enemies and that now in the hope of recovering his health which was greatly impaired he intended to return to england he therefore earnestly besought them to place confidence in and faithfully serve and obey his brother the duke of lancaster as they had hitherto served and obeyed him  the barons all solemnly promised to obey these injunctions and they took the oath of fealty and homage to the duke they then bid the prince farewell and he soon afterward embarked on board the ship with his wife and son and set sail for england  the fleet which accompanied the prince on the voyage as convoy to the princes ship contained five hundred menatarms and a large body of archers besides this force was intended to guard against the danger of being intercepted by the french on the way the prince and the princess must of course have felt some solicitude on this account but richard being yet only four years old was too young to concern himself with any such fears so he played about the ship during the voyage untroubled by the anxieties and cares which weighed upon the spirits of his father and mother  the voyage was a very prosperous one the weather was pleasant and the wind was fair and after a few days sail the fleet arrived safely at southampton the king with his family and suite disembarked they remained two days at southampton to refresh themselves after the voyage and to allow the prince who seemed to be growing worse rather than better a little time to gather strength for the journey to london when the time arrived for setting out he was found too ill to travel by any of the ordinary modes and so they placed him upon a litter and in this way the party set out for windsor castle  the party traveled by easy stages and at length arrived at the castle here richard for the first time saw his grandfather edward the third king of england they were all very kindly received by him after remaining a short time at windsor castle the prince with his wife and richard and the knights and barons and other attendants who had come with him from aquitaine proceeded to a place called birkhamstead about twenty miles from london and there took up his abode  illustration portrait of edward the third richards grandfather  and thus it was that richard for the first time entered the country which had been the land of his ancestors for so long a time and over which he was himself so soon to reign     chapter vi  accession to the throne  ad 1376  john of gaunthis thoughts in respect to the kingdomlaws of

courtthe whole difficulty amicably settled   young richard lived in comparative retirement with his mother for about six years after his return to england his fathers sickness continued indeed the prince was so feeble in body and so dejected and desponding in mind that he was wellnigh incapable of taking any part in public affairs his brother john of gaunt duke of lancaster remained for some time in aquitaine and was engaged in continual wars with france but at length he too returned to england he was a man of great energy of character and of great ambition and he began to revolve the question in his mind whether in case his brother the prince of wales should die the inheritance of the kingdom of england should fall to him or to richard the son of his brother  my brother edward is older than i he said to himself and if he should live till after our father the king dies then i grant that he should succeed to the throne but if he dies before the king then it is better that i should succeed to the throne for his son richard is but a child and is wholly unfit to reign besides if the oldest son of a king is dead it is more reasonable that the next oldest should succeed him rather than that the crown should go down to the children of the one who has died  the laws of succession were not absolutely settled in those days so that in doubtful cases it was not uncommon for the king himself or the parliament or the king and parliament together to select from among different claimants during the lifetime of the king the one whom they wished to succeed to the crown  all were agreed however in this casethe king the parliament and the people of the countrythat if edward should survive his father he was the rightful heir he was a universal favorite and people had been long anticipating a period of great prosperity and glory for the kingdom of england when he should be king  in the mean time however his health grew worse and worse and at length in 1376 he died his death produced a great sensation provision was made for a very magnificent funeral the prince died at westminster which was then a mile or two west from london though now london has become so extended that westminster forms the west end of the town it was determined to bury the prince in the cathedral at canterbury canterbury is in the southeastern part of england and was then as now the residence of the archbishop and the religious metropolis so to speak of the kingdom when the day of the funeral arrived an immense cavalcade and procession was formed at westminster all the nobles of the court and the members of parliament joined in the train as mourners and followed the body through the city the body was placed on a magnificent hearse which was drawn by twelve horses immense throngs of people crowded the streets and the windows to see the procession go by after passing through the city the hearse attended by the proper escort took the road to canterbury and there the body of the prince was interred a monument was erected over the tomb upon which was placed an effigy of the prince dressed in the armor in which the illustrious wearer had gained so many victories and acquired such lasting renown  illustration edward the black princethis engraving represents the effigy of the black prince as now seen upon his monument on the north side of the cathedral at canterbury  the king of france although the prince had been one of his most implacable enemies all his life and had been engaged in incessant wars against him caused funeral solemnities to be celebrated in paris on the occasion of his death  the ceremonies were performed with great magnificence in the chapel of the royal palace and all the barons knights and nobles of the court attended in grand costume and joined in rendering honor to the memory of their departed foe  it was about midsummer when richards father died richards uncle john of gaunt duke of lancaster was in london and he had a large party in his favor though generally he was very unpopular in england he had not yet openly claimed the right to inherit the crown nor did any one know positively that he intended to do so in order to prevent if possible any dispute on this question and to anticipate any movements which john might otherwise make to secure the crown to himself the parliament petitioned the king to bring the young prince richard before them that they might publicly receive him and recognize him formally as heir to the crown this the king did richard was dressed in royal robes and conveyed in great state to the hall where parliament was convened of course the spectacle of a boy of ten years old brought in this manner before so august an assembly excited universal attention the young prince was received with great honor a solemn oath of allegiance was taken by all present including the members of the parliament the great officers of state and a number of nobles of high rank including the duke of lancaster himself in this oath the claims of richard to succeed his grandfather as king of england were recognized and those taking the oath bound themselves forever to maintain his rights against all who should ever call them in question  at christmas of that year the king gave a great entertainment to all the lords and nobles of his court at this entertainment he gave prince richard the highest place next to himself putting his uncle john and all his other uncles below him this was to signify that he was now the second person in the kingdom and that his uncles must always henceforth yield precedence to him  the king was now sixtyfive years of age his health was very infirm it was made so in great measure by his mode of life which was scandalous he associated with corrupt men and women who led him into great excesses as the spring of the year came on he grew worse but he would not abandon his evil habits he lived at one of his palaces on the thames a short distance above london near richmond his government fell into great disorder but he did nothing to restrain or correct the evils that occurred in a word he was fast relapsing into utter imbecility  there was a young woman named alice perrers who had for some time been the favorite of the king and had openly lived with him greatly to the displeasure of many of his people she was now with him at his palace the nobles and courtiers who had been in attendance upon the king seeing that he was soon to die began to withdraw from him and leave him to his fate they saw that there was nothing more to be obtained from him and that for their future prospects they must depend on the favor of prince richard or of his uncle john it is true that richards right to the succession had been acknowledged but then he was yet a child and it was supposed that his uncle john being the next oldest son of the king would probably be appointed regent until he should come of age so the courtiers left the dying monarch to his fate and went to court the favor of those who were soon to succeed to his power some went to the palace of the duke of lancaster others proceeded to kennington where the prince and his mother were residing the poor king found himself forsaken of all the world and left to die neglected and alone it is said that alice perrers was the last to leave him and that she only remained after the rest for the sake of a valuable ring which he wore upon his finger and which she wished to get away from him as soon as the dying monarch was too far gone to be conscious of the robbery  the counselors and nobles though they thus forsook the king were not wholly unmindful of the interests of the kingdom they assembled immediately after his death and determined that during richards minority the government should be administered by a council and they selected for this council twelve men from among the highest nobles of the land they determined upon this plan rather than upon a regency because they knew that if a regent were appointed it would be necessary that the duke of lancaster should be the man and they were unwilling to put the power into his hands for fear that he would not surrender it when richard should come of age  besides it would be in his power in case he had been appointed regent to have caused richard to be put to death in some secret way if he chose to do so and then of course the crown would without dispute pass next to him it was not wholly unreasonable to fear this for such crimes had often been committed by rival against rival in the english royal line a man might be in those days a very brave and gallant knight a model in the eyes of all for the unsullied purity of his chivalric honor and yet be ready to poison or starve an uncle or a brother or a nephew without compunction or remorse if their rights or interests conflicted with his own the honor of chivalry was not moral principle or love of justice and right it was mere punctiliousness in respect to certain conventional forms  immediately on the death of the king orders were sent to all the ports in the southern part of england forbidding any ship or boat of any kind from going to sea the object of this was to keep the death of the king a secret from the king of france for fear that he might seize the opportunity for an invasion of england indeed it was known that he was preparing an expedition for this purpose before the king died and it was considered very important that he should not hear of the event until the government should be settled lest he should take advantage of it to hasten his invasion  the making of these arrangements and the funeral ceremonies connected with the interment of the king occupied some days there was also a difficulty between the duke of lancaster and the citizens of london to be settled which for a time threatened to be quite embarrassing the case was this  in all accounts of the reformation in england among the earliest of those who first called in question the supremacy of the pope the name of wickliffe is always mentioned indeed he has been called the morning star of the english reformation as he appeared before it and by the light which beamed from his writings and his deeds announced and ushered its approach he was a collegian of the great university of oxford a very learned man and a great student of ecclesiastical and civil law during the reign of edward richards grandfather who had now just died there had been some disputes between him and the pope in relation to their respective rights and powers within the realm of england this is not the place to explain the particulars of the dispute it is enough here to say that there were two parties formed in england some taking sides with the church and others with the king the bishops and clergy of course belonged to the former class and many of the high nobility to the latter at length after various angry discussions the pope issued a bull addressed to the archbishop of canterbury and to the bishop of london two of the highest ecclesiastical dignitaries of the realm commanding them to cause wickliffe to be apprehended and brought before them for trial on the charge of heresy  the decrees of popes were in those days as now generally called bulls the reason why they were called by this name was on account of their being authenticated by the popes seal which was impressed upon a sort of button or boss of metal attached to the parchment by a cord or ribbon the latin name for this boss was bulla such bosses were sometimes made of lead so as to be easily stamped by the seal sometimes they were made of other metals there was one famous decree of the pope in which the boss was of gold this was called the golden bull  on the adjoining page we have an engraving copied from a very ancient book representing an archbishop reading a bull to the people in a church you can see the boss of metal with the seal stamped upon it hanging down from the parchment  illustration the bull                                       as soon as the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of london received the bull commanding them to bring wickliffe to trial they caused him to be seized and brought to london on hearing of his arrest a number of his friends among the nobles came at once to london too in order that they might support him by their countenance and encouragement and restrain the prelates from carrying their hostility against him too far among these were the duke of lancaster and a certain lord percy a nobleman of very high rank and station the trial took place in the church of st pauls wickliffe was called upon to answer to the charges made against him before a very imposing court of ecclesiastics all dressed magnificently in their sacerdotal robes the knights and barons who took wickliffes side were present too in their military costume and a great assembly besides consisting chiefly of the citizens of london  the common people of london being greatly under the influence of the priests were of course against wickliffe and they looked with evil eyes upon the duke of lancaster and the other nobles who had come there to befriend him in the course of the trial which it seems was not conducted in a very regular manner the prelates and the nobles got into a dispute the dispute at last became so violent that the duke of lancaster had the rudeness to threaten the bishop of london that if he did not behave better he would drag him out of the church by the hair of his head this was certainly very rough language to address to a bishop especially at a time when he was sitting under authority from the pope as a judge in a high spiritual court and clothed in all the paraphernalia of his sacred office the londoners were excessively angry they went out and called their fellowcitizens to arms the excitement spread and increased during the night and the next morning a mob collected in the streets threatening vengeance against the duke and lord percy and declaring that they would kill them the dukes arms which were displayed in a public place in the city they reversed as was customary in the case of traitors and then growing more and more excited as they went on they directed their steps toward the palace of the savoy where they expected to find the duke himself the duke was not there but the men would have set fire to the palace had it not been for the interposition of the bishop of london he hearing what was going on repaired to the spot and with great difficulty succeeded in restraining the mob and saving the palace they however proceeded forthwith to the house of lord percy where they burst through the doors and ransacking all the rooms tore and broke every thing to pieces and threw the fragments out at the windows they found a man dressed as a priest whom they took to be lord percy in disguise and they killed him on the spot  the murdered man was not lord percy however but a priest in his own proper dress lord percy and the duke were just preparing to sit down to dinner quietly together in another place when a messenger came breathless and informed them what was going on they immediately fled they ran to the waterside got into a boat and rowed themselves over to kennington a place on the southern side of the river nearly opposite to westminster where the young prince richard and his mother were then residing for all this took place just before king richards grandfather died  the lordmayor and aldermen of london were greatly alarmed when they heard of this riot and of the excesses which the citizens of london had committed they were afraid that the duke of lancaster whose influence and power they knew was already very great and which would probably become vastly greater on the death of the king would hold them responsible for it so they went in a body to richmond where the king was lying sick and made very humble apologies for the indignities which had been offered to the duke and they promised to do all in their power to punish the transgressors the king was however too far gone to pay much attention to this embassy the mayor and aldermen then sent a deputation to prince richard at kennington to declare their goodwill to him and their readiness to accept him as their sovereign upon the death of his grandfather and to promise faithful allegiance to him on their own part individually and on the part of the city of london they hoped by this means to conciliate the good opinion of richard and of his mother as well as of the other friends around him and prepare them to judge leniently of their case when it should come before them  all this as has already been remarked took place just before king edwards death immediately after his death richard and his mother went to richmond and took up their residence in the palace where edward died on the next day a deputation was sent to the mayor and aldermen of london in richards name calling upon them to appear at richmond before the king together with the duke of lancaster and his friends in order that both sides might be heard in respect to the subjectmatter of the dispute and that the question might be properly decided the duke of lancaster they were informed had agreed to this course and was ready to appear they were accordingly summoned to appear also  the londoners were at first rather afraid to obey this injunction they did not think that a boy of eleven years of age was really competent to hear and decide such a case then they were afraid too that the duke of lancaster being his uncle would have such an influence over him as to lead him to decide just as he the duke should desire and that thus if they submitted to such a hearing of the case they would place themselves wholly in the dukes power after some hesitation however they finally concluded to go stipulating only that whatever disposal might be made of the case there should in no event any personal harm befall the mayor or the aldermen  this condition was agreed to and the parties appeared on the appointed day before the little king to have the case tried richard was of course surrounded by his officers and counselors and the business was really transacted by them though it was done in the young kings name there was no difficulty in settling the dispute amicably for all parties were disposed to have it settled and in such cases it is always easy to find a way in this instance the advisers of richard managed so well that the duke and his friends were quite reconciled to the londoners and they all went out from the presence of the king at last when the case was concluded as good friends apparently as they had ever been  the settling of this dispute was the first act of king richards reign considering how violent the dispute had been and how powerful the parties to it were and also considering that richard was yet nothing but a small though very pretty boy we must admit that it was a very good beginning     chapter vii  the coronation  ad 1377  nature and design of a coronationarrangements made for richards coronationconduits of winegolden snowthe young

monarch is often postponed for a considerable time after his accession to the throne there is no practical inconvenience in such a postponement for the crowning though usually a very august and imposing ceremony is of no particular force or effect in respect to the powers or prerogatives of the king he enters upon the full enjoyment of all these prerogatives and powers at once on the death of his predecessor and can exercise them all without restraint as the public good may require the coronation is merely a pageant which as such may be postponed for a longer or shorter period as occasion may require  richard was crowned however a very short time after his fathers death it was thought best undoubtedly to take prompt measures for sealing and securing his right to the succession lest the duke of lancaster or some other person might be secretly forming plans to supplant him king edward richards grandfather died on the 22d of june the funeral occupied several days and immediately afterward arrangements began to be made for the coronation the day was appointed for the 16th of july on the 15th the king was to proceed in state from the palace in the environs of london where he had been residing through the city of london to westminster where the coronation was to take place and as the people of london desired to make a grand parade in honor of the passage of the king through the city the arrangements of the occasion comprised two celebrations on two successive daysthe procession through london on the 15th and the coronation at westminster on the 16th  on the morning of the 15th an imposing train of the nobility led by all the great officers of state assembled at the residence of the king to receive him and to escort him through the city richard was dressed in magnificent robes and mounted upon a handsome charger a nobleman led his horse by the bridle another nobleman of high rank went before him bearing the sword of state the emblem of the regal power other nobles and prelates in great numbers mounted many of them on splendidlycaparisoned horses and in full armor joined in the train bands of musicians with trumpets and other martial instruments in great numbers filled the air with joyful sounds and in this manner the procession commenced its march  in the mean time the londoners had made great preparations for the reception of the cortége conduits were opened in various parts of the city to run with wine instead of water in token of the general joy in the heart of the city an edifice in the form of a castle was erected in honor of the occasion this castle had four towers in each of the towers were four beautiful young girls all about richards age they were dressed in white and their duty was as the king went by to throw out a quantity of little leaves of gold which falling upon and all around the king produced the effect of a shower of golden flakes of snow  the procession stopped before the castle there were conduits flowing with wine upon two sides of it the young girls descended from the towers bringing golden cups in their hands these cups they filled with wine at the fountains and offered them to the king and to the nobles who accompanied him on the top of the castle between the four towers there stood a golden angel with a crown in his hand by some ingenious mechanism this angel was made to extend his arm to the king as if in the act of offering him the crown this was a symbol representing the idea often inculcated in those days that the right of the king to reign was a divine right as if the crown were placed upon his head by an angel from heaven  after pausing thus a short time at the castle the procession moved on the streets were filled with vast crowds of people who drowned the music of the trumpets and drums by their continual acclamations  in this way the royal procession passed on through london and at length arrived at the gate of the palace in westminster here richard was assisted to dismount from his horse and was conducted into the palace between two long lines of knights and soldiers that were stationed at the entrance and upon the staircase to honor his arrival he was glad that the ceremony was over for he was beginning to be very tired of riding on horseback so many hours and of being so long in the midst of scenes of so much noise excitement and confusion  the next day was the day appointed for the coronation itself richard was dressed in his royal robes and shortly before noon he was conducted in great state from the palace to the church he was received by a procession of bishops and monks and conducted by them to the grand altar the pavement before the altar was covered with rich tapestry here richard kneeled while prayers were said and the litany was sung by the priests his barons and nobles and the great officers of state kneeled around him after the prayers were over he was conducted to an elevated seat which was richly decorated with carvings and gold  a bishop then ascended to a pulpit built against one of the vast gothic columns of the church and preached a sermon the sermon was on the subject of the duty of a king explaining how a king ought to conduct himself in the government of his people and enjoining upon the people too the duty of being faithful and obedient to their king  richard paid little attention to this sermon being already tired of the scene he was moreover bewildered by the multitude of people crowded into the church and all gazing intently and continually upon him there were bishops and priests in their sacerdotal robes of crimson and gold and knights and nobles brilliant with nodding plumes and glittering armor of steel when the sermon was finished the oath was administered to richard it was read by the archbishop richard assenting to it when it was read as soon as the oath had thus been administered the archbishop turning in succession to each quarter of the church repeated the oath in a loud voice to the people four times in all and called upon those whom he successively addressed to ask whether they would submit to richard as their king the people on each side as he thus addressed them in turn answered with a loud voice that they would obey him this ceremony being ended the archbishop turned again toward richard pronounced certain additional prayers and then gave him his benediction  the ceremony of anointing came next the archbishop advanced to richard and began to take off the robes in which he was attired at the same time four earls held over and around him as a sort of screen a coverture as it was called of cloth of gold richard remained under this coverture while he was anointed the archbishop took off nearly all his clothes and then anointed him with the holy oil he applied the oil to his head his breast his shoulders and the joints of his arms repeating as he did so certain prayers the choir in the mean time chanted a portion of the scriptures relating to the anointing of king solomon when the oil had been applied the archbishop put upon the king a long robe and directed him to kneel richard accordingly kneeled again upon the tapestry which covered the floor the archbishop and the bishops kneeling around him while in this position the archbishop offered more prayers and more hymns were sung and then he assisted richard to rise from his kneeling posture and proceeded to dress and equip him with the various garments and arms and emblems appropriate to the kingly power in putting on each separate article the archbishop made a speech in latin according to a form provided for such occasions beginning with receive this cloak receive this stole receive this sword and the likef  footnote f the stole was a long narrow scarf fringed at the ends it was wound about the neck and crossed over the breast and was worn as a badge  in this manner and with these ceremonies richard was invested with a splendidlyembroidered coat and cloak a stole a sword a pair of spurs a pair of bracelets and finally with a garment over all called the pallium all these things of course had been made expressly for the occasion and were adapted to the size and shape of a boy like richard the archbishop was assisted in putting these things on by certain nobles of the court who had been designated for this purpose and who considered themselves highly honored by the part that was assigned them in the ceremony  when the dressing had been completed the archbishop took the crown and after having invoked a blessing upon it by his prayers and benedictions all in the latin tongue he placed it upon richards head repeating at the same time a latin form the meaning of which was that he received the crown from god almighty and that to god alone he was responsible for the exercise of his royal power  then came a certain grand officer of the court with a red globe an emblem of royalty which has long been used in england this globe the archbishop blessed and then the officer put it into richards hands in the same manner the sceptre was brought and after being blessed by means of the same ceremonies and prayers was also put into richards hands  richard was now completely invested with the badges and insignia of his office the archbishop then raising his hands pronounced upon him his apostolic benediction and the ceremony so far was ended the bishops and nobles then came up to congratulate and salute richard on having thus received his crown after which they conducted him to his seat again  richard now began to be very tired and to wish to go home but there was a great deal more yet to come before he could be set at liberty there was an anthem to be sung by the choir and more prayers to be said after which there came what was called the offertory this was a ceremony in which a person was led to the altar to lay down upon it whatever offering he chose to make for the service of the church the king rose from his seat and was led forward to the altar having of course been previously told what he was to do he had in his hand a sum of money which had been provided for the occasion he laid down this money first upon the altar and then his sword it was the custom in these coronations for the king thus to offer his sword in token of the subordination of his royal power to the law and will of god and then the sword was afterward to be redeemed with money by the swordbearer the officer whose duty it was on leaving the church to bear the sword in procession before the king  accordingly after richard had returned from the altar the earl whose office it was to bear the sword went to the altar and redeemed it with a sum of money and carried it back to the place where richard was sitting  then came the service of the mass which occupied a long time so that richard became very tired indeed before it was ended after the mass came the communion which it was necessary for richard to partake the communion was of course accompanied with more prayers and more chantings until the poor boy thought that the ceremonies would never be ended when at last however all was over and the procession was ready to form again to leave the church richard was so worn out and exhausted with the fatigue that he had endured that he could not ride home so they brought a sort of litter and placed him upon it and four of the knights bore him home on their shoulders his uncle the duke of lancaster and the earl percy went before him and a long train of bishops nobles and grand officers of state followed behind in this way he was brought back to the palace as soon as the party reached the palace they carried richard directly up to a chamber took off all his grand paraphernalia and put him to bed  he rested a little while and then they brought him something to eat his troubles were however not yet over for there was to be a great banquet that afternoon and evening in the hall of the palace and it was necessary that he should be there accordingly after a short time he was arrayed again in his royal robes and insignia and conducted down to the hall here he had a ceremony to perform of creating certain persons earls of course it was his counselors that decided who the persons were that were to be thus raised to the peerage and they told him also exactly what he was to do and say in the programme of the ceremony he sat upon his throne surrounded by his nobles and officers of state and did what they told him to do when this ceremony had been performed the whole company sat down to the tables which had been prepared for a banquet  they continued their feasting and carousing to a late hour and then amused themselves with various boisterous games common in those days in the courtyard of the palace a pillar was set up with pipes at the sides of it from which there were flowing continually streams of wine of different kinds and every body who pleased was permitted to come and drink a part of the amusement consisted in the pushings and strugglings of the people to get to the faucets and the spilling of the wine all over their faces and clothes the top of the pillar was adorned with a large gilt image of an eagle  the next day there were more processions and more celebrations but richard himself was fortunately for him excused from taking any part in them in the mean time the people who managed the government in richards name heard the news that the french had learned in some way the tidings of king edwards death and had landed in the southern part of england and were burning and destroying all before them so they made all haste to raise an army to go and repel the invaders  it was finally concluded also to appoint richards two uncles namely john duke of lancaster and edmund earl of cambridge as his guardians until he should become of age some persons thought it was not safe to trust richard to the duke of lancaster at all but others thought it would be better to conciliate him by treating him with respect than to make him an open enemy by passing over him entirely  richard was considered at this time a very amiable and good boy and it was generally believed by the people of england that with a right and proper training he would grow up to be a virtuous and honest man and they anticipated for him a long and happy reign and yet in a little more than ten years after he became of age he was disgraced and dethroned on account of his vices and crimes     chapter viii  chivalry  ad 13781380  edmund earl of cambridgethomas of woodstockrichards young cousin henry of

langurant refuses to surrenderhis fateintolerable tyranny of the nobles in those daysoppression of the taxgatherersrichards helplessness   besides his uncle john duke of lancaster richard had two other uncles who each acted an important part in public affairs at the commencement of his reign they were       1 his uncle edmund who was the earl of cambridge and      afterward duke of york of course he is sometimes called in      the histories of those times by one of these names and      sometimes by the other       2 his uncle thomas thomas was born in the palace of      woodstock and so was often called thomas of woodstock he      was the earl of buckingham and afterward the duke of      gloucester  besides these uncles richard had a cousin just about his own age who afterward as we shall see played a very important part indeed in richards history this cousin was named henry bolingbroke he was the son of richards uncle john the duke of lancaster he and richard were now both about eleven years of age or rather richard was eleven and his cousin henry was about ten  of course richard was altogether too young to exercise any real control in respect to the government of the country every thing was consequently left to the parliament and the nobles his uncles endeavored to assume the general direction of affairs but there was nevertheless a strong party against them there were no means of deciding these disputes except by the votes in parliament and these votes went one way and the other as one party or the other for the time being gained the ascendency every one watched very closely the conduct of richards uncle john he was the next oldest son of edward the third after edward the prince of wales richards father of course if richard were to die he would become king and if he himself were to die before richard did and then richard were to die before he grew up and had children of his own then his son richards cousin henry bolingbroke would be entitled to claim the kingdom thus while richard remained unmarried and without heirs this henry bolingbroke was in the direct line of succession and of course next to richard himself he was perhaps the most important personage in the kingdom there was it is true another child the grandchild of an older uncle of richards named lionel but he was very young at this time and he died not long afterward leaving henry bolingbroke the only heir  it is curious enough that a year or two after this the french king died and was succeeded by his son a boy of about twelve years of age this boy was charles the sixth he was crowned in france with ceremonies still more splendid and imposing in some respects than those which had been observed in london on the occasion of richards coronation thus the hopes and fears of all the millions of people inhabiting france and england respectively in regard to the succession of the crown and the government of the country were concentrated in three boys not yet in their teens  of course richard and his cousin henry bolingbroke were rivals from the beginning richard and his friends were jealous and suspicious of henry and of his father and were always imagining that they were wishing that richard might die in order that they might come into his place thus there was no cordial friendship in the family nor could there be any of the other nobles and barons some took sides in one way and some in the other the boys themselves both richard and henry were too young to know much about these things but the leading barons and courtiers formed themselves into parties ranging themselves some on one side and some on the other so as to keep up a continual feeling of jealousy and illwill  in the mean time the french began to retaliate for the invasions of their country which the english had made by planning invasions of england in return one expedition landed on the isle of wight and after burning and destroying the villages and small towns they laid some of the large towns under a heavy contribution that is they made them pay a large sum of money under a threat that if the money was not paid they would burn down their town too so the citizens collected the money and paid it and the french expedition set sail and went away before the government had time to send troops from london to intercept them  the french too besides invading england themselves on the south incited the scotch to make incursions into the northern provinces for scotland was then entirely independent of england a curious story is related illustrating the religious ignorance which prevailed among the common people of scotland in those days it seems that some remarkable epidemic prevailed in 1379 in the northern part of england which was extremely fatal great numbers of people died the scotch sent messengers across the border to ascertain what the cause of the sickness was the english people told them that they did not know what the cause was it was a judgment from god the nature and operation of which was hidden from them they added however this pious sentiment that they submitted themselves patiently to the dispensation for they knew that every calamity that could befall men in this world came from the grace of god to the end that being punished for their sins they might be led to repent and reform their wicked lives  the messengers went home and reported to the scottish borderers that the english people said that the plague came from the grace of god not being able it would seem to remember the rest of the message so the priests arranged a form of prayer addressed to certain saints which was to be said by the people every morning this prayer implored the saints to deliver the people from the grace of god and the dreadful plagues which were sent by it upon men the form was thisg  footnote g the form was in latin we give here the english of it  the head of the family would first say blessed be and the others would respond the lord  then the head of the family would say       god and saint mango      saint romane and saint andro      shield us this day from gods grace and      the foul death that englishmen die of  and all the others would say amen  thus they considered the grace of god as an evil which they were to pray to be delivered from  indeed the common people at this time not only in scotland but throughout england were in a state of great ignorance and degradation the barons and knights and soldiers generally looked down with great contempt upon all who were engaged in any industrial pursuits in the country the great mass of those who were employed in tilling the ground were serfs or slaves bought and sold with the land and at the disposal in almost all respects of their haughty masters the inhabitants of the towns who lived by the manufacturing arts or by commerce were more independent but the nobles and knights and all who considered themselves gentlemen looked down with something like contempt upon these too as in fact their successors the present aristocracy of england do at the present day regarding them as persons in a very mean condition and engaged in low and ignoble pursuits still the industrial classes had increased greatly in wealth and numbers and they began to have and to express some opinion in respect to public affairs they had considerable influence in the house of commons and the government was in a great measure dependent upon the house of commons and was becoming more and more so every year it is true the king or rather the great lords who managed the government in his name could make war where they pleased and appoint whom they pleased to carry it on still they could not assess any tax except by the consent of the commons and thus in carrying on any great operations they were becoming every year more and more dependent on the public sentiment of the country  the country began to be very much dissatisfied with the management of public affairs within two or three years after the commencement of richards reign large sums of money were raised and put into the hands of richards uncles who spent it in organizing great expeditions by land and sea to fight the french but almost all of these expeditions were unsuccessful the people thought that they were mismanaged and that the money was squandered some of the nobles expended immense sums upon themselves in the case of one expedition that put to sea from the southern coast of england the nobleman who commanded it had twentyfive vessels loaded with his own personal property and baggage and that of his servants and attendants this man had fiftytwo new suits of apparel made of cloth of gold immensely expensive the fleet was wrecked and all this property was lost in the sea  a great many of the expeditions that were fitted out in england were for the purpose of carrying on wars in brittany and aquitaine in france for the benefit exclusively of the nobles and knights who claimed possessions in those countries the mass of the people of england at whose expense the operations were carried on having no interest whatever in the result the worst of it was that in these wars no real progress was made towns were taken and castles were stormed first by one party and then by the other the engraving represents the storming of one of these towns and being copied from an ancient picture it shows truthfully the kind of armor and the mode of fighting employed in those days  illustration storming of a town  almost the only way of forcing a passage into a castle or fortified town was by climbing over the walls by means of ladders and overpowering the garrison upon the top of them by main force as represented in the engraving sometimes it is true the besiegers of a castle undermined the walls so as to make them fall in and thus open a breach at the present day mines dug in this way are blown up by gunpowder but people were little acquainted with the use of gunpowder then and so they were obliged to shore up the walls while they were digging them by means of posts and beams and these after the miners had withdrawn were pulled out by ropes and thus the walls were made to fall down  great engines were sometimes used too to batter down the walls of castles and towns there was one kind of engine used by the duke of lancaster in one of his campaigns in france in the early part of richards reign which was called a sow the sow was made in many parts at a distance from the place besieged wherever a suitable supply of beams and timber could be obtained and then was brought on carts to the spot when it was framed together and put in operation it would hurl immense stones which striking the walls made breaches in them or going over them came down into the interior of the place crushing through the roofs of the houses and killing sometimes multitudes of men the sow was made too so as to afford shelter and protection to a great number of persons who could ride upon it while it was drawn or pushed up near the walls and thus reach a point where they could begin to undermine the walls or plant their ladders for scaling them the duke of lancaster caused one sow to be made which would carry in this way one hundred men  gunpowder however began to be used about this time though in a very imperfect and inefficient manner at one siege namely that of st malo a town on the northwestern coast of france it is said that the duke of lancaster had four hundred cannon they were all however of very little avail in taking the town  the wars waged between the english and the french in these chivalrous times were much more personal in their character than wars are at the present day in that period of the world every great duke or baron or knight was in some sense an independent personage having his own separate interests to look out for and his own individual rights and honor to maintain to a degree far greater than now the consequence of this was that the narratives of wars of those times contain accounts of a great many personal incidents and adventures which make the history of them much more entertaining than the histories of modern campaigns i will give one or two examples of these personal incidents  at one time while the duke of lancaster was besieging st malo with his four hundred cannon there was a famous welsh knight named evan known in history as evan of wales who was besieging a castle belonging to the english the name of the castle was mortain it was on the river garonne in the country of aquitaine the castle was so strong that evan had no hope of taking it by force and so he invested it closely on all sides and sat down quietly waiting for the garrison to be starved into a surrender  the castle was near the river evan built three blockhouses on the three sides of it one of these blockhouses was on the edge of a rock before the castle on the river side the second was opposite a postern gate and was intended particularly to watch the gate in order to prevent any one from coming out or going in the third blockhouse was below the castle between the lower part of it and the water to guard the fourth side of the castle evan had taken possession of a church which stood at some little distance from it and had converted the church into a fort thus the castle was completely invested being watched and guarded on every side the garrison however would not surrender hoping that they might receive succor before their provisions were entirely exhausted they remained in this condition for a year and a half and were at length reduced to great distress and suffering still the governor of the castle would not surrender  it may seem strange that evan a knight from wales should be fighting against the english since wales had some years before been annexed to the realm of england the reason was that evans family had been driven out of wales by the cruelties and oppressions of the english his father who had formerly been prince of wales had been beheaded and evan in his infancy had been saved by his attendants who fled with him to france there he had been received into the family of the french king john and after he had grown up he had fought under john many years the older he grew the more his heart was filled with resentment against the english and now he was engaged heart and hand in the attempt to drive them out of france of course the english considered him a traitor and they hated him much more than they did any of the french commanders of whom nothing else was to be expected than that they should be enemies to the english and fight them always and every where evan they considered as in some sense one of their own countrymen who had turned against them  there was another circumstance which increased the hatred of the english against evan and that was that he had taken one of their knights prisoner and then refused to ransom him on any terms the english offered any sum of money that evan would demand or they offered to exchange for him a french knight of the same rank but evan was inexorable he would not give up his prisoner on any terms but sent him to paris and shut him up in a dungeon where he pined away and at length died of misery and despair  in consequence of these things a plot was formed in england for assassinating evan a welshman by the name of john lamb was appointed to execute it  john lamb set out from england and crossed the channel to france he was a welleducated man speaking french fluently and he was well received every where by the french for he told them that he was a countryman of evans and that he was going to mortain to join him the french accordingly treated him well and helped him forward on his journey  when he reached mortain he came into the presence of evan and falling on his knees before him he said that he was his countryman and that he had come all the way from wales to enter into his service evan did not suspect any treachery he received the man kindly and made many inquiries of him in respect to the news which he brought from wales  john gave him very favorable accounts of the country and spoke particularly of the interest and affection which was every where felt for him  the whole country said he are thinking and talking continually about you and are anxiously desiring your return they wish to have you for their lord  these and other flatteries quite won the heart of evan and he took lamb into his service and appointed him to a confidential post about his person  for a time after this there were occasional skirmishes between the garrison of mortain and the besiegers but as the strength of the garrison gradually failed these contests became less and less frequent until at last they ceased entirely the soldiers of evan then had nothing to do but to watch and wait until the progress of starvation and misery should compel the garrison to surrender there was no longer any danger of sorties from the walls and the besiegers ceased to be at all on their guard but went and came at their ease about the castle just as if there were no enemy near  evan himself used to go out in the morning when the weather was fine into the fields in front of the castle before he was dressed and there have his hair combed and plaited a long time for like most of the knights and gentlemen soldiers of those days he was very particular about his dress and his personal appearance on these occasions he often had nobody to attend him but john lamb there was a place where there was a fallen tree which formed a good seat at a spot which afforded a commanding view of the castle and of the surrounding country he used often to go and sit upon this tree while his hair was combed amusing himself the while in watching to see what was going on in the castle and to observe if there were any signs that the garrison were going to surrender  one morning after a very warm night during which evan had not been able to sleep he went out to this place very early he was not dressed but wore only a jacket and shirt with a cloak thrown over his shoulders the soldiers generally were asleep and there was nobody with evan but john lamb evan sat down upon the log and presently sent john lamb to the blockhouse for his comb  go and get my comb said he and comb my hair that will refresh me a little  so john went for the comb as he went however it seemed to him that the time for the execution of his plan had come so he brought with him from the blockhouse a spanish dagger which he found there in evans apartment as soon as he reached evan who had thrown off his cloak and was thus almost naked and entirely off his guard he plunged the dagger into him up to the hilt at a single blow evan sank down upon the ground a lifeless corpse lamb left the dagger in the wound and walked directly to the gate of the castle  the guards at the gate hailed him and demanded what he wanted he said he wished to see the governor of the castle so the guards took him in and conducted him into the presence of the governor  my lord said lamb i have delivered you from one of the greatest enemies you ever had  from whom asked the governor  from evan of wales said lamb  the governor was very much astonished at hearing this and demanded of lamb by what means he had delivered them from evan lamb then related to the governor what he had done  the first impression produced upon the governors mind by the statement which lamb made was a feeling of displeasure he looked at the assassin with a scowl of anger upon his face and said sternly  wretch you have murdered your master you deserve to have your head cut off for such a deed and were it not that we are in such great straits and that we gain such very great advantage by his death i would have your head cut off on the spot however what is done can not be undone let it pass  the garrison did not derive any immediate advantage after all from the death of evan for the french were so incensed by the deed which john lamb had perpetrated that they sent more troops to the spot and pressed the siege more closely than ever the garrison was however not long afterward relieved by an english fleet which came up the river and drove the french away  the knights and barons of those days were not accustomed to consider it any hardship to go to war against each other but rather a pleasure they enjoyed fighting each other just as men at the present day enjoy hunting wild beasts in the forest and that chieftain was regarded as the greatest and most glorious who could procure for his retainers the greatest amount of this sort of pleasure provided always that his abilities as a leader were such that they could have their full share of victory in the contests that ensued it was only the quiet and industrial population at home the merchants of london the manufacturers of the country towns and the tillers of the land who were impoverished and oppressed by the taxes necessary for raising the money which was required that were disposed to complain the knights and soldiers who went forth on these campaigns liked to go they not only liked the excitements and the freedom of the wild life they led in camp and of the marches which they made across the country but they liked the fighting itself their hearts were filled with animosity and hatred against their foes and they were at any time perfectly willing to risk their lives for the opportunity of gratifying these passions they were also greatly influenced by a love for the praise and glory which they acquired by the performance of any great or brilliant feat of arms  this led them often to engage in single personal combats such for example as this there was a certain french knight named de langurant he was making an incursion into the english territories in the neighborhood of bordeaux one day he was scouring the country at the head of about forty troopers armed with lances at the head of this troop he came into the neighborhood of a village which was in the hands of the english and was defended by an english garrison when he approached the village he halted his men and posted them in ambush in a wood  you are to remain here a while said he i am going on alone before the town to see if i can not find some body to come out to fight me in single combat  the object of de langurant in this plan was to show his daring and to perform a brave exploit which he might have to boast of and glory over afterward among his brother soldiers  the men did as he had commanded them and concealed themselves in the wood de langurant then rode on alone his lance fixed in its rest and his helmet glittering in the sun until he reached the gate of the town then he halted and challenged the sentinel  the sentinel demanded what he wanted  where is the captain of this garrison said the trooper i wish you to go and find him and tell him that lord de langurant is at the gates of the town and wishes to have a tilt with him i dare him to come and fight with me since he pretends that he is such a valiant man tell him that if he does not come i will proclaim him every where as a coward that did not dare to come out and meet me  the name of the captain whom de langurant thus challenged was bernard courant it happened that one of bernards servants was upon the gate near the sentinel at the time this challenge was given he immediately called out to de langurant saying  i have heard what you have said sir knight and i will go immediately and inform my master you may rely upon seeing him in a few minutes if you will wait for he is no coward  bernard was greatly incensed when he heard the impertinent and boasting message which de langurant had sent him he started up immediately and called for his arms commanding at the same time that his horse should be saddled he was very soon equipped and ready the gate was opened the drawbridge let down and he sallied forth de langurant was waiting for him on the plain  illustration knights charging upon each otherthis engraving represents the manner in which knights rode to the encounter of each other in single combat they are each well protected with a helmet a shield or buckler and other armor of iron and are provided with lances and other weapons these lances were very long and were made of the toughest wood that could be obtained the object of each combatant in such an encounter is to strike his antagonist with the point of his weapon so as either to pierce his armor and kill him or else to throw him off his horse by the shock and force of the blow if a knight were unhorsed he lay generally helpless on the ground being unable to rise on account of the weight of his armor of course in this situation he was easily vanquished by his adversary  the knights were both mounted on furious chargers and after a moments pause during which they eyed each other with looks of fierce defiance they put spurs to their horses and the horses began to gallop toward each other at the top of their speed each of the knights as he advanced had one end of his lance supported in its rest while he pointed the other directly toward his antagonist with a view of striking him with it as he rode by watching at the same time the terrible point which was coming toward him in hopes to avoid it if possible and if not to bear up against the blow so firmly as not to be unhorsed the lances were very long and were made of very solid wood but the chief momentum of the blow which they were intended to give came from the end of them being supported in a rest which was connected with the saddle in such a manner that the whole impetus of the horse as it were was communicated to the lance and this impetus was so great that if a lance struck in such a manner that it could not glance off and did not overthrow the man but met with a solid resistance it was often shivered to atoms by the shock this happened in the present case the lances of both combatants were shivered at the first encounter the riders were however uninjured the horses wheeled made a short circuit and rushed toward each other again at the second encounter bernard brought down so heavy a blow with a battleaxe upon the iron armor that covered de langurants shoulder that the unfortunate trooper was hurled out of his saddle and thrown to the ground  as soon as bernard could rein in his horse again and bring him round he galloped up to the spot where de langurant had fallen and found him attempting to raise himself up from the ground at the same time the horsemen whom de langurant had left in the wood and who had been watching the combat from their place of ambush seeing their master unhorsed began to put themselves in motion to come to his rescue bernard who was a man of prodigious strength reached down from his horse as he rode over his fallen enemy and seized hold of his helmet his horse in the mean time going on and bernard holding to the helmet with all his force it was torn off from its fastenings and de langurants head was left unprotected and bare  bernard threw the helmet down upon the ground under his horses feet then drawing his dagger he raised it over de langurants head and called upon him to surrender  surrender said he surrender this instant or you are a dead man  the men in ambush were coming on and de langurant hoped they would be able to rescue him so he did not reply bernard knowing that he had not a moment to spare drove the dagger into de langurants head and then galloped away back through the gates into the town just in time to avoid the troop of horsemen from the ambush who were bearing down at full speed toward the spot and were now just at hand  the gates of the town were closed and the drawbridge was taken up the moment that bernard had entered so that he could not be pursued the horsemen therefore had nothing to do but to bear away their wounded commander to the nearest castle which was in their possession the next day he died                                       while the barons and knights were thus amusing themselves at the beginning of richards reign with fighting for castles and provinces either for the pleasure of fighting or for the sake of the renown or the plunder which they acquired when they were fortunate enough to gain the victory the great mass of the people of england were taxed and oppressed by their haughty masters to an extent almost incredible the higher nobles were absolutely above all law one of them who was going to set off on a naval expedition into france seized in the english seaport which he was leaving a number of women the wives and daughters of the citizens and took them on board his ship to be at the disposal there of himself and his fellow grandees for this intolerable injury the husbands and fathers had absolutely no remedy to crown the wickedness of this deed when soon after the fleet had left the port a storm arose and the women were terrified at the danger they were in and their fright added to the distress they felt at being thus torn away from their families and homes made them completely and uncontrollably wretched the merciless nobles threw them overboard to stop their cries  taxes were assessed too at this time upon all the people of the kingdom that were of an extremely onerous character these taxes were farmed as the phrase is that is the right to collect them was sold to contractors called farmers of the revenue who paid a certain sum outright to the government and then were entitled to all that they could collect of the tax thus there was no supervision over them in their exactions for the government being already paid cared for nothing more the consequence was that the taxgatherers who were employed by the contractors treated the people in the most oppressive and extortionate manner if the people made complaints the government would not listen to them for fear that if they interfered with the taxgatherers in collecting the taxes the farmers would not pay so much the next time  richard himself of course knew nothing about all these things or if he did know of them he was wholly unable to do any thing to prevent them he was completely in the power of his uncles and of the other great nobles of the time the public discontent however grew at last so great that there was nothing wanted but a spark to cause it to break out into a flame there was such a spark furnished at length by an atrocious insult and injury offered to a young girl the daughter of a tiler by one of the taxgatherers this led to a formidable insurrection known in history as wat tylers insurrection i shall relate the story of this insurrection in the next chapter     chapter ix

by the cruel tyranny and oppression which they suffered in the early part of king richards reign is commonly called wat tylers insurrection as if the affair with wat tyler were the cause and moving spring of it whereas it was in fact only an incident of it  the real name of this unhappy man was john walter he was a tiler by tradethat is his business was to lay tiles for the roofs of houses according to the custom of roofing prevailing in those days so he was called john walter the tiler or simply walter the tiler and from this his name was abridged to wat tyler  the whole country was in a state of great discontent and excitement on account of the oppressions which the people suffered before walter appeared upon the stage at all when at length the outbreak occurred he came forward as one of the chief leaders of it there were however several other leaders the names by which the principal of them were known were jack straw william wraw jack shepherd john milner hob carter and john ball it is supposed that many of these names were fictitious and that the men adopted them partly to conceal their real names and partly because they supposed that they should ingratiate themselves more fully with the lower classes of the people by assuming these familiar and humble appellations  the historians of the times say that these leaders were all very bad men they may have been so though the testimony of the historians is not conclusive on this point for they belonged to and wrote in the interest of the upper classes their enemies the poor insurgents themselves never had the opportunity to tell their own story either in respect to themselves or their commanders  still it is highly probable that they were bad men it is not generally the amiable the gentle and the good that are first to rise and foremost to take the lead in revolts against tyrants and oppressors it is on the other hand far more commonly the violent the desperate and the bad that are first goaded on to assume this terrible responsibility it is indeed one of the darkest features of tyranny that it tends by the reaction which follows it to invest this class of men with great power and to commit the best interests of society and the lives of great numbers of men for a time at least entirely to the disposal of the most reckless and desperate characters  the lower classes of the people of england had been held substantially as slaves by the nobles and gentry for many generations they had long submitted to this hopeless of any change but they had gradually become enlightened in respect to their natural rights and now when the class immediately above them were so grievously oppressed and harassed by the taxes which were assessed upon them and still more by the vexatious and extortionate mode in which the money was collected they all began to make common cause and when the rebellion broke out they rose in one mass freemen and bondmen together  there was a certain priest named john ball who before the rebellion broke out had done much to enlighten the people as to their rights and had attempted to induce them to seek redress at first in a peaceable manner he used to make speeches to the people in the marketplace representing to them the hardships which they endured by the oppressions of the nobility and urging them to combine together to petition the king for a redress of their grievances the king will listen to us i am sure said he if we go to him together in a body and make our request but if he will not hear us then we must redress our grievances ourselves the best way we can  the example of ball was followed by many other persons and as always happens in such cases the excitement among the people and their eagerness to hear brought out a great many spectators whose only object was to see who could awaken the resentment and anger of their audiences in the highest degree and produce the greatest possible excitement these orators having begun with condemning the extravagant wealth the haughty pretensions and the cruel oppressions of the nobles and contrasting them with the extreme misery and want of the common people whom they held as slaves proceeded at length to denounce all inequalities in human condition and to demand that all things should be held in common  things will never go on well in england said they until all these distinctions shall be leveled and the time shall come when there shall be neither vassal nor lord and these proud nobles shall be no more masters than ourselves how ill have they used us and what right have they to hold us in this miserable bondage are we not all descended from the same parents adam and eve what right have one set of men to make another set their slaves what right have they to compel us to toil all our lives to earn money that they may live at ease and spend it they are clothed in velvets and rich stuffs ornamented with ermine and furs while we are half naked or clothed only in rags they have wines and spices and fine bread while we have nothing but rye and the refuse of the straw they have manors and handsome seats while we live in miserable cabins and have to brave the wind and rain at our labor in the fields in order that with the proceeds of our toil they may support their pomp and luxury and if we do not perform our services or if they unjustly think that we do not we are beaten and there is no one to whom we can complain or look for justice  there is obviously some truth and some extravagance in these complaints men deprived of their rights as these poor english serfs were and goaded by the oppressions which they suffered almost to despair will of course be extravagant in their complaints none but those totally ignorant of human nature would expect men to be moderate and reasonable when in such a condition and in such a state of mind  the truth is that there always has been and there always will necessarily be a great inequality in the conditions and a great difference in the employments of men but this fact awakens no dissatisfaction or discontent when those who have the lower stations of life to fill are treated as they ought to be treated if they enjoy personal liberty and are paid the fair wages which they earn by their labor and are treated with kindness and consideration by those whose duties are of a higher and more intellectual character and whose position in life is superior to theirs they are almost without exception satisfied and happy it is only when they are urged and driven hard and long by unfeeling oppression that they are ever aroused to rebellion against the order of the social state and then as might be expected they go to extremes and if they get the power into their hands they sweep every thing away and overwhelm themselves and their superiors in one common destruction  young persons sometimes imagine that the american doctrine of the equality of man refers to equality of condition and even grown persons who ought to think more clearly and be more reasonable sometimes refer to the distinctions of rich and poor in this country as falsifying our political theories but the truth is that in our political theory of equality it is not at all equality of condition but equality of rights that is claimed for man all menthe doctrine is simplyhave an equal right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness even when all are in the full enjoyment of their rights different men will of course attain to very different degrees of advancement in the objects of their desire some will be rich and some will be poor some will be servants and some masters some will be the employers and some the employed but so long as all are equal in respect to their rights none will complainor at least no classes will complain there will of course be here and there disappointed and discontented individuals but their discontent will not spread it is only by the longcontinued and oppressive infringement of the natural rights of large masses of men that the way is prepared for revolts and insurrections  it was by this process that the way was prepared for the insurrection which i am now to describe the whole country for fifty miles about london was in a very sullen and angry mood ready for an outbreak the moment that any incident should occur to put the excitement in motion this incident was furnished by an occurrence which took place in the family of walter the tiler  it seems that a personal tax had been levied by the government the amount of which varied with the age of the individual assessed children paid so much young men and young women paid more the line between these classes was not clearly defined or rather the taxgatherers had no means of determining the ages of the young people in a family if they suspected the parents reported them wrong in such cases they were often very insolent and rude and a great many quarrels took place by which the people were often very much incensed the taxgatherer came one day into walters house to collect the tax walter himself was away engaged at work tiling a house nearby the only persons that were at home were his wife and a young daughter just growing to womanhood the taxgatherer said that the girl was fullgrown and that they must pay the higher tax for her her mother said no she is not fullgrown yet she is only a child the taxgatherer then said he would soon find out whether she was a woman or not and went to her to take hold of her offering her rudeness and violence of the worst possible character the poor girl screamed and struggled to get away from him her mother ran to the door and made a great outcry calling for help walter hearing the cries seized for a club a heavy implement which he used in tiling and ran home as soon as he entered the house he demanded of the officer who had now left his daughter and came forward to meet him what he meant by conducting in so outrageous a manner in his house the officer replied defiantly and advanced toward walter to strike him walter parried the stroke and then being roused to perfect phrensy by the insult which his daughter had received and the insolence of the taxgatherer he brought his club down upon the taxgatherers head with such a blow as to break his skull and kill him on the spot the blow was so violent that the mans brains were scattered all about the floor  the news of this occurrence spread like wildfire through the town the people all took walters part and they began to assemble it seems that a great many of them had had their daughters maltreated in the same way by the taxgatherers but had not dared to resist or to complain they now however flocked around the house of walter and promised to stand by him to the end the plan was proposed that they should march to london and in a body appeal to the king and call upon him to redress their wrongs  he is young said they and he will have pity upon us and be just to us let us go in a body and petition him  the news of the movement spread to all the neighboring towns and very soon afterward a vast concourse collected and commenced their march toward london they were joined on the road by large companies that came from the villages and towns on the way until at length walter and his fellowleaders found themselves at the head of from sixty to one hundred thousand men  illustration view of the tower of london as seen from the river  the whole country was of course thrown into a state of great alarm the duke of lancaster who was particularly obnoxious to the people was absent at this time he was on the frontiers of scotland the king was in his palace but on hearing tidings of the insurrection he went to the tower which is a strong castle built on the banks of the river in the lower part of london a number of the nobles who had most cause to fear the mob went with him and shut themselves up there the princess of wales richards mother happened to be at canterbury at the time having gone there on a pilgrimage she immediately set out on her return to london but she was intercepted on the way by tyler and his crowd of followers the crowd gathered around the carriage and frightened the princess very much indeed but they did her no harm after detaining her for some time they let her pass on she immediately made the best of her way to the tower where she joined her son  as fast as companies of men came from the villages and towns along the road to join the insurgents the leaders administered to them an oath the oath bound them       1 always to be faithful and true to king richard       2 never to submit to the reign of any king named john this      was aimed at the duke of lancaster whose name was john and      whom they all specially hated       3 always to follow and defend their leaders whenever called      upon to do so and always to be ready to march themselves      and to bring their neighbors with them at a moments      warning       4 to demand the abrogation of all the obnoxious taxes and      never to submit again to the collection of them  in this manner the throngs moved on along the roads leading to london they became gradually more and more excited and violent as they proceeded soon they began to attack the houses of knights and nobles and officers of the government which they passed on the way and many persons whom they supposed to be their enemies they killed at canterbury they pillaged the palace of the archbishop the archbishop of canterbury then as now drew an immense revenue from the state and lived in great splendor and they justly conceived that the luxury and ostentation in which he indulged was in some degree the cause of the oppressive taxation that they endured  they assaulted a castle on the way and made prisoner of a certain knight named sir john newton whom they found in it and compelled him to go with them to london the knight was very unwilling to go with them and at first seemed determined not to do so but they disposed of his objections in a very summary manner  sir john said they unless you go with us at once and in every thing do exactly as we order you you are a dead man  so sir john was compelled to go they took two of his children with them also to hold as security they said for their fathers good behavior  there were other parties of the insurgents who made prisoners in this way of men of rank and family and compelled them to ride at the head of their respective columns as if they were leaders in the insurrection  in this manner the throngs moved on until at length approaching the thames they arrived at blackheath and greenwich two villages below london farther down than the tower and near the bank of the river here they halted and determined to send an embassage to the king to demand an audience the embassador that they were to send was the knight sir john newton  sir john did not dare to do otherwise than as the insurgents directed he went to the river and taking a boat he crossed over to the tower the guards received him at the gate and he was conducted into the presence of the king  he found the king in an apartment with the princess his mother and with a number of the nobles and officers of his court they were all in a state of great suspense and anxiety awaiting tidings they knew that the whole country was in commotion but in respect to what they were themselves to do in the emergency they seem to have had no idea  sir john was himself one of the officers of the government and so he was well known to all the courtiers he fell on his knees as soon as he entered the kings presence and begged his majesty not to be displeased with him for the message that he was about to deliver  i assure your majesty said he that i come not voluntarily but on compulsion  the king said to him that he had nothing to fear and directed him to proceed at once and deliver his message  the knight then said that the people who had assembled wished to see the king and he urgently requested that his majesty would come and meet them at blackheath  they wish you to come by yourself alone said he and your majesty need have no fear for your person for they will not do you the least harm they have always respected you and they will continue to respect and honor you as their king they only wish to tell you some things which they say it is very necessary that your majesty should hear they have not informed me what it is that they wish to say since they desire to communicate it themselves directly to your majesty  the knight concluded by imploring the king to grant his subjects a favorable answer if he could or at least to allow him to return to them with such a reply as would convince them that he their messenger had fairly delivered his message  because said he they hold my children as hostages and unless i return they will surely put them to death  the king replied that the knight should have an answer very soon and he immediately called a council of his courtiers to consider what should be done there was much difference of opinion but it was finally concluded to send word to the men that the king would come down the river on the following day to speak with them and that if the leaders would come to the bank of the river opposite blackheath he would meet them there  so sir john newton left the tower and recrossing the river in his boat went back to the camp of the insurgents and reported to the leaders the answer of the king  they were very much pleased to hear that the king was coming to meet them the news was soon communicated to all the host and it gave universal satisfaction there were sixty thousand men on the ground it is said and of course they were very insufficiently provided with food and not at all with shelter they however began to make arrangements to spend the night as well as they could where they were in anticipation of the interview with the king on the following day  on the following morning the king attended mass in solemn state in the chapel of the tower and then immediately afterward entered his barge accompanied by a grand train of officers knights and barons the barge leaving the tower stairs was rowed down the river to the place appointed for the interview about ten thousand of the insurgents had come to the spot and when they saw the barge coming in sight with the royal party on board they burst out into such a terrific uproar with yells screams shouts outcries and frantic gesticulations that they seemed to the king and his party like a company of demons they had sir john newton with them they had brought him down to the bank of the river because as they said if the king were not to come they should believe that he had imposed upon them in the message which he had brought and in that case they were going to cut him to pieces on the spot  the assembly seemed so noisy and furious that the nobles in attendance on the king were afraid to allow him to land they advised him to remain in the barge at a little distance from the shore and to address the people from the deck the king resolved to do so so the barge lay floating on the river the oarsmen taking a few strokes from time to time to recover the ground lost by the drift of the current the king stood upon the deck of the barge with his officers around him and asked the men on the shore what they wished for  i have come at your request said he to hear what you have to sayh  footnote h see frontispiece  such an arrangement as this for communicating with a mass of desperate and furious men would not have been safe under circumstances similar to those of the present day a man standing in this way on the deck of a boat within speaking distance of the shore might with a rifle or even with a musket have been killed in a moment by any one of the thousands on the shore in those days however when the only missiles were spears javelins and arrows a man might stand at his ease within speaking distance of his enemies entirely out of reach of their weapons  when the crowd upon the shore saw that the king was waving his hand to them in order to silence them and that he was trying to speak they became in some measure calm and when he asked again what they wished for the leaders replied by saying that they wished him to come on shore they desired him to land they said so that he could better hear what they had to say  one of the officers about the king replied that that could not be  the king can not land among you he said you are not properly dressed nor in a fit condition in any respect to come into his majestys presence  hereupon the noise and clamor was renewed and became more violent than ever the men insisting that the king should land and filling the air with screams yells and vociferations of all sorts which made the scene truly terrific the counselors of the king insisted that it was not safe for the king to remain any longer on the river so the oarsmen were ordered to pull their oars and the barge immediately began to recede from the shore and to move back up the river it happened that the tide was now coming in and this assisted them very much in their progress and the barge was swept back rapidly toward the tower  the insurgents were now in a great rage those who had come down to the bank of the river to meet the king went back in a throng to the place where the great body of the rebels were encamped on the plain the news that the king had refused to come and hear their complaints was soon spread among the whole multitude and the cry was raised to london to london so the whole mighty mass began to put itself in motion and in a few hours all the roads that led toward the metropolis were thronged with vast crowds of ragged and wretchedlooking men barefooted bareheaded some bearing rudelymade flags and banners some armed with clubs and poles and such other substitutes for weapons as they had been able to seize for the occasion and all in a state of wild and phrensied excitement  the people of london were greatly alarmed when they heard that they were coming there was then but one bridge leading into london from the southern side of the river this bridge was on the site of the present london bridge about half a mile above the tower there was a gate at the end of the bridge next the town and a drawbridge outside of it the londoners shut the gate and took up the drawbridge to prevent the insurgents from coming in  when the rioters reached the bridge and found that they were shut out they of course became more violent than before and they began to burn and destroy the houses outside now it happened that many of these houses were handsome villas which belonged to the rich citizens of the town these citizens became alarmed for their property and they began to say that it would be better after all to open the gates and let the people come in  if we let them come in said they they will wander about the streets a while but they will soon get tired and go away whereas by opposing and thwarting them we only make them the more violent and mischievous  then besides there were a great many of the common people of london that sympathized with the rioters and wished to join them  they are our friends said they they are striving to obtain redress for grievances which we suffer as well as they their cause is our cause so let us open the gates and let them come in  illustration the savoy  in the mean time the whole population of the city were becoming more and more alarmed every hour for the rioters were burning and destroying the suburbs and they declared that if the londoners did not open the gates they would after ravaging every thing without the walls take the city by storm and burn and destroy every thing in it so it was finally concluded to open the gates and let the insurgents in  they came in in an immense throng which continued for many hours to pour over the bridge into the city like a river of men above flowing athwart the river of water below as they entered the city they divided and spread into all the diverging streets a portion of them stormed a jail and set all the prisoners free others marched through the streets filling the air with dreadful shouts and outcries and brandishing their pikes with great fury the citizens in hopes to conciliate them brought out food for them and some gave them wine on receiving these provisions the insurgents built fires in the streets and encamped around them to partake of the food and refreshments which the citizens had bestowed they were rendered more goodnatured perhaps by this kind treatment received from the citizens but they soon became excited by the wine which they drank and grew more wild and noisy than ever at length a large party of them began to move toward the palace of the duke of lancaster this palace was called the savoy it stood on the bank of the river between london and westminster and was a grand and imposing mansion  the duke of lancaster was an especial object of their hatred he was absent at this time as has been said being engaged in military operations on the frontiers of scotland the mob however were determined to destroy his palace and every thing that belonged to it  so they broke into the house murdering all who made any resistance and then proceeded to break and destroy every thing the palace contained they built fires in the courtyard and in the street and piled upon them every thing movable that would burn the plate and other such valuables as would not burn they broke up and threw into the thames they strictly forbade that any of the property should be taken away one man hid a silver cup in his bosom intending to purloin it but he was detected in the act and his comrades threw him cup and all as some say upon the fire others say they threw him into the thames at any rate they destroyed him and his booty together  we are here said they in the cause of truth and righteousness to execute judgment upon a criminal and not to become thieves and robbers ourselves  illustration ruins of the savoy  when they had destroyed every thing that the palace contained they set fire to the building and burned it to the ground a portion of the walls remained standing afterward for a long time a desolate and melancholy ruin  the insurgents felt a special animosity against lawyers whom they considered mercenary instruments in the hands of the nobles for oppressing them they hung all the lawyers that they could get into their hands and after burning the savoy they went to the temple which was a spacious edifice containing the courts the chambers of the barristers and a vast store of ancient legal records they burned and destroyed the whole  it is said too that there was a certain man in london a rich citizen named richard lyon who had formerly been walter the tilers master and had beaten him and otherwise treated him in a cruel and oppressive manner at the time that he received these injuries walter had no redress but now the opportunity had come he thought for revenge so he led a gang of the most desperate and reckless of the insurgents to lyons house and seizing their terrified victim they dragged him out without mercy and cut off his head the head they stuck upon the top of a pike and paraded it through the streets a warning as they said to all cruel and oppressive masters  a great many other heads principally those of men who had made themselves particularly obnoxious to the insurgents were paraded through the streets in the same manner  after spending the day in these excesses keeping all london in a state of dreadful confusion and alarm the various bands began to move toward night in the direction of the tower where the king and his court had shut themselves up in great terror not knowing what to do to escape from the dreadful inundation of poverty and misery which had so suddenly poured in upon them the rioters when they reached the tower took possession of a large open square before it and kindling up great bonfires they began to make arrangements for bivouacking there for

were continual consultations held and much perplexity and alarm prevailed some of richards advisers recommended that the most decisive measures should be adopted at once the king had in the tower with him a considerable body of armed men there were also in other parts of london and vicinity many more amounting in all to about four thousand it was recommended by some of the kings counselors that these men should all be ordered to attack the insurgents the next morning and kill them without mercy it is true that there were between fifty and one hundred thousand of the insurgents but they had no arms and no organization and it was not to be expected therefore that they could stand a moment numerous as they were against the kings regular troops they would be slaughtered it was said like sheep and the insurrection would be at once put down  others thought that this would be a very hazardous mode of proceeding and very uncertain as to its results  it is much better said they that your majesty should appease them if possible by fair words and by a show of granting what they ask for if we once attempt to put them down by force and should not be able to go through with it we shall only make matters a great deal worse the commonalty of london and of all england would then join them and the nobles and the government will be swept away entirely from the land  these counsels prevailed it was decided not to attack the rioters immediately but to wait a little and see what turn things would take  the next morning as soon as the insurgents were in motion in the great square they began to be very turbulent and noisy and to threaten that they would attack the tower itself if the king did not open the gates to them it was finally determined to yield in part to their requests  there was a certain place in the suburbs of london known by the name of mileendso called perhaps because it was at the end of a mile from some place or other at this place was an extended meadow to which the people of london were accustomed to resort on gala days for parades and public amusements the king sent out a messenger from the tower to the leaders of the insurgents with directions to say to them that if they would all go to mileend he would come out and meet them there  they took him at his word and the whole immense mass began to set itself in motion toward mileend  they did not all go there however those who really desired to have an interview with the king with a view to a redress of their grievances repaired to the appointed place of rendezvous but of the rest a large party turned toward london in hopes of pillage and plunder others remained near the tower this last party as soon as the king and his attendants had gone to mileend succeeded in forcing their way in through the gates which it seems had not been left properly guarded and thus gained possession of the tower they ransacked the various apartments and destroyed every thing which came in their way that was at all obnoxious to them they broke into the chamber of the princess of wales richards mother and though they did not do the princess any personal injury they terrified her so much by their violence and noise that she fainted and was borne away apparently lifeless her attendants carried her down the landingstairs on the river side and there put her into a covered boat and rowed her away to a place of safety  the people in the tower did not all get off so easily the archbishop of canterbury was there and three other prelates of high rank these men were particularly obnoxious to the rioters so they seized them and without any mercy dragged them into the court and cut off their heads the heads they put upon the ends of poles and paraded them in this way through the streets of london  in the mean time the king followed by a numerous train of attendants had proceeded to mileend and there met the insurgents who had assembled in a vast concourse to receive him several of the attendants of the king were afraid to follow him into the danger to which they thought he was exposing himself by going among such an immense number of lawless and desperate men some of them deserted him on the way to the place of meeting and rode off in different directions to places of safety the king himself however though so youngfor he was now only about sixteen years of agehad no fear as soon as he came to the meadow at mileend where the insurgents had now assembled to the number of sixteen thousand he rode forward boldly into the midst of them and opened the conference at once by asking them what they desired  the spokesman whom they had appointed for the occasion stated their demands which were that they should be made free they had hitherto been held as serfs in a bondage which exposed them to all sorts of cruelties and oppressions since they were amenable not to law but wholly to the caprice and arbitrary will of individual masters they demanded therefore that richard should emancipate them from this bondage and make them free  it was determined by richard and his counselors that this demand should be complied with or at least that they should pretend to comply with it and that decrees of emancipation for the different counties and districts which the various parties of insurgents had come from should be immediately issued this decision seemed to satisfy them the leaders or at least a large portion of them said that it was all they wanted and several parties immediately began to set out on their return to their several homes  but there were a great many who were not satisfied an insurrection like this whatever may be the object and design of the original movers in it always brings out into prominence and invests with temporary power vast numbers of desperate and violent men whose passions become inflamed by the excitement of movement and action and by sympathy with each other and who are never satisfied to stop with the attainment of the objects originally desired thus in the present instance although a great number of the rebels were satisfied with the promises made by the king at mileend and so went home multitudes still remained large parties went to london to join those who had already gone there in hopes of opportunities for pillage others remained at their encampments doubting whether the king would really keep the promises which he had made them and send the decrees then besides fresh parties of insurgents were continually arriving at london and its neighborhood so that the danger seemed by no means to have passed away  the king immediately caused the decree to be prepared thirty secretaries were employed at once to write the several copies required they were all of the same form they were written as was customary with royal decrees in those times in the latin language were engrossed carefully upon parchment signed by the king and sealed by his seal the announcement that the secretaries were preparing these decrees when the work had been commenced tended greatly to satisfy the insurgents and many more of them went home still vast numbers remained and the excitement among them and their disposition for mischief was evidently on the increase  such was the state of things during the night of friday the various parties of the insurgents were encamped in and around london the glare of their fires flashing on the buildings and lighting up the sky and their shouts sometimes of merriment and sometimes of anger filling the air the peaceable inhabitants passed the night in great alarm some of them endeavored to conciliate the goodwill of the insurgents by offering them food and wine the wine of course excited them and made them more noisy than ever their numbers too were all the time increasing and no one could foresee how or when the trouble would end  the next morning a grand consultation among the rebels was determined upon it was to be held in a great open space called smithfielda space set apart as a cattlemarket at the outskirts of london toward the north all the leaders who had not returned to their homes were present at the consultation among them and at the head of them indeed was wat tyler  the king that morning it happened having spent the night at the private house down the river where his mother had sought refuge after making her escape from the tower concluded to go to westminster to attend mass his real motive for making this excursion was probably to show the insurgents that he did not fear them and also perhaps to make observations in respect to their condition and movements without appearing to watch them  he accordingly went to westminster accompanied and escorted by a suitable cortége and guard the mayor of the city of london was with the party after hearing mass at westminster the king set out on his return home but instead of going back through the heart of london as he had come he took a circuit to the northward by a road which as it happened led through smithfield where a great body of the insurgents had assembled as has already been said thus the king came upon them quite unexpectedly both to himself and to them when he saw them he halted and the horsemen who were with him halted too there were about sixty horsemen in his train  some of his officers thought it would be better to avoid a reencounter with so large a body of the insurgentsfor there were about twenty thousand on the fieldand recommended that the kings party should turn aside and go home another way but the king said no he preferred to speak to them  he would go he said and ascertain what it was that they wanted more he thought that by a friendly colloquy with them he could appease them  while the king and his party thus halted to consider what to do the attention of the leaders of the insurgents had been directed toward them they knew at once that it was the king  it is the king said walter i am going to meet him and speak with him all the rest of you are to remain here you must not move from this spot until i come back unless you see me make this signal  so saying walter made a certain gesture with his hand which was to be the signal for his men  when you see me make this signal said he do you all rush forward and kill every man in the troop except the king you must not hurt the king we will take him and keep him he is young and we can make him do whatever we say we will put him at the head of our company as if he were our commander and we were obeying his orders and we will do every thing in his name in this way we can go wherever we please all over england and do what we think best and there will be no opposition to us  when i say that walter gave these orders to his men i mean that these words were attributed to him by one of the historians of the time as however all the accounts which we have of these transactions were written by persons who hated the insurgents and wished to present their case in the most unfavorable light possible we can not depend absolutely on the truth of their accounts especially in cases like this when they could not have been present to hear or see  at any rate walter rode up alone to meet the king he advanced so near to him that his horses head touched the kings horse while in this position a conversation ensued between him and the king walter pointed to the vast concourse of men who were assembled in the field and told the king that they were all under his orders and that what he commanded them to do they would do the king told him that if that were the case he would do well to recommend them all to go to their respective homes he had granted the petition he said which they had offered the day before and had ordered decrees to be prepared emancipating them from their bondage he asked walter what more they required  walter replied that they wanted the decrees to be delivered to them  we are not willing to depart till we get all the decrees said he there are all these men and as many more besides in the city and we wish you to give us all the decrees that we may take them home ourselves to our several villages and towns  the king said that the secretaries were preparing the decrees as fast as they could and the men might depend that those which had not yet been delivered would be sent as soon as they were ready to the villages and towns  go back to your men he added and tell them that they had better return peaceably to their homes the decrees will all arrive there in due time  but walter did not seem at all inclined to go he looked around upon the kings attendants and seeing one that he had known before a squire who was in immediate attendance on the kings person he said to him  what you here  this squire was the kings swordbearer in addition to the kings sword which it was his duty to carry he was armed with a dagger of his own  walter turned his horse toward the squire and said  let me see that dagger that you have got  no said the squire drawing back  yes said the king let him take the dagger  the king was not at all afraid of the rebel and wished to let him see that he was not afraid of him  so the squire gave walter the dagger walter took it and examined it in all its parts very carefully turning it over and over in his hands as he sat upon his horse it was very richly ornamented and walter had probably never had the opportunity to examine closely any thing so beautifully finished before  after having satisfied himself with examining the dagger he turned again to the squire  and now said he let me see your sword  no said the squire this is the kings sword and it is not going into the hands of such a lowborn fellow as you and moreover he added after pausing a moment and looking at walter with an expression of defiance if you and i had met somewhere alone you would not have dared to talk as you have done not for a heap of gold as high as this church  there was a famous church called the church of st bartholomew near the place where the king and his party had halted  by the powers said walter i will not eat this day before i have your head  seeing that a quarrel was impending the mayor of london and a dozen horsemen rode up and surrounded walter and the squire  scoundrel said the mayor how dare you utter such threats as those  what business is that of yours said walter turning fiercely toward the mayor what have you to do with it  seize him said the king for the king himself was now beginning to lose his patience  the mayor encouraged by these words and being already in a state of boiling indignation and rage immediately struck a tremendous blow upon walters head with a cimeter which he had in his hand the blow stunned him and he fell heavily from his horse to the ground one of the horsemen who had come up with the mayora man named john standwichimmediately dismounted and thrust the body of walter through with his sword killing him on the spot  in the mean time the crowd of the insurgents had remained where walter had left them watching the proceedings they had received orders not to move from their position until walter should make the signal but when they saw walter struck down from his horse and stabbed as he lay on the ground they cried out they have killed our captain form the lines form the lines we will go and kill every one of them  so they hastily formed in array and got their weapons ready prepared to charge upon the kings party but richard who in all these transactions evinced a degree of bravery and coolness very remarkable for a young man of sixteen rode forward alone and boldly to meet them  gentlemen said he you have no leader but me i am your king remain quiet and peaceable  the insurgents seemed not to know what to do on hearing these words some began to move away but the more violent and determined kept their ground and seemed still bent on mischief the king went back to his party and asked them what they should do next some advised that they should make for the open fields and try to escape but the mayor of london advised that they should remain quietly where they were  it will be of no use said he for us to try to make our escape but if we remain here we shall soon have help  the mayor had already sent horsemen into london to summon help these messengers spread the cry in the city to smithfield to smithfield they are killing the king this cry produced universal excitement and alarm the bands of armed men quartered in london were immediately turned out and great numbers of volunteers too seizing such weapons as they could find made haste to march to smithfield and thus in a short time the king found himself supported by a body of seven or eight thousand men  some of his advisers then urged that the whole of this force should fall at once upon the insurgents and slaughter them without mercy this it was thought that they could easily do although the insurgents were far more numerous than they for the kings party consisted in great measure of wellarmed and welldisciplined soldiers while the insurgents were comparatively a helpless and defenseless rabble  the king however would not consent to this perhaps somebody advised him what to do or perhaps it was his own prudence and moderation which suggested his course he sent messengers forward to remonstrate calmly with the men and demand of them that they should give up their banners if they would do so the messengers said that the king would pardon them so they gave up their banners this seemed to be the signal of disbanding and large parties of the men began to separate from the mass and move away toward their homes  next the king sent to demand that those who had received decrees of emancipation should return them they did so and in this way a considerable number of the decrees were given up the king tore them to pieces on the field upon the plea that they were forfeited by the mens having continued in rebellion after the decrees were granted  the whole mass of the insurgents began now rapidly to get into disorder they had no head no banners and the army which was gathering against them was increasing in strength and resolution every moment the dispersal went on faster and faster until at last those that remained threw down their weapons and fled to london  the king then went home to his mother she was overjoyed to see him safely returning  my dear son said she you can not conceive what pain and anguish i have suffered for you this day  yes mother said richard i have no doubt you have suffered a great deal but it is all over now now you can rejoice and thank god for i have regained my inheritance the kingdom of england which i had lost                                       after this there was no farther serious trouble the insurgents were disheartened and most of them were glad to make the best of their way home after the danger was past richard revoked all the decrees of emancipation which he had issued on the ground that they had been extorted from him by violence and intimidation and also that the condition on which they had been granted namely that the men should retire at once quietly to their homes had not been complied with on their part he found it somewhat difficult to recover them all but he finally succeeded he also sent commissions to all the towns and villages which had been implicated in the rebellion and caused great numbers of persons to be tried and condemned to death many thousands were thus executed indeed the rebellion had extended far and wide for besides the disturbances in and near london there had been risings in all parts of the kingdom and great excesses committed every where  when the rebellion was thus quelled things returned for a time into substantially the same condition as before and yet the bondage of the people was never afterward so abject and hopeless as it had been a considerable general improvement was the result indeed such outbreaks as this against oppression are like the earthquakes of south america which though they cause for the time great terror and often much destruction still have the effect to raise the general level of the land and leave it forever afterward in a better condition than before  the cause of these rebels moreover badly as they managed it was in the main a just cause and it is to precisely such convulsive struggles as these that have been made from time to time by the common people of england in the course of their history that their descendants the present commons of england and the people of america are indebted for the personal rights and liberties which they now enjoy     chapter xi  good queen anne  ad 13821394  the planning of richards first marriagejourney of the bridal party toward englandtheir way is

his first queen was named anne she was a bohemian princess and so is sometimes called in history anne of bohemia she was however more commonly called good queen anne  the marriage was planned by richards courtiers and counselors when richard himself was about fifteen years old the negotiations were interrupted by the troubles connected with the insurrection described in the two last chapters but immediately after the insurrection was quelled they were renewed the proposals were sent to bohemia by richards government after suitable inquiries had been made by annes parents and friends the proposals were accepted and preparations were made for sending anne to england to be married richard was now about sixteen years of age anne was fifteen neither of them had ever seen the other  in due time when every thing had been made ready the princess set out on her journey accompanied by a large train of attendants she was under the charge of a nobleman named the duke of saxony and of his wife the duchess the duchess was annes aunt besides the duke there were in the party a number of knights and other persons of distinction and also several young ladies of the court who went to accompany and wait upon the princess there were also many other attendants of lower degree  the party traveled slowly as was the custom in those days until at length they reached flanders here at brussels the capital the princess was received by the duke and duchess of brabant who were her relatives and was entertained by them in a very sumptuous manner she however heard alarming news at brussels the intention of the party had been to take ship on the coast of flanders and proceed to calais by water calais was then in the hands of the english and an embassador with a grand suite had been sent from richards court to receive the princess on her arrival there and conduct her across the channel to dover and thence to london  the reason why the princess and her party did not propose to go by land all the way to calais was that by so doing they would necessarily pass through the territories of the king of france and they were afraid that the french government would intercept them it was known that the government of france had been opposed to the match as tending to give richard too much influence on the continent  but now on their arrival at brussels the bridal party learned that there was a fleet of norman vessels ten or twelve in number that were cruising to and fro on the coast between brussels and calais with a view of blocking up the princesss way by sea as well as by land both she herself and the duke of saxony were much chagrined at receiving this information and for a time they did not know what to do at length they sent an embassage to paris and after some difficulties and delay they succeeded in obtaining the consent of the french government that the princess should pass through the french territories by land the embassadors brought back a passport for her and for her party  although the king of france thus granted the desired permission he did it in a very ungracious manner for he took care to say that he yielded to the duke of saxonys request solely out of kindness to his good cousin anne and a desire to do her a favor and not at all out of regard to the king of england  the princess was detained a month in brussels while they were arranging this affair and when at last it was settled she resumed her journey taking the road from brussels to calais the duke of brabant accompanied her with an escort of one hundred spearmen this however was an escort of honor rather than of protection as the duke relied mainly upon the french passport for the safety of the party  as the party were approaching calais they were received at the town of gravelines by the english embassador and his suite who had come out from calais to meet them this embassador was the earl of salisbury he was attended by a force of one thousand men namely five hundred spearmen and five hundred archers conducted by this grand escort and accompanied by a large cavalcade of knights and nobles all clad in full armor and splendidly mounted the princess and the ladies in her train made a magnificent entry into calais through the midst of a vast concourse of spectators with trumpets sounding and banners waving and their hearts beating high with ecstasy and delight in passing over the drawbridge and through the gates of calais anne felt an emotion of exultation and pride in thinking that she was here entering the dominions of her future husband  the princess did not remain long in calais she set out on the following day for dover the distance across is about twenty miles they were dependent wholly on the wind in those days for crossing the channel but the princess had a prosperous passage and arrived safely at dover that night news then spread rapidly all over the country and ran up to london that the queen had come  the news of course produced universal excitement no certain tidings of the movements of the bride had been heard for some weeks before and no one could tell when to expect her her arrival awakened universal joy parliament was in session at the time they voted a large sum of money to be expended in arrangements for receiving the young queen in a proper manner and in public rejoicings on the occasion they then immediately adjourned and all the world began to prepare for the arrival of the royal cortége in london  the princess after resting a day in dover moved on to canterbury admiring as she journeyed the beautiful scenery of the country over which she was henceforth to be queen richards uncle thomas the duke of gloucester with a large retinue was ready there to receive her he conducted her to london as they approached the city the lordmayor of london and all the great civic functionaries with a long train of attendants came out in great state to receive her and escort her into town the place of their meeting with her was blackheath the same place which a year before had been the bivouac of the immense horde of ragged and miserable men that wat tyler and his fellowinsurgents had brought to london but how changed now was the scene then the country was excited by the deepest anxiety and alarm and the spectacle on the field was that of one immense mass of squalid poverty and wretchedness of misery reduced by hopeless suffering to recklessness and despair now all was gayety and splendor in the spectacle and the whole country was excited to the highest pitch of exultation and joy  at blackheath the grand cavalcade was formed for passing through london splendid preparations had been made in london to receive the bride and to do honor to her passage through the city many of these preparations were similar to those which had been made on the occasion of the kings coronation there was a castle and tower with young girls at the top throwing down a shower of golden snow and fountains at the sides flowing with wine with fancifullydressed pages attending to offer the princess drink from golden cups in a word the young and beautiful bride was received by the civic authorities of london with the same tokens of honor and the same public rejoicings that had been accorded to the king  in a few days the marriage took place the ceremony was performed in the chapel royal of the kings palace at westminster the king appeared to be very much pleased with his bride and paid her great attention after a week spent with her and the court in festivities and rejoicings in westminster he took her up the river to the royal castle at windsor his mother the princess of wales and other ladies of rank went with them and formed part of their household they lived here very happily together for some time  the young queen soon began to evince those kind and gracious qualities of heart which afterward made her so beloved among the people of england instead of occupying herself solely with her own greatness and grandeur and with the uninterrupted round of pleasures to which her husband invited her she began very soon to think of the sufferings which she found that a great many of the common people of england were enduring and to consider what she could do to relieve them the condition of the people was particularly unhappy at this time for the king and the nobles were greatly exasperated against them on account of the rebellion and were hunting out all who could be proved or were even suspected to have been engaged in it and persecuting them in the most severe and oppressive manner and they were bloody and barbarous beyond precedent the young queen hearing of these things was greatly distressed and she begged the king for her sake to grant a general pardon to all his subjects on the occasion of her coronation which ceremony was now soon to be performed the king granted this request and thus peace and tranquillity were once more fully restored to the land  after this during all her life anne watched for every opportunity to do good and she was continually engaged in gentle but effective efforts to heal dissensions to assuage angry feelings and to alleviate suffering she was a general peacemaker and her lofty position and the great influence which she exercised over the king gave her great power to accomplish the benevolent purposes which the kindness of her heart led her to form  the arrival of the young queen produced a great sensation among the ladies of richards court in consequence of the new fashions which she introduced into england the fashions of dress in those days were very peculiar we learn what they were from the pictures drawn with the pen or painted in watercolors in the manuscripts of those days that still remain in the old english libraries there are a great many of these drawings and as they agree together in the style and fashion of the costumes represented there is no doubt that they give us correct ideas of the dresses really worn besides there are many allusions in the chronicles of those times and in poems and books of accounts which correspond precisely with the drawings and thus confirm their correctness and accuracy  the engravings on the following page are copied from one of these ancient manuscripts  observe the singular forms of the caps both those of the men and of the women the men wore sometimes jackets and sometimes long gowns which came down to the ground the most singular feature of the dresses of the men however is the longpointed shoes were it not that fashions are often equally absurd at the present day we should think it impossible that such shoes as these could ever have been made  illustration male costume in the time of richard ii  illustration female costume in the time of richard ii  these shoes were called cracows cracow was a town in poland which was at that time within the dominions of annes father and it is supposed that the fashion of wearing these shoes may have been brought into england by some of the gentlemen in annes train when she came to england to be married it is known that the queen did introduce a great many foreign fashions to the court and among the rest a fashion of headdress for ladies which was quite as strange as peaked shoes for the gentlemen it consisted of what was called the horned cap  illustration fashionable headdresses  these horns were often two feet high and sometimes two feet wide from one side to the other the frame of this headdress was made of wire and pasteboard and the covering was of some glittering tissue or gauze there were other headdresses scarcely less monstrous than these some of them are represented in the engraving these fashions when introduced by the queen spread with great rapidity among all the court ladies and thence to all fashionable circles in england  it is said too that it was this young queen who first introduced pins into england dresses had been fastened before by little skewers made of wood or ivory queen anne brought pins which had been made for some time in germany and the use of them soon extended all over england  sidesaddles for ladies on horseback were a third fashion which queen anne is said to have introduced the sidesaddle which she brought was however of a very simple construction it consisted of a seat placed upon the horses back with a sort of step depending from it on one side for the feet to rest upon both feet were placed upon this step together  queen anne after her marriage lived very happily with her husband for twelve years she was devotedly attached to him and he seems sincerely to have loved her he was naturally kind and affectionate in his disposition and while anne lived he yielded himself to the good influences which she exerted over him she journeyed with him wherever he went and aided him in the accomplishment of all his plans whenever he became involved in any difficulty either with his nobles or with his subjects she acted the part of mediator and almost always succeeded in allaying the animosity and healing the feud before it proceeded to extremes she resided with her husband sometimes at one palace and sometimes at another but her favorite residence was at the palace of shene near the present town of richmond  although the king was crowned at the time of his accession to the throne he did not fully assume the government at that time on account of his youth for you will remember that he was then only about eleven years old nor did he in fact come fully into possession of power at the time of his marriage for he was then under sixteen at that time and for several years afterward his uncles and the other influential nobles managed the government in his name at length however when he was about twentyone years old he thought it was time for him to assume the direction of affairs himself and he accordingly did so at this time there was another grand celebration one scarcely inferior in pomp and splendor to the coronation itself  among other performances on this occasion there was a tournament in which knights mounted on horseback and armed from head to foot with iron armor fought in the lists endeavoring to unhorse each other by means of their spears the tournament was held at smithfield raised platforms were set up by the side of the lists for the lords and ladies of the court and a beautiful canopy for the queen who was to act as judge of the combat and was to award the prizes the prizes consisted of a rich jeweled clasp and a splendid crown of gold  the queen went first to the ground and took her place with her attendants under her canopy the knights who were to enter the lists then came in a grand cavalcade through the streets of london to the palace there were sixty ladies mounted on beautiful palfreys accoutred with the newfashioned sidesaddles each of these ladies conducted a knight whom she led by a silver chain they were preceded by minstrels and bands of instrumental music and the streets were thronged with spectators  after the tournament there was a grand banquet at the palace of the bishop of london with music and dancing and other such amusements which continued to a late hour of the night                                       for some years after this the king and queen lived together in great prosperity outwardly things went pretty well with the kings affairs and as he was fond of pomp and display he gradually acquired habits of very profuse and lavish expenditure indeed he is said to have made it an object of his ambition to surpass in the magnificence of his style of living all the sovereigns of europe he kept many separate establishments in his different palaces and at all of them gave entertainments and banquets of immense magnificence and of the most luxurious character it is said that three hundred persons were employed in his kitchens  at length in the year 1394 when richard was preparing for an expedition into ireland to quell a rebellion which had broken out there the queen was seized with a fatal epidemic which was then prevailing in england and after a short illness she died she was at her palace of shene at this time the king hastened to attend her the moment that he heard the tidings of her illness and was with her when she died he was inconsolable at the loss of his wife for he had loved her sincerely and she had been a singularly faithful and devoted wife to him he was made almost crazy by her death he imprecated bitter curses on the palace where she died and he ordered it to be destroyed it was in fact partially dismantled in obedience to these orders and richard himself never occupied it again it was however repaired under a subsequent reign  richard gave up for the time being his expedition into ireland being wholly absorbed in his sorrow for the irreparable loss he had suffered he wrote letters to all the great nobles and barons of england to come to the funeral and the obsequies were celebrated with the greatest possible pomp and parade two months were expended in making preparations for the funeral when the day arrived a very long procession was formed to escort the body from shene to westminster this procession was accompanied by an immense number of torchbearers all carrying lighted torches in their hands so great was the number of these torches that a large quantity of wax was imported from flanders expressly for the purpose  the tomb of anne was not made until a year after her death richard himself attended to all the details connected with the construction of it the inscription was in latin the following is an exact translation of it       under this stone lies anne here entombed      wedded in this worlds life to the second richard      to christ were her meek virtues devoted      his poor she freely fed from her treasures      strife she assuaged and swelling feuds appeased      beauteous her form her face surpassing fair      on julys seventh day thirteen hundred ninetyfour      all comfort was bereft for through irremediable sickness      she passed away into interminable joys  by the death of his wife richard was left as it were almost alone in the world his mother the princess of wales had died some time before and anne had had no children there were his uncles and his cousins it is true but they were his rivals and competitors rather than his friends indeed they were destined soon to become his open enemies  richard was afterward married again to his little wife as we shall see in a future chapter     chapter xii  incidents of the reign

the character of richards reign and of the incidents that occurred during the course of it we now go back a little again so as to begin at the beginning of it  when richard was married he was as has already been said only about fifteen or sixteen years of age as he grew older after this time and began to feel that sense of strength and independence which pertains to manhood he became more and more jealous of the power and influence of his uncles in the government of the country his mother too who was still living and who adhered closely to him was very suspicious of the uncles she was continually imagining that they were forming plots and conspiracies against her son in favor of themselves or of their own children she was particularly suspicious of the duke of lancaster and of his son henry bolingbroke it proved in the end that there was some reason for this suspicion for this henry bolingbroke was the means at last of deposing richard from his throne in order to take possession of it himself as we shall see in the sequel  in order to prevent as far as possible these uncles from finding opportunity to accomplish any of their supposed designs richard and his mother excluded them as much as they could from power and appointed other persons who had no such claims to the crown to all the important places about the court this of course made the uncles very angry they called the men whom richard thus brought forward his favorites and they hated them exceedingly this state of things led to a great many intrigues and manoeuvres and plots and counterplots the favorites against the uncles and the uncles against the favorites these difficulties were continued for many years parties were formed in parliament of which sometimes one was in the ascendency and sometimes the other and all was turmoil and confusion  when richard was about twenty years old one of his uncleshis uncle thomas at that time duke of gloucestergained such an influence in parliament that some of richards favorites were deposed from office and imprisoned the duke was imboldened by this success to take a farther step he told the parliament that the government would never be on a good footing until they themselves appointed a council to manage in the kings name  when richard heard of this plan he declared that he would never submit to it  i am the king of england said he and i will govern my realm by means of such officers as i choose to appoint myself i will not have others to appoint them for me  the ideas which the kings of those days entertained in respect to the province of parliament was that it was to vote the necessary taxes to supply the kings necessities and also to mature the details of all laws for the regulation of the ordinary business and the social relations of life but that the government strictly so calledthat is all that relates to the appointment and payment of executive officers the making of peace or war the building and equipment of fleets and the command of armies was exclusively the kings prerogative and that for the exercise of his prerogative in these particulars the sovereign was responsible not to his subjects but to god alone from whom he claimed to have received his crown  the people of england as represented by parliament have never consented to this view of the subject they have always maintained that their kings are in some sense responsible to the people of the realm and they have often deposed kings and punished them in other ways  accordingly when richard declared that he would not submit to the appointment of a council by parliament the commons reminded him of the fact that his greatgrandfather edward the second had been deposed in consequence of having unreasonably and obstinately resisted the will of his people and they hinted to him that it would be well for him to beware lest he should incur the same fate some of the lords too told him that the excitement was so great in the country on account of the mismanagement of public affairs and the corruptions and malpractice of the favorites that if he refused to allow the council to be appointed there was danger that he would lose his head  so richard was obliged to submit and the council was appointed richard was in a great rage and he secretly determined to lay his plans for recovering the power into his own hands as soon as possible and punishing the council and all who were concerned in appointing them for their audacity in presuming to encroach in such a manner upon his sovereign rights as king  the council that was appointed consisted of eleven bishops and nobles richards uncle thomas the duke of gloucester was at the head of it this council governed the country for more than a year every thing was done in richards name it is true but the real power was in the hands of the duke of gloucester richard was very angry and indignant but he did not see what he could do  he was however all the time forming plans and schemes to recover his power at last after about a year had passed away he called together a number of judges secretly at nottingham toward the northern part of the kingdom and submitted to them the question whether such a council as the parliament had appointed was legal it was of course understood beforehand how the judges would decide they decreed that the council was illegal that for parliament to give a council such powers was a violation of the kings prerogative and was consequently treason and that of course all who had been concerned in the transaction had made themselves liable to the penalty of death  it was richards plan after having obtained this decree to cause the prominent members of the council to be arrested and he came to london and began to make his preparations for accomplishing this purpose but as soon as his uncle thomas the duke of gloucester heard of these plans he and some great nobles who were ready to join with him against the king collected all their forces and began to march to london at the head of forty thousand men richards cousin henry the duke of lancasters son joined them on the way richards friends and favorites on hearing of this immediately took arms and preparations began to be made for civil war in a word after having successfully met and quelled the great insurrection of the serfs and laborers under wat tyler richard was now to encounter a still more formidable resistance of his authority on the part of his uncles and the great barons of the realm these last indeed were far more to be feared than the others for they had arms and organization and they enjoyed every possible facility for carrying on a vigorous and determined war richard and his party soon found that it was useless to attempt to resist them accordingly after a very brief struggle the royal party was entirely put down richards favorites were arrested some of them were beheaded others were banished from the realm and the government of the country fell again into the hands of the uncles  one of richards favorites who was executed on this occasion was a man whose untimely death grieved and afflicted both richard and the queen very much indeed his name was sir simon burley he had been richards friend and companion all his life richards father edward the black prince had appointed sir simon richards tutor while richard himself was a mere child and he had been with him ever since that time queen anne was much attached to him and she was particularly grateful to him on account of his having been the commissioner who negotiated and arranged her marriage with richard richard made every possible exertion to save his tutors life but his uncle gloucester was inexorable he told richard that his keeping the crown depended on the immediate execution of the traitor queen anne fell on her knees before him and begged and entreated that sir simon might be spared but all was of no avail  so richard was compelled to submit but he did not do so without secret muttering and resolutions of revenge he allowed the government to remain in his uncles hands for some time but at length about a year afterward he found himself strong enough to seize it again the plea which his uncles had hitherto made for managing the government themselves was that richard was not yet of age but now he became of age and he resolved on what might be called a coup détat to get possession of the government he planned this measure in concert with a number of his own friends and favorites who hoped by this means that they themselves should rise to power  he called a grand council of all the nobles and great officers of state the assembly convened in the great councilchamber and waited there for the king to come in  at length the king arrived and walking into the chamber he took his seat upon the throne a moment afterward he turned to one of the chief officers present and addressed him saying  my lord what is my age at the present time  the nobleman answered that his majesty was now over twenty years of age  then said the king speaking in a very firm and determined manner i am of years sufficient to govern mine own house and family and also my kingdom for it seemeth against reason that the state of the meanest person in my kingdom should be better than mine every heir throughout the land that has once come to the age of twenty years is permitted if his father be not living to order his business himself and that which is permitted by law to every other person of however mean degree why is it denied to me  the king spoke these words with an air of such courage and determination that the barons were astonished the foremost of them after a brief pause seemed ready to accede to his proposals they said that there should henceforth be no right abridged from him but that he might take upon himself the government if he chose as it was now manifestly his duty to do  very well said the king you know that i have been a long time ruled by tutors and governors so that it has not been lawful for me to do any thing no matter of how small importance without their consent now therefore i desire that henceforth they meddle no more with matters pertaining to my government for i will attend to them myself and after the manner of an heir arrived at full age i will call whom i please to be my counsel and thus manage my own affairs according to my own will and pleasure  the barons were extremely surprised to hear these determinations thus resolutely announced by the king but had nothing to say in reply  and in the first place continued richard i wish the chancellor to give me up the great seal  the great seal was a very important badge and emblem of the royal prerogative no decree was of legal authority until an impress from this seal was attached to it the officer who had charge of it was called the chancellor a new seal was prepared for each sovereign on his accession to the throne the devices were much the same in all they consisted of a representation of the king seated on his throne upon one side of the seal and on the other mounted on horseback and going into battle armed from head to foot the legends or inscriptions around the border were changed of course for each reign  the engraving on the following page represents one side of king richards seal the other side contained an image of the king seated on his throne and surrounded by various insignia of royalty  i wish the chancellor said the king to deliver me up the great seal  illustration seal of richard ii  so the nobleman who had been chancellor up to that time delivered the seal into the hands of the king the seal was kept in a beautiful box richly ornamented it was always brought to the council by the lord chancellor who had it in charge the king proceeded immediately afterward to appoint a new chancellor and to place the box in his hands in the same summary manner the king displaced almost all the other high officers of state and appointed new ones of his own instead of them the former officers were obliged to submit though sorely against their will they were powerless for the king had now attained such an age that there was no longer any excuse for withholding from him the complete possession of his kingdom  from this time accordingly richard was actually as well as nominally king of england but still he was often engaged in contentions and quarrels with his uncles and with the other great nobles who took his uncles part  the queenfor good queen anne was at this time still livingwas so gentle and kind and she acted her part as peacemaker so well that she greatly softened and soothed these asperities but richard led nevertheless a wild and turbulent life and was continually getting involved in the most serious difficulties then there were wars to be carried on sometimes with france sometimes with scotland and sometimes with ireland richards uncles the dukes of lancaster and gloucester generally went away in command of the armies to carry on these wars sometimes richard himself accompanied the expeditions but even on these occasions when he and his knights and nobles were engaged together in a common cause and apparently at peace with each other there were so many jealousies and angry heartburnings among them that deadly quarrels and feuds were continually breaking out  as an example of these quarrels i will give an account of one which took place not very long after richard was married he was engaged with his uncles in an expedition to scotland there was a knight in attendance upon him named sir miles this knight was a friend of the queen he was a bohemian and had come from bohemia to pay anne a visit and to bring the news to her from her native land the king out of affection to anne paid him great attention this made the english knights and nobles jealous and they amused themselves with mimicking and laughing at sir miless foreign peculiarities the particular friends of the queen however took his part one especially named the earl of stafford and his son the young lord ralph stafford lord ralph stafford was one of the most courteous and popular knights in england  in the course of the expedition to scotland the party came to a town called beverley which is situated in the northern part of england near the frontier one day two archers belonging to the service of lord ralph stafford in riding across the fields near beverley found two squires engaged in a sort of quarrel with sir miles the cause of the quarrel was something about his lodgings in the town the squires it seems knowing that the knights and nobles generally disliked sir miles were encouraged to be very bold and insolent to him in expressing their illwill and when the archers came up they were following him with taunts and ridicule and abuse while sir miles was making the best of his way toward the town  the archers took the bohemians part they remonstrated with the squires for thus abusing and teasing a stranger and a foreigner a personal friend too and guest of the queen  what business is it of yours villainous knave whether we laugh at him or not said the squires what right have you to intermeddle what is it to you  what is it to us repeated one of the archers it is a great deal to us this man is the friend of our master and we will not stand by and see him abused  upon hearing this one of the squires uttered some words of defiance and advanced as if to strike the archer but the archer having his bow and arrow all ready suddenly let the arrow fly and the squire was killed on the spot  sir miles had already gone on toward the town the other squire seeing his companion dead immediately made his escape the two archers leaving the man whom they had killed on the ground where he had fallen made the best of their way home and told their master sir ralph stafford what they had done  sir ralph was extremely concerned to hear of the occurrence and he told the archer who killed the squire that he had done very wrong  but my lord said the archer i could not have done otherwise for the man was coming up to us with his sword drawn in his hand and we were obliged either to kill him or to be killed ourselves  the archers moreover told sir ralph that the squires were in the service of sir john holland now sir john holland was a half brother of the king being the child of his mother the princess of wales by a former husband when sir ralph heard this he was still more alarmed than before he told the archers who killed the squire that they must go and hide themselves somewhere until the affair could be arranged  i will negotiate with lord holland for your pardon said he either through my father or in some other way but in the mean time you must keep yourselves closely concealed  the earl of stafford lord ralph staffords father was a nobleman of the very highest rank and of great influence  it is a curious indication of the ideas that prevailed in those days and of the relations that subsisted between the nobles and their dependants that the slaughter of a man in an affray of this kind was a matter to be arranged between the masters respectively of the men engaged in it  the archers went away to hide themselves until lord ralph could arrange the matter  in the mean time the squire who had escaped in the fray hurried home and related the matter to lord holland lord holland was greatly enraged he uttered dreadful imprecations against lord ralph stafford and against sir miles whom he seemed to consider responsible for the death of his squire and declared that he would not sleep until he had had his revenge so he mounted his horse and taking some trusty attendants with him rode into beverley and asked where sir miless lodgings were while he was going toward the place breathing fury and death suddenly in a narrow lane he came upon lord ralph who was then going to find him in order to arrange about the murder it was now however late in the evening and so dark that the parties did not at first know each other  who comes here said lord holland when he saw sir ralph approaching  i am stafford replied sir ralph  you are the very man i want to see said lord holland one of your servants has killed my squirethe one that i loved so much  as he said this he brought down so heavy a blow upon sir ralphs head as to fell him from his horse to the ground he then rode on the attendants hurried to the spot and raised sir ralph up they found him faint and bleeding and in a few moments he died  as soon as this fact was ascertained one of the men rode on after lord holland and coming up to him said  my lord you have killed lord stafford  very well said lord holland i am glad of it i would rather it would be a man of his rank than any body else for so i am the more completely revenged for the death of my squire  as fast as the tidings of these events spread they produced universal excitement the earl of stafford the father of sir ralph was plunged into the most inconsolable grief at the death of his son the earl was one of the most powerful nobles in the army and if he had undertaken to avenge himself on lord holland the whole expedition would perhaps have been broken up into confusion on the kings solemn assurance that holland would be punished he was appeased for the time but then the princess of wales richards mother who was lord hollands mother too was thrown into the greatest state of anxiety and distress she implored richard to save his brothers life all the other nobles and knights took sides too in the quarrel and for a time it seemed that the dissension would never be healed lord holland in the mean while fled to the church at beverley and took sanctuary there by the laws and customs of the time they could not touch him until he came voluntarily out  richard resisted all the entreaties of his mother to spare the murderers life until he found that her anxiety and distress were preying upon her health so much that he feared that she would die at last to save his mothers life he promised that holland should be spared but it was too late his mother fell into a decline and at length died as it was said of a broken heart what a dreadful death that of a mother worn out by the agony of longcontinued and apparently fruitless efforts to prevent one of her children from being the executioner of another for the crime of murder  besides these fierce deadly contests among the knights and nobles the ladies of the court had their feuds and quarrels too they were often divided into cliques and parties and were full of envyings jealousies and resentments against each other one of the most serious of these difficulties was occasioned by a marriage of the duke of lancaster which took place toward the close of his life this was his third marriage he having been successively married to two ladies of high rank before the lady whom he now married was of a comparatively humble station in life she was the daughter of a foreign knight her name originally was catharine de rouet she had been in her early life a maiden in attendance on the duchess of lancaster the dukes second wife while she was in his family the duke formed a guilty intimacy with her which was continued for a long time they had three children the duke provided well for these children and gave them a good education after a time the duke becoming tired of her arranged for her to be married to a certain knight named swinton and she lived with this knight for some time until at length he died and catharine became a widow  the duchess of lancaster died also and then the duke became for the second time a widower and he now conceived the idea of making catharine swinton his wife his motive for this was not his love for her for that it is said had passed away but his regard for the children who on the marriage of their mother to the father of the children would be legitimatized and would thus become entitled to many legal rights and privileges from which they would otherwise be debarred the other ladies of the court however particularly the wives of the other dukesthe duke of lancasters brotherswere greatly incensed when they heard of this proposed marriage and they did all they possibly could do to prevent it all was however of no avail for the duke of lancaster was not a man to be easily thwarted in any determination that he might take into his head so he was married and the poor despised catharine was made the first duchess in the realm and became entitled to take precedence of all the other duchesses  this the other duchesses could not endure they could not bear it they said and they would not bear it they declared that they would not go into any place where this woman as they called her was to be as might have been expected an interminable amount of quarreling and illwill grew out of this affair  about the time of this marriage of the duke the king himself was married a second time

entertainmentrichard receives his bridethe palanquinexcitement in londonreception of the little queenthe little queens mode of life in england   king richards second wife was called the little queen because she was so young and small when she was married she was only about nine years old at that time the story of this case will show a little how the marriages of kings and princesses in those days were managed  it was not long after the death of good queen anne before some of richards courtiers and counselors began to advise him to be married again he replied as men always do in such cases that he did not know where to find a wife the choice was indeed not very large being restricted by etiquette to the royal families of england and of the neighboring countries several princesses were proposed one after another but richard did not seem to like any of them among other ladies one of his cousins was proposed to him a daughter of the duke of gloucester but richard said no she was too nearly related to him  at last he took it into his head that he should like to marry little isabella the princess of france then about nine years old the idea of his being married to isabella was calculated to surprise people for two reasons first because isabella was so small and secondly because the king of france her father was richards greatest and most implacable enemy france and england had been on bad terms with each other not only during the whole of richards reign but through a great number of reigns preceding and now just before the period when this marriage was proposed the two nations had been engaged in a long and sanguinary war but richard said that he was going to make peace and that this marriage was to be the means of confirming it  but she is altogether too young for your majesty said richards counselors she is a mere child  true said the king but that is an objection which will grow less and less every year besides i am in no haste i am young enough myself to wait till she grows up and in the mean time i can have her trained and educated to suit me exactly  so after a great deal of debate among the kings counselors and in parliament it was finally decided to send a grand embassage to paris to propose to the king of france that he should give his little daughter isabella in marriage to richard king of england  this embassage consisted of an archbishop two earls and twenty knights attended each by two squires making forty squires in all and five hundred horsemen the party proceeded from london to dover then crossed to calais which was at this time an english possession and thence proceeded to paris  when they arrived at paris they entered the city with great pomp and parade being received with great honor by the french king and they were lodged sumptuously in quarters provided for them  the embassadors were also very honorably received at court the king invited them to dine with him and entertained them handsomely but many objections were made to the proposed marriage  how can we said the french counselors give a princess of france in marriage to our worst and bitterest enemy  to this the embassadors replied that the marriage would establish and confirm a permanent peace between the two countries  then there was another objection isabella was already engaged she had been betrothed some time before to the son of a duke of one of the neighboring countries but the embassadors said that they thought this could be arranged  while these negotiations were going on the embassadors asked permission to see the princess this at first the king and queen isabellas father and mother declined they said that she was only eight or nine years old and that such a child would not know at all how to conduct at such an interview  however the interview was granted at last the embassadors were conducted to an apartment in the palace of the louvre where the princess and her parents were ready to receive them on coming into the presence of the child the chief embassador advanced to her and kneeling down before her he said  madam if it please god you shall be our lady and queen  the princess looked at him attentively while he said this she was a very beautiful child with a gentle and thoughtful expression of countenance and large dark eyes full of meaning  she replied to the embassador of her own accord in a clear childish voice  sir if it please god and my lord and father that i be queen of england i should be well pleased for i have been told that there i shall be a great lady  isabella then took the kneeling embassador by the hand and lifted him up she then led him to her mother  the embassadors were extremely pleased with the appearance and behavior of the princess and were more than ever desirous of succeeding in their mission but after some farther negotiations they received for their answer that the french court were disposed to entertain favorably the proposal which richard made but that nothing could be determined upon the subject at that time  we must wait said the king until we can see what arrangement can be made in regard to the princesss present engagement and then if king richard will send to us again next spring we will give a final answer  so slow are the movements and operations in such a case as this among the great that the embassadors were occupied three weeks in paris in advancing the business to this point they were however well satisfied with what they had done and at length took their leave and returned to london in high spirits with their success and reported the result to king richard he himself was well satisfied too  the negotiations went on prosperously during the winter and in the spring another embassage was sent larger than the preceding the attendants of this embassage were several thousand in number and they occupied a whole street in paris when they arrived there by this embassage the arrangement of the marriage was finally concluded the ceremony was in fact performed for isabella was actually married to richard by proxy as it is called a customary mode of conducting marriages between a princess and a king one of the embassadors a grand officer of state personated king richard on this occasion and the marriage was celebrated with the greatest possible pomp and splendor  besides the marriage contracts there were various other treaties and covenants to be drawn up and signed and sealed all this business required so much time that this embassage like the other remained three weeks in paris and then they returned home to london and reported to richard what they had done  still the affair was not yet fully settled a great many of the nobles and the people of england very strenuously opposed the match for they wished the war with france to be continued this was particularly the case with richards uncle the duke of gloucester he had greatly distinguished himself in the war thus far and he wished it to be continued so he did all he could to oppose the consummation of the marriage and the negotiations and delays were long protracted richard however persevered and at length the obstacles were so far removed that in the fall of 1396 he began to organize a grand expedition to go with him to the frontiers of france to receive his bride  immense preparations were made on both sides for the ceremonial of this visit the meeting was to take place on the frontier since neither sovereign dared to trust himself within the dominions of the other for fear of treachery for the same reason each one deemed it necessary to take with him a very large armed force great stores of provisions for the expedition were accordingly prepared and sent on beforehand portions being sent down the thames from london and the rest being purchased in flanders and other countries on the continent and forwarded to calais by water the king of france also for the use of his party sent stores from paris to all the towns in the neighborhood of the frontier  among the ladies of the court on both sides there was universal emulation and excitement in respect to plans and preparations which they had to make for the wedding great numbers of them were to accompany the expedition and nothing was talked of but the dresses and decorations which they should wear and the parts that they should respectively perform in the grand parade hundreds of armorers and smiths and other artisans were employed in repairing and embellishing the armor of the knights and barons and in designing and executing new banners and new caparisons for the horses richer and more splendid than were ever known before  there was a great deal of heartburning and illwill in respect to the duke of lancasters new wife with whom the other ladies of the court had declared they would not associate on any terms the king was determined that she should go on the expedition and the other ladies consequently found themselves obliged either to submit to her presence or forego the grandest display which they would ever have the opportunity to witness as long as they should live they concluded to submit though they did it with great reluctance and with a very ill grace  at length every thing was ready and the expedition leaving london journeyed to dover and then crossed the straits to calais a long time was then consumed in negotiations in respect to the peace for although richard himself was willing to make peace on almost any terms so that he might obtain his little bride his uncles and the other leading nobles made great difficulties and it was a long time before the treaties could be arranged at length however every thing was settled and the preparations were made for delivering to richard his bride  two magnificent pavilions were erected near the frontier one on the french and the other on the english side these pavilions were for the use of the two monarchs respectively and of their lords and nobles then in the centre between these and of course exactly upon the frontier a third and more open pavilion was set up in this central pavilion the two kings were to have their first meeting for either of the kings to have entered first into the dominions of the other would have been in some sense an acknowledgment of inferiority on his part so it was contrived that neither should first visit the other but that they should advance together each from his own pavilion and meet in the central one after which they could visit each other as it might be convenient the first interview therefore took place in the centre pavilion it was necessary however to take some strong precautions against treachery accordingly before the meeting an oath was administered to both monarchs by which each one solemnly asseverated that he was acting in good faith in this transaction and that he had no secret reservation or treachery in his heart and pledged his sacred honor that the other should suffer no violence damage molestation arrest constraint or any other inconvenience whatever during the interview  as an additional precaution a strong force consisting of four hundred knights on each side all fully armed were drawn up on opposite sides of the central pavilion the english troops on the english side and the french on the french sidei these troops were arranged in such a manner that the king of england should pass between the ranks of the english knights in going to the pavilion and the french king between the french knights  footnote i besides these knights each of the kings had a strong force stationed in reserve at a little distance from their respective pavilions to be ready in case of any difficulty  things being thus arranged at the appointed hour the two kings set out together from their own pavilions and walked accompanied each by a number of dukes and nobles of high rank to the central pavilion here the kings both being uncovered approached each other they saluted each other in a very friendly manner and held a brief conversation together some of the accounts say that the french king then taking the english king by the hand led him to the french tent the french dukes who had accompanied him following with the english dukes who had accompanied richard and that there the whole party partook of refreshment  however this may be the first interview was one mainly of ceremony afterward there were other interviews in the different pavilions these alternating visits were continued for several days until at length the time was appointed for a final meeting at which the little queen was to be delivered into her husbands hands  this final grand ceremony took place in the french pavilion the order of proceeding was as follows first there was a grand entertainment the table was splendidly laid out and there was a sideboard loaded with costly plate at the table the kings were waited upon by dukes during the dinner richard talked with the king of france about his wife and about the peace which was now so happily confirmed and established between the two countries  after dinner the cloth was removed and the tables were taken away when the pavilion was cleared a door was opened and a party of ladies of the french court headed by the queen came in conducting the little princess as soon as she had entered the king of france took her by the hand and led her to richard richard received her with a warm welcome and lifting her up in his arms kissed her he told the king of france that he was fully sensible of the value of such a gift and that he received it as a pledge of perpetual amity and peace between the two countries he also as had been previously agreed upon solemnly renounced all claim to the throne of france on account of isabella or her descendants forever  he then immediately committed the princess to the hands of the duchess of lancaster and the other ladies and they at once conveyed her to the door of the tent here there was a sort of palanquin magnificently made and adorned waiting to receive her the princess was put into this palanquin and immediately set out for calais richard and the immense train of knights and nobles followed and thus at a very rapid pace the whole party returned to calais  a few days after this the marriage ceremony was performed anew between richard and isabella richard himself being personally present this time great was the parade and great the rejoicing on this occasion after the marriage the little queen was again put under the charge of the duchess of lancaster and the other english ladies who had been appointed to receive her  in the mean time all london was becoming every day more and more excited in expectation of the arrival of the bridal party there great preparations were made for receiving them at length about a fortnight after taking leave of her father isabella arrived in london she spent the first night at the tower and on the following day passed through london to westminster in a grand procession an immense concourse of people assembled on the occasion indeed such was the eagerness of the people to see the queen on her arrival in london that there were nine persons crushed to death by the crowd on london bridge when she was passing over it  the queen took up her residence at windsor castle where she was under the charge of the duchess of lancaster and other ladies who were to superintend her education king richard used to come and visit her very often and on such occasions she was excused from her studies and so she was always glad to see him besides he used to talk with her and play with her in a very friendly and affectionate manner he was now about thirty years old and she was ten he however liked her very much for she was very beautiful and very amiable and affectionate in her manners she liked to have richard come and see her too for his visits not only released her for the time from her studies but he was very gentle and kind to her and he used to play to her on musical instruments and sing to her and amuse her in various other ways she admired moreover the splendor of his dress for he always came in very magnificent apparel  in a word richard and his little queen notwithstanding the disparity of their years were both very well pleased with the match which they had made richard was proud of the youth and beauty of his wife and isabella was proud of the greatness power and glory of her husband     chapter xiv  richards deposition and death  ad 13971399  difficulties of richards positionhis rivalsplot discoveredrichard arrests his uncle

queenher return to francesequel of the story of the little queen   it was not long after richards marriage to the little queen before the troubles and difficulties in which his government was involved increased in a very alarming degree the feuds among his uncles and between his uncles and himself increased in frequency and bitterness and many plots and counterplots were formed in respect to the succession for isabella being so young it was very doubtful whether she would grow up and have children and unless she did so some one or other of richards cousins would be heir to the crown i have spoken of his cousin henry of bolingbroke as the principal of these claimants there was however another one roger the earl of march roger was the grandson of richards uncle lionel who had died long before the duke of gloucester who had been so bitterly opposed to richards marriage with isabella and had as it seemed now become his implacable enemy conceived the plan of deposing richard and making roger king isabella if this plan had been carried into effect was to have been shut up in a prison for all the rest of her days there were several great nobles joined with the duke of gloucester in this conspiracy  the plot was betrayed to richard by some of the confederates richard immediately determined to arrest his uncle and bring him to trial it was necessary however to do this secretly before any of the conspirators should be put upon their guard so he set off one night from his palace in westminster with a considerable company of armed men to go to the dukes palace which was at some distance from london planning his journey so as to arrive there very early in the morning the people of london when they saw the king passing at that late hour wondered where he was going  he arrived very early the next morning at the dukes castle he sent some of his men forward into the court of the castle to ask if the duke were at home the servants said that he was at home but he was not yet up so the messengers sent up to him in his bedchamber to inform him that the king was below and to ask him to come down and receive him gloucester accordingly came down he was much surprised but he knew that it would be very unwise for him to show any suspicion and so after welcoming the king he asked what was the object of so early a visit the king assumed a gay and unconcerned air as if he were out upon some party of pleasure and said he wished the duke to go away with him a short distance so the duke dressed himself and mounted his horse the king in the mean time talking in a merry way with the ladies of the castle who had come down into the court to receive him when they were ready the whole party rode out of the court and then the king suddenly changing his tone ordered his men to arrest the duke and take him away  the duke was never again seen or heard of in england and for a long time it was not known what had become of him it was however at last said and generally believed that he was put on board a ship and sent secretly to calais and shut up in a castle there and was after a time strangled by means of feather beds or as others say by wet towels put over his face in obedience to orders sent to the castle by richard several other great noblemen whom richard supposed to be confederates with gloucester were arrested by similar stratagems two or three of the most powerful of them were brought to a trial before judges in richards interest and being condemned were beheaded it is supposed that richard did not dare to bring gloucester himself to trial on account of the great popularity and vast influence which he enjoyed among the people of england  richard was very much pleased with the success of his measures for thus putting the most formidable of his enemies out of the way and not long after this his cousin roger died so that richard was henceforth relieved of all special apprehension on his account but the country was extremely dissatisfied the duke of gloucester had been very much respected and beloved by the nation richard was hated his government was tyrannical his style of living was so extravagant that his expenses were enormous and the people were taxed beyond endurance to raise the money required while however he thus spared no expense to secure his own personal aggrandizement and glory it was generally believed that he cared little for the substantial interests of the country but was ready to sacrifice them at any time to promote his own selfish ends  in the mean time having killed the principal leaders opposed to him for a time he had every thing his own way he obtained the control of parliament and caused the most unjust and iniquitous laws to be passed the object of which was to supply him more and more fully with money and to increase still more his own personal power he went on in this way until the country was almost ripe for rebellion  still with all his wealth and splendor richard was not happy he was harassed by perpetual suspicions and anxieties and his conscience tortured him with reproaches for the executions which he had procured of his uncle gloucester and the other noblemen particularly the earl of arundel one of the most powerful and wealthy nobles of england he used to awake from his sleep at night in horror crying out that the blood of the earl was all over his bed  he was afraid continually of his cousin henry who was now in the direct line of succession to the crown and whom he imagined to be conspiring against him he wished very much to find some means of removing him out of the way an opportunity at length presented itself there was a quarrel between henry and a certain nobleman named norfolk each accused the other of treasonable designs there was a long difficulty about it and several plans were formed for a trial of the case at last it was determined that there should be a trial by single combat between the parties to determine the question which of them was the true man  the town of coventry which is in the central part of england was appointed for this combat the lists were prepared a pavilion for the use of the king and those who were to act as judges was erected and an immense concourse of spectators assembled to witness the contest all the preliminary ceremonies were performed as usual in those days in personal combats of this character except that in this case the combatants were to fight on horseback they came into the lists with horses magnificently caparisoned norfolks horse was covered with crimson velvet and the trappings of henrys were equally splendid when all was ready the signal was given and the battle commenced after the combatants had made a few passes at each other without effect the king made a signal and the heralds cried out ho ho which was an order for them to stop the king then directed that their arms should be taken from them and that they should dismount and take their places in certain chairs which had been provided for them within the lists these chairs were very gorgeous in style and workmanship being covered with velvet and elegantly embroidered  the assembly waited a long time while the king and those with him held a consultation at length the king announced that the combat was to proceed no farther but that both parties were deemed guilty and that they were both to be banished from the realm the term of henrys banishment was ten years norfolks was for life  the country was greatly incensed at this decision there was no proof whatever that henry had done any thing wrong henry however submitted to the kings decree apparently without murmuring and took his departure as he journeyed toward dover where he was to embark the people flocked around him at all the towns and villages that he passed through and mourned his departure and when finally he embarked at dover and went away they said that the only shield defense and comfort of the commonwealth was gone  henry went to paris and there told his story to the king of france the king took his part very decidedly he received him in a very cordial and friendly manner and condemned the course which richard had pursued  another circumstance occurred to alienate the king of france still more from richard there was a certain french lady named de courcy who had come from france with the little queen and had since occupied a high position in the queens household she was isabellas governess and principal lady of honor this lady it seemed lived in quite an expensive style and by her influence and management greatly increased the expense of the queens establishment which was of course entirely independent of that of the king this lady de courcy kept eighteen horses for her own personal use and maintained a large train of attendants to accompany her in state whenever she appeared in public she had two or three goldsmiths and jewelers and two or three furriers and a proportionate number of other artisans all the time at work making her dresses and decorations richard under pretense that he could not afford all this dismissed the lady de courcy from her office and sent her home to france of course she was very indignant at this treatment and she set out on her return home prepared to give the king of france a very unfavorable account of his soninlaw it was some time after this however before she arrived at paris  about three months after henry of bolingbroke was banished from the realm his father the duke of lancaster died he left immense estates which of right should have descended to his son richard had given henry leave to appoint an attorney to act as his agent during his banishment and take care of his property but instead of allowing this attorney to take possession of these estates and hold them for henry until he should return the king confiscated them and seized them himself he also at the same time revoked the powers which he had granted to the attorney this transaction awakened one general burst of indignation from one end of england to the other and greatly increased the hatred which the people bore to the king and the favor with which they were disposed to regard henry  it must be admitted in justice to richard that his mind was greatly harassed at this time with the troubles and difficulties that surrounded him and with his want of money to complete his misfortunes a rebellion broke out in ireland he felt compelled to go himself and quell it so he collected all the money that he could obtain and raised an army and equipped a fleet to go across the irish sea he left his uncle the duke of york regent during his absence  before setting out for ireland the king went to windsor to bid the little queen goodby he took his leave of her in a church at windsor where she accompanied him to mass on leaving the church after service he partook of wine and refreshments with her at the door and then lifting her up in his arms he kissed her many times saying  adieu madame adieu till we meet again  as soon as richard was gone a great number of the leading and influential people began to form plans to keep him from coming back again or at least to prevent his ever again ruling over the realm henry who was now in paris and who since his father was dead was now himself the duke of lancaster began to receive letters from many persons urging him to come to england and promising him their support in dispossessing richard of the throne  henry determined at length to comply with these proposals he found many persons in france to encourage him and some to join him with these persons not more it is said than sixty in all he set sail from the coast of france and passing across the channel approached the coast of england he touched at several places to ascertain what was the feeling of the country toward him at length he was encouraged to land the people received him joyfully and every body flocked to his standard  the duke of york whom richard had left as regent immediately called a council of richards friends to consider what it was best to do on consultation and inquiry they found that the country would not support them in any plan for resisting henry so they abandoned richards cause at once in despair and fled in various directions intent only on saving their own lives  the duke of york went to windsor castle took the queen and her attendants and conveyed them up the river to the castle of wallingford where he thought they would be more safe  in the mean time the kings expedition to ireland resulted disastrously and he returned to england to his utter dismay he learned on his arrival that henry had landed in england and was advancing toward london in a triumphant manner he had no sufficient force under his command to enable him to go and meet his cousin with any hope of success the only question was how he could save himself from henrys vengeance he dismissed the troops that remained with him and then with a very few attendants to accompany him he sought refuge for a while among the castles in wales where he was reduced to great destitution and distress being forced sometimes to sleep on straw at length he went to conway which is a town near the northern confines of wales and shut himself up in the castle therethat famous conway castle the ruins of which are so much visited and admired by the tourists of the present day  in the mean time henry although he had marched triumphantly through england at the head of a large though irregular force had not proclaimed himself king or taken any other open step inconsistent with his allegiance to richard but now when he heard that richard was in wales he went thither himself at the head of quite a large army which he had raised in london he stopped at a town in north wales called flint and taking his lodgings there he sent forward an earl as his messenger to conway castle to treat with richard the earl on being introduced into richards presence said that his cousin was at flint castle and wished that he would come there to confer with him on matters of great moment richard did not know what to do he soon reflected however that he was completely in henrys power and that he might as well make a virtue of necessity and submit with a good grace so he said he would accompany the earl to flint castle  they had not gone far on the road before a large number of armed men appeared at the road side in a narrow place between the mountains and the sea where they had been lying in ambush these men were under the earls command little was said but richard saw that he was a prisoner  on his arrival at flint castlej richard had an interview with henry henry when he came into the kings presence treated him with all due reverence as if he still acknowledged him as his sovereign he kneeled repeatedly as he advanced until at length the king took him by the hand and raised him up saying at the same time  footnote j there is some discrepancy in the accounts in respect to the castle where this interview was had but this is not material  dear cousin you are welcome  henry replied  my sovereign lord and king the cause of my coming at this time is to have again the restitution of my person my lands and my heritage through your majestys gracious permission  the king replied  dear cousin i am ready to accomplish your will so that you may enjoy all that is yours without exception  after some farther insincere and hypocritical conversation of this sort breakfast was served after breakfast henry conducted the king to a window on the wall from which on looking over the plain a vast number of armed men who had come from london with henry were to be seen richard asked who those men were henry replied that they were people of london  and what do they want asked richard  they want me to take you said henry and carry you prisoner to the tower and there will be no pacifying them unless you go with me  richard saw at once that it was useless to make any resistance so he submitted himself entirely to such arrangements as henry might make henry accordingly set out with him on the journey to london ostensibly escorting him as a king but really conveying him as a prisoner on the journey the fallen monarch suffered many marks of neglect and indignity but he knew that he was wholly in the power of his enemies and that it was useless to complain indeed his spirit was completely broken and he had no heart to make even a struggle on reaching london he was conducted to the tower he was lodged there as he had often been lodged before only now the guards which surrounded him were under the command of his enemies and were placed there to prevent his escape instead of to protect him from danger  henry immediately convened a parliament issuing the writs however in the kings name this was necessary to make the parliament technically legal when the parliament met articles of accusation were formally brought against richard these articles were thirtythree in number they recapitulated all the political crimes and offenses which richard had committed during his life his cruelties and oppressions his wastefulness his maladministration of public affairs the illegal and unjust sentences of banishment or of death which he had pronounced upon peers of the realm and various other high crimes and misdemeanors  while these measures were pending richards mind was in a state of dreadful suspense and agitation sometimes he sank into the greatest depths of despondency and gloom and sometimes he raved like a madman walking to and fro in his apartment in his phrensy vowing vengeance on his enemies  he had interviews from time to time with henry and the other nobles at one time henry went with the duke of york and others to the tower and sent a messenger to the king requesting him to come to the apartment where they were as they wished to see him  tell henry of lancaster said the king that i shall do no such thing if he wishes to see me let him come to me  so they came to the kings apartment henry took off his cap as he came in and saluted the king respectfully the duke of york was with henry at this time richard was very angry with the duke of york whom he had left regent of england when he went away but who had made no resistance to henrys invasion so as soon as he saw him he broke forth in a perfect phrensy of vituperation and rage against him and against his son who was also present this produced a violent altercation between them and the king in which one of them told the king that he lied and threw down his bonnet before him in token of defiance richard then turned to henry and demanded in a voice of fury why he was placed thus in confinement under a guard of armed men  am i your servant he demanded or am i your king and what do you intend to do with me  you are my king and lord replied henry calmly but the parliament have determined that you are to be kept in confinement for the present until they can decide in respect to the charges laid against you  here the king uttered a dreadful imprecation expressive of rage and despair  illustration henry of bolingbrokeking henry iv  he then demanded that they should let him have his wife but henry replied that the council had forbidden that he should see the queen this exasperated the king more than ever he walked to and fro across the apartment wringing his hands and uttering wild and incoherent expressions of helpless rage  illustration pontefract castle king richards prison  the end of it was that richard was forced to abdicate the crown he soon saw that it was only by so doing that he could hope to save his life an assembly was convened and he formally delivered up his crown and renounced all claim to it forever he also gave up the globe and sceptre the emblems of sovereignty with which he had been invested at his coronation in addition to this ceremony a written deed of abdication had been drawn up and this deed was now signed by the king with all the necessary formalities proclamation having been made of richards abdication henry came forward and claimed the crown as richards rightful successor and he was at once proclaimed king and conducted to the throne richard was conducted back to the tower and soon afterward was conveyed by henrys order to a more sure place of confinementpontefract castle and here was shut up a close prisoner  things remained in this state a short time and then a rumor arose that a conspiracy was formed by richards friends to murder henry and restore richard to the throne a spiked instrument was said to have been found in henrys bed put there by some of the conspirators with a view of destroying him when he lay down whether this story of the conspiracy was false or true one thing is certain that the existence of richard endangered greatly the continuance and security of henrys power henry and his counselors were well aware of this and one day when they had been conversing on the subject of this danger henry said  have i no faithful friend who will deliver me from this man whose life is death to me and whose death would be my life  very soon after this it was known that richard was dead the universal belief was that he was murdered there were various rumors in respect to the manner in which the deed was perpetrated the account most precise and positive states that a man named exton who had heard the remark of the king repaired at once to the castle of pontefract accompanied by eight desperate men all well armed and gained admission to richards room while he was at table richard seeing his danger sprang up and attempted to defend himself he wrenched a weapon out of the hands of one of his assailants and fought with it so furiously that he cut down four of the ruffians before he was overpowered he was felled to the floor at last by a blow which exton struck him upon his head exton having sprung up upon the chair which richard had sat in and thus obtained an advantage by his high position  it was necessary to make the fact of richards death very certain and so soon afterward the body was placed upon a hearse and drawn by four black horses to london here it was left in a public place for some time to be viewed by all who desired to view it there were no less than twenty thousand persons that availed themselves of the opportunity of satisfying themselves by the evidence of their senses that the hated richard was no more                                       the little queen all this time had been confined in another castle she was now about twelve years old her father when he heard of the misfortunes which had befallen her husband and of the forlorn and helpless condition in which she was placed was so distressed that he became insane the other members of the family sent to england to demand that she should be restored to them but henry refused this request he wished to make her the wife of his son who was now the prince of wales but isabella would not listen to any such proposals then henry wished that she should remain in england as the queendowager and he promised that she should be treated with the greatest respect and consideration as long as she lived but neither she herself nor her friends in france would consent to this at length after long delay and many protracted negotiations it was decided that she should return home  the little queen on her return to france embarked from dover there were five vessels appointed to receive her and her suite there were in attendance upon her two ladies of the royal family who had the charge of her person her governess several maids of honor and two french chambermaids whose names were semonette and marianne there were many other persons besides  isabella reached the french frontier at a town between calais and boulogne and there was delivered with much form and ceremony to a deputation of french authorities sent forward to receive her  she lived in france after this for several years mourning her husband all the time with faithful and unchanging affection at length a marriage was arranged for her with her cousin a french prince she was married when she was nineteen years old she was very averse to this marriage when it was first proposed to her and could only speak of it with tears but under all the circumstances of the case she thought that she was not at liberty to decline it and after she was married she loved her husband very sincerely and made a very devoted and faithful wife three years after her marriage she had a son and a few hours after the birth of the child she suddenly died her husband was almost distracted when he heard that his beloved wife was dead his grief seemed for a time perfectly uncontrollable but when they brought to him his infant child it seemed in some measure to comfort him                           the end
