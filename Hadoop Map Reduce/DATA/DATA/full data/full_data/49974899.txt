49974899	evergreens  by jerome k jerome   they look so dull and dowdy in the spring weather when the snow drops and the crocuses are putting on their dainty frocks of white and mauve and yellow and the babybuds from every branch are peeping with bright eyes out on the world and stretching forth soft little leaves toward the coming gladness of their lives they stand apart so cold and hard amid the stirring hope and joy that are throbbing all around them  and in the deep full summertime when all the rest of nature dons its richest garb of green and the roses clamber round the porch and the grass waves waisthigh in the meadow and the fields are gay with flowersthey seem duller and dowdier than ever then wearing their faded winters dress looking so dingy and old and worn  in the mellow days of autumn when the trees like dames no longer young seek to forget their aged looks under gorgeous brighttoned robes of gold and brown and purple and the grain is yellow in the fields and the ruddy fruit hangs clustering from the drooping boughs and the wooded hills in their thousand hues stretched like leafy rainbows above the valeah surely they look their dullest and dowdiest then the gathered glory of the dying year is all around them they seem so out of place among it in their somber everlasting green like poor relations at a rich mans feast it is such a weatherbeaten old green dress so many summers suns have blistered it so many winters rains have beat upon itsuch a shabby mean old dress it is the only one they have  they do not look quite so bad when the weary winter weather is come when the flowers are dead and the hedgerows are bare and the trees stand out leafless against the gray sky and the birds are all silent and the fields are brown and the vine clings round the cottages with skinny fleshless arms and they alone of all things are unchanged they alone of all the forest are green they alone of all the verdant host stand firm to front the cruel winter  they are not very beautiful only strong and stanch and steadfastthe same in all times through all seasonsever the same ever green the spring cannot brighten them the summer cannot scorch them the autumn cannot wither them the winter cannot kill them  there are evergreen men and women in the world praise be to god not many of them but a few they are not the showy folk they are not the clever attractive folk nature is an oldfashioned shopkeeper she never puts her best goods in the window they are only the quiet strong folk they are stronger than the world stronger than life or death stronger than fate the storms of life sweep over them and the rains beat down upon them and the biting frosts creep round them but the winds and the rains and the frosts pass away and they are still standing green and straight they love the sunshine of life in their undemonstrative wayits pleasures its joys but calamity cannot bow them sorrow and affliction bring not despair to their serene faces only a little tightening of the lips the sun of our prosperity makes the green of their friendship no brighter the frost of our adversity kills not the leaves of their affection  let us lay hold of such men and women let us grapple them to us with hooks of steel let us cling to them as we would to rocks in a tossing sea we do not think very much of them in the summertime of life they do not flatter us or gush over us they do not always agree with us they are not always the most delightful society by any means they are not good talkers norwhich would do just as well perhaps betterdo they make enraptured listeners they have awkward manners and very little tact they do not shine to advantage beside our society friends they do not dress well they look altogether somewhat dowdy and commonplace we almost hope they will not see us when we meet them just outside the club they are not the sort of people we want to ostentatiously greet in crowded places it is not till the days of our need that we learn to love and know them it is not till the winter that the birds see the wisdom of building their nests in the evergreen trees  and we in our springtime folly of youth pass them by with a sneer the uninteresting colorless evergreens and like silly children with nothing but eyes in their heads stretch out our hands and cry for the pretty flowers we will make our little garden of life such a charming fairylike spot the envy of every passerby there shall nothing grow in it but lilies and roses and the cottage we will cover all over with virginiacreeper and oh how sweet it will look under the dancing summer sunlight when the soft west breeze is blowing  and oh how we shall stand and shiver there when the rain and the east wind come  oh you foolish foolish little maidens with your dainty heads so full of unwisdom how oftenoh how often are you to be warned that it is not always the sweetest thing in lovers that is the best material to make a goodwearing husband out of the lover sighing like a furnace will not go on sighing like a furnace forever that furnace will go out he will become the husband full of strange oathsjealous in honor sudden and quick in quarrel and grow into the lean and slipperd pantaloon how will he wear there will be no changing him if he does not suit no sending him back to be altered no having him let out a bit where he is too tight and hurts you no having him taken in where he is too loose no laying him by when the cold comes to wrap yourself up in something warmer as he is when you select him so he will have to last you all your lifethrough all changes through all seasons  yes he looks very pretty nowhandsome pattern if the colors are fast and it does not fadefeels soft and warm to the touch how will he stand the worlds rough weather how will he stand lifes wear and tear  he looks so manly and brave his hair curls so divinely he dresses so well i wonder if the tailors bill is paid he kisses your hand so gracefully he calls you such pretty names his arm feels so strong a round you his fine eyes are so full of tenderness as they gaze down into yours  will he kiss your hand when it is wrinkled and old will he call you pretty names when the baby is crying in the night and you cannot keep it quietor better still will he sit up and take a turn with it will his arm be strong around you in the days of trouble will his eyes shine above you full of tenderness when yours are growing dim  and you boys you silly boys what materials for a wife do you think you will get out of the emptyheaded coquettes you are raving and tearing your hair about oh yes she is very handsome and she dresses with exquisite taste the result of devoting the whole of her heart mind and soul to the subject and never allowing her thoughts to be distracted from it by any other mundane or celestial object whatsoever and she is very agreeable and entertaining and fascinating and she will go on looking handsome and dressing exquisitely and being agreeable and entertaining and fascinating just as much after you have married her as beforemore so if anything  but you will not get the benefit of it husbands will be charmed and fascinated by her in plenty but you will not be among them you will run the show you will pay all the expenses do all the work your performing lady will be most affable and enchanting to the crowd they will stare at her and admire her and talk to her and flirt with her and you will be able to feel that you are quite a benefactor to your fellowmen and womento your fellowmen especiallyin providing such delightful amusement for them free but you will not get any of the fun yourself  you will not get the handsome looks you will get the jaded face and the dull lusterless eyes and the untidy hair with the dye showing on it you will not get the exquisite dresses you will get dirty shabby frocks and slommicking dressinggowns such as your cook would be ashamed to wear you will not get the charm and fascination you will get the afterheadaches the complainings and grumblings the silence and sulkiness the weariness and lassitude and illtemper that comes as such a relief after working hard all day at being pleasant  it is not the people who shine in society but the people who brighten up the back parlor not the people who are charming when they are out but the people who are charming when they are in that are good to live with it is not the brilliant men and women but the simple strong restful men and women that make the best traveling companions for the road of life the men and women who will only laugh as they put up the umbrella when the rain begins to fall who will trudge along cheerfully through the mud and over the stony placesthe comrades who will lay their firm hand on ours and strengthen us when the way is dark and we are growing weakthe evergreen men and women who like the holly are at their brightest and best when the blast blows chilliestthe stanch men and women  it is a grand thing this stanchness it is the difference between a dog and a sheepbetween a man and an oyster  women as a rule are stancher than men there are women that you feel you could rely upon to the death but very few men indeed have this doglike virtue men taking them generally are more like cats you may live with them and call them yours for twenty years but you can never feel quite sure of them you never know exactly what they are thinking of you never feel easy in your mind as to the result of the nextdoor neighbors laying down a brussels carpet in his kitchen  we have no school for the turningout of stanch men in this nineteenth century in the old earnest times war made men stanch and true to each other we have learned up a good many glib phrases about the wickedness of war and we thank god that we live in these peaceful trading times wherein we canand dodevote the whole of our thoughts and energies to robbing and cheating and swindling one anotherto doing our friends and overcoming our enemies by trickery and lieswherein undisturbed by the wicked ways of fightingmen we can cultivate to better perfection the smartness the craft and the cunning and all the other businesslike virtues on which we so pride ourselves and which were so neglected and treated with so little respect in the bad old age of violence when men chose lions and eagles for their symbols rather than foxes  there is a good deal to be said against war i am not prepared to maintain that war did not bring with it disadvantages but there can be no doubt that for the noblest work of naturethe making of menit was a splendid manufactory it taught men courage it trained them in promptness and determination in strength of brain and strength of hand from its stern lessons they learned fortitude in suffering coolness in danger cheerfulness under reverses chivalry reverence and loyalty are the beautiful children of ugly war but above all gifts the greatest gift it gave to men was stanchness  it first taught men to be true to one another to be true to their duty true to their post to be in all things faithful even unto death  the martyrs that died at the stake the explorers that fought with nature and opened up the world for us the reformers they had to do something more than talk in those days who won for us our liberties the men who gave their lives to science and art when science and art brought not as now fame and fortune but shame and penurythey sprang from the loins of the rugged men who had learned on many a grim battlefield to laugh at pain and death who had had it hammered into them with many a hard blow that the whole duty of a man in this world is to be true to his trust and fear not  do you remember the story of the old viking who had been converted to christianity and who just as they were about with much joy to baptize him paused and asked but whatif this as you tell me is the only way to the true valhallawhat has become of my comrades my friends who are dead who died in the old faithwhere are they  the priests confused replied there could be no doubt those unfortunate folk had gone to a place they would rather not mention  then said the old warrior stepping back i will not be baptized i will go along with my own people  he had lived with them fought beside them they were his people he would stand by them to the endof eternity most assuredly a very shocking old viking but i think it might be worth while giving up our civilization and our culture to get back to the days when they made men like that  the only reminder of such times that we have left us now is the bulldog and he is fast dying outthe pity of it what a splendid old dog he is so grim so silent so stanch so terrible when he has got his idea of his duty clear before him so absurdly meek when it is only himself that is concerned  he is the gentlest too and the most lovable of all dogs he does not look it the sweetness of his disposition would not strike the casual observer at first glance he resembles the gentleman spoken of in the oftquoted stanza       es all right when yer knows im      but yerve got to know im fust  the first time i ever met a bulldogto speak to that iswas many years ago we were lodging down in the country an orphan friend of mine named george and myself and one night coming home late from some dissolving views we found the family had gone to bed they had left a light in our room however and we went in and sat down and began to take off our boots  and then for the first time we noticed on the hearthrug a bulldog a dog with a more thoughtfully ferocious expressiona dog with apparently a heart more dead to all ennobling and civilizing sentimentsi have never seen as george said he looked more like some heathen idol than a happy english dog  he appeared to have been waiting for us and he rose up and greeted us with a ghastly grin and got between us and the door  we smiled at hima sickly propitiatory smile we said good dogpoor fellow and we asked him in tones implying that the question could admit of no negative if he was not a nice old chap we did not really think so we had our own private opinion concerning him and it was unfavorable but we did not express it we would not have hurt his feelings for the world he was a visitor our guest so to speakand as wellbroughtup young men we felt that the right thing to do was for us to prevent his gaining any hint that we were not glad to see him and to make him feel as little as possible the awkwardness of his position  i think we succeeded he was singularly unembarrassed and far more at his ease than even we were he took but little notice of our flattering remarks but was much drawn toward georges legs george used to be i remember rather proud of his legs i could never see enough in them myself to excuse georges vanity indeed they always struck me as lumpy it is only fair to acknowledge however that they quite fascinated that bulldog he walked over and criticized them with the air of a longbaffled connoisseur who had at last found his ideal at the termination of his inspection he distinctly smiled  george who at that time was modest and bashful blushed and drew them up on to the chair on the dogs displaying a desire to follow them george moved up on to the table and squatted there in the middle nursing his knees georges legs being lost to him the dog appeared inclined to console himself with mine i went and sat beside george on the table  sitting with your feet drawn up in front of you on a small and rickety onelegged table is a most trying exercise especially if you are not used to it george and i both felt our position keenly we did not like to call out for help and bring the family down we were proud young men and we feared lest to the unsympathetic eye of the comparative stranger the spectacle we should present might not prove imposing  we sat on in silence for about half an hour the dog keeping a reproachful eye upon us from the nearest chair and displaying elephantine delight whenever we made any movement suggestive of climbing down  at the end of the half hour we discussed the advisability of chancing it but decided not to we should never george said confound foolhardiness with courage  courage he continuedgeorge had quite a gift for maximscourage is the wisdom of manhood foolhardiness the folly of youth  he said that to get down from the table while that dog remained in the room would clearly prove us to be possessed of the latter quality so we restrained ourselves and sat on  we sat on for over an hour by which time having both grown careless of life and indifferent to the voice of wisdom we did chance it and throwing the tablecloth over our wouldbe murderer charged for the door and got out  the next morning we complained to our landlady of her carelessness in leaving wild beasts about the place and we gave her a brief if not exactly truthful history of the business  instead of the tender womanly sympathy we had expected the old lady sat down in the easy chair and burst out laughing  what old boozer she exclaimed you was afraid of old boozer why bless you he wouldnt hurt a worm he aint got a tooth in his head he aint we has to feed him with a spoon and im sure the way the cat chivies him about must be enough to make his life a burden to him i expect he wanted you to nurse him hes used to being nursed  and that was the brute that had kept us sitting on a table with our boots off for over an hour on a chilly night  another bulldog exhibition that occurs to me was one given by my uncle he had had a bulldoga young onegiven to him by a friend it was a grand dog so his friend had told him all it wanted was trainingit had not been properly trained my uncle did not profess to know much about the training of bulldogs but it seemed a simple enough matter so he thanked the man and took his prize home at the end of a rope  have we got to live in the house with this asked my aunt indignantly coming in to the room about an hour after the dogs advent followed by the quadruped himself wearing an idiotically selfsatisfied air  that exclaimed my uncle in astonishment why its a splendid dog his father was honorably mentioned only last year at the aquarium  ah well all i can say is that his son isnt going the way to get honorably mentioned in this neighborhood replied my aunt with bitterness hes just finished killing poor mrs mcslangers cat if you want to know what he has been doing and a pretty row therell be about it too  cant we hush it up said my uncle  hush it up retorted my aunt if youd heard the row you wouldnt sit there and talk like a fool and if youll take my advice added my aunt youll set to work on this training or whatever it is that has got to be done to the dog before any human life is lost  my uncle was too busy to devote any time to the dog for the next day or so and all that could be done was to keep the animal carefully confined to the house  and a nice time we had with him it was not that the animal was badhearted he meant wellhe tried to do his duty what was wrong with him was that he was too hardworking he wanted to do too much he started with an exaggerated and totally erroneous notion of his duties and responsibilities his idea was that he had been brought into the house for the purpose of preventing any living human soul from coming near it and of preventing any person who might by chance have managed to slip in from ever again leaving it  we endeavored to induce him to take a less exalted view of his position but in vain that was the conception he had formed in his own mind concerning his earthly task and that conception he insisted on living up to with what appeared to us to be unnecessary conscientiousness  he so effectually frightened away all the trades people that they at last refused to enter the gate all that they would do was to bring their goods and drop them over the fence into the front garden from where we had to go and fetch them as we wanted them  i wish youd run into the garden my aunt would say to mei was stopping with them at the timeand see if you can find any sugar i think theres some under the big rosebush if not youd better go to jones and order some  and on the cooks inquiring what she should get ready for lunch my aunt would say  well im sure jane i hardly know what have we are there any chops in the garden or was it a bit of steak that i noticed on the lawn  on the second afternoon the plumbers came to do a little job to the kitchen boiler the dog being engaged at the time in the front of the house driving away the postman did not notice their arrival he was brokenhearted at finding them there when he got downstairs and evidently blamed himself most bitterly still there they were all owing to his carelessness and the only thing to be done now was to see that they did not escape  there were three plumbers it always takes three plumbers to do a job the first man comes on ahead to tell you that the second man will be there soon the second man comes to say that he cant stop and the third man follows to ask if the first man has been there and that faithful dumb animal kept them pinned up in the kitchenfancy wanting to keep plumbers in a house longer than is absolutely necessaryfor five hours until my uncle came home and the bill ran self and two men engaged six hours repairing boilertap 18s material 2d total 18s 2d  he took a dislike to the cook from the very first we did not blame him for this she was a disagreeable old woman and we did not think much of her ourselves but when it came to keeping her out of the kitchen so that she could not do her work and my aunt and uncle had to cook the dinner themselves assisted by the housemaida willingenough girl but necessarily inexperiencedwe felt that the woman was being subject to persecution  my uncle after this decided that the dogs training must be no longer neglected the man next door but one always talked as if he knew a lot about sporting matters and to him my uncle went for advice as to how to set about it  oh yes said the man cheerfully very simple thing training a bulldog wants patience thats all  oh that will be all right said my uncle it cant want much more than living in the same house with him before hes trained does how do you start  well ill tell you said nextdoorbutone you take him up into a room where theres not much furniture and you shut the door and bolt it  i see said my uncle  then you place him on the floor in the middle of the room and you go down on your knees in front of him and begin to irritate him  oh  yesand you go on irritating him until you have made him quite savage  which from what i know of the dog wont take long observed my uncle thoughtfully  so much the better the moment he gets savage he will fly at you  my uncle agreed that the idea seemed plausible  he will fly at your throat continued the nextdoorbutone man and this is where you will have to be careful as he springs toward you and before he gets hold of you you must hit him a fair straight blow on his nose and knock him down  yes i see what you mean  quite sowell the moment you have knocked him down he will jump up and go for you again you must knock him down again and you must keep on doing this until the dog is thoroughly cowed and exhausted once he is thoroughly cowed the things donedogs as gentle as a lamb after that  oh says my uncle rising from his chair you think that a good way do you  certainly replied the nextdoorbutone man it never fails  oh i wasnt doubting it said my uncle only its just occurred to me that as you understand the knack of these things perhaps youd like to come in and try your hand on the dog we can give you a room quite to yourselves and ill undertake that nobody comes near to interfere with you and ifif continued my uncle with that kindly thoughtfulness which ever distinguished his treatment of others if by any chance you should miss hitting the dog at the proper critical moment or if you should get cowed and exhausted first instead of the dogwhy i shall only be too pleased to take the whole burden of the funeral expenses on my own shoulders and i hope you know me well enough to feel sure that the arrangements will be tasteful and at the same time unostentatious  and out my uncle walked  we next consulted the butcher who agreed that the prizering method was absurd especially when recommended to a shortwinded elderly family man and who recommended instead plenty of outdoor exercise for the dog under my uncles strict supervision and control  get a fairly long chain for him said the butcher and take him out for a good stiff run every evening never let him get away from you make him mind you and bring him home always thoroughly exhausted you stick to that for a month or two regular and youll have him like a little child  umseems to me that im going to get more training over his job than anybody else muttered my uncle as he thanked the man and left the shop but i suppose its got to be done wish id never had the d dog now  so religiously every evening my uncle would fasten a long chain to that poor dog and drag him away from his happy home with the idea of exhausting him and the dog would come back as fresh as paint my uncle behind him panting and clamoring for brandy  my uncle said he should never have dreamed there could have been such stirring times in this prosaic nineteenth century as he had training that dog  oh the wild wild scamperings over the breezy commonthe dog trying to catch a swallow and my uncle unable to hold him back following at the other end of the chain  oh the merry frolics in the fields when the dog wanted to kill a cow and the cow wanted to kill the dog and they each dodged round my uncle trying to do it  and oh the pleasant chats with the old ladies when the dog wound the chain into a knot around their legs and upset them and my uncle had to sit down in the road beside them and untie them before they could get up again  but a crisis came at last it was a saturday afternoonuncle being exercised by dog in usual waynervous children playing in

costs for assault on fond parentuncle fined five pounds and cost for assault on police  my uncle gave the dog away soon after that he did not waste him he gave him as a weddingpresent to a near relation  but the saddest story i ever heard in connection with a bulldog was one told by my aunt herself  now you can rely upon this story because it is not one of mine it is one of my aunts and she would scorn to tell a lie this is a story you could tell to the heathen and feel that you were teaching them the truth and doing them good they give this story out at all the sundayschools in our part of the country and draw moral lessons from it it is a story that a little child can believe  it happened in the old crinoline days my aunt who was then living in a countrytown had gone out shopping one morning and was standing in the high street talking to a lady friend a mrs gumworthy the doctors wife she my aunt had on a new crinoline that morning in which to use her own expression she rather fancied herself it was a tremendously big one as stiff as a wirefence and it set beautifully  they were standing in front of jenkins the drapers and my aunt thinks that itthe crinolinemust have got caught up in something and an opening thus left between it and the ground however this may be certain it is that an absurdly large and powerful bulldog who was fooling round about there at the time managed somehow or other to squirm in under my aunts crinoline and effectually imprison himself beneath it  finding himself suddenly in a dark and gloomy chamber the dog naturally enough got frightened and made frantic rushes to get out but whichever way he charged there was the crinoline in front of him as he flew he of course carried it before him and with the crinoline of course went my aunt  but nobody knew the explanation my aunt herself did not know what had happened nobody had seen the dog creep inside the crinoline all that the people did see was a staid and eminently respectable middleaged lady suddenly and without any apparent reason throw her umbrella down in the road fly up the high street at the rate of ten miles an hour rush across it at the imminent risk of her life dart down it again on the other side rush sideways like an excited crab into a grocers shop run three times round the shop upsetting the whole stockintrade come out of the shop backward and knock down a postman dash into the roadway and spin round twice hover for a moment undecided on the curb and then away up the hill again as if she had only just started all the while screaming out at the top of her voice for somebody to stop her  of course everybody thought she was mad the people flew before her like chaff before the wind in less than five seconds the high street was a desert the townsfolk scampered into their shops and houses and barricaded the doors brave men dashed out and caught up little children and bore them to places of safety amid cheers carts and carriages were abandoned while the drivers climbed up lampposts  what would have happened had the affair gone on much longerwhether my aunt would have been shot or the fireengine brought into requisition against herit is impossible having regard to the terrified state of the crowd to say fortunately for her she became exhausted with one despairing shriek she gave way and sat down on the dog and peace reigned once again in that sweet rural town
