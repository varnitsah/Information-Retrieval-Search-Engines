28612773	in the track of the troops by rm ballantyne    chapter one  a tale of modern war  reveals the explosive nature of my early career  the remarkablei might even say amazingpersonal adventures which i am about to relate occurred quite recently  they are so full of interest to myself and to my old mother that i hasten to write them down while yet vivid and fresh in my memory in the hope that they may prove interestingto say nothing of elevating and instructiveto the englishspeaking portions of the human race throughout the world  the dear old lady to whom i have just referredmy motheris one of the gentlest meekest tenderest beings of my acquaintance  her regard for me is almost idolatrous  my feelings towards her are tinged with adoration  from my earliest years i have been addicted to analysis  some of my younger readers may not perhaps know that by analysis is meant the reduction of compound things to their elementsthe turning of things as it were inside out and tearing them to pieces  all the complex toys of infancy i was wont to reduce to their elements i turned them inside out to see what they were made of and how they worked  a doll not my own but my sister bellas which had moveable eyelids and a musical stomach was treated by me in this manner the result being that i learned little while my poor sister suffered much  everything in my fathers house suffered more or less from this inquiring tendency of my mind  time however while it did not abate my thirst for knowledge developed my constructive powers  i became a mechanician and an inventor perpetual motion was my first hobby  six times during the course of boyhood did i burst into my mothers presence with the astounding news that i had discovered it at last  the mild and trustful being believed me  six times also was i compelled to acknowledge to her that i had been mistaken and again she believed me more thoroughly perhaps than at first  no one i think can form the least idea of the delight with which i pursued this mechanical willothewisp  growing older i took to chemistry and here my love for research and analysis found ample scope while the sufferings of my fathers household were intensified  i am not naturally cruelfar from it they little knew how much pain their sufferings caused me how earnestly i endeavoured to lessen or neutralise the nuisances which the pursuit of science entailed  but i could not consume my own smoke or prevent explosions or convert bad and suffocating odours into sweet smells  settling down to this new pursuit with intense enthusiasm i soon began to flow in my natural course and sought to extend the bounds of chemical knowledge  i could not help it  the particular direction in which my interest ultimately became concentrated was that of explosives  after becoming acquainted with guncotton nitroglycerine dynamite lithofracteur and other combinations of powerfullyexplosive agents i took to searching for and inventing methods by which these might be utilised  to turn everything to good account is a desire which i cannot resist  explosives naturally drew my attention to minestinmines coalmines and other commercial enterprises  they also suggested war and torpedoes  at that time i had not reflected on the nature of war  i merely knew it to be a science cultivated chiefly by the human race and that in its practice explosives are largely used  to blowup effectively whether in a literal or figurative sense is difficult  to improve this power in war and in the literal sense i set myself to work  i invented a torpedo which seemed to me better than any that had yet been brought out  to test its powers i made a miniature fortification and blew it up  i also blew up our groom jacob lancey  it happened thus  the miniature fortress which was made of cardboard earth and bricks was erected in a yard near our stables  under its walls the torpedo was placed and the match lighted  it was night and very dark  i had selected the hour as being that most suitable to the destruction of an enemys stronghold  the match was very slow in burning  matches invariably are so in the circumstances suddenly i heard the sound of footsteps  next moment before i had time to give warning jacob lancey came round the corner of the stables with a pitchfork on his shoulder and walked right into the fortress  he set his foot on the principal gateway tripped over the ramparts and falling headlong into the citadel laid its banner in the dust  at the same instant there came a terrific flash and crash and from the midst of smoke and flames the groom appeared to shoot into the air  with feelings of horror i sprang to the rescue and dragged the poor fellow from the smoking debris  he was stunned at first but soon recovered and then it was found that one of the fingers of his left hand had been completely blown off  words cannot describe my feelings i felt as if i had become next thing to a murderer  lancey was a tall powerful man of about thirty and not easily killed  he had received no other injury worth mentioning  although the most faithful of servants he was irascible and i anticipated an explosion of temper when he recovered sufficiently to understand the nature of his injury but i was mistaken  the blowingup seemed to have quite cured his temperat least as regarded myself for when i afterwards went to see him with a very penitent face he took my hand and said  dont take on so master jeffry  you didnt do it a purpus you know and after all its ony the little finger o the left hand  itll be rather hout o the way than otherwise  moreover i was used to make a baccy stopper o that finger an it strikes me that the stumpll fit the pipe better than the pint did besides bein less sensitive to fire who knows  anyow master jeffry youve got no occasion to grieve over it so  i felt a little comforted when the good fellow spoke thus but i could not forgive myself  for some time after that i quite gave up my chemical and other experiments and when i did ultimately resume them i went to work with extreme caution  not long after this event i went to college and studied medicine  my course was nearly completed when my dear father died  he had earnestly desired that i should enter the medical profession  i therefore resolved to finish my course although being left in possession of a small estate named fagend in devonshire and an ample income it was not requisite that i should practise for a livelihood  one morning a considerable time after my studies were completed i sat at breakfast with my mother  jeff she said my name is jeffry childers jeff what do you think of doing now  being twentyfour you ought you know to have some fixed idea as to the future for of course though independent you dont intend to be idle  right mother right i replied i dont mean to be an idler nevertheless i dont mean to be a doctor  i shall turn my mind to chemistry and talking of that i expect to test the powers of a particular compound today  and what said my mother with a peculiar smile is the nature of this compound  violently explosive said i  ah of course i might have guessed that jeff for most of your compounds are either violently explosive or offensivesometimes both but what is the name of this one  before answering that said i pulling out my watch allow me to ask at what hour you expect bella home today  she half promised to be over to breakfast if cousin kate would let her away  it is probable that she may arrive in less than an hour  curious coincidence said i that her lover is likely to arrive about the same time  what  nicholas naranovitsch  yes  the ship in which he sailed from st petersburg arrived late last night and i have just received a telegram saying that he will be down by the first train this morning  love you know is said to have wings if the pair given to naranovitsch are at all in keeping with his powerful frame they will bear him swiftly to fagend  it may interest the reader at this point to know that my only sister bella had been engaged the previous year to one of my dearest college friends a young russian whose father had sent him to finish his education in england  my own father having been a merchant many of whose dealings were with russia had frequently visited st petersburg and twice my mother and sister and i accompanied him thither  while there we had met with the naranovitsch family  young nicholas was now in the army and as finelooking a fellow as one could wish to see  not only was he strong and manly but gentle in manner and tender of heart  my sister bella being the sweetestno not quite that for there is a pretty youngwell no matterbella being as i may say one of the sweetest girls in england he fell in love with her of course  so did she with him no wonder  during a visit to our place in devonshire at the end of his college career he and bella became engaged  nicholas returned to st petersburg to obtain his parents consent to the union and to make arrangements  he was rich and could afford to marry  at the time i write of he was coming back not to claim his bride for his father thought him still too young but to see her and to pay us a visit  now you know mother said i after the young people have seen each other for halfanhour or so they will naturally want to take a walk or a ride and  only halfanhour interrupted my mother with one of her peculiar little smiles  well an hour if you like or two if they prefer it i returned at all events they will want a walk before luncheon and i shall take the opportunity to show them some experiments which prove the power of the singular compound about which you questioned me just now  the explosive  yes  its name is dynamite  and what may that be jeff  something very awful i daresay remarked my mother with a look of interest as she sipped her tea  very awful indeed said i at least its effects are sometimes tremendous  what worse than gunpowder  ay much worse though i should prefer to say better than gunpowder  dear me rejoined my mother lifting her eyebrows a little in surprise  yes much better i continued gunpowder only bursts things  pretty well that jeff in the way of violence isnt it  yes but nothing to dynamite for while powder only bursts things dynamite shatters them  how very dreadful  what is dynamite  that is just what i am about to explain said i  you must know then that it is a compound  dear dear sighed my mother how many compounds you have told me about jeff since you took to chemistry  are there no uncompounded thingsno simple things in the world  why yes mother you are a simple thing and i only wish there were a good many more simple things like you in the world  dont be foolish jeff but answer my question  well mother there are indeed some simple elements in creation but dynamite is not one of them  it is composed of an excessively explosive oil named nitroglycerine itself a compound and an earth called kieselguhr  the earth is not explosive and is only mixed with the nitroglycerine to render that liquid less dangerous but the compound is named dynamite in which form it is made up and sold in immense quantities for mining purposes  here is some of it i added pulling from my pocket a cartridge nearly two inches in length and about an inch in diameter  it is a soft pasty substance done up as you see in cartridgepaper and this little thing if properly fired would blow a large boulderstone to atoms  bless me boy be careful exclaimed my mother pushing back her chair in some alarm  there is no danger i said in reassuring tones for this cartridge if opened out and set on fire by a spark or flame would not in the first place light readily and in the second place it would merely burn without exploding but if i were to put a detonator inside and fire it by means of that it would explode with a violence that far exceeds the force of gunpowder  and what is this wonderful detonator jeff that so excites the latent fury of the dynamite  i was much amused by the pat way in which my mother questioned me and became more interested as i continued my explanation  you must know i said that many powders are violently explosive and some more so than others  this violence of explosion is called detonation by which is meant the almost instantaneous conversion of the ultimate molecules of an explosive compound ie the whole concern into gas  i see you mean that it goes off quickly said my mother in a simple way that was eminently characteristic  well yes but much more quickly than gunpowder does  it were better to say that a powder detonates when it all explodes at the same instant  gunpowder appears to do so but in reality it does not  one of the best detonators is fulminate of mercury  detonating caps are therefore made of this and one such cap put into the middle of that cartridge of dynamite and set fire to by any means would convert the cartridge itself into a detonator and explode it with a shattering effect  a human being i continued sometimes illustrates this principle figurativelyi mean the violent explosion of a large cartridge by means of a small detonator  take for example a schoolmaster and suppose him to be a dynamite cartridge  his heart is a detonating cap  the schoolroom and boys form a galvanic battery  his brain may be likened to a conductingwire  he enters the schoolroom the chemical elements are seething in riot books are being torn and thrown ink spilt etcetera  before opening the door the good man is a quiet piece of plastic dynamite but the instant his eye is touched the electric circuit is as it were completed the mysterious current flashes through the brain and fires his detonating heart  instantly the gleaming flame shoots with lightningspeed to temples and toes  the entire man becomes a detonator and he explodes in a violent hurricane of kicks cuffs and invective  now without a detonatora heartthe man might have burned with moderate wrath but he could not have exploded  dont try illustration jeff said my plainspoken mother gently patting my arm it is not one of your strong points  perhaps not but do you understand me  i think i do in a hazy sort of way  dear mother she always professes to comprehend things hazily and indeed i sometimes fear that her conceptions on the rather abstruse matters which i bring before her are not always correct but it is delightful to watch the profound interest with which she listens and the patient efforts she makes to understand  i must in justice add that she sometimes though not often displays gleams of clear intelligence and powers of close incisive reasoning that quite surprise me  but now to return to what we were speaking ofmy future plans said i it seems to me that it would be a good thing if i were to travel for a year or so and see the world  you might do worse my boy said my mother  with a view to that i continued i have resolved to purchase a yacht but before doing so i must complete the new torpedo that i have invented for the navy that is i hope it may be introduced into our navy  the working model in the outhouse is all but ready for exhibition  when finished i shall show it to the lords of the admiralty and after they have accepted it i will throw study overboard for a time and go on a cruise  ah jeff jeff sighed my mother with a shake of her head youll never leave off till you get blown up  but i suppose you must have your way  you always had dear boy  but never in opposition to your wishes had i  now be just mother  quite true jeff quite true  how comes it i wonder that you are so fond of fire smoke fumes crash clatter and explosions  really said i somewhat amused by the question i cannot tell unless it be owing to something in that law of compensation which appears to permeate the universe  you have such an abhorrence of fire fumes smoke crash clatter and explosions that your only son is bound as it were to take special delight in chemical analysis and combination to say nothing of mechanical force and contrivance in order that a balance of some sort may be adjusted which would otherwise be thrown out of order by yourpardon mecomparative ignorance of and indifference to such matters  nay jeff replied my mother gently with a look of reproof on her kind face ignorance if you will but not indifference  i cannot be indifferent to anything that interests you  true forgive me i should have said dislike  yes that would have been correct jeff for i cannot pretend to like the bursting smoking and illsmelling things you are so fond of but you know i am interested in them  you cannot have forgotten how when you were a boy i used to run at your call to witness your pyrotechnic hydraulic mechanic and chemic displaysyou see how well i remember the namesand how the  the acids i interrupted taking up the theme ruined your carpets and tablecloths and the smoke stifled and blinded while the noise and flames terrified you no mother i have not forgotten it nor the patient way you took the loss of your old silk dress or  ah yes sighed the dear old lady with quite a pitiful look if it had been any other than my wedding dress whichbutwell its of no use regretting now and you know jeff i would not have checked you for worlds because i knew you were being led in the right way though in my folly i sometimes wished that the way had been a little further removed from smoke and smells  but after all you were very careful dear boywonderfully so for your years and your little accidents did not give me much pain beyond the day of their occurrence  the poisoning of the cat to be sure was sad though unavoidable and so was the destruction by fire of the cooks hair but the flooding of the house after the repairs you executed on the great cistern and the blowing out of the laundry window at the time the clothesboiler was cracked with other trifles of that sort were  the remainder of my mothers speech was cut short by a clattering of hoofs  next moment my sister bella came round the corner of the house at full gallop her fresh face beaming with the exercise and her golden hair streaming in the breeze  she pulled up leaped off her pony and ran into the room  as she did so i observed a tall soldierly man appear in the avenue advancing with rapid strides  well did i know his grave handsome face  here comes nicholas said i turning round but bella had fled  i observed that my friend instead of coming straight to the room from the window of which my mother and i had saluted him turned sharp off to the library  i was running to the door to welcome him when my mother called me back i turned and looked at her  she smiled  so did i  without uttering a word we both sat down to finish our breakfast  ah  jeff said my mother with a little sigh how i wish you would fall in love with some one  fall in love mother  what nonsense  how could i  no doubt there are plenty loveable girls and there is one charming littlewell no matter  at that moment nicholas entered the room heartily saluted my mother and cut short our conversation    chapter two  is still more explosive than the first  much to my surprise i found that neither nicholas naranovitsch nor bella nor my mother would consent to witness my experiments with dynamite that day  as my old chum approached to greet me on the lawn before breakfast the day following i could not help admiring his fine tall athletic figure  i dont know how it is but i have always felt somehow as if i looked up at him although we were both exactly the same heightsix feet one without our boots  i suppose it must have been owing to his standing so erect while i slouched a little  perhaps my looking up to him mentally had something to do with it  youll come today wont you  i said referring to the experiments  of course i will old boy but he added with a smile only on one condition  what may that be  that you dont bother bella with minute details  of course i promised not to say a word unless asked for explanations and after breakfast we all went to a part of the grounds which i wished to bring under cultivation  it was at that time encumbered with several large trees old roots and a number of boulders  come along with us lancey i said to the groom who was also my laboratory assistant and whom i met in the stableyard the scene of his memorable blowingup  i am about to try the effect of an explosive and wish you to understand the details  yes sir replied lancey with a respectful touch of his cap i must say sir if youll allow me i never knowed any one like you sir for goin into details except one and that one  ah yes i know that was your friend the scotch boy said i interrupting but lancey was a privileged servant and would not be interrupted  yes sir he resumed the scotch boy sandy  we was at school together in edinburgh where i got the most o my edication and i never did see such a boy sir for goin into  yes yes lancey i know but i havent time to talk about him just now  we are going to the bit of waste ground in the hollow follow us there  i was obliged to cut him short because this scotch hero of his was a subject on which he could not resist dilating on the slightest encouragement  arrived at the waste ground we met the manager of a neighbouring mine who was deeply learned in everything connected with blasting  i have brought my mother and sister you see mr jones said i as we approached  they dont quite believe in the giantpower which is under your control they seem to think that it is only a little stronger than gunpowder  we can soon change their views on that point said the manager with a slight bow to the ladies while i introduced nicholas as an officer of the russian army  this is one of the stones you wish to blast is it not said mr jones laying his hand on an enormous boulder that weighed probably several tons  it is i answered  the manager was a man of actiongrave of countenance and of few words he drew a flask from his pocket and emptied its contents a large quantity of gunpowder on the boulder  asking us to stand a little back he applied a slow match to the heap and retired several paces  in a few seconds the powder went off with a violent puff and a vast cloud of smoke  the result was a little shriek of alarm from my mother and an exclamation from bella  not much effect from that you see said the manager pointing to the blackened stone yet it was a large quantity of powder which if fired in a cavity inside the stone would have blown it to pieces  here now is a small quantity of dynamite  he produced a cartridge about two inches in length similar to that which i had shown to my mother at breakfast into this cartridge i shall insert a detonator cap which is fastened to the end of a pickford fusethus  as he spoke he inserted into the cartridge the end of the fuse to which was attached a small cap filled with fulminate of mercury and tied it tightly up  this done he laid the cartridge on the top of the boulder placed two or three similar cartridges beside it and covered all with a small quantity of sand leaving the other end of the fuse projecting  why the sand asked bella  because a slight amount of confinement is advantageous replied mr jones  if i were to bore a short hole in the stone and put the dynamite therein the result would be still more effective but the covering i have put on it will suffice and will serve all the better to show the great difference between this explosive and gunpowder  but said my mother who had a tendency to become suddenly interested in things when she began to have a faint understanding of them but mr jones you did not give the powder fair play  if you had covered it with sand would not its effect have been more powerful  not on the stone madam it would only have blown off its covering with violence that would have been all  now ladies and gentlemen if you will retire behind the shelter of that old beechtree i will light the fuse  we did as we were desired  the manager lighted the fuse and followed us  in a few moments there occurred an explosion so violent that the huge boulder was shattered into several pieces which were quite small enough to be lifted and carted away  most amazing exclaimed bella with enthusiasm  it was quite obvious that she had no anticipation of such a thorough result  nicholas too who i may mention had no natural turn of taste for such matters was roused to a state of inquiry  to a question put by him mr jones explained that taking its powers into consideration dynamite was cheaper than gunpowder and that it saved much labour as it would have taken two men a considerable time to have bored an ordinary blasthole in the boulder he had just broken up  i now led the way to another part of the ground on which grew a large beechtree whose giant roots took a firm grasp of the ground  it was a hundred years old at least about twelve feet in circumference and sixty feet high  one similar tree i had had cut down but the labour had been very great and the removal of the stump excessively troublesome as well as costly  mr jones now went to work at the forestgiant  in the ground underneath the tree he ordered lancey to make a hole with a crowbar into this he pressed some cartridges of dynamite with a wooden rammer then the cartridge with the detonator inside of it and the fuse extending from its mouth was placed in contact with the charge under the tree  the hole was next closed up with some earth leaving about a foot of the fuse outside  the light was then applied and we retired to a safe distance  in a few moments the charge exploded  the tree seemed to rise from its bed  all the earth under it was blown out and the roots were torn up and broken with the exception of four of the largest which were fully ten inches in diameter  a small charge of dynamite inserted under each of these completed the work and the old giant slowly bowing forward laid his venerable head upon the ground  another charge was next placed in the soil under some loose and decayed roots which were easily broken to pieces so as to permit of their removal  thus in a short time and at little cost were trees and roots and boulders torn up and shattered  but is dynamite not very dangerous mr jones asked my mother as we walked slowly homeward  not at all dangerousat least not worth speaking of replied the manager nitroglycerine by itself is indeed very dangerous being easily exploded by concussion or mere vibration but when mixed with infusorial earth and thus converted into dynamite it is one of the safest explosives in existencenot quite so safe indeed as guncotton but much more so than gunpowder  any sort of fire will explode gunpowder but any sort of fire will not explode dynamite it will only cause it to burn  it requires a detonator to explode it with violence  without its detonator dynamite is a sleeping giant  ay mother said i taking up the subject the case stands thus gunpowder is a big athlete who slumbers lightly any spark can wake him to violent action but dynamite is a bigger athlete who sleeps so soundly that a spark or flame can only rouse him to moderate rage it requires a special shake to make him wideawake but when thus roused his fury is terrific as you have just seen  and now i added as we drew near the house we will change the subject because i have this morning received two letters which demand the united consideration of our whole party  i will therefore call up bella and nicholas who have fallen behind as usual  mr jones will excuse my talking of family matters for a few minutes as replies must be sent by return of post  i then explained that one of the letters was an invitation to me and my mother and sister with any friends who might chance to be visiting us to go to portsmouth to witness a variety of interesting experiments with torpedoes and such warlike things while the other letter was an offer by a friend of a schoonerbuilt yacht for a moderate sum  now nicholas said i apologetically im sorry to give you such an explosive reception but it cannot be helped  if you dont care about torpedoes you may remain here with my mother and bella but if you would like to go i shall be happy to introduce you to one or two of my naval friends  for myself i must go because  we will all go jeff interrupted bella nothing could be more appropriate as a sequel to this mornings experiments  a day among the torpedoes will be most interesting wont it  she looked up at nicholas on whose arm she leaned  he looked down with that peculiar smile of his which seemed to lie more in his eyes than on his lips and muttered something about a day anywhere being etcetera etcetera  my mother remarked that she did not understand exactly what a torpedo was and looked at me for an explanation  i confess that her remark surprised me for during the course of my investigations and inventions i had frequently mentioned the subject of torpedoes to her and once or twice had given her a particular description of the destructive machine however as she had evidently forgotten all about it and as i cannot resist the temptation to elucidate complex subjects when opportunity offers i began  it is a machine mother which  which bursts interrupted bella with a little laugh  but that is no explanation dear returned my mother at least not a distinctive one for guns burst sometimes and soapbubbles burst and eggs burst occasionally  bella said nicholas who spoke english perfectly though with a slightly foreign accent never interrupt a philosopher  allow jeff to proceed with his definition  well a torpedo said i is an infernal machine  jeff said my mother seriously dont  mother i use the word advisedly and dispassionately  it is a term frequently given to such engines because of their horrible nature which suggests the idea that they were originated in the region of satanic influence  a torpedo then is a pretty large case or box or cask or reservoir of one form or another filled with gunpowder or guncotton or dynamite which is used chiefly under water for blowingup purposes  sometimes men use torpedoes to blow up rocks and sunken wrecks and sometimes i grieve to say it they blow up ships and sailors  dreadful my dear said my mother nevertheless i should like to go with you on this excursion and see what devices men invent for the purpose of killing each other  very well thats settled said i  now as to the other letter about the yacht  i will buy it mother and go on a cruise to the mediterranean on one condition namely that you and nicholas and bella go with me  impossible exclaimed my mother firmly i never could bear the sea  but youve had little experience of it said i  well not muchbut i cannot bear it  now mother said i coaxingly here is bella dying to go to sea i know  nicholas has loads of time and cannot be left behind and i wish very much to go but all will fall to the ground if you refuse to accompany us  we cannot leave you in this house alone  the sea air will certainly do you good and if it does not we can land you know at lisbon gibraltar niceanywhere and return home overland  well then i will go returned my pliant mother  thats right said i sitting down to write  now then all of you get ready to go to london this afternoon  we shall spend a day or two there because before leaving i must see the first lord of the admiralty on particular business  afterwards we shall run down to portsmouth by the afternoon express spend the night there and so be ready to face the torpedoes in the morning    chapter three  an interview with men in power  there is something peculiarly exhilarating in bright sunshine and calm weather  this is no doubt a truism but there are some truths of which one never tires and in regard to which one feels everrecurring freshness  who ever wearied of a balmy breeze or a bright sunrise even a glorious noon cannot pall upon us unless it be too hot  when bright sunshine is associated with good health pleasant company a successful courtship and the prospect of light on a favourite study the reader will understand how it was that my mother and i with nicholas and bella formed a peculiarly happy quartette as we perambulated the streets of london prior to my visit to the admiralty  it was a friday forenoon and there were many holidaykeepers hastening to trains  at the corner of one of the main thoroughfares a crowd partly blocked the road  the cause of it became apparent to us when the head and arched neck of a black charger appeared and then the white plume and polished cuirass of a life guardsman  we stood on a doorstep so that bella might see the troop  as they passed before us with that stately bearing of man and horse which has always seemed to me peculiar to the life guards and the sun flashed in dazzling gleams from breasts and helmets i glanced at my friend naranovitsch  his soldierlike form was drawn up to its full height while the flashing eye flushed countenance distended nostrils and compressed but slightly smiling lips told i thought of a strong feeling of martial joy  doubtless he was thinking at the moment of his own regiment to which he had been but recently appointed and of his comradesinarms  finelooking fellows  i whispered  splendid glorious he said in a deep low voice  bella looked quickly up at him displaying an anxious sorrowing face and bright eyes dimmed with illsuppressed tears  you are not ill bella he whispered bending down with a look of tenderness not unmixed with surprise  no oh no she replied in a low tone but the sight of the guards has made me very sad  i knew full well the cause of her emotion but the crowded street was not a suitable place for explanation  come follow me i said and walked quickly along in the direction of the strand where i turned abruptly into one of those quiet courts which form as it were harbours of refuge from the rattle and turmoil of the great city  here sauntering slowly round the quiet precincts of the court with the roar of the street subdued to a murmur like that of a distant cataract bella told nicholas in tones of the deepest pathos how a german lady elsie goeben one of her dearest friends had been married to the handsomest and best of men in one of the prussian cavalry regiments  how only six months after their union the francoprussian war broke out and elsies husband wilhelm was sent with his regiment to the frontier how in many engagements he had distinguished himself and how at last he was mortally wounded during one of the sorties at the siege of metz  they did not find him till next day continued my sister for he had fallen in a part of the field so far in advance of the ground on which his dead comrades lay that he had been overlooked  he was riddled with bullets they say and his noble face which i had so often seen beaming with affection on his young wife was so torn and disfigured that his friends could scarcely recognise him  he was still alive when found and they knew his voice  when they raised him he merely exclaimed at last thank god with a deep sigh as if of relief  the words were few but they had terrible significance for they told of a long long night of agony and dreadful solitude but he was not quite alone my sister added in a low voice for he was a christian  he died before reaching the tents of his division  bellas voice faltered as she said after a moments pause dear elsie never recovered the shock  she joined her husband in heaven two months afterwards  truly said i war is a terrible curse  i hate it  i detest it cried bella with a sudden tone and look of energy that was all the more impressive because of her natural character being gentle and retiring  i saw that nicholas was surprised and pained  he would fain have comforted bella but knew not what to say for he had been trained to talk of martial glory and to look on war through the medium of that halo of false glitter with which it has been surrounded by too many historians in all ages  the young russian had hitherto dwelt chiefly on one aspect of war  he had thought of noble and heroic deeds in defence of hearth and home and all that man holds sacred  to fight for his country was to nicholas an idea that called up only the thoughts of devotion selfsacrifice in a good cause duty fidelity courage romance while in regard to the minor things of a warriors life a hazy notion of dash glitter music and gaiety floated through his brain  of course he was not ignorant of some of the darker shades of war  history which told him of many gallant deeds also recorded numberless dreadful acts  but these latter he dismissed as being disagreeable and unavoidable accompaniments of war  he simply accepted things as he found them and not being addicted to very close reasoning did not trouble himself much as to the rectitude or wisdom of war in the abstract  neither did he distinguish between righteous and unrighteous warwar of selfdefence and war of aggression  sufficient for him that he served his country faithfully  this was a good general principle no doubt for a youthful officer but as one who expected to rise to power and influence in his native land something more definite would ultimately be required of him  as yet he had neither experienced the excitement beheld the miseries nor bathed in the socalled glory of war and now that a corner of the dark cloud was unexpectedly flung over him in bellas sorrow he felt deeply sympathetic but helpless  a sad look however and a gentle pressure of the hand that rested on his arm was quite sufficient for bella  to relieve my friend from his embarrassment i pulled out my watch and urged that we should walk in the direction of the admiralty as the hour for my interview had nearly arrived  at charingcross we parted and i proceeded on my mission with the plan of my torpedo which nicholas styled the infernal machine in my pocket and a rather anxious heart in my breast for although i was quite certain that my invention was superior to all others inasmuch as it fulfilled several conditions which were not fulfilled by other torpedoes i did not feel sure that the lords of the admiralty would take the same view of it that i did  besides the machine had only been tried as a model and might not act perfectly when tested in actual warfare  but of course i knew that my inventive powers would readily overcome each weak point as it cropped into view in practice  i met with a very gracious reception from the first lord  beside him were seated two elderly gentlemen whom i judged to be brother lords  it were needless to recount all that passed during that memorable interview  suffice it to say that after i had given a most careful and clear explanation of my invention to which the three lords listened with marked attention the first lord said with a bland smile  but what mr childers is the peculiar point of superiority over other torpedoes which you claim for yours  i confess that the question damped me a little for i had been remarkably explicit in my explanations which lasted nearly an hour however with the utmost alacrity i went again over the chief points  you observe my lord said i pointing to my drawing which lay spread out on the table that this watchwork arrangement in the heart of the machine is so intimately connected with that lever and screw on its exterior that in passing out of the case from which it is launched into the sea the machinery is set in motion and the first act of the torpedo is to set or regulate itself for the special purpose for which it is designed  thus it may be styled an automatic torpedo  the celebrated whitehead fishtorpedo beautiful and cleverly contrived though it be can only advance straight to its object at a certain depth below the surface but mine as you see by this arrangement of the main pneumatic engine which connects the watchwork regulator with an eccentric wheel or fin outside causes the torpedo to describe a curve of any size and in any direction during its progress  thus if you wish to hit an enemys vessel but cannot venture to fire because of a friendly ship happening to lie between you have only to set the eccentric indicator to the required curve and send the torpedo on its mission of destruction right under the bottom of the friendly ship or by laying the torpedo on its side it will easily go round it and afterwards hit the enemy  ah  i see said the first lord with a grave nod you have at last succeeded in making that which has so long been held impossible an instrument which will shoot round the corner  well a yes my lord although i confess it had not struck me in that light before  but i continued feeling my enthusiasm rise as the first lord became more appreciative the weapon may be used even in attacking fortresses from the sea for by making what i may call the inverted trajectory of the curve very high the torpedo may be made to rush under the surface of the water gradually curve upwards then shoot right out of its native element and go straight into a fort or town on a hill at least a hundred feet above the level of the sea  indeed exclaimed the first lord  i observed that the other two lords were gazing at me with looks from which were banished every expression except that of intense surprise regarding this as a sign that the merits of my invention were beginning to tell on them i went on  yes my lord the action of the thing is absolutely certain if the distance of the object aimed at be ascertained to a nicety and the arrangements of the watchwork indicator adjusted to those of the eccentric wheel and the pneumatic engine with mathematical precision this of course in these days of thorough education can be easily done by even the youngest officer in a ship  i should have mentioned however that if it were required to send the torpedo into a citadel or fortress on a hill it would be necessary to use a stronger explosive than any yet knownguncotton and dynamite being too weak and nitroglycerine too dangerous therefore inadmissible  ha exclaimed the first lord and where is such an explosive to be found  in my laboratory down in devonshire my lord i answered with a look of diffidence feeling uncertain how he would take the announcement  for a few moments he contemplated me in perfect silence and i observed that the other two lords smiled  i felt perplexed but the awkwardness of the moment was quickly removed by the first lord asking what my new compound was made of  that my lord said i is a secret  just so and you wish to sell your secret to government  no my lord i replied with dignity i wish to let my government possess any slight gift which it lies in my power to present to it in addition to that of a loyal heart but i cannot afford to let my secret be known unless i have some assurance that it shall be held inviolable  that assurance you have said the first lord but i should have supposed that to so loyal a subject the character of the british admiralty would have been sufficient guarantee and that nothing further would have been required from me  i do not require further assurance my lord said i hastily i merely wish you to understand how important it is that secrecy should be observed  i will reveal it to you  here i rose and whispered in the first lords ear  he turned pale as i sat down and whispered to the other two lords who looked very grave from which i augured good fortune to my invention  at the same time i was surprised for my communication to him was in no way alarming though connected with explosives  presently the first lord touched a bell  a servant in uniform appeared and after a few words disappeared  i was puzzled but silent  mr childers said the first lord i shall give your invention my best attention but i must tell you that there are many others in this country as well as yourself who are exerting their minds to discover the most effectual method of spreading wholesale devastation among their fellowcreatures and  forgive my interrupting you my lord i exclaimed with a look of horror but i repudiate entirely any intention to destroy my fellowcreatures  my motives in this matter have been purely scientific  i have no doubt of it returned the first lord with a smile nevertheless the tendency of your labours is towards destruction and my reference to the fact is merely for the purpose of informing you that there are many other inventors who have claimed my attention to their designs and that you must not expect an immediate decision in regard to yours  with this i was politely bowed out and as i passed down the corridor i could not help feeling disappointed at the rather faint success of my visit  the idea too that i was a wouldbe destroyer of my species had never before occurred to me my whole soul and faculties having hitherto been engrossed in the simple idea of perfecting a chemical explosive and a mechanical contrivance  thus unintentionally do we sometimes lend ourselves to that from which our hearts revolt  i noticed too that the servant who had been summoned by the first lord while we were discussing the torpedo was particularly attentive to me and very careful in seeing me off the premises and then for the first time it flashed across my mind that i had been taken for a madman  i was so tickled with the idea that i burst into a sudden fit of hearty laughter an act which induced a little boy a policeman and an old woman who chanced to be passing to imbibe the erroneous view of the first lord  however although grievously disheartened i was not subdued  hope which tells so many flattering tales told me that after proper consideration the admiralty would infallibly perceive the value of my invention and in regard to the destruction of my fellowcreatures i consoled myself with the reflection that torpedoes were much more calculated for defensive than offensive warfare  before quitting this subject i may state that from that day to this i have never heard from the admiralty in reference to my invention  this fact gives me no pain now although it did at first  i will explain why  there is a friend of minea grave kindly young man yet withal sarcastic and eccentricwho met me immediately after my visit to the admiralty  he is a strange being this friend who crops up at all sorts of unexpected times and in divers places when one least expects him his name is u biquitous  my dear childers said he when i had explained matters you are a victimyou are the victim of selfdelusion  you were victimised by selfdelusion when i first met you at the time you thought you had discovered perpetual motion  your torpedo as you have just described it to me is an impossibility and you yourself are  an ass said i looking up in his face  no by no means returned biquitous earnestly but you are an enthusiast without ballast  enthusiasm is a fine noble quality  the want of ballast is a grievous misfortune  study mechanics my boy a little more than you have yet done before venturing on further inventions and dont theorise too much  you have been revelling of late in the regions of fancy  take my advice and dont do it  i wont said i fervently but i cannot give up my cherished pursuits  there is no reason that you should returned my friend grasping my hand and my earnest advice to you is to continue them but lay in some ballast if possible  with these cheery words ringing in my ears i rejoined my mother and sister and went off to portsmouth  it is well however to state here that my personal investigations in the matter of explosives had at this time received a deathblow  i went indeed with intense interest to see the display of our national destructive powers at portsmouth but i never again ventured to add my own little quota to the sum of human knowledge on such subjects and the reader may henceforth depend upon it that in all i shall hereafter write there shall be drawn a distinct and unmistakable line between the region of fact and fancy    chapter four  a day with the torpedoes  the sentence with which i finished the last chapter appears to me essential because what i am now about to describe may seem to many readers more like the dreams of fancy than the details of sober fact  when my mother and i with nicholas and bella arrived at portsmouth we were met by my naval friend a young lieutenant who seemed to me the beauideal of an embryo naval hero  he was about the middle height broad lithe athletic handsome with a countenance beaming with goodwill to and belief in everybody including himself  he was selfpossessed impressively attentive to ladies both young and old and suave to gentlemen healthy as a wild stag and happy as a young cricket with a budding moustache and a fluff on either cheek  though gentle as a lamb in peace he was said to be a very demon in war and bore the not inappropriate name of firebrand  allow me to introduce my friend lieutenant naranovitsch mr firebrand my mother and sister not too late i hope said i shaking hands  not at all  in capital time replied the young fellow gaily as he bowed to each  allow me mrs childerstake my arm  the boat is not far off  boat exclaimed my mother must we then go to sea  not exactly replied firebrand with a light laugh unless you dignify portchester creek by that name  the nettle targetship lies there and we must go on board of her as it is around and in connection with her that the various experiments are to be tried by means of gunboats launches steampinnaces and various other kinds of small craft  how very fortunate that you have such a charming day said my mother whose interest was at once aroused by the youths cheery manner  do you expect many people to witness the experiments mr firebrand  about five hundred invitations have been issued answered the lieutenant and i daresay most of those invited will come  it is an occasion of some importance being the termination of the senior course of instruction in our naval torpedo school here  i am happy to think he added with an arch smile that an officer of the russian army will have such a good opportunity of witnessing what england is preparing for her enemies  it will afford me the greatest pleasure to witness your experiments replied nicholas returning the smile with interest all the more that england and russia are now the best of friends and shall i hope never again be enemies  in a few minutes we were conveyed on board the nettle on whose deck was a most animated assemblage  not only were there present hundreds of gailydressed visitors and officers both naval and military in bright and varied uniforms but also a number of chinese students whose gaudy and peculiar garments added novelty as well as brilliancy to the scene  delightful murmured bella as she listened to the sweet strains of the commanderinchiefs band and gazed dreamily at the sunflashes that danced on the glassy water  paradise replied naranovitsch looking down into her eyes  what are they going to do asked my mother of young firebrand who kept possession of her during the whole of the proceedings and explained everything  they are going to illustrate the application of torpedo science to offensive and defensive warfare said the lieutenant and just now i see they are about to send off an outrigger launch to make an attack with two torpedoes one on either bow each being filled with 100 pounds of gunpowder  sometimes guncotton is used but this 100 pounds charge of powder is quite sufficient to send the vessel in which we stand to the bottom in five or ten minutes  come this waywe shall see the operations better from this point  now dont be alarmed there is not the slightest danger i assure you  he spoke in reassuring tones and led my mother to the side of the ship whither i followed them and became at once absorbed in what was going on  the outrigger launch referred to was a goodlysized boat fitted with a small engine and screw propeller  its chief peculiarities were two long poles or spars which lay along its sides projecting beyond the bows these were the outriggers  at the projecting end of each spar was fixed an iron case bearing some resemblance in shape and size to an elongated kettledrum  these were the torpedoes  i heard the lieutenant explain to my mother that if one of these torpedoes chanced to explode where it hung it would blow the boat and men to atoms  to which my mother replied horrible and asked how in that case the crew could fire it and escape  whereupon he responded you shall see presently  another peculiarity in the launch was that it had a species of iron hood or shield like a broad and low sentrybox from behind which protection the few men who formed her crew could steer and work the outriggers and the galvanic battery without being exposed  this little boat seemed to me like a vicious wasp as it left the side of the ship with a rapid throbbing of its engine and twirling of its miniature screw  when at a sufficient distance from the ship an order was given by the officer in charge  immediately the outrigger on the right or starboard side was run out by invisible hands to its full extentapparently fifteen feet beyond the bow of the launch then the inner end of the outrigger was tilted violently into the air so that the other end with its torpedo was thrust down ten feet below the surface of the water this i was told is about the depth at which an enemys ship ought to be struck  the launch still going at full speed was now supposed to have run so close to the enemy that the submerged torpedo was about to strike her  another order was given  the operator gave the needful touch to the galvanic battery which like the most faithful of servants instantly sent a spark to fire the torpedo  the result was tremendous  a column of seething mud and water twenty feet in diameter shot full thirty feet into the air overwhelming the launch in such a shower that many of the unprofessional spectators imagined she was lost  thus an imaginary ironclad was sent with a tremendous hole in her to the bottom of the sea  that this is no imaginary result will be seen in the sequel of our tale  why the shock has made the nettle herself tremble  i exclaimed in surprise  oh the poor boat cried my mother  no fear of the boat said young firebrand and as to the nettle why my good fellow i have felt our greatest ironclad the mighty thunderer of which i have the honour to be an officer quiver slightly from the explosion of a mere fivepounds torpedo discharged close alongside  few people have an adequate conception of the power of explosives and still fewer i believe understand the nature of the powers by which they are at all times surrounded  that 100pounds torpedo for instance which has only caused us to quiver would have blown a hole in our most powerful ship if fired in contact with it and yet the cushion of water between it and the tiny launch that fired it is so tough as to be quite a sufficient protection to the boat as you see  we did indeed see for the waspish little boat emerged from the deluge she had raised and steaming swiftly on turned round and retraced her track  on reaching about the same position as to the nettle she repeated the experiment with her second torpedo  splendid exclaimed young naranovitsch whose military ardour was aroused  it means does it not said bella a splendid ship destroyed and some hundreds of lives lost  wellyes said nicholas hesitatingly but of course it does not always follow you know that so many lives  he paused and smiled with a perplexed look  bella smiled dubiously and shook her head for it did not appear to either of them that the exact number of lives lost had much to do with the question  a sudden movement of the visitors to the other side of the ship stopped the conversation  they were now preparing to show the effect of a guncotton handgrenade in other words a species of bombshell meant to be thrown by the hand into an enemys boat at closequarters  this really tremendous weapon was an innocentlooking disc or circlet of guncotton weighing not more than eight ounces  innocent it would in truth have been but for the little detonator in its heart without which it would only have burned not exploded  attached to this disc was an instantaneous fuse of some length so that an operator could throw the disc into a passing boat and then fire the fuse which would instantly explode the disc  all this was carefully explained by firebrand to my astonished mother while the disc for experimental purposes was being placed in a cask floating in the water  on the fuse being fired this cask was blown into matchwooda wreck so complete that the most ignorant spectator could not fail to understand what would have been the fate of a boat and its crew in similar circumstances  how very awful said my mother  pray mr firebrand what is gunworstedi mean cotton  the young lieutenant smiled rather broadly as he explained in a glib and slightly singsong tone which savoured of the woolwich military academy that guncotton is the name given to the explosive substance produced by the action of nitric acid mixed with sulphuric acid on cotton fibre  he was going to add it contains carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen corresponding to when my mother stopped him  dear me mr firebrand is a popular explanation impossible  not impossible madam but rather difficult  let me see  guncotton is a chemical compound of the elements which i have just nameda chemical compound you will observe not a mechanical mixture like gunpowder  hence it explodes more rapidly than the latter and its power is from three to six times greater  my mother looked perplexed  what is the difference she asked between a chemical compound and a mechanical mixture  firebrand now in his turn looked perplexed  why madam he exclaimed in modulated desperation the ultimate molecules of a mixture are only placed beside each other so that an atom of gunpowder may be saltpetre charcoal or sulphur dependent on its fellowatoms for power to act whereas a chemical compound is such a perfect union of substances that each ultimate molecule is complete in its definite proportions of the four elements and therefore an independent little atom  now the next experiment continued firebrand glad to have an opportunity of changing the subject is meant to illustrate our method of countermining  you must know that our enemies may sometimes sink torpedoes at the entrance of their harbours to prevent our ships of war entering  such torpedoes consist usually of casks or cases of explosives which are fired either by electric wires like the telegraph when ships are seen to be passing over them or by contact that is to say an enemys ship entering a harbour runs against something which sets something else in motion which explodes the torpedo and blows it and the ship into what natives of the green isle call smithereens  this is very satisfactory when it happens to an enemy but not when it happens to onesself therefore when we have to enter an enemys harbour we countermine  this operation is now about to be illustrated  the last experiments exhibited the power of offensive torpedoes  there are several different kinds such as mr whiteheads fishtorpedo the harvey torpedo and others  dear me said my mother with a perplexed air i should have thought mr firebrand that all torpedoes were offensive  by no means those which are placed at the entrance of harbours and navigable rivers are defensive  to protect ourselves from the offensive weapon we use crinolines  my mother looked quickly up at her polite young mentor  you play with the ignorance of an old woman sir she said with a halfjocular air  indeed i do not madam i assure you returned firebrand with much earnestness  every ironclad is provided with a crinoline which is a powerful iron network hung all round the ship at some distance from her likepardon mea ladys crinoline and is intended to intercept any torpedo that may be discharged against her  attention was called at this point to the countermining experiments  it may be said in regard to these that they can be conducted in various ways but always with the same end in view namely to destroy an enemys mines by exploding others in their midst  for the sake of illustration it was supposed that the surrounding seabottom was studded with invisible torpedoes and that the nettle was a warship determined to advance into the enemys harbour  to effect this with safety and in order to clear away the supposed sunken torpedoes a countertorpedo was floated between two empty casks and sent off floating in the desired direction by means of the tide  this countermine consisted of an iron cylinder containing 300 pounds of powder and was electrically connected with the nettle  a small charge of guncotton was fixed to the suspender that held the torpedo to its casks  when at a safe distance from the ship this charge was fired  it cut the suspender and let the torpedo sink to the bottom there it was exploded with terrific violence as was quickly shown by the mighty fountain of mud water and smoke that instantly shot up into the air  it has been proved by experiment that 500 pounds of guncotton exploded below water will destroy all the torpedoes that lie within a radius of 120 yards  it is obvious therefore that a warship could advance into the space thus cleared and then send a second countermine ahead of her in the same way  if neither tide current nor wind will serve to drift the casks the operation might be accomplished by a small boat which could back out of danger after laying each torpedo and thus step by step or shot by shot the advance could be made in safety through the enemys defences  after this twelve small charges of guncotton were sunk in various directions each representing a countermine of 500 pounds  these were discharged simultaneously to demonstrate the possibility of extending the operations over a wide area  these miniature charges were sent down in small nets and were quite unprotected from the water so that the guncotton was wet when fired  this fact caught the attention of my mother at once  how can it go off when wet she exclaimed turning her bright little eyes in astonishment on her young companion  ha that is one of the strange peculiarities of guncotton replied firebrand with an amused look you dont require to keep it dry like powder  it is only necessary that there should be one small lump of dry guncotton inside the wet stuff with a detonator in its heart  a detonator you must know  oh i know what a detonator is said my mother quickly  well then continued firebrand the exploding of the detonator and the dry disc causes the wet guncotton also to go off as you have seen now they are going to exhibit one of the modes of defending harbours they have sunk four mines of 300 pounds of gunpowder each not far from where you see yon black specks floating on the water  the black specks are buoys called circuitclosers because they contain a delicate contrivancea compound of mechanism and galvanismwhich when the buoys are bumped close the electric circuit and cause the mine to explode  thus when a shipofwar sails against one of these circuitclosers she is immediately blown up  is not that rather a sneaking way of killing ones enemies asked my mother  young firebrand laughed and admitted that it was but pleaded that everything was fair in love and war  in actual warfare the circuitclosers are placed just over the mines which they are designed to explode but for safety on this occasion they were placed at a safe distance from their respective mines  a steamlaunch was used to bump them and a prodigious upheaval of water on each explosion showed clearly enough what would have been the fate of an ironclad if she had been over the mine  oh shade of nelson  i could not help exclaiming how shocked you must be if you are permitted to witness such methods of conducting war  ah yes sighed firebrand the bubble reputation you see is being transferred from the cannons mouth to the torpedo  i made no reply for my mind reverted to my laboratory in devonshire where lay the workingmodel of the terrible weapon i had spent so much time in perfecting  it seemed strange to me now that in the eager pursuit of a scientific object i had scarcely ever if at all reflected on the dire results that the use of my torpedo involved and i felt as if i were really guilty of the intent to murder  just before leaving home i had charged my model which was quite a large one capable of holding about 50 pounds of dynamite in the hope that i might prevail on the first lord of the admiralty and some of his colleagues to come down and see it actually fired  i now resolved to throw the dynamite into the sea break up my model and have done with explosives for ever  while my mind was running on this i was startled by an explosion close alongside  on turning towards the side of the ship i found that it was caused by the rending of a huge iron chain the links of which were more than one and a quarter inch in thickness  this powerful cable which could have held an ironclad was snapped in twain like a piece of thread by the explosion against it of only two and a half pounds of guncotton  very well done i said to firebrand but i think that a much smaller quantity of dynamite would have done it as effectively  now mrs childers said the young lieutenant the last experiment is about to be made and i think it will interest you even more than the others  see they are about to send off the electrical steampinnace  as he spoke a boat was being prepared alongside the ship  why exclaimed my mother almost speechless with surprise they have forgotten to send its crew in it  no madam said firebrand with one of his blandest smiles they have not forgotten her crew but there are services so dangerous that although the courage of the british sailor will of course enable him to face anything it has been thought advisable not to put it to too severe a test hence this automatic boat has been invented  it is steered and all its other operations are performed by means of electricity applied not on board the boat but on board of the nettle  this was indeed the case  the electric pinnace went off as he spoke her steamengines steeringgear and all the other apparatus being regulated by electric wires which were paid out from the ship as the boat proceeded on her mission of supposed extreme danger  right under the withering fire of the imaginary enemys batteries she went and having scorned the rain of small shot that swept over her like hail and escaped the plunging heavy shot that fell on every side she dropped a mine over her stern exploded it by means of a slow fuse turned round and steamed back in triumph amid the cheers of the spectators  this last was really a marvellous sight and the little boat seemed indeed to deserve the encomiums of firebrand who said that if cool calm pluck in the face of appalling danger merited anything that heroic little steampinnace ought to receive the victoria cross  i was still meditating on this subject and listening to the animated comments going on around me when i myself received a shock compared to which all the explosions i had that day witnessed were as nothing  it suddenly recurred to my memory that i had left a compound in my laboratory at home in a state of chemical preparation which required watching to prevent its catching fire at a certain part of the process i had been called away from that compound suddenly by nicholas just before we left for london and i had been so taken up with what he had to tell me that i had totally forgotten it  the mere burning of this compound would in itself have been nothing for my laboratory was an old outhouse quite unconnected with the dwelling but in the laboratory also lay my torpedo  the worst of it was that i had inserted a detonator and affixed a fuse feeling quite secure in doing so because i invariably locked the door and carried the key in my pocket  my face must have turned very pale for nicholas who came up at the moment looked at me with anxious surprise and asked if i were ill  no said i hurriedly no not illbutyesit is a slow process at best and not always certainsometimes takes a day or two to culminate the fusion may not have been quite completed or it may have failed altogether  too late i fear too late but i cannot rest till i know tell my mother im off homeonly businessdont alarm her  regardless of the amazed looks of those who stood near me i broke from the grasp of nicholas leaped into one of the boats alongside seized the oars and rowed ashore in mad haste  fortune favoured me  the train had not left though it was just in motion  i had no time to take a ticket but leaping upon the moving footboard i wrenched open a carriagedoor and sprang in  it was an express  we went at full sixty miles an hour yet i felt as if we moved like a snail  no words can adequately explain the state of my mind and bodythe almost uncontrollable desire i felt to spring out of the train and run on ahead  but i was forced to sit still and think i thought of the nearness of the laboratory to our kitchen windows of the tremendous energy of the explosive with which the modeltorpedo was charged of the mass of combustibles of all kinds by which it was surrounded of the thousand and one possibilities of the case and of my own inexcusable madness in not being more careful  at last the train pulled up at the town from which our residence is about two miles distant  it was now evening but it was summer and the days were long  hiring a horse at the nearest hotel i set off at a breakneck gallop  the avenuegate was open  i dashed in  the laboratory was not visible from that point being at the back of the house  at the front door i pulled up sprang to the ground let the horse go and ran forward  i was met by lancey coming round the corner  i saw at once that all was over  his face and hands had been scorched and his hair singed  i gasped for breath  no one killed  i asked  no sir nobody killed but most of us orribly scared sir  nobody hurt lancey  i asked again leaning against the side of the house and wiping my forehead  no sir nor urt continued my faithful groom hastening to relieve my mind youve no need to alarm yourself sir for were all alive and earty though i must say its about the wust buster sir that youve yet turned out of ands  it sent in the kitchen winders as if theyd bin made of tissue paper sir an cook she went into highstericks in the coalbunker margaret she swounded in the scullery and mary went into fits in the washus  but theyre all right again sironly raither skeery ever since  we ad some trouble in puttin it out for the cumbustibles didnt seem to care much for water  we got it under at last early this morning  this morning  yes sir  it blowd up about two hours arter you left for london an weve bin at it ever since  we was so glad your mother was away sir for it did make an uncommon crack  i was just sayin to cook not alf an hour since the master would have enjoyed that he would it was such a crusher  any ofofthe torpedo left lancey  i asked with some hesitation  the torpedo sir  bless your art it went up to the eavens like a skyrocket an blowed the outouse about to that extent that you couldnt find a bit big enough to pick your teeth with  on hearing this i roused myself and hastened to the scene of devastation  one glance sufficed  the spot on which my laboratory had stood was a blackened heap of rubbish  now mother said i next day after relieving her mind by a full and rapid account of what had happened there is nothing that i know of to detain me at home  i will therefore see to having the yacht got ready and we shall all go to sea without delay    chapter five  terrible torpedo tales followed by overturned plans  change of scene has almost always an invigorating effect on the mind whatever be the nature of your mind variety rest assured will improve its condition  so we thought my mother and i nicholas and bella as we lay one beautiful morning becalmed in the english channel  the yacht turned out to be a most charming vessel  schoonerrigged with two cabins one of which formed our salon during the day and the gentlemens bedroom by night the other being set apart entirely for the ladies  it was quite full  my mother and bella filled it  another female would have caused it to overflow  contrary to all expectation my mother turned out a capital sailor better even than bella on whom she attended during the first part of the voyage when the latter was ill  dyou think we shall have a good passage across the farfamed bay of biscay asked nicholas as he sat on the cabin skylight smoking a mild cigar  talking of that smoking was the only thing in which i could not join my future brotherinlaw  i know not how it is but so it is that i cannot smoke  i have often tried to but it invariably makes me sick for which perhaps i ought to be thankful  it is to be hoped we shall i replied to his question but i am not a judge of weather  what think you mr whitlaw  i said addressing my skipper  i hope we shall sir replied the skipper with a deferential touch of his cap and a glance round the horizon but i dont feel sure  mr whitlaw was an american and a splendid specimen of the nation to which he belongedtall lanky broadshouldered gentlemanly grave selfpossessed prompt goodhumoured i have seldom met a more agreeable man  he had been in the northern navy of america during the last war and had already introduced some of the discipline to which he had been accustomed amongst my small crew  bella was up on deck enjoying the sunset so was my mother  lancey was busy cleaning my fowlingpiece near the companionhatch  it is charming exclaimed my mother  so calm said bella  and settledlooking remarked nicholas flipping the end of his cigar over the side  mr whitlaw does not appear to think so favourably of the weather i remarked  the skipper looking gravely at a particular point on the horizon said in a quiet tone  the clouds are heavy  from which you judge that the fine weather may not last  it may be so but the indications are not certain was his cautious reply  that night we were in a perfect chaos of wind and water  the stormfiend seemed to have reserved all his favours in order to give us a befitting reception  the sea roared the wind yelled the yachtbut why repeat the ofttold tale that invariably ends with biscay o  a week later and we were in a dead calm revelling in warmth bathed in sunshine within the straits of gibraltar  it was evening  all sail was set  not a puff of wind rendered that display available  the reefpoints pattered as the yacht rolled gracefully from side to side on the gentle heave of the mediterraneans bosom  sitting on a rug on the deck between my mother and nicholas bella said in a low quiet tone this is perfect felicity  agreed said nicholas in a similar tone with a puff from his cigar  bella referred to the calm of course  a seacaptain sitting astride the bulwarks of his ship in the doldrums far far away from bella said in reference to a similar calm which had beset him for three weeks this is perfectly maddening with many other strong expressions which we would rather not record but bella of course did not know that and could not be expected to reflect on it  she was taken up with her own comforts at the time  my dear said mrs childers i think i shall go to bed  come with me  goodnight nicholas  will you keep the skylight off tonight jeffry  it was too hot in our cabin last night  of course i will said i why did you not ring and let me know that you would like fresh air  but i shall see to it tonight  about eleven oclock that night i lay on one of the lockers of the main cabin in a wakeful mood  nicholas lay on the other locker in that profound slumber which is so characteristic of healthy youth  his regular breathing was the only sound i heard except the soft footfall of our skipper as he slowly paced the deck  presently i heard another step  it advanced and a low fine night sir apprised me that it was lancey who had come on deck to air himself after the culinary and other labours of the day for he served in the capacity of cook and steward to the yacht  i wish youd tell me about that expedition you was speakin off to the master this morning said lancey  with pleasure replied the skipper sit down here and ill spin it off to you right away  i knew by the sound of their motions that they had seated themselves at the foot of the mainmast just between the skylights of the two cabins and feared that their talk might disturb my mother but reflecting that she must have got to sleep long ago i thought it better not to disturb them unless their talk should become too loud  as for myself in my wakeful mood their converse could not annoy me  after a time it began to interest me deeply  it was about the blowingup of southern ironclads was it not said the skipper  as he spoke i could distinctly hear the puff puff of his pipe between each halfdozen words  just so replied lancey  the master is uncommon fond of blowinsup and inquirin into the natur of things  i never knowd another except one as beat im at inwestigation but that one beat everybody i ever seen or heard of  he was a scotch boy named sandy  what was his other name asked the skipper  avent a notion replied lancey  we never called im anythink else i dont believe he ad any other name  he said he was the son of an apothecary  no doubt the schoolmaster knew is other name if he ad one but he never used it and we boys were content with sandy  that boy sir seemed to me to know everythink and was able i believe to do hanythink  he was a tremendous fighter too though not out o the way as regards size  he could lick the biggest boy in the school and when he made up his mind to do a thing nothin on earth could stop him adoin of it  good said the skipper with an emphatic puff thats what we americans call the power to go ahead  did sandy become a great man  dont know answered lancey  he went aead too fast for me to foller  one day the master gave im a lickin  he vowed hed be revenged  next mornin early he got up an smashed the school winders redooced the masters desk to matchwood an walked away whistlin  i never seed im since  nor heard of him  nor eard of im  that was a pity said the skipper with a prolonged whiff  it was  but go on mister whitlaw with your hanecdotes  i couldnt rightly hear all you said to the master  it was about torpedo warfare we were talking said the skipper  you know that sort o thing is only in its infancy but the americans as usual had the honour of starting it fairly into being  the honour eh said lancey hm well im not so sure about the honour but go on  well whether it be an honour or no i wont dispute returned the skipper with a puff but of this i am sure that during the late war between the north and south in america torpedo practice was regularly brought into play for the first time and the case which i brought before mr childers yesterday is only one of many which i could describe  ill not relate the same story but another and a better  about the beginning of the war in 1862 the confederatesthese were the southern menblew up our ironclad the cairo in which i lost one of my most intimate friends and in 1864 they attempted to blow up the wabash and myself along with it  the cairo business was caused by sunk torpedoes  she was going up the yazoo river at the time and had lowered a boat to search for torpedoes which were known to be sunk there  they succeeded in fishing up one which was found to be an exploded one  meanwhile the cairo having got rather too close in shore backed out towards the middle of the stream when two explosions occurred in quick succession one close to the portquarter the other under the portbow  the effect was tremendous  some of the heavy guns were actually lifted from the deck  the captain instantly shoved the cairo on the bank and got a hawser out to a tree to keep her if possible from sinking in deep water  the pumps steam and hand were set going immediately but her whole frame ironclad though she was had been so shattered that nothing could save her  twelve minutes afterwards she slipped down into six fathoms water giving them barely time to get out the boats and save the sick men aboard and the arms my friend was one of the sick and the moving was ultimately the death of him though no lives were lost at the time  youre not tellin me crackers are you said lancey in an incredulous tone  my good fellow returned the skipper i wish that i were  the story is only too true and i would it were the only one of the sort i had to tell  you can find a book in london see note 1 if you like which tells all about this and the other torpedo work done during the late american war  well then said lancey in the tone of an eager listener while by the tapping on the combings of the hatchway i could distinguish that he was emptying his pipe with a view no doubt to the enjoyment of another and what happened when they tried to blow you up  well you must know resumed the skipper it was long afterwards near the end of the war  i was in the us steamer wabash at the time we were at anchor off charleston and we kept a sharp lookout at that time for it was a very different state of things from the woodenwall warfare that nelson used to carry on  why we never turned in a night without a half sort of expectation of being blown into the sky before morning  it was uneasy work too for although american sailors are as good at facing death as any men they dont like the notion of death coming in on them like a sneak below the waterline and taking them in the dark while asleep  we were always on the alert and doubly so at that time for only a short while previously the confederates had sunk another of our ironclads the housatonic with one of their torpedodavidslittle boats that were so called because compared with the great ironclads they were meant to attack they somewhat resembled david when he went out against goliath  well as i said the wabash was at anchor and it was nightnot very late about ten but it was very dark  fortunately the deck was in charge that night of a young officer named craven and never was an officer worse named or better deserving to be called courage  he had his wits about him  at the hour i have named he observed something on the starboardquarter about 150 yards off  it resembled a plank on the water  in reality it was a torpedodavid  it was opposite the mainmast when first observed going rapidly against the tide  at that moment it turned and made straight for the ship craven was up to the mark  he commenced with volleys of musketry beat the gong for the crew to assemble at quarters rang four bells for the engine to go ahead opened fire with the watch and the starboard battery and gave orders to slip the cable  his orders you may be sure were obeyed with promptitude  the gong sent every man from his hammock as if he had received an electric shock jackinthebox never came out of his box more promptly than each man shot up the hatchway  an exaggerated idea of the effect of torpedoes if that were possiblehad got possession of us  we were at our quarters in a moment the ship moved ahead the chain slipped and the torpedoboat passed us about forty yards astern  a round shot from us at the same moment appeared to strike it  we cheered  a second shot was fired and appeared to send it to the bottom for we saw it no more  but now our turn came continued the skipper refilling his pipe puff you see we were not so well situated as the southerners for the use of this weapon for we had to go in to attack their forts while they had only to defend themselves which they did largely with sunk torpedoes  we had long been desirous of revenging their attacks in a similar fashion and at last we were successful on the 27th of october  i had the good luck to be one of the expedition  it was risky work of course  we all knew that but where is the nation worthy of the name that will not find men for risky work  people talk about the difference of courage in nations  in my opinion that is all gammon  most nations that lie near to one another are pretty much alike as to courage  in times of trial among all nations the men of pluck come to the front and the plucky men be they american english french german russian or turk do pretty much the same thingthey fight like heroes till they conquer or die  better if they didnt fight at all remarked lancey  thats true but if youre attacked you must fight  anyhow on this particular occasion we attacked the confederate ironclad ram albemarle and sent her to the bottom  i had volunteered for the duty with some other men from the squadron and we started in a steamlaunch under lieutenant cushing  the distance from the mouth of the river to where the ram lay was about eight miles the stream averaging 200 yards in width and being lined with the enemys pickets so that we had to proceed with the utmost possible caution  we set out in the dead of night  there was a wreck on our way which was surrounded by schooners and we knew that a gun was mounted there to command the bend of the river  we had the good luck however to pass the pickets and the wreck without being discovered and were not hailed until seen by the lookout of the ram itself  without replying to the hail we made straight at her under a full head of steam  the enemy sprang their rattles rang their bell and commenced firing  the albemarle was made fast to a wharf with a defence of logs around her about thirty feet from her side  a chance fire on the shore enabled us to see this although the night was intensely dark and raining  from the report afterwards published by the commander of the albemarle it seems that a good lookout had been kept  the watch also had been doubled and when we were seen about three in the morning they were all ready  after hailing a brisk fire was opened on us both by small arms and large guns but the latter could not be brought to bear owing to our being so close and we partially disturbed the aim of the former by a dose of canister at close range  paymaster swan of the otsego was wounded near me and some others  my own jacket was cut in many places and the air seemed full of bullets  our torpedoboom was out and ready  passing close to the albemarle we made a complete circle round her so as to strike her fairly  then lieutenant cushing gave the order and we went straight at her bows on in a moment we struck the logs just abreast of the quarterport with such force that we leaped half over them at the same time breasted them in  the boom was lowered at once  now lads a vigorous pull said cushing  we obeyed and sent the torpedo right under the overhang of the ship it exploded  at the same instant the albemarles greatgun was fired a shot seemed to go crashing through the boat and a dense mass of water rushed in from the torpedo  it seemed to me as if heaven and earth had come together  smoke and yells with continued firing at only fifteen feet range followed in the midst of which i heard the commander of the ironclad summon us to surrender  i heard our lieutenant twice refuse and then ordering the men to save themselves he jumped into the water  i followed him and for some time swam in the midst of a showerbath caused by plunging shot and bullets but not one of them struck me  at last i reached the shore and escaped  at the time i thought we must have failed in our purpose but i was mistaken  though we had lost one boat and some of our men many of them being captured i learned that the albemarle had sunk in fifteen minutes after the explosion of the torpedo only her shield and smokestack being left out of the water to mark the spot where a mighty ironclad had succumbed to a few pounds of wellapplied gunpowder  if that be so said lancey after a pause and deep sigh it seems to me no manner of use to build ironclads at all and that it would be better as well as cheaper in time to come to fight all our battles with torpedoboats  it may be so replied the skipper rising but as that is a subject which is to be settled by wiser heads than ours and as you have to look after the ladies breakfast tomorrow morning id strongly advise you to turn in  lancey took the hint and as he slept in a berth close to the cabin i quickly had nasal assurance that he had thrown care and torpedoes to the dogs  it was not so with myself  much of the information which mr whitlaw had unconsciously conveyed to me was quite new for although i had as a youth read and commented on the late american war while it was in progress i had not given to its details that amount of close study which is necessary to the formation of a reasonable judgment  at first i could not resist the conviction that my skipper must have been indulging in a small amount of exaggeration especially when i reflected on the great strength and apparent invulnerability of such massive vessels as our thunderer but knowing the sedate and truthful character of mr whitlaw i felt perplexed  little did i think at the time that i should live to see and that within the year the truth of his statements corroborated with my own eyes  i meditated long that night on war and its results as well as the various processes by which it is carried on and i had arrived at a number of valuable conclusions which i would have given worlds to have been able to jot down at the moment when i was overtaken by that which scattered them hopelessly to the winds i fell sound asleep  the rest of this delightful voyage i am compelled to pass over in order that i may come to matters of greater importance  we had reached the neighbourhood of the beautiful town of nice when my dear mother to my surprise and mortification suddenly announced that she could not endure the sea any longer  she had kept pretty well she admitted and had enjoyed herself too except when listening to those dreadful stories of the captain about the american war which had travelled to her down the aftercabin skylight during wakeful hours of the night  despite appearances she said she had suffered a good deal there was something she declared like a dumpling in her throat which always seemed about to come up but wouldnt and which she constantly tried to swallow but couldnt  in these circumstances what could i do  we had meant to land at nice in passing  i now resolved to leave my mother and sister there and proceed eastwardit might be to egypt or the black seawith naranovitsch  the latter had ordered his letters to be forwarded to nice we therefore ran into the port and while my mother and sister and i drove to the chateau to see the splendid view from that commanding position he went off to the postoffice  on returning to the yacht we found poor nicholas in deep distress  he had received a letter announcing the death of his father and requiring his immediate return to russia  as the circumstances admitted of no delay and as my mother could not be prevailed on to go farther in the yacht it was hastily arranged that she and bella should return through france to england and that nicholas should take charge of them  our plans being fixed they were at once carried into effect and the same evening i found myself alone in my yacht with no one but the skipper and crew and the faithful lancey to keep me company  the world was now before me where to choose  after a consultation with my skipper i resolved to go on a cruise in the black sea and perhaps ascend the danube in spite of the rumours of possible war between the russians and turks    note 1  a treatise on coastdefence   compiled from official reports of officers of the united states  by von scheliha lieutenantcolonel and chief engineer of the department of the gulf of mexico of the army of the late confederate states of america    chapter six  turk and bulgariana wrestling match and a dispute  river navigation is to my mind most captivating but space forbids that i should enlarge on it and on many other points of interest in this eventful voyage  i shall therefore pass over the dardanelles and the bosporus leaving the great and classic stamboul itself behind untouched and transport the reader at once to one of those touches of nature which make the whole world kin  it is a little village on the danube riverthe mighty danube which bears the fleets of the world on its ample breast  we had been a considerable time in the river for we took things very leisurely before reaching the village to which i refer  it was named yenilik  while i had been rejoicing in the varied scenerythe lagoons and marshes of the several mouths of the great river and the bolder prospects of hill and dale higher upi had not been idling my time or making entire holiday of it for i had devoted myself to the study of the turkish language  my powers as a linguist may not perhaps be above the average nevertheless i confess to a considerable facility in the acquisition of languages  russian i already knew very well having as before intimated spent a considerable time in st petersburg  desiring to perfect myself in turkish i undertook to teach my man lancey  not that i had much opinion of his abilityfar from it but i entertain a strong belief in the scriptural idea that two are better than one  of course i do not hold that two fools are better than one wise man but two men of average ability are in nearly all circumstances better than one especially if one of them is decidedly and admittedly superior to the other  lanceys powers were limited but his ambition was not so and i am bound to add that his application was beyond all praise  of course his attainments like his powers were not great  his chief difficulty lay in his tendency to drop the letter h from its rightful position in words and to insert it along with r and k in wrong places  but my efforts to impress lanceys mind had the satisfactory effect of imbedding minute points of the language deeply in my own memory  the village to which i have referred was in bulgariaon the right or southern shore of the danube  it was a pretty spot and the bright sunny weather lent additional charms to water rock and tree while the twittering of birds to say nothing of the laughter and song of men women and children working in the fields or engaged in boisterous play added life to it  towards the afternoon i landed and accompanied by lancey went up to the chief store or shop of the village  it was a primitive store in which the most varied and incongruous articles were associated  the owner of the shop was engaged in bargaining with i think one of the finest specimens of manhood i ever saw  his name i accidentally learned on entering for the shopman at that moment said  no dobri petroff i cannot let you have it for less  the shopman spoke in the bulgarian tongue which being a kindred dialect of the russian language i understood easily  too dear said petroff as he turned over the article a piece of calico with a goodhumoured affectation of contempt  dobri petroff was a young man apparently not more than twentyfive tall broad deepchested smallwaisteda perfect study for an apollo both dress and language betokened him an uneducated man of the bulgarian peasantry and his colour seemed to indicate something of gipsy origin but there was an easy frank deportment about him and a pleasant smile on his masculine countenance which told of a naturally free if not freeandeasy spirit  although born in a land where tyranny prevailed where noble spirits were crushed independence destroyed and the people generally debased there was an occasional glance in the black eye of dobri petroff which told of superior intelligence a certain air of natural refinement and a strong power of will  no dobri no not a rouble less repeated the shopman  petroff smiled and shook back his black curly hair as a lion might in sporting with an obstinate cub  at that moment a turk entered  his position in society i could not at the time guess but he had the overbearing manner of one who might have been raised by favour from a low to a high station  he pushed petroff rudely out of his way and claimed the entire attention of the shopman which was at once and humbly accorded  a fine expression of fierce contempt flashed across petroffs countenance but to my surprise he at once drew aside  when the turk was served and had gone out the shopman turned to me  after petroff i said bowing towards the man  the surprise and pleasure of petroff was evidently great but he refused to take advantage of my courtesy and seemed so overwhelmed with modest confusion at my persisting that he should be served before me that he ultimately left the shop much to my regret without making his purchase  to my inquiries the shopman replied that dobri was the blacksmith of the place and one of its best and steadiest workmen  after completing my purchases i left and strolled through the village towards its further extremity  the turks seem to ave it all their own way ere sir said lancey as we walked along  if the treatment we have seen that man receive were the worst of it i replied the bulgarians would not have very much to complain of though insolence by superiors to inferiors is bad enough  they have however more than that to bear lancey the story of bulgarian wrongs is a long and a very sad one  as we strolled beyond the village and were engaged in earnest converse on this subject we suddenly came on a group of holidaymakers  a number of the peasantry were assembled in a field engaged in dances games and athletic sports  we mingled with the crowd and looked on they were engaged at the time in a wrestling match  little notice was taken of our appearing so intent were they on the proceedings  two strong men were engaged in what i may call a tremendous hug  each was stripped to the waist  their muscles stood out like those of hercules as they strained and tugged  at last they went down one being undermost with both shoulderblades touching the ground and a loud cheer greeted the victor as he stood up  he was a splendid animal unquestionablyover six feet with immense chest and shoulders and modest withal but a man of about five feet eight stepped into the ring and overthrew him with such ease that a burst of laughter mingled with the cheer that followed  the triumph of the little man was however shortlived for a bulgarian giant next made his appearanceevidently a stranger to those presentand after a prolonged struggle laid the little man on his back  for some time this giant strutted about defiantly and it appeared as if he were to remain the champion for no one seemed fit or willing to cope with him  at last some gipsy girls who were sitting in front of the ring urged one of their tribe a tall strong young fellow to enter the lists against the giant  the youth consented and entered the ring but a quick throw from the giant sent him sprawling to the great disappointment of his brunette friends  amongst the girls present there sat a remarkably pretty young woman whom the others endeavoured to urge to some course of action to which she at first objected  after a little persuasion however she appeared to give in and rising left the circle  soon after she returned with a magnificent specimen of humanity whom she pushed into the ring with evident pride  it was dobri petroff  the villagers greeted him by name with a ringing cheer as he advanced  with a modest laugh he shook his huge antagonist by the hand  he stripped to the waist and each man presented a rounded development of muscular power which would have done credit to any of the homeric heroes but there was a look of grand intelligence and refinement in petroffs countenance which would probably have enlisted the sympathies of the villagers even if he had been an utter stranger  having shaken hands the wrestlers began to walk round each other eagerly looking for a chance to get the catch  it seemed at first as if neither liked to begin when suddenly the bulgarian turned sharp on petroff and tried a favourite throw but with the lithe easy motion of a panther the blacksmith eluded his grasp  the excitement of the spectators became intense for it now seemed as if the two huge fellows were wellmatched and that a prolonged struggle was about to take place  this however was a mistake  the villagers apparently had underrated the powers of their own champion and the gipsy girls looked anxious evidently fearing that the hitherto victorious stranger would again triumph  for some moments the cautious walkround continued then there was a sudden exclamation of surprise from the crowd for the blacksmith seized his adversary by the waist and with a quick throw caused him to turn almost a somersault in the air and to come down on his back with stunning violence  while the heavy fellow lay as if slightly stunned on the ground petroff stooped again shook hands with him and then lifting him high in the air as though he had been but a boy set him on his feet and turned to resume his jacket amid the enthusiastic cheers of the people  petroffs jacket was handed to him by a pretty darkeyed girl of about five years of age who bore so strong a resemblance to the young woman who had brought the blacksmith on the scene that i at once set them down as sisters  the child looked up in the champions face with such innocence that he could not resist the temptation to stoop and kiss her then taking the little ones hand he pushed through the crowd and left the ring  i observed that the young woman also rose and went with them  feeling interested in these people  lancey and i followed and overtook them before they had quitted the field  i said in russian  goodday petroff you overthrew that fellow with greater ease than i had expected  the blacksmith gave me a look of pleased recognition as he returned my salutation  well sir he said it was not difficult  the man is strong enough but does not understand the art well  you are an englishman i think  i am said i somewhat surprised as well by the question as by the superior manner and address of the man  it was a man from your land returned petroff with a grave earnest look who taught me to wrestlea man from cornwall  he was a sailora stout fellow and a good man  his vessel had been anchored off our village for some time so that we saw a good deal of him  they had a passenger on board who landed and went much about among the people  he was a german and called himself a colporteur  he taught strange doctrines and gave away many bibles printed in the bulgarian tongue  ah said i no doubt he was an agent of the british and foreign bible society  perhaps so returned petroff with a somewhat perplexed look but he said nothing about that  his chief desire seemed to be to get us to listen to what he read out of his bible  and some of us did listen too  he gave one of the bibles to my wife here and she has been reading it pretty eagerly ever since  what this then is your wife  i exclaimed  yes marika is my wife and ivanka is my daughter replied petroff with a tender glance at the little girl that trotted by his side  perhaps marika your cornish friend may have taught you to speak english said i in my native tongue turning to the woman  marika shook her pretty head laughed and blushed  she seemed to understand me but would not consent to reply in english  the colporteur of whom you have spoken said i turning to the blacksmith and again speaking russian did you a great service when he gave your wife the word of god  dobri petroff assented but a frown for a minute overspread his face yes he said i admit that but he also taught me to think and it might have been better for mefor many of us in this landif we did not think if we could eat and sleep and work like the brutes that perish  i feared that i knew too well what the man referred to and would gladly have dropped the subject but could not do so without appearing rude  it is always well to think said i when we think rightly that is in accordance with the teachings of the bible about which we have just been speaking  marika has read much of it to you no doubt  she has said the blacksmith with a touch of sternness and among other things she has read to me that oppression driveth even a wise man mad  am i to understand that as merely stating the fact or justifying the madness  without waiting for a reply to the question he went on hurriedly  you saw that turk today who pushed me aside as if i had been a dog that showed you the spirit of the men in power here but you little know their practices  petroff said i interrupting and looking at the man earnestly forgive me if i say that we had better not discuss the subject now  i have just arrived in your land and know little about it yet  when i have seen and heard and thought much i will be better able to understand you  petroff admitted with ready grace that i was right and thrusting his fingers through the wild clustering curls of his black hair as if to let the air circle more freely about his head he turned sharp round and pointed to a cottage which stood at a short distance from the highroad at the entrance to the village  that is our home sir we shall feel happy if you will enter it  i willingly complied and turned with them into the bypath that led to it  the cottage was a mere hut long and low one end of which constituted the forge the other end divided into three compartments being the dwellinghouse  here i found the hand of marika very evident in the neatness and cleanliness of everything in and around the place  the owners were very poor but there was sufficient for comfort and health on a shelf in a corner lay the bible which the family had received from the colporteur  it was the only book in the house and evidently a cherished treasure  in another corner on a rudelymade but warm couch lay a treasure of a different stampa boy apparently about two years of age  as i looked at the curly black hair the wellshaped nose the firm rosy lips and the broad brow i turned to petroff with a smile and said  i need not ask if that boy is yours  the man did not at once reply but seized the child which our entrance had awakened and raised it high above his head  do you hear that little dob  the gentleman knows who you are by your mothers eyes  nay said i with a laugh by its fathers nose  but now that you mention the eyes i do recognise the mothers plainly  how old is he  this was the first of a series of questions which opened the hearts of these people to me  on the strength of these jetblack eyes and the wellshaped nose to say nothing of the colporteur and the bible lancey and i struck up quite an intimate friendship insomuch that at parting little dob gave me a familiar dab on the face and ivanka turned up her sweet little mouth to be kissedquite readily and of her own accord there is nothing on earth so captivating as a trustful child  my heart was knit to little ivanka on the spot and it was plain that little dob and lancey were mutually attracted  i remained at that village several days longer than i had intended in order to cultivate the acquaintance of the blacksmiths family  during that time i saw a good deal of the other villagers and found that petroff was by no means a typical specimen  he was above his compeers in all respects except in his own opinion one of natures gentlemen in short who are to be found not numerously perhaps but certainly in almost every land with unusual strength of intellect and breadth of thought and power of frame and force of will and nobility of aspiration  such men in free countries become leaders of the good and brave  in despotic lands they become either the deliverers of their country or the pests of societythe terror of rulers the fomentors of national discord  doubtless in many cases where right principles are brought to bear on them they learn to submit and sometimes become mitigators of the evils which they cannot cure  most of the other inhabitants of this village some of whom were mohammedans and some christians of the greek church were sufficiently commonplace and uninteresting  many of them appeared to be simply lazy and inert  others were kindly enough but stupid and some were harsh coarse and cruel very much as we find the peasantry in other parts of the world where they are illtreated or uncared for  while staying here i had occasion to go on shore one morning and witnessed a somewhat remarkable scene in a cafe  lancey and i having made a longer excursion than usual and the day being rather hot resolved to refresh ourselves in a native coffeehouse  on entering we found it already pretty well filled with bulgarians of whom a few were moslems  they were apparently of the poorer class  most of them sat on low stools smoking chiboukslong pipes with clay heads and amber mouthpiecesand drinking coffee  the christians were all engrossed at the moment of our arrival with a stranger who from his appearance and the package of books which lay open at his side i at once judged to be a colporteur  dobri petroff i observed was near him and interested so deeply in what was going on that he did not at first perceive us  having selected some new testaments and bibles from his pack the colporteur handed them round for inspection  these i found were printed in the modern bulgarian tongue  the people greatly admired the binding of the volumes and began to evince considerable interest in what the colporteur said about them  at last he proposed to read and as no objection was made he read and commented on several passages although a german he spoke bulgarian fluently and ere long had aroused considerable interest for the people had little or no knowledge of the bible the only one to which they had access being that which lay on the pulpit of the greek church of the village and which being written in the ancient slavic language was incomprehensible by them  the priests in the greek church there are generally uneducated men and their intoned services and unknown tongue do not avail much in the way of enlightenment  the schoolmasters i was told by those who had good opportunity of judging are much better educated than the priests  i observed that one of these who had on a former visit been pointed out to me by my friend dobri sat not far from the colporteur smoking his chibouk with a grave critical expression of countenance  at last the colporteur turned to the 115th psalm and i now began to perceive that the man had a purpose and was gradually leading the people on  it is well known that the greek church although destitute of images in its religious buildings accords the same reverence or homage to pictures which the romish church does to the former  at first as the colporteur read the people listened with grave attention but when he came to the verses that describe the idols of the heathen as being made of silver and gold the work of mens hands with mouths that could not speak and eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear several of the more earnest listeners began to frown and it was evident that they regarded the language of the colporteurs book as applicable to their sacred pictures and resented the implied censure  when he came to the eighth verse and read they that make them are like unto them so is every one that trusteth in them there were indignant murmurs for these untutored peasants whatever their church might teach about such subtleties as worshipping god through pictures accepted the condemnatory words in simplicity  why are you angry asked the colporteur looking round  because answered a stern old man who sat close to me your words condemn us as well as the heathen  they make out the pictures of our saints to be idolsimages and pictures being one and the same thing  but these are not my words said the colporteur they are the words of god  if these words are true returned the old man with increasing sternness then we are all wrong but these words are not truethey are only the words of your bible about which we know nothing  my friends returned the colporteur holding up the volume from which he had been reading this is not only my bible it is also yours the same that is read in your own churches only rendered into your own modern tongue  at this point dobri petroff who i observed had been listening keenly to what was said started up with vehemence and exclaimed  if this be true we can prove it  our bible lies in the neighbouring church and here sits our schoolmaster who reads the ancient slavic like his mothertongue  come let us clear up the matter at once  this proposal was heartily agreed to  the bulgarians in the cafe rose en masse and headed by the village schoolmaster went to the church where they found the bible that the priests were in the habit of reading or rather intoning and turned up the 115th psalm  it was found to correspond exactly with that of the colporteur  the result was at first received in dead silence and with looks of surprise by the majority  this was followed by murmuring comments and some disputes  it was evident that the seeds of an inquiring spirit had been sown that day which would bear fruit in the future  the colporteur wisely forbearing to press his victory at that time left the truth to simmer  see note 1  i joined him as he went out of the church and during a brief conversation learned from him that an extensive work is being quietly carried on in turkey which although not attracting much attention is nevertheless surely undermining the huge edifice of error by means of the lever of truth  among other things he said that in the year 1876 so many as twentyeight thousand bibles translated into the modern native tongue had been circulated in the turkish empire and in greece by the british and foreign bible society while the americans who are busily engaged in the blessed work in armenia had distributed twenty thousand copies  leaving the village of yenilik and my bulgarian friends with much regret i continued the voyage up the danube landing here and there for a day or two and revelling in the bright weather the rich prospects and the peaceful scenes of industry apparent everywhere as man and beast rejoiced in the opening year  time passed rapidly as well as pleasantly  sometimes i left the yacht in charge of mr whitlaw and in company with my trusty servant travelled about the country conversing with turks wherever i met them thus becoming more and more versed in their language and doing my best without much success to improve lancey in the same    note 1  the facts on which the above is founded were given to the author by the reverend doctor thomson who has resided in turkey as the agent of the british and foreign bible society for upwards of thirty years    chapter seven  the black clouds gather  while i was enjoying myself thus among the towns and villages on the banks of the danube admiring the scenery cultivating the acquaintance of the industrious rural population of the great river and making an occasional trip into the interior the dogs of war were let loose and the curtain rose on the darkest tragedy of the nineteenth century  the comic and the tragic are inextricably mingled in this world  i believe that this is no accident but like everything else a special arrangement  all fun makes man a fool but all sorrow makes him a desperado  the feeling of anxiety aroused by the war news was i may say mitigated by the manner of its announcement  sir cried lancey bursting into the cabin one afternoon while i was preparing for a trip ashore the roossians as declared war an the whole country is gettin hup in harms  of course i had been well aware for some time past that there was a prospect nay a probability of war but i had not allowed myself to believe it because i have a strong natural tendency to give civilised men credit for more sense than they appear to possess  that russia would really draw the sword and sacrifice millions of treasure and thousands of her best young lives to accomplish an object that could be more easily and surely attained by diplomacy with the expenditure of little money and no bloodshed seemed to me incredible  that the other european nations should allow this state of things to come to pass seemed so ridiculous that i had all along shut my eyes to facts and proceeded on my voyage in the confidence of a peaceful solution of the eastern question  in days of old i said to my skipper in our last conversation on this subject which we were fond of discussing the nations were less educated than now and less imbued perhaps with the principles of the peaceteaching gospel which many of them profess to believe but now the christian world is almost out of its teens intercommunication of ideas and interests is almost miraculously facile  thought is wellnigh instantaneously flashed from hemisphere to hemisphere if not from pole to pole commerce is so highly cultivated that international exhibitions of the raw material and the fabrics of all nations are the order of the day while goodwill between man and manto say nothing of womanis so prevalent that i really find it hard to believe in the possibility of a great european war  nevertheless replied mr whitlaw in a tone of cynicism to which at times he gave pretty free indulgence the crimean war occurred in the nineteenth century and the american civil war and the young widows of the francoprussian war are not yet greyhaired while their children have scarcely reached their teens  truly civilisation and the progress of knowledge which men boast of so much seem to be of little value  i pointed out to mr whitlaw that he was wrong in supposing that civilisation is of little value  if you compare the condition of the united states or england i said with that of the red indians of your own land or with the semibarbarous states of asia you must allow that civilisation has done much  it seems to me that the fault of mankind lies in expecting too much of that condition  civilisation teaches man how to make the world most comfortable to himself and to his fellows but there is a higher attainment than that and it is only christianity which can teach man how to sacrifice himself for others and in so doing to attain the same ends as those arrived at by civilisation with more important and lasting ends in addition  well then on that principle objected the skipper you ought to expect war just now for there is very little christianity going that i can see though plenty of civilisation  on these points we differ mr whitlaw said i for there seems to me very little civilisation at present considering the age of the world and on the other hand there is much genuine christianitymore i believe than meets the careless or the jaundiced eye  however now that war has been declared it becomes necessary that we should get out of the danube as fast as possible  accordingly the yachts head was turned eastward and we descended rapidly with the stream  my intention was good but the result was disastrous not an unwonted state of things the best intentions in human affairs being frequently doomed to miscarry  i must ask the reader now to turn aside with me from my own personal adventures to events which had occurred near the banks of the pruth the river that divides russia from turkey  here on tuesday the 24th of april 1877 a scene of the utmost animation and excitement prevailed  the emperor of all the russias was about to review his troops previous to the declaration of war on turkey  up to that time of course war had been expectedas regards the army eagerly desired but no declaration had absolutely been made  ungheni where the railway crosses the pruth and not far from kischeneff the capital of bessarabia was fixed on as the spot where the grand review should take place  great were the preparations for the reception of his majesty for whether majesty be right or wrong majesty must be honoured and cheered  majesty male or female represents power and power must be treated with respect nay ought to be so treatedwhen it behaves itself  there is something overwhelmingly grand in multitude  humanity cannot resist the influence  it is quite clear that the human race were meant to be gregarious  what were the orator without his multitude  i might go further and ask what were the multitude without its orator  flags and banners waved and ribbons rippled that day in bessarabia for the serried legions of russia marched in almost unending columns towards ungheni on the roumanian frontier and after they had passed the emperor himself made for the same point with the grand duke nicholas and the czarewitch and general ignatieff and the minister of war and many other dignitaries of the empire with a numerous and gorgeous staff  the day was magnificent  the people who streamed out to see the review were enthusiastic  perhaps if they had been bulgarian peasantry and had been able to foresee the future their enthusiasm would not have been so great  yet i do not say that their enthusiasm was misplaced they saw a nations chivalry assembled to fight and die if need be in the nations cause with its emperor to patronise and its nobles to lead the legions on in all of which there was ground for real enthusiasm  among the regiments that marched that day to ungheni was one to which i would draw special attention  it was not much better perhaps than the others but it was a good typical russian regiment and had a commander at its head who looked as if he could do it justice  they marched at a smart pace four miles an hour with a long dogged steady tramp that was clumsy to look at but seemed likely to last  few of the men were tall but they were burly squareset fellows broad of shoulder deep of chest and smart of limb  they wore a frenchlike blue cap with a red band round it and a blue tunic with loose blue trousers stuffed into boots that reached the knee  their knapsacks were hairy and their belts black the latter suggesting deliverance from that absurdity of old pipeclay  their greatcoats heavy and brown were worn in a roll over the left shoulder and each man carried his own kettle the latter being suggestive of tea and tuckin followed by tobacco and turnin  among these warriors in his proper position marched a noteworthy young lieutenant  he was my old college chum and brotherinlaw to be nicholas naranovitsch head and shoulders over his fellows straight as a poplar proud as a peacock and modest as an untried man ought to be  the spot for the review was well chosen on a gentle undulating hillside which enabled the spectators to see the whole army at once the weather was bright and sunny as i have said and the glitter of uniforms and thousands of bayonets with the broad blaze reflected from a long line of polished fieldpieces sent a thrill through many a heart suggesting glory  there were a few hearts also no doubt to whom they suggested the natural end for which these glorious things were called togetherblood and murder national ruination broken constitutions desolated homes and sudden death  holiday reviews are common enough all over the world but this was no holiday review  every one knew that it was the prelude to war and there was an appropriate gravity and silence in the conduct of spectators  it was deeply impressive too to watch the long lines and masses of troopseach unit full of youth strength energy enthusiasm hopestanding perfectly silent absolutely motionless like statues for full an hour and a half  their deep silence and immobility seemed to produce a sympathetic condition in the spectators there was no laughing jesting or chaff among them  even when the emperor arrived there was no cheering  a greater than the emperor had overawed them  they merely swayed open and took off hats deferentially as he passed  it was not till he began to ride round the lines with his brilliant staff that the silence was broken by music and cheers  of the review itself i will not speak  that and the threequarters of an hour mass which followed being over a murmur of expectation ran through the crowd and along the ranks like a solemn growl  then there was a deep intense silence which was faintly broken by the bishop of kischeneff reading the manifesto  he had not read far when sobs were heard  it was the voice of the emperor alexander who prided himself on the fact that the glory of his reign had hitherto been its peaceful character  they say that it had been his boast and hope that he should finish it without a war  previously he had said to the troops i have done everything in my power to avoid war and bloodshed  nobody can say we have not been patient or that the war has been of our seeking  we have practised patience to the last degree but there comes a time when even patience must end  when that time comes i know that the young russian army of today will not show itself unworthy of the fame which the old army won in days gone by  what the young army thought of the fame of its elder brother as well as of the sobs of its present emperor may be gathered from the fact that it went all but mad with enthusiasm  when the bishop finished reading there went up a wild and universal shout of joy of exultation of triumph of relief as though a great weight of suspense had been lifted from the hearts of the multitude  it spread through the army like light and was raised again and again until the very vault of heaven seemed to thunder while the soldiers tossed their caps in the air or twirled them on their bayonets for several minutes  then the ordre du jour of the grand duke nicholas commanderinchief of the army was read to every battalion squadron and battery and the days work was done  the right was legally and constitutionally granted to some hundreds of thousands of young men to go forth and slaughter burn and destroy to their hearts contentin other words to gather laurels  it was a sad days worksad for turkey sad for russia sad for europe and especially sad for the women children and old people of the theatre of the future war  it was a good days work for nobody and for nothing but it was the legitimate outcome of work that had been going on for years before  in pondering over the matter since i have often been led to ask myself with considerable surprise why did this war occurwho wanted it  it is quite plain that europe did not equally plain that turkey did not still more plain that the emperor alexander did not for he wept at the prospect of it like a child  who then did desire and cause it there are some things in this remarkable world that no man can understand  at all events i cannot  when i put the same question long afterwards to my dear and eversagacious mother she replied do you not think jeff that perhaps the men in power somewhere wanted it and caused it  there are some countries you know where the people are mere chessmen who have nothing whatever to do or say in the management of their own affairs and are knocked about wisely or foolishly as the case may be by the men in power  england herself was in that sad case once if we are to believe our school histories and some of the european nations seem to be only now struggling slowly out of that condition while others are still in bondage  i think my mother was right  after much consideration i have come to the conclusion that war is usually though not always caused by a few ambitious men in power at the head of enslaved or semienslaved nations not always i repeat because free nations being surrounded by savage barbarous and semifree are sometimes wheedled dragged or forced into war in spite of themselves  after the review some of the regiments started directly for the frontier  nicholas naranovitsch was summoned to the presence of his colonel nicholas was very young and inexperienced nevertheless during the brief period in which he had served he had shown himself possessed of so much ability and wisdom that he was already selected to go on a secret mission  what that mission was he never told me  one result of it however was that he and i had a most unexpected meeting on the danube in very peculiar circumstances    chapter eight  treats of torpedoes terrible catastrophe unexpected meetings and such like  to return to my personal experiences  it now became a matter of the deepest importance that we should get out of the river before the russian army reached its banks and stopped the navigation  the weather however was against us  it rained a great deal and the nights were very dark  the swollen current it is true was in our favour nevertheless as we had already spent several weeks in ascending the river it was clear that we should have to race against time in retracing our course  one dark night about the end of may as we were approaching the lower danube and speculating on the probability of our getting out in time i gave orders to run into a creek and cast anchor intending to land and procure a supply of fresh meat of which we had run short  better wait for daylight sir suggested my skipper  its not unlikely in these days of torpedoes that the entrance to places may be guarded by them  the skipper was so far right  the entrance to unimportant creeks indeed had not been guarded but the russians had already laid down many torpedoes in the river to protect them from turkish ironclads while engaged in constructing their pontoon bridges  he had scarcely made the remark when i was half stunned by a shock under my feet which seemed to rend the yacht asunder  there followed a terrific report and the deck was instantly deluged with water  there could be no doubt what had occurred  we had touched a torpedo and the yacht was already sinking we rushed to our little boat in consternation but before we could lower it our trim little vessel went down stern foremost  for a few moments there was a horrible rushing sound in my ears and i felt that i could hold my breath no longer when my head rose above the surface  i struck out with a gasp of relief which was as it were echoed close to me  i looked round as well as darkness and water would allow and observed an object floating near me  i pushed towards it and just as i caught hold i heard a panting voice exclaim  eaven be praised  amen said i is that you lancey  it is sir an im right glad to ear your voice  cetch a tight old sir its big enough for two  what is it  i asked  one of the encoops said lancey  its too small for two i fear said i seizing hold of it  hall right sir itll old us both  i can swim  clinging to our frail support we were hurried by the rapid current we knew not whither for although the moon was in the sky it was so covered with black clouds that we could not see whether we were being swept towards the shore or into the middle of the stream  besides this the wind was driving the rain and dashing the water into our eyes continuously  lancey i gasped it is uuseless to let ourselves besweswept about at the will of chance currents  the river is very wiwide  let us place ourselves side by sideandstrikeoutinthesame drection  uniformity of actionnecessaryin desprt situations  lancey at once acted on my suggestion gasping that haction ofof hany kind would tend totokp limbs warm  we proceeded in silence for some minutes when i observed the masts and rigging of several vessels drawn faintly against the dark sky  they were considerably to our right and the current was evidently bearing us away from them  a strong effort now lancey said i and we may reach them  i could feel as well as see that my faithful servant exerted himself to the utmost  as we approached the vessels their huge black hulls loomed up out of the dark surroundings and were pictured against the sky which dark though it was had not the intense blackness of the vessels themselves  we passed the nearest one within twenty yards  let go sir and swim for it cried lancey  no no  i cried earnestly never let go your  i stopped for lancey had already let go and made a dash for the nearest ship  i heard him hail and saw the flashing of lights for a moment then all was dark again and silent as i was hurried onward the feeling of certainty that he could not have been saved with so rapid a current sweeping him past filled my mind with intense anxiety  just then i felt a shock  the hencoop had been driven against another vessel which i had not observed  i tried to grasp her but failed  i uttered a loud cry not with the expectation that the crew of the vessel could save methat i knew to be impossiblebut in the hope that they might be ready for lancey should he be carried close to them  then i was dragged onward by the powerful current and tossed like a cork on the river  i had observed in passing that the vessel was a turkish ironclad and came to the conclusion that i had passed the turkish flotilla which i knew was at that time lying near the fortress of matchin  at the very time that i was being thus driven about by the wild waters and praying to god for the deliverance of my comrades and myself sometimes audibly more frequently in spiritanother and a very different scene was taking place not far off on the roumanian shore  the wind had fallen the clouds that covered the moon had just thinned enough to render darkness visible and nothing was to be heard save the continual croaking of the frogs which are very large and numerous in the marshes of the danube when four boats pushed off and proceeded quickly yet quietly up the river  no men were visible in these boats no sails no oars  they were steam launches and were destined for a night attack on the flotilla which i had just passed  their crews were covered nearly from stem to stern by iron bulletproof awnings which as well as the boats were painted black  the engines were so constructed as to make the least possible amount of noise and when speed was reduced no sound was heard save a dull throbbing that was almost drowned by the croaking frogs  it was a little after midnight when these boats set outtwo being meant to attack and two to remain in support  they had seven miles of river to traverse before reaching the enemy and it was while they were in the midst of their voyage that i chanced to meet them clinging to my hencoop  they came so straight at me that i was on the point of being run down by the leading boat when i gave a sharp halloo  it was replied to by one that indicated surprise and was decidedly english in tone  next moment the launch scraped violently against my raft and i saw a hand extended  grasping it i was drawn quickly into the boat  another hand instantly covered my mouth and i was thrust down into the bottom of the boat with considerable violence  being allowed to raise myself a little the chink of a dark lantern was opened and the light streamed full upon me  it at the same time lighted up several faces the inquiring eyes of which gazed at me intently  a stern voice demanded who i was  just then a gleam of light fell on a countenance which gazed at me with openmouthed and openeyed amazement  it was that of nicholas naranovitsch  i was just going to answer when the sight of him struck me dumb  nicholas touched the officer who had questioned me on the shoulder and whispered in his ear  he at once closed the lantern leaving us all in total darkness while nicholas caught me by the arm and making me sit down on a box of some kind beside him gave vent to his surprise in hurried broken whispers  a short time sufficed to explain how it was that i came to be there then he began to tell me about his being sent on a secret expedition and his having obtained leave to join in this midnight attack by torpedoboats when a low stern order to be silent compelled him to stop  from that moment he and i remained perfectly quiet and observant  after an hours steaming the russian launches came to the immediate neighbourhood of the enemys flotilla and the engines were slowed  each boat was armed with two torpedoes attached to the end of two long spars which moved on pivots and could also be dipped so that the torpedoes should be sunk ten feet under water at any moment  these torpedoeseach being about twenty inches long by about fifteen in diameterhad a double action  they could be fired by contact or in the event of that failing by electricity  the latter mode could be accomplished by an electric battery in a little box in the stern of each boat with which a long cable a quarter of an inch thick of fine wires twisted together connected each torpedo  all this of course i learned afterwards  at the time sitting in almost total darkness i knew nothing more than that we were bound on a torpedo expedition  i could scarcely persuade myself that it was not a dream but my numbed frame and drenched garments were too real to be doubted and then i fancied it must be a special judgment to punish me for the part i had taken in the improvement of these terrible implements of war  despite the slowing of the engines and the dead silence that prevailed the boats were observed by the turkish sentinels as we approached  who goes there was demanded in the turkish language  the launch in which i sat was the first to approach but the officer in command took no notice and made no reply  again the sentinel challengedperhaps doubting whether in the darkness his eyes had not deceived him as well as his ears  still no answer was given  the darkness was not now quite so intense and it was evident that longer concealment was impossible when therefore the challenge was given a third time our russian commander replied and i thought i observed a grim smile on his countenance as he said in turkish friends  the sentinel however seeing that we continued to advance expressed his disbelief in our friendship by firing at us  then there began an uproar the like of which i had never before conceived  being very near the turkish monitor at the time we distinctly heard the clattering of feet the shout and rush of sailors and the hurried commands to prepare for action  there was no lack of promptitude or energy on board the vessel  there was some lack of care or discipline however for i heard the order for the bow gun to be fired given three times and heard the click of the answering hammer three times in little more than as many seconds betokening a determined missfire  but if the bow gun had gone off and sent one of us to the bottom there would still have been three boats left to seal the vessels fate  at the fourth order a globe of flame leaped from the iron side of the monitor and a heavy shot went harmlessly over our heads  shouts and lights in the other vessels showed that the entire flotilla was aroused  i observed that the launch next to ours drew off and we advanced alone while the other two remained well behind ready to support  a sharp fusillade had now been opened on us and we heard the bullets pattering on our iron screen like unearthly hail but in spite of this the launch darted like a wasp under the monitors bow  the torpedoes were arranged so as to be detached from their spars at any moment and affixed by long light chains to any part of an attacked ship  round a rope hanging from the bow of the vessel one of these chains was flung and the torpedo was dropped from the end of the spar while the launch shot away paying out the electric cable as she went  but this latter was not required  the torpedo swung round by the current and hit the ship with sufficient violence  it exploded and the column of water that instantly burst from under the monitor half filled and nearly swamped us as we sped away  the noise was so great that it nearly drowned for an instant the shouts cries and firing of the turks  the whole flotilla now began in alarm to fire at random on their unseen foes and sometimes into each other  meanwhile the launches like vicious mosquitoes kept dodging about struck often though harmlessly by small shot but missed by the large guns  our commander now perceived that the monitor he had hit was sinking though slowly at the bows  he shouted therefore to the second launch to go at her  she did so at once slipped in under the fire and smoke that belched from her side and fixed another torpedo to her stern in the same manner as the former  the officer in charge perceived however that the current would not drive it against the ship  he therefore shot away for a hundred yardsthe extent of his electric cableand then fired the charge  a terrible explosion took place parts of the ship were blown into the air and a huge plank came down on the russian launch like an avenging thunderbolt pierced the iron screen which had so effectually resisted the bullets and passed between two sailors without injuring either  it did no further damage however and when the crew turned to look at their enemy they saw the great ironclad in the act of sinking  in a few minutes nothing of her was left above water except her masts  the crew were drowned with the exception of a few who escaped by swimming  by this time it was daybreak and our danger within near range of the other monitors of course became very great  just then an incident occurred which might have proved fatal to us  our screw fouled and the boat became unmanageable  observing this a turkish launch from one of the monitors bore down upon us  one of our sailors who chanced to be a good diver jumped over the side and cleared the screw  meanwhile the men opened so heavy fire on the enemys launch that she veered off and a few minutes later we were steaming down the danube towards the place from which the boats had set forth on their deadly mission  that was gloriously done wasnt it said nicholas to me with enthusiasm after the first blaze of excitement began to abateone of the enemys biggest ironclads sent to the bottom with all her crew at the trifling expense of two or three hundred pounds weight of powder and not a man injured on our side  i looked earnestly in my friends handsome face for a few seconds  yes said i slowly many thousands of pounds worth of human property destroyed months of human labour and ingenuity wasted and hundreds of young lives sacrificed to say nothing of relatives bereaved and souls sent into eternity before their timetruly if that is glory it has been gloriously done  bah  jeff returned nicholas with a smile youre not fit to live in this world you should have had a special one created for yourself but come let me hear how you came to be voyaging a la boyton on the danube  we at once began a rapid fire of question and reply  among other things nicholas informed me that the two boats which had accomplished this daring feat were commanded by lieutenants dubasoff and thestakoff one with a crew of fourteen the other of nine men  the world is changing nicholas said i as we landed  that the wooden walls of old england have passed away has long been acknowledged by every one but it seems to me now that her iron walls are doomed to extinction and that ere long the worlds warnavies will consist of nothing but torpedoboats and her wars will become simply tournaments therewith  it may be so said nicholas gaily as he led the way to his quarters it may be that extremes shall meet at last and we shall be reduced by sheer necessity to universal peace  that would be glorious indeed said i though it would have the uncomfortable effect of leaving you without employment  well in the meantime he rejoined as you are without employment just now you must consider yourself my prisoner for of course you cannot remain among us without passport profession purpose or business of any kind  to be shot for a spy is your legitimate due just now  but we shall want surgeons soon and newspaper correspondence is not a bad business in these times come ill see what can be done for you    chapter nine  in which lancey is tried suspected blown up captured halfhanged delivered and astonished  we must turn now to poor lancey from whom i parted in the waters of the danube but with whose fate and doings i did not become acquainted until long afterwards  as i had anticipated he missed the vessel of the turkish flotilla towards which he had struck out but fortunately succeeded in grappling the chain cable of that which lay next to it and the crew of which as the reader will recollect i had roused by a shout in passing  lancey soon let the turks know where he was  a boat being lowered he was taken on board but it was clear to him that he was regarded with much suspicion  they hurried him before the officer in charge of the deck who questioned him closely  the poor fellow now found that his knowledge of the turkish language was much slighter than in the pride of his heart while studying with me he had imagined  not only did he fail to understand what was said to him but the dropping of hs and the introduction of rs in wrong places rendered his own efforts at reply abortive  in these circumstances one of the sailors who professed to talk english was sent for  this man a fine stalwart turk with a bushy black beard began his duties as interpreter with the question  hoosyoo  eh say that again said lancey with a perplexed look  hoosyoo repeated the moslem with emphasis  hoosyoo repeated lancey slowly  oh i see with a smile of sudden intelligence whos you  just so  im jacob lancey groom in the family of mrs jeff childers of fagend in the county of devonshire england  this having been outrageously misunderstood by the turk and misinterpreted to the officer the next question was  wessyoocumfro  wessyoocumfro  again lancey repeated the word and once more with a smile of sudden intelligence exclaimed ah i see weres you come from  well i last come from the water avin previously got into it through the hupsettin of our boat  lancey hereupon detailed the incident which had left him and me struggling in the water but the little that was understood by the turks was evidently not believed and no wonder for by that time the russians had been laying down torpedoes in all directions about the danube to prevent the enemy from interfering with their labours at the pontoon bridges  the turkish sailors were thus rendered suspicious of every unusual circumstance that came under their notice  when therefore a big powerful and rather oddlooking man was found clinging to one of their cables they at once set him down as an unsuccessful torpedoist and a careful search was instantly made round the vessel as a precaution  meanwhile lancey was led rather roughly down to the cabin to be questioned by the captain  the cabin although very luxurious in its fittings was not so richly ornate as had been anticipated by the english groom whose conceptions of everything had been derived from the arabian nights entertainments or rather from a fanciful imagination fed by that romantic work  the appearance of the turkish captain however and the brightlycoloured costume of an officer who sat by his side were sufficiently striking and oriental  on lancey being placed before him the captain turned and said a few words to the officer at his side who was a splendid fellow in the prime of life with a square bony frame and red beard which harmonised if it did not contrast with his scarlet fez and blue tassel  a rich eastern shawl encircled his waist from the folds of which peeped the handles of a brace of pistols  he looked at the dripping englishman earnestly and sternly for a few moments and the slightest tinge of a smile lighted his grave countenance as he said in broken but sufficiently fluent english  the captin do want you to repeat vat you have say on deck  lancey repeated it with a considerable number of additions but no variations  after translating it all and listening to something in reply the officer turned again to lancey  the captin he said with quiet gravity bids me tell to you that you is a liar  lancey flushed deeply  i would tell you he said with a frown to tell the captain that es another ony that would show i was as badmannered as imself  if i do tells him zat returned the officer you should have your head cutted off immediately  lanceys indignation having already halfcooled and his memory being refreshed just then with some vivid remembrances of the eastern mode of summoning black slaves by the clapping of hands followed by the flying off of heads or the prompt application of bowstrings to necks he said still however with an offended air  well then tell im what you like hall ive got to say is that ive told the plain truth an es welcome to believe it or not as e likes  without the slightest change in his grave countenance or his appearing in the least degree offended by lanceys freeandeasy manner the redbearded officer again turned to address the captain  lancey now observed that the latter replied with a degree of deferential respect which seemed unnatural in mere brother officers  you is regarded as a spy said the redbeard turning once more to lancey and fixing his cold grey eye intently on him as if to read his thoughts  no i aint a spy returned the unfortunate man somewhat bitterly nor never mean to be  ang me if you like  ive nothink more to say  neither the captain nor the redbearded officer replied but the former waved his hand and the two sailors who had led lancey to the cabin again seized him and led him away more roughly than before  the free spirit of my poor servant resented this unnecessary rudeness and he felt a strong inclination to fight but discretion or some faint remembrance of scimitars and bowstrings induced him to submit  full well did he know what was the fatal doom of a spy and a sinking of the heart came over him as he thought of immediate execution  at the very least he counted on being heavily ironed and thrust into the darkest recesses of the hold  great then was his surprise when the man who had at first acted as interpreter took him below and supplied him with a dry shirt and a pair of trousers  thankfully accepting these and standing between two guns he put them on  who is the hofficer with the red beard he asked while thus engaged  the interpreter seemed unwilling to answer at first but on a repetition of the question replied  pasha  pasha eh  ah that accounts for the respect of the capnrather shorter in the legs these ere than i could ave wished owever beggars they say mustnt bewell theyre wide enough anyhowa pasha is e  dont look like a sailor though  is e a sailor  no replied the interpreter sharply  well well no offence meant said lancey buttoning his shirt  if you dont feel commoonicative i wont trouble you no more than to thank ee for the shirt an trousers which the latter bein dry is a blessin though they air a trifle short in the legs an wide in the ips  after this lancey was supplied with food  while he was eating it he was startled by sudden rushing and shouting which was immediately followed by the discharge of musketry on deck  he sprang up and seeing that the turkish sailors were grasping their arms and swarming up the hatchways he mingled with one of the streams  no one paid any attention to him  at that moment he felt a shock which he afterwards described as resembling an earthquake or the blowing up of a powdermagazine  part of the planking near to where he stood was shattered  some of the guns appeared almost to leap for an instant a few inches into the air  gaining the deck he ascertained that an attack of russian torpedoboats was going on  it was in fact the attack which i have already described the monitor by which lancey was rescued being that which had been selected by the russian commander as his victim  when the second torpedo exploded as already described lancey was standing near the gangway and saw that the men were lowering the boats in urgent haste for the vessel was evidently sinking  yoos know bout dat said a stern voice near him  at the same moment he was seized by the interpreter and another man who made an effort to hurl him into the sea  but lancey was strong and tenacious of life before a third sailor who was about to aid his comrades could act the red bearded officer appeared with the captain and was about to descend into the boat when he observed lancey struggling in the grasp of the sailors  spy he exclaimed in the turkish tongue you must not escape  get into the boat  the sailors fell back  lancey not sure whether to regard this as temporary deliverance or his deathwarrant hesitated but at a sign from the pasha he was collared by five or six men and hurled into the bottom of the boat where he lay halfstunned while they rowed towards the shore  before reaching it however he was still doomed to rough handling for one of the shots from the large guns which were fired almost at random from the flotilla accidentally struck the boat and sent it to the bottom  lancey was a good swimmer  the cold water restored him to full vigour and he struck out boldly for the shore  he soon left the boats crew behind with the exception of one man who kept close to his side all the way  as they neared the shore however this man suddenly cried out like one who is drowning  a second time he cried and the gurgling of his voice told its own tale  the stout englishman could not bear to leave a human being to perish whether friend or foe  he swam towards the drowning man and supported him till their feet touched bottom  then perceiving that he was able to stagger along unassisted lancey pushed hurriedly from his side in the hope of escaping from any of the crew who might reach land for they were evidently the reverse of friendly  he landed among a mass of bulrushes  staggering through them and nearly sinking at every step he gradually gained firmer footing  ah jacob he muttered to himself pausing for a few minutes rest little did you think youd git into such an orrible mess as this wen you left ome  sarves you right for quittin your native land  with this comforting reflection he pushed on again and soon found himself on a road which led towards a town or village whose lights were distinctly visible  what should he do  the village was on the bulgarian side and the natives if not enemies would of course become so on learning from any of the saved men of the monitor who he was  to swim across the danube he felt was after his recent exertions impossible  to remain where he was would be to court death among the frogs  lancey was a prompt man  right or wrong his conclusions were soon come to and acted on  he decided to go straight to the village and throw himself on the hospitality of the people  in half an hour he found himself once more a prisoner  worse than that the interpreter who was among the men saved from the wreck chanced to discover him and denounced him as a spy  the mood in which the turks then were was not favourable to him  he was promptly locked up and about daybreak next morning was led out to execution  poor lancey could scarcely credit his senses  he had often read of such things but had never fully realised that they were true  that he an innocent man should be hung offhand without trial by jury or otherwise in the middle of the nineteenth century was incredible there was something terribly real however in the galling tightness of the rope that confined his arms in the troop of stern horsemen that rode on each side of him and in the cart with ropes and the material for a scaffold which was driven in front towards the square of the town  there was no sign of pity in the people or of mercy in the guards  the contrivance for effecting the deadly operation was simple in the extremetwo large triangles with a pole resting on them and a strong rope attached thereto  there was no drop  an empty box sufficed and this was to be kicked away when the rope was round his neck  even up to the point of putting the rope on lancey would not believe  reader have you ever been led out to be hanged  if not be thankful the conditions of mind consequent on that state of things is appalling it is also various  men take it differently according to their particular natures and as the nature of man is remarkably complex so the variation in his feeling is exceedingly diverse  there are some who in such circumstances give way to abject terror others whose nervous system is not so finely strung and whose sense of justice is strong are filled with a rush of indignation and meet their fate with savage ferocity or with dogged and apparent indifference some rising above sublunary matters shut their eyes to all around and fix their thoughts on that world with which they may be said to be more immediately connected namely the next  lancey went through several of these phases  when the truth first really came home to him he quailed like an arrant coward  then a sense of violated justice supervened  if at that moment samsons powers had been his he would have snapped the ropes that bound him like packthread and would have cut the throat of every man around him  when he was placed upon the substitute for a block and felt by a motion of his elbows his utter powerlessness the dogged and indifferent state came on but it did not last  it could not  his christian training was adverse to it  come he mentally exclaimed it is gods will  quit you like a man jacoband die  there is no doubt that in this frame the brave fellow would have passed away if he had not been roused by the loud clattering of horses feet as a cavalcade of glittering turkish officers dashed through the square in front of these he observed the redbearded officer who had acted as interpreter in the cabin of the turkish monitor  there came a sudden gush of hope  lancey knew not his name but in a voice of thunder he shouted  elp elp allo  pasha  redbeard  the executioner hastened his work and stopped the outcry by tightening the rope  but redbeard had heard the cry  he galloped towards the place of execution recognised the supposed spy and ordered him to be released at the same time himself cutting the rope with a sweep of his sword  the choking sensation which lancey had begun to feel was instantly relieved  the rope was removed from his neck and he was gently led from the spot by a soldier of the pashas escort while the pasha himself galloped coolly away with his staff  if lancey was surprised at the sudden and unexpected nature of his deliverance he was still more astonished at the treatment which he thereafter experienced from the turks  he was taken to one of the best hotels in the town shown into a handsome suite of apartments and otherwise treated with marked respect while the best of viands and the choicest of wines were placed before him  this made him very uncomfortable  he felt sure that some mistake had occurred and would willingly have retired if possible to the hotel kitchen or pantry but the waiter to whom he modestly suggested something of the sort did not understand a word of english and could make nothing of lanceys turkish  he merely shook his head and smiled respectfully or volunteered some other article of food  the worthy groom therefore made up his mind to hold his tongue and enjoy himself as long as it lasted  when i wakes up out o this remarkable and not unpleasant dream he muttered between the whiffs of his cigarette one evening after dinner ill write it out fair an ave it putt in the daily noos or the times  but the dream lasted so long that lancey began at last to fear he should never awake from it  for a week he remained at that hotel faring sumptuously and quite unrestrained as to his movements though he could not fail to observe that he was closely watched and followed wherever he went  is it a plenipotentiary or a furrin prime minister they take me for he muttered to himself over a mild cigar of the finest quality or mayhap they think im a prince in disguise  but then a man in disguise aint known and therefore cant be follered or if he was what would be the use of his disguise  no i cant make it out noow  still less by any effort of his fancy or otherwise could he make out why after a weeks residence at the village in question he was ordered to prepare for a journey  this order like all others was conveyed to him by signs  some parts of his treatment had been managed otherwise  when for instance on the night of his deliverance it had been thought desirable that his garments should be better and more numerous his attendants or keepers had removed his old wardrobe and left in its place another which although it comprehended trousers savoured more of the east than the west  lancey submitted to this as to everything else like a true philosopher  generally however the wishes of those around him were conveyed by means of signs  on the morning of his departure a small valise stuffed with the few articles of comfort which he required and a change of apparel was placed at his bedside  the hotel attendant who had apparently undertaken the management of him packed this up in the morning having somewhat pointedly placed within it his robe de nuit  thereafter the man bowed smiled gravely pointed to the door beckoned him to follow and left the room  by that time lancey had as it were given himself up  he acted with the unquestioning obedience of a child or a lunatic  following his guide he found a native cart outside with his valise in it  beside the cart stood a good horse saddled and bridled in the turkish fashion his hotelattendant pointed to the horse and motioned to him to mount  then it burst upon lancey that he was about to quit the spot perhaps for ever and being a grateful fellow he could not bear to part without making some acknowledgment  my dear turk or whatever you are he exclaimed turning to his attendant im sorry to say goodbye an im still more sorry to say that ive nothin to give you  a tenpunnote if i ad it would be but a small testimony of my feelins but i do assure you i avnt got a rap  in corroboration of this he slapped his empty pockets and shook his head  then breaking into a benignant smile he shook hands with the waiter warmly turned in silence mounted his horse and rode off after the native cart which had already started  you dont know where were goin to i spose said lancey to the driver of the cart  the man stared but made no reply  ah i thought not said lancey then he tried him in turkish but a shake of the head intimated the mans stupidity or his interrogators incapacity  journeying in silence over a flat marshy country they arrived about midday at a small village before the principal inn of which stood a number of richlycaparisoned chargers  here lancey found that he was expected to lunch and join the party though in what capacity he failed to discover  the grave uncommunicative nature of the turks had perplexed and disappointed him so often that he had at last resigned himself to his fate and given up asking questions all the more readily perhaps that his fate at the time chanced to be a pleasant one  when the party had lunched and were preparing to take the road it became obvious that he was not regarded as a great man travelling incognito for no one took notice of him save a turk who looked more like a servant than an aristocrat  this man merely touched him on the shoulder and pointed to his horse with an air that savoured more of command than courtesy  lancey took the hint and mounted  he also kept modestly in rear  when the cavalcade was ready a distinguishedlooking officer issued from the inn mounted his charger and at once rode away followed by the others he was evidently a man of rank  for several days they journeyed and during this period lancey made several attempts at conversation with the only man who appeared to be aware of his existencewho indeed was evidently his guardian  but like the rest this man was taciturn and all the information that could be drawn out of him was that they were going to constantinople  i hasten over the rest of the journey  on reaching the sea they went on board a small steamer which appeared to have been awaiting them  in course of time they came in sight of the domes and minarets of stamboul the great city of the sultans the very heart of europes apple of discord  it was evening and the lights of the city were everywhere glittering like long lines of quivering gold down into the waters of the bosporus here the party with which lancey had travelled left him without even saying goodbyeall except his guardian who on landing made signs that he was to follow or rather to walk beside him  reduced by this time to a thoroughly obedient slave and satisfied that no mischief was likely to be intended by men who had treated him so well lancey walked through the crowded streets and bazaars of constantinople as one in a dream much more than halfconvinced that he had got somehow into an arabian night the entertainments of which seemed much more real than those by which his imagination had been charmed in days of old  coming into a part of the city that appeared to be suburban his keeper stopped before a building that seemed a cross between a barrack and a birdcage  it was almost surrounded by a wall so high that it hid the building from view except directly in front  there it could be seen with its small hermeticallyclosed windows each covered with a wooden trellis  it bore the aspect of a somewhat forbidding prison  konakpalace said the keeper breaking silence for the first time  a konak a palace eh repeated lancey in surprise more like a jail i should say  owever customs differ  oos palace may it be now  pasha sanda pasha replied the man touching a spring or bell in the wall you goes in  as he spoke a small door was opened by an armed black slave to whom he whispered a few words and then stepping back motioned to his companion to enter  arter you sir said lancey with a polite bow  but as the man continued gravely to point and the black slave to hold the door open he forbore to press the matter and stepped in  the gate was shut with a bang followed by a click of bolts  he found on looking round that the keeper had been shut out and he was alone with the armed negro  youre in for it now jacob my boy muttered lancey to himself as he measured the negro with a sharp glance and slowly turned up the wristband of his shirt with a view to prompt action  but the sable porter far from meditating an assault smiled graciously as he led the way to the principal door of the palace or as the poor fellow felt sure it must be the prison    chapter ten  involves lancey in great perplexities which culminate in a vast surprise  no sooner did the dark and unpretending door of sanda pashas konak or palace open than lanceys eyes were dazzled by the blaze of light and splendour within and when he had entered accustomed though he was to good society in england he was struck dumb with astonishment perhaps the powerful contrast between the outside and the interior of this eastern abode had something to do with the influence on his mind  unbridled luxury met his eyes in whatever direction he turned  there was a double staircase of marble a court paved with mosaicwork of brilliant little stones splendid rooms the walls of which were covered with velvet paper of rich pattern and colour  gilding glittered everywhereon cornices furniture and ceilings from which the eyes turned with double zest to the soft light of marble sculpture judiciously disposed on staircase and in chambers  there were soft sofas that appeared to embrace you as you sank into them pictures that charmed the senses here a bath of snowwhite marble there gushing fountains and jets of limpid water that appeared to play hideandseek among green leaves and lovely flowers and disappeared mysteriouslyin short everything tasteful and beautiful that man could desire  of course lancey did not take all this in at once  neither did he realise the fact that the numerous softmoving and picturesque attendants black and white whom he saw were a mere portion of an army of servants numbering upwards of a thousand souls whom this pasha retained  these did not include the members of his harem  he had upwards of a hundred cooks and two hundred grooms and coachmen  this household it is said consumed among other things nearly 7000 pounds of vegetables a day and in winter there were 900 fires kindled throughout the establishment see note 1  but of all this and a great deal more lancey had but a faint glimmering as he was led through the various corridors and rooms towards a central part of the building  here he was shown into a small but comfortable apartment very eastern in its character with a motherofpearl table in one corner bearing some slight refreshment and a low couch at the further end  eat said the black slave who conducted him  he spoke in english and pointed to the table an sleep he added pointing to the couch sanda pasha sees you de morrow  with that he left lancey staring in a bewildered manner at the door through which he had passed  sanda pasha repeated the puzzled man slowly will see me de morrow will he  well if de morrow ever comes wich i doubt sanda pasha will find e as made a most hegragious mistake of some sort owever thats is business not mine  having comforted himself with this final reflection on the culminating event of the day he sat down to the motherofpearl table and did full justice to the pashas hospitality by consuming the greater part of the viands thereon consisting largely of fruits and drinking the wine with critical satisfaction  next morning he was awakened by his black friend of the previous night who spread on the motherofpearl table a breakfast which in its elegance appeared to be light but which on close examination turned out like many light things in this world to be sufficiently substantial for an ordinary man  lancey now expected to be introduced to the pasha but he was mistaken no one came near him again till the afternoon when the black slave reappeared with a substantial dinner  the pasha was busy he said and would see him in the evening  the time might have hung heavily on the poor mans hands but close to the apartment in which he was confined there was a small marble court open to the sky in which were richlyscented flowers and rare plants and fountains which leaped or trickled into tanks filled with goldfish  in the midst of these things he sat or sauntered dreamily until the shades of evening fell  then the black slave returned and beckoned him to follow  he did so and was ushered into a delicious little boudoir whose windows not larger than a foot square were filled with pink blue and yellow glass  here the door being softly shut behind him lancey found himself in the presence of the redbearded officer whom he had met on board the turkish monitor  redbeard as lancey called him mentally reclined on a couch and smoked a chibouk  come here he said gravely in broken english  lancey advanced into the middle of the apartment  it vas you what blewd up de monitor he said sternly sending a thick cloud of smoke from his lips  no your  lancey paused  he knew not how to address his questioner but feeling that some term of respect was necessary he coined a word for the occasion  no your pashaship i did nothink of the sort  im as hinnocent of that ewent as a newborn babe  vat is your name  lancey  ha your oder name  jacob  ho  my name is sanda pasha  you have hear of me before  yes on board the turkish monitor  just so but before zat i mean said the pasha with a keen glance  lancey was a bold and an honest man  he would not condescend to prevaricate  im wery sorry youryour pashaship but to tell the plain truth i never did ear of you before that  well zat matters noting  i do go now to sup vid von friend hamed pasha he is called  you go vid me  go get ready  poor lancey opened his eyes in amazement and began to stammer something about having nothing to get ready with and a mistake being made but the pasha cut him short with another go so imperative that he was fain to obey promptly  having no change of raiment the perplexed man did his best by washing his face and hands and giving his hair and clothes an extra brush to make himself more fit for refined society  on being called to rejoin the pasha he began to apologise for the style of his dress but the peremptory despot cut him short by leading the way to his carriage in which they were driven to the konak or palace of hamed pasha  they were shown into a richlyfurnished apartment where hamed was seated on a divan with several friends smoking and sipping brandy and water for many of these eminent followers of the prophet pay about as little regard to the prophets rules as they do to the laws of european society  hamed rose to receive his brother pasha and lancey was amazed to find that he was a nubian with thick lips flat nose and a visage as black as coal  he was also of gigantic frame insomuch that he dwarfed the rest of the company including lancey himself  hamed had raised himself from a low rank in society to his present high position by dint of military ability great physical strength superior intelligence reckless courage and overflowing animal spirits  when sanda pasha entered he was rolling his huge muscular frame on the divan and almost weeping with laughter at something that had been whispered in his ear by a dervish who sat beside him  sanda introduced lancey as an englishman on hearing which the black pasha seized and wrung his hands amid roars of delight and torrents of remarks in turkish while he slapped him heartily on the shoulder then to the amazement of lancey he seized him by the collar of his coat unbuttoned it and began to pull it off  this act was speedily explained by the entrance of an attendant with a pale blue loose dressinggown lined with fur which the pasha made his english guest put on and sit down beside him  having now thoroughly resigned himself to the guidance of what his turkish friends styled fate lancey did his best to make himself agreeable and gave himself up to the enjoyment of the hour  there were present in the room besides those already mentioned a turkish colonel of cavalry and a german doctor who spoke turkish fluently  the party sat down to supper on cushions round a very low table  the dervish hadji abderhaman turned out to be a gourmand as well as a witty fellow and a buffoon  the pasha always gave the signal to begin to each dish and between courses the dervish told stories from the arabian nights entertainments or uttered witticisms which kept the nubian pasha in roars of laughter  they were all very merry for the host was fond of boisterous fun and practical jokes while his guests were sympathetic  lancey laughed as much as any of them for although he could not despite his previous studies follow the conversation he could understand the pantomime and appreciated the viands highly  his redbearded friend also came to his aid now and then with a few explanatory remarks in broken english  at such times the host sat with a beaming smile on his black face and his huge mouth halfexpanded looking from one to another as if attempting to understand and ready at a moments notice to explode in laughter or admiration or enthusiasm according to circumstances  hamed pasha wants to know if you is in do army said sanda pasha  not in the regulars replied lancey but i ave bin in the militia  the nubian gave another roar of delight when this was translated and extended his great hand to one whom he thenceforth regarded as a brotherinarms  lancey grasped and shook it warmly  let the englishman see your sword said sanda in turkish to hamed  sanda knew his friends weak point  the sword was at once ordered in for inspection  truly it was a formidable weapon which might have suited the fist of goliath and was well fitted for the brawny arm that had waved it aloft many a time in the smoke and din of battle  it was blunt and hacked on both edges with frequent use but its owner would not have it sharpened on any account asserting that a stout arm did not require a keen weapon  while the attention of the company was taken up with this instrument of death the dervish availed himself of the opportunity to secure the remains of a dish of rich cream to which he had already applied himself more than once  the nubian observed the sly and somewhat greedy act with a twinkling eye  when the dervish had drained the dish the host filled a glass full to the brim with vinegar and with fierce joviality bade him drink it  the poor man hesitated and said something about wine and a mistake but the pasha repeated drink with such a roar and threw his sword down at the same time with such a clang on the marble floor that the dervish swallowed the draught with almost choking celerity  the result was immediately obvious on his visage nevertheless he bore up bravely and even cut a sorry joke at his own expense while the black giant rolled on his divan and the tears ran down his swarthy cheeks  the dervish was an adventurer who had wandered about the country as an idle vagabond until the war broke out when he took to armycontracting with considerable success  it was in his capacity of contractor that he became acquainted with the boisterous black pasha who greatly appreciated his low but ready wit and delighted in tormenting him  on discovering that the dervish was a voracious eater he pressedi might say forcedhim with savage hospitality to eat largely of every dish so that when pipes were brought after supper the poor dervish was more than satisfied  now you are in a fit condition to sing cried hamed slapping the overfed man on the shoulder come give us a song the englishman would like to hear one of your arabian melodies  redbeard translated this to lancey who protested that nothink would afford im greater delight  the dervish was not easily overcome  despite his condition he sang well and heartily a ditty in arabic about love and war which the nubian pasha translated into turkish for the benefit of the german doctor and sanda pasha rendered into broken english for lancey  but the great event of the evening came when the english guest in obedience to a call if not a command from his host sang an english ballad  lancey had a sweet and tuneful voice and was prone to indulge in slow pathetic melodies  the black pasha turned out to be intensely fond of music and its effect on his emotional spirit was very powerful at the first bar of his guests flowing melody his boisterous humour vanished his mouth and eyes partly opened with a look of pleased surprise he evidently forgot himself and his company and when although unintelligible to him the song proceeded in more touching strains his capacious chest began to heave and his eyes filled with tears  the applause not only of the host but the company was loud and emphatic and lancey was constrained to sing again  after that the colonel sang a turkish warsong  the colonels voice was a tremendous bass and he sang with such enthusiasm that the hearers were effectively stirred  hamed in particular became wild with excitement  he halfsuited his motions while beating time to the action of each verse and when as a climax in the last verse the colonel gave the order to charge  hamed uttered a roar sprang up seized his great sabre and caused it to whistle over his friends with a sweep that might have severed the head of an elephant  at this point one of the attendants who appeared to be newly appointed to his duties and who had more than once during the feast attracted attention by his stupidity shrank in some alarm from the side of his wild master and tumbled over a cushion  hamed glared at him for a moment with a frown that was obviously not put on and halfraised the sabre as if about to cut him down instantly the frown changed to a look of contempt and almost as quickly was replaced by a gleam of fun  stand forth said hamed dropping the sabre and sitting down  the man obeyed with prompt anxiety  your name  mustapha  mustapha repeated the pasha i observe that you are a capable young fellow  you are a man of weight as the marble floor can testify  i appoint you to the office of head steward  go stand up by the door  the man made a low obeisance and went  let the household servants and slaves pass before their new superior and do him honour  with promptitude and with a gravity that was intensely ludicrousfor none dared to smile in the presence of hamed pashathe servants of the establishment having been summoned filed before the new steward and bowed to him  this ceremony over mustapha was ordered to go and make a list of the poultry  the poor man was here obliged to confess that he could not write  you can draw demanded the pasha fiercely  with some hesitation the steward admitted that he coulda little  go then draw the poultry every cock and hen and chicken said the pasha with a wave of his hand which dismissed the household servants and sent the luckless steward to his task  after this pipes were refilled fresh stories were told and more songs were sung  after a considerable time mustapha returned with a large sheet of paper covered with hieroglyphics  the man looked timid as he approached and presented it to his master  the pasha seized the sheet  what have we here he demanded sternly  the man said it was portraits of the cocks and hens  ha exclaimed the pasha a portraitgallery of poultryeh  he held the sheet at armslength and regarded it with a fierce frown but his lips twitched and suddenly relaxed into a broad grin causing a tremendous display of white teeth and red gums  poultry ha just so  what is this  he pointed to an object with a curling tail which mustapha assured him was a cock  what a cock where is the comb  who ever heard of a cock without a comb eh  and that what is that  mustapha ventured to assert that it was a chicken  a chicken cried the pasha fiercely more like a dromedary  you rascal did you not say that you could draw  go deceiver you are deposed  have him out and set him to cleanse the henhouse and woe betide you if it is not as clean as your own conscience before tomorrow morningaway  the pasha shouted the last word and then fell back in fits of laughter while the terrified man fled to the henhouse and drove its occupants frantic in his wild attempts to cleanse their augean stable  it was not until midnight that sanda pasha and lancey taking leave of hamed and his guests returned home  come follow me said the pasha on entering the palace  he led lancey to the room in which they had first met and seating himself on a divan lighted his chibouk  sit down he said pointing to a cushion that lay near him on the marble floor  lancey although unaccustomed to such a low seat obeyed  smoke said the pasha handing a cigarette to his guest  lancey took the cigarette but at this point his honest soul recoiled from the part he seemed to be playing  he rose and laying the cigarette respectfully on the ground said  sanda pasha its not for the likes o me to be sittin ere smokin with the likes o you sir  theres some mistake ere hobviously ive been treated with the consideration doo to a prince since i fell into the ands of the turks and it is right that i should at once correct this mistake wich id ave done long ago if i could ave got the turks whove ad charge of me to understand hinglish  im bound to tell you sir that im ony a groom in a hinglish family and makes no pretence to be hanythink else though circumstances as putt me in a false position since i come ere  i ope your pashaship wont think me ungracious sir but i cant abear to sail under false colours  to this speech sanda pasha listened with profound gravity and puffed an enormous cloud from his lips at its conclusion  sit down he said sternly  lancey obeyed  light your cigarette  there was a tone of authority in the pashas voice which lancey did not dare to resist  he lighted the cigarette  look me in the face said the pasha suddenly turning his piercing grey eyes full on him guest  supposing that this was a prelude to an expression of doubt as to his honesty lancey did look the pasha full in the face and returned his stare with interest  do you see this cut over the bridge of my nose demanded the pasha  lancey saw it and admitted that it must have been a bad one  and do you see the light that is blazing in these two eyes he added pointing to his own glowing orbs with a touch of excitement  lancey admitted that he saw the light and began to suspect that the pasha was mad  at the same time he was struck by the sudden and very great improvement in his friends english  but for you continued the pasha partly raising himself that cut had never been and the light of those eyes would now be quenched in death  the pasha looked at his guest more fixedly than ever and lancey now feeling convinced of his entertainers madness began to think uneasily of the best way to humour him  twenty years ago continued the pasha slowly and with a touch of pathos in his tone i received this cut from a boy in a fight at school lancey thought that the boy must have been a bold fellow and only the other day i was rescued by a man from the waters of the danube  lancey thought that on the whole it would have been well if the man had left him to drown the name of the boy and the name of the man was the same  it was jacob lancey  lanceys eyes opened and his lower jaw dropped  he sat on his cushion aghast  jacob lancey continued the pasha in a familiar tone that sent a thrill to the heart of his visitor hae ye forgotten your auld scotch freen and schoolmate sandy  in sanda pasha you behold sandy black  lancey sprang to his kneesthe low couch rendering that attitude naturalgrasped the pashas extended hand and gazed wistfully into his eyes  oh sandy sandy he said in a voice of forced calmness while he shook his head reproachfully many and many a time ave i prophesied that you would become a great man but little did i think that youd come to thisa mayomedan and a turk  unable to say more lancey sat down on his cushion clasped his hands over his knees and gazed fixedly at his old friend and former idol  lancey my boyit is quite refreshing to use these old familiar words againi am no more a mohammedan than you are  then youre a ypocrite replied the other promptly  by no meansat least i hope not said the pasha with a smile and a slightly troubled look  surely there is a wide space between a thoroughly honest man and an outandout hypocrite  i came here with no religion at all  they took me by the hand and treated me kindly knowing nothing i took to anything they chose to teach me  what could a youth do  now i am what i am and i cannot change it  lancey knew not what to reply to this  laying his hand on the rich sleeve of the pasha he began in the old tone and in the fulness of his heart  sandy my old friend as i used to all but worship nominal mayomedan though you be its right glad i am to words failed him here  well well said the pasha smiling and drawing a great cloud from his chibouk im as glad as yourself and not the less so that ive been able to do you some small service in the way of preventing your neck from being stretched and that brings me to the chief point for which i have brought you to my palace namely to talk about matters which concern yourself for it is obvious that you cannot remain in this country in time of war with safety unless you have some fixed position tell me now where you have been and what doing since we last met in scotland and i will tell you what can be done for you in turkey  hereupon lancey began a longwinded and particular account of his life during the last twenty years  the pasha smoked and listened with grave interest  when the recital was finished he rose  now lancey said he it is time that you and i were asleep  in the morning i have business to attend to  when it is done we will continue our talk  meanwhile let me say that i see many little ways in which you can serve the turks if you are so minded  sandy black said lancey rising with a look of dignity you are very kindjust what i would ave expected of youbut you must clearly understand that i will serve only in works of umanity  in a milingtary capacity i will serve neither the turks nor the roossians  quite right my old friend i will not ask military service of you so goodnight  by the way it may be as well to remind you that except between ourselves i am not sandy black but sanda pashayou understand  with an arch smile the pasha laid down his chibouk and left the room and the black attendant conducted lancey to his bedroom  the same attendant took him the following morning after breakfast to the pashas selamlik or place of salutations in order that he might see how business matters were transacted in turkey  the selamlik was a large handsome room filled with men both with and without turbans who had come either to solicit a favour or a post or to press on some private business  on the entrance of the pasha every one rose  when he was seated there began a curious scene of bowing to the ground and touching by each person present of the mouth and head with the hand  this lasted full five minutes  sanda pasha then received a number of business papers from an officer of the household to which he applied himself with great apparent earnestness paying no attention whatever to his visitors  lancey observed however that his absorbed condition did not prevent a few of these visitors apparently of superior rank from approaching and whispering in his ear  to some of them he was gracious to others cool as they severally stated the nature of their business  no one else dared to approach until the reading of the papers was finished suddenly the pasha appeared to get weary of his papers  he tossed them aside ordered his carriage rose hastily and left the room  but this uncourteous behaviour did not appear to disconcert those who awaited his pleasure  probably like eels they had got used to rough treatment some of them ran after the pasha and tried to urge their suits in a few rapid sentences others went off with a sigh or a growl resolving to repeat the visit another day while sanda himself was whirled along at full speed to the sublime porte to hold council with the ministers of state on the arrangements for the war that had by that time begun to rage along the whole line of the lower danubethe russians having effected a crossing in several places  after enjoying himself for several days in the palace of his old schoolmate my worthy servant being resolved not to quit the country until he had done his utmost to discover whether i was alive or drowned accepted the offer of a situation as cook to one of the turkish ambulance corps  having received a suitable change of garments with a private pass and recommendations from the pasha he was despatched with a large body of recruits and supplies to the front    note 1  a similar establishment to this was not long ago described by the correspondent of a wellknown journal    chapter eleven  refers to two important letters and a secret mission  it is a curious coincidence that about the very time when my servant was appointed to serve in the turkish ambulance corps i received permission to act as a surgeon in the russian army  through the influence of nicholas naranovitsch i was attached to his own regiment and thus enjoyed the pleasure of his society for a considerable time after the breaking out of the war  i preferred this course to that of returning home because first i could not bear the thought of leaving the country without making every possible exertion to ascertain the fate of my yachts crew and rendering them succour if possible and secondly because i felt an irresistible desire to alleviate professionally the sufferings of those who were certain to be wounded during the war  i also experienced much curiosity to know something more of the power and influence of modern warengines  perhaps some people will think this latter an unworthy motive  it may have been so i cannot tell  all i can say is that it was a very secondary one and would not of itself have been sufficient to induce me to remain for an hour to witness the horrors and carnage of battlefields  still putting the various motives together i felt justified in remaining  in order that i might render still more effective service to the cause of humanity i wrote immediately after my appointment as surgeon to an intimate friend north of the tweed offering my services as war correspondent to a paper of which he was editor namely the scottish bawbee  that celebrated journalwell known on the east west and north coasts of scotland and extensively circulated in the centre and south of the country including englandis liberal in its principles conservative in reference only to things that are good and violently radical when treating of those that are bad  it enjoys the credit of being curt in its statements brief in the expression of its opinions perfectly silent in reference to its surmises distinctly repudiative of the gift of prophecy consistently averse to the attribution of motives persistently wise in giving the shortest possible account of murders and scandalous cases and copious in its references to literature art and religious progress besides being extremely methodical in its arrangement  in regard to the latter quality i cannot refrain from referring to its sensible mode of treating births marriages and deaths by putting the christian and surname of the born married or defunct as the first words in each announcement so that ones digestion at breakfast is aided by reading with some comfort of the joys and sorrows of ones friends instead of having incipient dyspepsia engendered by a painful search for the main facts in confusing sentences  the editors reply came by return of post  it contained the acceptance of my services and a proposal of extremely liberal terms allowing me besides a handsome retaining fee two horses and such travelling attendants as might be found necessary  there were also certain emphatic stipulations which are worth recording  i was not on any pretext whatever to attempt the divination much less the revelation of the future  i was never upon any consideration to be seduced into lengthy descriptions of things that i did not see or minute particulars about matters which i did not know  i was utterly to ignore and refuse to be influenced by personal predilections or prejudices in regard to either combatant  i was to say as little about scenery as was consistent with a correct delineation of the field of war and never to venture on sentimental allusions to sunsets moonlights or waterreflections of any kind  i was not to forget that a newspaper was a vehicle for the distribution of news the announcement of facts and the discussion thereof not a medium for the dissemination of fancies and fiddlededee  above all i was never to write a column and a half of speculation as to the possible and probable movements of armies to be followed in our next by two columns of the rumoured movements of armies to be continued in our next by two columns and a half of the actual movements of armies to wind up in our next with three columns of retrospective consideration as to what might could would or should have been the movements of armies but that i was on the contrary to bear in remembrance the adage about brevity being the soul of wit and when i had nothing to write to write nothing  by so doing it was added i should please the editor and charm the public one of whose minor griefs is as regards newspapers that it is brought into a state of disgust with every event of this life long before it has happened and thoroughly nauseated with it long after it is pastto say nothing of the resulting mental confusion  in case any gentleman of the press should feel injured by these statements i must remind him that i am not responsible for them  they are the sentiments of the scottish bawbee which must be taken for what they are worth  it is true i heartily agree with them but that is an entirely different subject on which i do not enter  i readily agreed to fall in with the wishes of the editor and thenceforward devoted myself heart and soul to correspondence and surgery  in both fields of labour i found ample scope for all the powers of body and mind that i possessed  just about this time i received a letter from my dear mother who was aware of my plans  it cost me some anxiety as it was utterly impossible that i should comply with the injunctions it contained jeffry my dear boy she wrote let me entreat you with all the solemnity of maternal solicitude to take care of your health  let russians and turks kill and expose themselves as they please but ever bear in remembrance that it is your duty to avoid danger  whatever you do keep your feet dry and youri need not go further into particulars medical allusions cannot always be couched in language such as one desires  never sleep on damp ground nor if possible without a roof or a covering of some sort over your head  even a parasol is better than nothing  if despite your precautions you should catch cold tie a worsted sockone of the red and black striped ones i have knitted for youround your neck and take one drop of aconiteonly one remember before going to bed  i know how with your allopathic notions you will smile at this advice but i assure you as your mother that it will prove an infallible cure  never sit in a draught when you can avoid it if you ever come under fire which i trust you never may be sure to get behind a house or a wall or a stone if possible if you cannot do so get behind a soldier one larger than yourself would be preferable of course but if you have not the opportunity of doing this then turn your side to the enemy because in that position you are a much narrower target and more likely to escape their bullets  i need not caution you not to run away  i would rather see you dear boy in a premature grave than hear that you had run away  but you could not run away no childers ever did soexcept from school  let the phial of globules which i gave you at parting be your bosom friends till their friendship is required in another and a lower region  they are a sovereign remedy against rheumatism catarrh bronchitis dyspepsia lumbago nervous affections headaches loss of memory debility monomania melancholia botherolia theoretica and in short all the ills that flesh is heir to if only taken in time  it struck me as i folded my mothers letter and that of the editor that there never was a man who went into any course of action better guarded and advised than myself  at the moment when this thought occurred to me my friend nicholas burst into my room in a state of unusual excitement  come jeff he said im detailed for another secret duty  people seem to have inordinate faith in me for all my duties are secret  are you willing to go with me  go where  i asked  that i may not tell he replied anywhere or nowhere or everywhere all i can say is that if you go it will be to act as surgeon to a squadron of cavalry  i see you have letters  good news from homeeh what of bella  yes i replied good news and good advicelisten  i reopened the letters and read them aloud  capital exclaimed nicholas just the thing for you  no doubt my expedition will furnish a column and a half if not more of unquestionable facts for the scottish bawbee  get ready my boy i start in halfanhour  he swung off in the same hearty reckless manner with which he had entered and i immediately set about packing up my surgical instruments and notebooks and making other preparations for a journey of unknown extent and duration    chapter twelve  my first experience of actual war and my thoughts thereon  we set out by the light of the moon  our party consisted of a small force of russian light cavalry  the officer in command was evidently well acquainted with our route for he rode smartly ahead without hesitation or sign of uncertainty for several hours  at first nicholas and i conversed in low tones as we cantered side by side over hill and dale but as the night advanced we became less communicative and finally dropped into silence  as i looked upon village and hamlet bathed in the subdued light resting in quietness and peace i thought sadly of the evils that war would surely bring upon many an innocent and helpless woman and child  it was invariably in this course that my thoughts about war flowed  i was indeed quite alive to the national evils of war and i will not admit that any manofpeace feels more sensitively than i do the fact that in war a nations best youngest and most hopeful blood is spilled while its longest lives and most ardent spirits are ruthlessly uselessly sacrificedits budding youths its strapping men its freshest and most muscular to say nothing of mental manhood  still while contemplating war and its consequences i have always been much more powerfully impressed with the frightful consequences to women and children than anything else  to think of our wives our little ones our tender maidens our loving matrons and our poor helpless babes being exposed to murder rapine torture and all the numerous and unnameable horrors of war for the sake of some false some fanciful some utterly ridiculous and contemptible idea such as the connection of one or two provinces of a land with this nation or with that or the integrity of a foreign empire has always filled me with sensations of indignation approaching to madness not unmingled i must add with astonishment  that savages will fight among themselves is selfevident that christian nations shall defend themselves from the assaults of savages is also obvious but that two christian nations should go to war for anything on any ground whatever is to my mind inexplicable and utterly indefensible  still they do it  from which circumstance i am forced to conclude that the christianity as well as the civilisation and commonsense of one or the other of such nations is for the time in abeyance  of course i was not perplexed in regard to the turks  their religion is not christian  moreover it was propagated by the sword and teaches coercion in religious matters but i could not help feeling that the russians were too ready to forsake diplomacy and take to war  my dear fellow said nicholas rousing himself when i stated my difficulty dont you see that the vacillating policy of england has driven us to war in spite of ourselves  she would not join the rest of europe in compelling turkey to effect reforms which sheturkeyhad promised to make so that nothing else was left for us but to go to war  my dear fellow i retorted somewhat hotly that turkey has behaved brutally towards its own subjects is a wellknown fact  that she has treated the representatives of all the great powers of europe with extreme insolence is another wellknown fact but it is yet to be proved that the efforts of diplomacy were exhausted and even if they were it remained for europe not for russia to constitute herself the champion of the oppressed  jeff my boy returned nicholas with a smile im too sleepy to discuss that subject just now further than to say that i dont agree with you  he did indeed look sleepy and as we had been riding many hours i forbore to trouble him further  by daybreak that morning we drew near to the town of giurgevo on the roumanianor i may say the russianside of the danube and soon afterwards entered it  considerable excitement was visible among its inhabitants who even at that early hour were moving hurriedly about the streets  having parted from our escort nicholas and i refreshed ourselves at the hotel de leurope and then went to an hospital where my companion wished to visit a wounded friendone he said who had lately taken part in a dashing though unsuccessful expedition  this visit to giurgevo was my first introduction to some of the actual miseries of war  the hospital was a clean wellventilated building rows of low beds were ranged neatly and methodically along the whitewashed walls  these were tenanted by young men in every stage of suffering and exhaustion  with bandaged heads or limbs they sat or reclined or lay some but slightly wounded and still ruddy with the hue of health on their young cheeks some cut and marred in visage and limbs with pale cheeks and blue lips that told of the lifeblood almost drained  others were lying flat on their backs with the soft brown moustache or curly brown hair contrasting terribly with the grey hue of approaching death  in one of the beds we found the friend of nicholas  he was quite a youth not badly wounded and received us with enthusiasm  my dear nicholas he said in reply to a word of condolence about the failure of the expedition you misunderstand the whole matter doubtless it did not succeed but that was no fault of ours and it was a glorious attempt  come i will relate it  does your friend speak russian  he at all events understands it said i  on this assurance the youth raised his hand to his bandaged brow as if to recall events and then related the incident of which the following is the substance  while the russians were actively engaged in preparing to cross the danube at a part where the river is full of small islands the turks sent monitors and gunboats to interrupt the operations  the russians had no vessels capable of facing the huge ironclads of the enemy  of the ten small boats at the place eight were engaged in laying torpedoes in the river to protect the works and two were detailed to watch the enemy  while they were all busily at work the watchers in a boat named the schootka heard the sound of an approaching steamer and soon after descried a turkish gunboat steaming up the river  out went the little schootka like a wasp with a deadly torpedo at the end of her spar the gunboat saw and sought to evade her put on full steam and hugged the turkish shore where some hundreds of circassian riflemen kept up an incessant fire on the russian boat  it was hit and its commander wounded but the crew and the second in command resolved to carry out the attack  the schootka increased her speed and to the consternation of the turks succeeded in touching the gunboat just behind the paddleboxes but the torpedo refused to explode and the schootka was compelled to haul off and make for shelter under a heavy fire from the gunboat and the circassian riflemen which quite riddled her  while she was making off a second turkish gunboat hove in sight the schootka had still another torpedo on board one on the harvey principle  this torpedo may be described as a somewhat square and flat case charged with an explosive compound  when used it is thrown into the sea and runs through the water on its edge being held in that position by a rope and caused to advance by pulling on it sidewise anglers will understand this when i state that it works on the principle of the otter and somewhat like the celebrated irish pig going to market runs ahead the more it is pulled back by the tail  with this torpedo the daring russians resolved to attack the second gunboat but when they threw it overboard it would not work something had gone wrong with its tail or with the levers by which on coming into contact with the enemy it was to explode  they were compelled therefore to abandon the attempt and seek shelter from the turkish fire behind an island  so then said i on quitting the hospital torpedoes although terrible in their action are not always certain  nothing is always certain replied nicholas with a smile except the flight of time and as the matter on which i have come requires attention i must now leave you for a few hours  dont forget the name of our hotel  that secure in a mans mind he may lose himself in any town or city with perfect safetyau revoir  for some time i walked about the town  the morning was bright and calm suggesting ideas of peace nevertheless my thoughts could not be turned from the contemplation of war and as i wandered hither and thither looking out for reminiscences of former wars i thought of the curiously steady way in which human history repeats itself  it seems to take about a quarter of a century to teach men to forget or ignore the lessons of the past and induce them to begin again to fight  here in 1829 the russians levelled the fortifications which at that time encircled the town here in 1854 the russians were defeated by the turks and here in 1872 these same russians and turks were at the same old bloody and useless gameever learning yet never coming to a knowledge of the great truth that with all their fighting nothing has been gained and nothing accomplished save a few changes of the men on the chessboard and the loss of an incalculable amount of life and treasure  as the day advanced it became very sultry  towards the afternoon i stopped and gazed thoughtfully at the placid danube which flowing round the gentle curve of slobosia reflected in its glittering waters the white domes and minarets of the opposite town of rustchuk  a low rumbling sound startled me just then from a reverie  on looking up i perceived a small puff of smoke roll out in the direction of the turkish shore  another and another succeeded and after each shot a smaller puff of smoke was seen to hang over the turkish batteries opposite  a strange conflicting rush of feelings came over me for i had awakened from dreaming of ancient battles to find myself in the actual presence of modern war  the russian had opened fire and their shells were bursting among the turks  these latter were not slow to reply  soon the rumbling increased to thunder and i was startled by hearing a tremendous crash not far distant from me followed by a strange humming sound  the crash was the bursting of a turkish shell in one of the streets of the town and the humming sound was the flying about of ragged bits of iron  from the spot on which i stood i could see the havoc it made in the road while men women and children were rushing in all directions out of its way  two objects lay near the spot however which moved although they did not flee  one was a woman the other a boy both were severely wounded  i hurried through the town in the direction of the redcross hospital partly expecting that i might be of service there and partly in the hope of finding nicholas  as i went i heard people remarking excitedly on the fact that the turks were firing at the hospital  the bombardment became furious and i felt an uncomfortable disposition to shrink as i heard and saw shot and shell falling everywhere in the streets piercing the houses and bursting in them  many of these were speedily reduced to ruins  people hurried from their dwellings into the streets excited and shouting  men rushed wildly to places of shelter from the deadly missiles and soon the cries and wailing of women over the dead and wounded increased the uproar  this was strangely and horribly contrasted with the fiendish laughter of a group of boys who as yet unhurt and scarcely alive to the real nature of what was going on had taken shelter in an archway from which they darted out occasionally to pick up the pieces of shells that burst near them  these poor boys however were not good judges of shelterplaces in such circumstances  just as i passed a shell fell and burst in front of the archway and a piece of it went singing so close past my head that i fancied at the first moment it must have hit me  at the same instant the boys uttered an unearthly yell of terror and fled from under the archway where i saw one of their number rolling on the ground and shrieking in agony  hastening to his assistance i found that he had received a severe flesh wound in the thigh  i carried him into a house that seemed pretty well protected from the fire dressed his wound and left him in charge of the inmates who although terribly frightened were kind and sympathetic  proceeding through the marketplace i observed a little girl crouching in a doorway her face as pale as if she were dead her lips perfectly white and an expression of extreme horror in her eyes  i should probably have passed her for even in that short sharp walk i had already seen so many faces expressing terror that i had ceased to think of stopping but i observed a stream of blood on her lightcoloured dress  stooping down i asked  are you hurt dear  twice i repeated the question before she appeared to understand me then raising a pair of large lustrous but tearless eyes to my face she uttered the single word father and pointed to something that lay in the gloom of the passage beyond her  i entered lifted the corner of a piece of coarse canvas and under it saw the form of a man but there was no countenance  his head had been completely shattered by a shell replacing the canvas i returned to the child  her right hand was thrust into her bosom and as she held it there in an unnatural position i suspected something and drew it gently out  i was right it had been struck and the middle finger was hanging by a piece of skin  a mere touch of my knife was sufficient to sever it  as i bandaged the stump i tried to console the poor child  she did not appear to care for the pain i unavoidably caused her but remained quite still only saying now and then in a low voice father as she looked with her tearless eyes at the heap that lay in the passage  giving this hapless little one in charge of a woman who seemed to be an inhabitant of the same building i hurried away but had not gone a hundred yards when i chanced to meet nicholas  ha well met my boy he exclaimed evidently in a state of suppressed excitement come along  i expected to have had a long hunt after you but fortune favours me and we have not a moment to lose  where are you going  i asked  just think he said seizing my arm and hurrying me along but taking no heed of my question we are fairly over the danube in force  the night before last three thousand men cossacks and infantry crossed from galatz in boats and rafts and gained the heights above matchin zoukoff has beaten the enemy everywhere and zimmermann is reported to have driven them out of matchinin fact we have fairly broken the ice and all that we have now to do is to go in and win  i saw by the flush on his handsome countenance that the martial ardour of nicholas was stirred to its depths  there was a noble look of daring in his clear grey eye and a smile of what seemed like joy on his lips which i knew well were the expression of such sentiments as love of country desire to serve like a brave son that emperor whom he regarded as a father hatred of oppression belief in the righteousness of the cause for which he fought and delight in the prospect of wild animal excitement  he was full of high hopes noble aspirations superabundant energy and although not a deep thinker could tell better than most men by looking at it whether the edge of a grindstone were rough or smooth  we walked smartly to our hotel but found that our servant had fled no one knew whither taking our horses with him  the landlord however suggested the railway station and thither we ran  a train was entering when we arrived  it was full of russian soldiers on the platform stood a jew to whom nicholas addressed himself  the jew at first seemed to have difficulty in understanding him but he ultimately said that he had seen a man who must be the one we were in search of and was about to tell us more when a turkish shell burst through the roof of the station and exploded on the platform part of which it tore up sending splinters of iron and wood in all directions the confused noise of shout and yell that followed together with the smoke prevented my observing for a moment or two what damage had been done but soon i ascertained that nicholas and myself were unhurt that the jew had been slightly wounded and also several of the people who were waiting the arrival of the train  the groans of some of the wounded and the cursing and shouting of the soldiers just arrived made a powerful impression on me  come i see our fellow cried nicholas seizing me suddenly by the arm and hurrying me away  in a few minutes we had caught our man mounted our horses rejoined our cavalry escort which awaited us in the marketplace and galloped out of the town  it is a fact worthy of record that of all the people killed and hurt during this bombardment of giurgevo not one was a russian  this arose from the fact that the soldiers were under the safe cover of their batteries  the turkish shells did not produce any real damage to works or men  in short all that was accomplished in this noisy display of the art of war was the destruction of many private houses the killing and maiming of several civilians including women and children and a shameful waste of very expensive ammunition partly paid for by the sufferers  in contemplating these facts the word glory assumed a very strange and quite a new meaning in my mind  soon we were beyond the reach of turkish missiles though still within sound of the guns  our pace showed that we were making what i suppose my military friends would style a forced march  nicholas was evidently unwilling to converse on the object of our march but at length gave way a little  i see no harm he said in telling you that we are about to cross the danube not far from this and that at least one of my objects is to secure a trustworthy intelligent spy  you knowperhaps you dont knowthat such men are rare  of course we can procure any number of men who have pluck enough to offer themselves as spies for the sake of the high pay just as we can get any number of men who are willing to jump down a cannons throat for the honour and glory of the thing  yes said i interrupting men like our friend nicholas naranovitsch  well perhaps he replied with a light laugh but dont change the subject jeff youve got a bad tendency to do so  i say there is no difficulty in getting spies but it is not easy to find men well qualified for such work  now one has been heard of at last and among other things i am commissioned to secure him for the purpose of leading our troops across the balkans  the balkans said i in surprise you are a long way from that range  the length of any way jeff depends not so much upon the way as on the spirit of him who measures it  ten miles to one man is a hundred miles to another and vice versa  i could make no objection to that for it was true  nevertheless said i after a pause there may be spirits among the turks who could render that which is only a few days journey in ordinary circumstances a six months business to the russians  admitted heartily returned nicholas with animation if the turk were not a brave foe one could not take so much interest in the war  this last remark silenced me for a time  the viewpoint of my future kinsman was so utterly different from mine that i knew not what to reply  he evidently thought that a plucky foe worthy of his steel was most desirable while to my mind it appeared obvious that the pluckier the foe the longer and more resolute would be the resistance and as a consequence the greater the amount of bloodshed and of suffering to the women children and aged the heavier the drain on the resources of both empires and of addition to the burdens of generations yet unborn  when after a considerable time i put the subject in this light before nicholas he laughed heartily and said  why jeff at that rate you would knock all the romance out of war  that were impossible nick i rejoined quickly for there is no romance whatever in war  no romance he exclaimed opening his eyes to their widest and raising his black brows to their highest in astonishment  no said i firmly not a scrap  all the romance connected with war is in spite of it and by no means the result of it  the heroism displayed in its wildest sallies is true heroism undoubtedly but it would be none the less heroism if it were exercised in the rescue of men and women from shipwreck or from fire  the romance of the bivouac in the dark woods or on the moonlit plains of foreign lands with the delights of fresh air and lifegiving exercise and thrilling adventure is not the perquisite of the warrior it is the privilege quite as much if not more of the pioneer in the american backwoods and prairies and of the hunter in the wilds of africa  the romance of unexpected meetings with foreign fair ones in outotheway circumstances with broken bones perhaps or gunshot wounds to lend pathos to the affair and necessitate nursing which may lead to lovemakingall that is equally possible to the alpine climber and the chamoishunter to the traveller almost anywhere who chooses to indulge in reckless sport regardless of his neckof course i added with a smile for i did not wish to appear too cynical in my friends eyes the soldier has a few advantages in which the civilian does not quite come up to him such as the glorious brass band and the red coat and the glittering lace  jeff said nicholas somewhat gravely would you then take all the glory out of war and reduce soldiers to a set of mere professional and legalised cutthroats whose duty it is callously to knock over so many thousand men at the command of governments  bear with me a little said i and hear me out  you misunderstand me  i speak of war not of warriors  as there is no romance so there is no glory in war  many a glorious deed may be and often is done in connection with war  such a deed is done when a handful of brave men sacrifice their lives at the call of duty and in defence of country as at thermopylae  such a deed is done when a wounded prussian soldier dying of thirst on the battlefield forgets the accursed customwarwhich has brought him to that pass and shares the last drops of his waterflask with a socalled french enemy  and such a deed is done still more gloriously when a soldier true to his queen and country is true also to his god and preaches while he practises the principles and gospel of the prince of peace in the presence of those with whom he acts his part in this worlds drama  there is indeed much that is glorious in the conduct of many warriors but there is no glory whatever in war itself  the best that can be said of it is that sometimes it is a stern yet sad necessity  we dropped the subject here having reached the point of the river where our party was to cross to the turkish shore  the passage was soon accomplished by means of rafts and many thousands of russians having already preceded us we experienced no opposition  it was daylight when we rode into a village on the bulgarian shore and i looked up sleepily at the cottages as we passed  we halt here said nicholas with a yawn as he drew rein  the officer in command of our party had already halted his men who gladly quitting their saddles streamed after us into the courtyard of the village    chapter thirteen  shews what sometimes happens in the track of troops  why nicholas i exclaimed looking round the inn i have been here before  it isit must bethe very place where on my way up i saw a famous wrestlingmatch  did i ever tell you about it  never but come along i must finish one part of my duty here without delay by paying a visit  you can tell me about the wrestlingmatch as we walk together  i described the match with great interest for my heart warmed towards the chief actor and his family and as i proceeded with the narration i observed with some satisfaction that the road we were following led in the direction of the cottage of dobri petroff  as we drew near to the path that diverged to it i resolved if possible to give nicholas who was evidently interested in my narrative a surprise by confronting him unexpectedly with the blacksmith and his family  nicholas i said you see that cottage on the hillside  i have a great desire to pay its inmates a visit  have you any objection to turn aside just for a few minutes  nicholas gave me a look of surprise and laughed  none in the world jeff for it happens that i particularly wish to visit the cottage myself  you do  whywhat  well finish your question jeff why should it seem strange to you that i want to visit a bulgarian family  why because nick this is the cottage of the very blacksmith about whom i have been speaking and i wanted to give you a surprise by introducing him to you  his name asked nicholas quickly  dobri petroff  the very man  how strange  you have already given me a surprise jeff and will now add a pleasure and a service by introducing me to him and perhaps by using your powers of suasion  it is no breach of confidence to tell you that part of my business here is to secure the services of this man as a guide over the balkans with the passes of which we have been told he is intimately acquainted  but it is said that he is a bold independent fellow who may dislike and refuse the duty  he wont dislike it at all events said i  he has no love for the turks who have treated him shamefully just because of that same bold and independent spirit  well come we shall see rejoined my friend  in a few minutes we had come to a turn in the path which brought the cottage full into view and i experienced a sudden shock on observing that part of itthat part which had been the forgewas a blackened ruin  i was at the same moment relieved however by the sight of ivanka and little dobri who were playing together in front of the uninjured part of the cottage  next moment the tall handsome form of the blacksmith appeared stooping under the doorway as he came out to receive us  i noticed that there was an expression of trouble on his countenance mingled with a look of sternness which was not usual to him  he did not recognise me at first and evidently eyed nicholasas a russian officerwith no favour  as we drew near the stern look vanished and he sprang forward with a glad smile to seize and shake my hand  at the same moment ivankas black eyes seemed to blaze with delight as she ran towards me and clasped one of my legs  little dobri bereft of speech stood with legs and arms apart and mouth and eyes wide open gazing at me  all well  i asked anxiously  all well said the blacksmith then with a glance at the forgeexcept the but thats not much after allcome in gentlemen come in  we entered and found marika as neat and thrifty as ever though with a touch of care about her pretty face which had not been there when i first met her  a few words explained the cause of their trouble  sir said petroff addressing me but evidently speaking at nicholas we unfortunate bulgarians have hard times of it just now  the turk has oppressed and robbed and tortured and murdered us in time past and now the russian who has come to deliver us is it seems to me completing our ruin  what between the two we poor wretches have come to a miserable pass indeed  he turned full on nicholas unable to repress a fierce look  friend said nicholas gently but firmly the chances of war are often hard to bear but you ought to recognise a great difference between the sufferings which are caused by wilful oppression and those which are the unavoidable consequences of a state of warfare  unavoidable retorted the blacksmith bitterly  is it not possible for the russians to carry supplies for their armies instead of demanding all our cattle for beef and all our harvests for fodder  do we not pay you for such things asked nicholas in the tone of a man who wishes to propitiate his questioner  yes truly but nothing like the worth of what you take besides of what value are a few gold pieces to me  my wife and children cannot eat gold and there is little or nothing left in the land to buy  but that is not the worst  your cossacks receive nothing from your government for rations and are allowed to forage as they will  do you suppose that when in want of anything they will stop to inquire whether it belongs to a bulgarian or not  when the war broke out and your troops crossed the river my cattle and grain were bought up whether i would or no by your soldiers  they were paid forunderpaid i saybut that i cared not for as they left me one milchcow and fodder enough to keep her  immediately after that a band of your lawless and unrationed cossacks came killed the cow and took the forage without paying for either  after that the moldavians who drive your waggonsupplies for youa lawless set of brigands when there are no troops near to watch themcleaned my house of every scrap that was worth carrying away what could i do  to kill a dozen of them would have been easy but that would not have been the way to protect my wife and children  the man laid his great hand tenderly on ivankas head while he was speaking in his deep earnest voice and nicholas who was well aware of the truth of his remarks about the cossacks and the waggondrivers of the army expressed such genuine feeling and regret for the sufferings with which the household had been visited that petroff was somewhat appeased  but how came your forge to be burned  i asked desiring to change the drift of the conversation  the question called up a look of ferocity on the blacksmiths face of which i had not believed it capable  the turks did it he hissed rather than said between his teeth the men of this villagemen whom i have served for yearsmen by whom i have been robbed for years and to whose insults i have quietly and tamely submitted until now for the sake of these he pointed to his wife and childrenbecame enraged at the outbreak of the war and burned my workshop  they would have burned my cottage too but luckily there is a good partitionwall between it and the shop which stayed the flames  no doubt they would have despoiled my house as they have done to others but my door and windows were barricaded and they knew who was inside  they left me but that which the turks spared the russians have taken  still sir he turned again full on nicholas i must say that if your government is honest in its intentions it is far from wise in its methods  you hate the turks however and are willing to serve against them asked nicholas  the blacksmith shook his shaggy locks as he raised his head  ay i hate them and as for  oh husband pleaded marika for the first time breaking silence do not take vengeance into your own hands  well as to that returned dobri with a careless smile i have no particular desire for vengeance but the turks have taken away my livelihood i have nothing to do and may as well fight as anything else  it will at all events enable me to support you and the children we are starving just now  nicholas hastened to assure the unfortunate man that his family would be specially cared for if he would undertake to guide the russian columns across the balkan mountains  taking him aside he then entered into earnest converse with him about the object of his mission  meanwhile i had a long chat with his wife and the little ones from whom i learned the sad details of the sufferings they had undergone since we last met  but you wont leave us now will you said little ivanka pitifully getting on my knee and nestling on my breast you will stay with father wont you and help to take care of us  im so frightened  which do you fear most dear said i smoothing her hairthe turks or the cossacks  the child seemed puzzled  i dont know she said after a thoughtful pause  father says the turks are far far worst but mother and i fear them both they are so fierceso very fierce  i think they would have killed us if father had been away  nicholas did not find it hard to persuade the blacksmith  he promised him a tempting reward but it was evident that his assurance that the wife and family would be placed under the special care of the authorities of the village had much greater effect in causing the man to make up his mind than the prospect of reward  it was further arranged that petroff should accompany us at once  ready he said when the proposal was made  ive nothing left here to pack up he added looking sadly round the poor and empty room  in less than an hour arrangements had been made with the chief man of the village for the comfort and safeguard of the family during the blacksmiths absence  it was bright noontide when we were again prepared to take the road  oh dobri said marika as in an angle of the innyard she bade her husband farewell dont forget the saviourjesusour one hope on earth  god bless you marika ill never forget you returned petroff straining his young wife to his heart  he had already parted from the children  next moment he was in the saddle and soon after was galloping with the troop to which we were attached towards the balkan mountains    chapter fourteen  tells more of what occasionally happens in the track of troops  as we advanced towards the high lands the scenery became more beautiful and picturesque  rich fields of grain waved on every side  pretty towns villages and hamlets seemed to me to lie everywhere smiling in the midst of plenty in short all that the heart of man could desire was there in superabundance and as one looked on the evidences of plenty one naturally associated it with the idea of peace  but as that is not all gold which glitters so the signs of plenty do not necessarily tell of peace  here and there as we passed over the land we had evidences of this in burned homesteads and trampled fields which had been hurriedly reaped of their golden store as if by the sword rather than the sickle  as we drew near to the front these signs of war became more numerous  we had not much time however to take note of them our special service required hard riding and little rest  one night we encamped on the margin of a wood  it was very dark for although the moon was nearly full thick clouds effectually concealed her or permitted only a faint ray to escape now and then like a gleam of hope from the battlements of heaven  i wandered from one fire to another to observe the conduct of the men in bivouac  they were generally lighthearted being very young and hopeful  evidently their great desire was to meet with the enemy whatever thoughts they might have had of home they did not at that time express them aloud  some among them however were grave and sad a few were sternalmost sulky  such was dobri petroff that night  round his fire among others stood sergeant gotsuchakoff and corporal shoveloff  come scout said the corporal slapping petroff heartily on the shoulder dont be downhearted man  that pretty little sweetheart you left behind you will never forsake such a strapping fellow as you she will wait till you return crowned with laurels  petroff was well aware that corporal shoveloff knowing nothing of his private history had made a mere guess at the little sweetheart and having no desire to be communicative met him in his own vein  its not that corporal he said with a serious yet anxious air which attracted the attention of the surrounding soldiers its not that which troubles me  im as sure of the pretty little sweetheart as i am that the sun will rise tomorrow but theres my dear old mother that lost a leg last christmas by the overturning of a sledge an my old father whos been bedridden for the last quarter of a century and the brindled cow thats just recovering from the measles  how they are all to get on without me and nobody left to look after them but an old sister as tall as myself and in the last stages of a decline  at this point the scout as corporal shoveloff had dubbed him was interrupted by a roar of laughter from his comrades in which the corporal joined heartily  well well said the latter who was not easily quelled either mentally or physically i admit that you have good cause for despondency nevertheless a man like you ought to keep up his spirits if it were only for the sake of example to young fellows now like andre yanovitch there who seems to have buried all his relatives before starting for the wars  the youth on whom shoveloff tried to turn the laugh of his own discomfiture was a splendid fellow tall and broadshouldered enough for a man of twentyfive though his smooth and youthful face suggested sixteen  he had been staring at the fire regardless of what was going on around  what did you say he cried starting up and reddening violently  come come corporal said sergeant gotsuchakoff interposing no insinuations  andre yanovitch will be ten times the man you are when he attains to your advanced ageoff with that kettle lads it must be more than cooked by this time and there is nothing so bad for digestion as overdone meat  it chanced that night after the men were rolled in their cloaks that dobri petroff found himself lying close to andre under the same bush  you dont sleep he said observing that the young soldier moved frequently  thinking of home like me no doubt  that was all nonsense said the youth sharply about the cow and your mother and sister wasnt it  of course it was  do you think i was going to give a straight answer to a fool like shoveloff  but you have left a mother behind you i suppose said andre in a low voice  no lad no my mother died when i was but a child and has left naught but the memory of an angel on my mind  the scout said no more for a time but the tone of his voice had opened the heart of the young dragoon  after a short silence he ventured to ask a few more questions  the scout replied cheerfully and from one thing to another they went on until discovering that they were sympathetic spirits they became confidante and each told to the other his whole history  that of the young dragoon was short and simple but sad  he had been chosen he said for service from a rural district and sent to the war without reference to the fact that he was the only support of an invalid mother whose husband had died the previous year  he had an elder brother who ought to have filled his place but who being given to drink did not in any way fulfil his duties as a son  there was also it was true a young girl the daughter of a neighbour who had done her best to help and comfort his mother at all times but without the aid of his strong hand that girls delicate fingers could not support his mother despite the willingness of her brave heart and thus he had left them hurriedly at the sudden and peremptory call of government  that young girl said petroff after listening to the lads earnest account of the matter with sympathetic attention has no place there has shehe touched the left breast of andres coat and nodded  the blush of the young soldier was visible even in the dim light of the campfire as he started up on one elbow and said  well yes she has a place there  he drew out a small gilt locket as he spoke and opening it displayed a lock of soft auburn hair  i never spoke to her about it he continued in a low tone till the night we parted  she is very modest you must know and i never dared to speak to her before but i became desperate that night and told her all and she confessed her love for me  oh petroff if i could only have had one day more ofofbut the sergeant would not wait  i had to go to the wars  one evening in paradise is but a short time yet i would not exchange it for all i ever he paused  yes yes i know all about that said the scout with an encouraging nod ive had more than one evening in that region and so will you lad after the war is over  im not so sure of that returned the dragoon sadly however she gave me this lock of her hairshe is called maria with the auburn hair at our placeand mother gave me the locket to put it in  i noticed that she took some grey hair out when she did so  keep it lad keep it always near your heart said the scout with sudden enthusiasm as the youth replaced and buttoned up his treasure it will save you mayhap like a charm in the hour of temptation  i dont need that advice returned the soldier with a quiet smile as he once more laid his head on his saddle  soon the noise in our little camp ceased and ere long every man was asleep except the sentinels  towards morning one of these observed a man approaching at full speed as he came near the sentinel threw forward his carbine and challenged the man stopped and looked about him like a startled hare then without reply turned sharply to the left and dashed off  the sentinel fired of course we all sprang up and the fugitive doubling again to avoid another sentinel almost leaped into the arms of andre yanovitch who held him as if in a vice until he ceased his struggles and sank exhausted with a deep groan  on being led to one of the fires in a halffainting condition it was found that he was covered with blood and wounds  he looked round him at first with an expression of maniacal terror but the moment he observed petroff among his captors he uttered a loud cry and springing forward seized his hand  why lewie exclaimed the scout with a gleam of recognition what has happened  the bashibazouks have been at our village cried the man wildly as he wiped the blood out of his eyes  ha exclaimed dobri with a fierce look we can succour  no no no interrupted the man with a strange mixture of horror and fury in his bloodstreaked face too late too late  he raised his head stammered as if attempting to say more then lifting both arms aloft while the outspread fingers clutched the air uttered an appalling cry and fell flat on the ground  not too late for revenge muttered the officer commanding the detachment  dress his wounds as quickly as may be mr childers  he gave the necessary orders to get ready  in a few minutes the horses were saddled and i had done what i could for the wounded man  you know the village he came from and the way to it asked the commanding officer of petroff  yes sir i know it well  take the man up behind you then and lead the way  the troop mounted and a few minutes later we were galloping over a wide plain on the eastern verge of which the light of the new day was slowly dawning  an hours ride brought us to the village  we could see the smoke of the still burning cottages as we advanced and were prepared for a sad spectacle of one of the effects of war but what we beheld on entering far surpassed our expectations  harvests trampled down or burned were bad enough so were burning cottages batteredin doors and smashed windows but these things were nothing to the sight of dead men and women scattered about the streets  the men were not men of war their peasant garbs bespoke them men of peace  gallantly had they fought however in defence of hearth and home but all in vain  the trained miscreants who had attacked them form a part of the turkish army which receives no pay and is therefore virtually told that after fighting their recognised duty is to pillage  but the brutes had done more than this  as we trotted through the little hamlet which was peopled only by the dead we observed that most of the men had been more or less mutilated some in a very horrible manner and the poor fellow who had escaped said that this had been done while the men were alive  dismounting we examined some of the cottages and there beheld sights at the mere recollection of which i shudder  in one i saw women and children heaped together with their limbs cut and garments torn off while their long hair lay tossed about on the bloody floors  in another which was on fire i could see the limbs of corpses that were being roasted or had already been burnt to cinders  not one soul in that village was left alive  how many had escaped we could not ascertain for the wounded man had fallen into such a state of wild horror that he could not be got to understand or answer questions at one cottage door which we came to he stood with clasped hands gazing at the dead inside like one petrified  some one touched him on the shoulder when we were ready to leave the place but he merely muttered my home  as we could do no good there and were anxious to pursue the fiends who had left such desolation behind them we again urged the man to come with us but he refused  on our attempting to use gentle force he started suddenly drew a knife from his girdle and plunging it into his heart fell dead on his own threshold  it was with a sense of relief as if we had been delivered from a dark oppressive dungeon that we galloped out of the village and followed the tracks of the bashibazouks which were luckily visible on the plain  soon we traced them to a road that led towards the mountainous country  there was no other road there and as this one had neither fork nor diverging path we had no difficulty in following them up  it was night however before we came upon further traces of them several fires where they had stopped to cook some food  as the sky was clear we pushed on all that night  shortly after dawn we reached a sequestered dell  the road being curved at the place we came on it suddenly and here under the bushes we discovered the lair of the bashibazouks  they kept no guard apparently but the sound of our approach had roused them for as we galloped into the dell some were seen running to catch their horses others scarcely awake were wildly buckling on their swords while a few were creeping from under the low booths of brushwood they had set up to shelter them  the scene that followed was brief but terrible  our men some of whom were lancers some dragoons charged them in all directions with yells of execration  here i saw one wretch thrust through with a lance doubling backward in his deathagony as he fell there another turned fiercely and fired his pistol full at the dragoon who charged him but missed and was cleft next moment to the chin  in another place a wretched man had dropped on his knees and while in a supplicating attitude was run through the neck by a lancer  but to say truth little quarter was asked by these bashibazouks and none was granted they fought on foot fiercely with spear and pistol and short sword it seemed to me as if some of my conceptions of hell were being realised rapid shots fire and smoke imprecations shouts and yells with looks of fiercest passion and deadly hate shrieks of mortal pain blood spouting in thick fountains from sudden wounds men lying in horrible almost grotesque contortions or writhing on the ground in throes of agony  o god thought i and all this is done for the amelioration of the condition of the christians in turkey  ha haa shouted a voice near me as if in mockery of my thought  it was more like that of a fiend than a man  i turned quickly  it was andre yanovitch his young and handsome face distorted with a look of furious triumph as he wiped his bloody sword after killing the last of the bashibazouks who had failed to escape into the neighbouring woods these brutes at least wont have another chance of drawing blood from women and children he cried sheathing his sword with a clang and trotting towards his comrades who were already mustering at the bottom of the dell the skirmish being over  the smoothfaced tenderhearted youth with the lock of auburn hair in his bosom had fairly begun his education in the art of war  his young heart was bursting and his young blood boiling with the tumultuous emotions caused by a combination of pity and revenge  the scout also galloped past to rejoin our party  i noticed in the melee that his swordsweep had been even more terrible and deadly than that of andre but he had done his fearful work in comparative silence with knitted brows compressed lips and clenched teeth  he was a fullgrown man the other a mere boy  besides dobri petroff had been born and bred in a land of rampant tyranny and had learned naturally bold and independent though he was at all times to hold himself and all his powers well in hand  little did the scout imagine that while he was thus inflicting welldeserved punishment on the turkish bashibazouks the cossacks of russia had about the same time made demands on the men of his own village who resisting were put to the sword and many of them massacred  strong in the belief that the country which had taken up arms for the deliverance of bulgaria would be able to fulfil its engagements and afford secure protection to the inhabitants of yenilik and among them to his wife and little ones dobri petroff went on his way with a comparatively easy mind  it was evening when we reached another village where the people had been visited by a body of russian irregular horse who had murdered some of them and carried off whatever they required  putting up at the little hostelry of the place i felt too much fatigued to talk over recent events with nicholas and was glad to retire to a small room where stretched on a wooden bench with a greatcoat for a pillow i soon forgot the sorrows and sufferings of bulgaria in profound slumber    chapter fifteen  simtovanew views of warlancey goes to the front and sees service and gets a scare  shortly afterwards our detachment reached the headquarters of general gourko who with that celebrated russian general skobeleff the younger was pressing towards the balkans  here changes took place which very materially altered my experiences  nicholas naranovitsch was transferred to the staff of general skobeleff petroff was sent to act the part of guide and scout to the division and i although anxious to obtain employment at the front was obliged to content myself with an appointment to the army hospitals at sistova  as it turned out this post enabled me to understand more of the true nature of war than if i had remained with the army and as i afterwards had considerable experience in the field the appointment proved to be advantageous though at the time i regarded it as a disappointment  when i had been some weeks at sistova i wrote a letter to my mother which as it gives a fair account of the impressions made at the time i cannot do better than transcribe    dearest motheri have been in the hospitals now for some weeks and   it is not possible for you to conceive or me to convey an adequate   description of the horrible effects of this most hideous war  my   opinions on waralways as you know stronghave been greatly   strengthened also modified  your heart would bleed for the poor   wounded men if you saw them  they are sent to us in crowds daily   direct from the battlefields  an ordinary hospital with its clean   beds and its sufferers warmly housed and well cared for with which   you are familiar enough gives no idea of an army hospital in time of   war    the men come in or are carried in begrimed with powder smoke and   dust with broken limbs and gaping wounds mortifying and almost unfit   for inspection or handling until cleansed by the application of   listers carbolic acid spray  some of these have dragged themselves   hither on foot from that awful shipka passa seven days journey   and are in such an abject state of exhaustion that their recovery is   usually impossible  yet some do recover  some men seem very hard to   kill  on the other hand i have seen some men whose hold on life was   so feeble as to make it difficult to say which of their comparatively   slight wounds had caused death    i am now alas familiar with death and wounds and human agony in   every form  day and night i am engaged in dressing operating and   tending generally  the same may be said of all connected with the   hospital  the doctors under professor wahl are untiring in their   work  the protestant sisters of mercy chiefly germans and the   sanitaires who take the weary nightwatches are quite worn out   for the number of sick and wounded who pour in on us has far exceeded   the computations formed  everything in this war has been   underestimated  what do you think of this factwithin the last   fifty days 15000 men have been killed and 40000 sick and wounded   sent to russian hospitals  this speaks to 55000 russian homes   plunged into mourningto say nothing of similar losses if not   greater by the turksa heavy price to pay for improving the   condition of bulgariaisnt it    there is a strong feeling in my mind that this is a war of   extermination  no quarter is too frequently the cry on either side   i do not say that the russians mean it to be so but when   bashibazouks torture their prisoners in cold blood and show fiendish   delight in the most diabolical acts of cruelty even going the length   of roasting people alive is it strange that a brutalising effect is   produced on the russians and that they retaliate in a somewhat   similar spirit at times  the truth is mother that one of the direct   and most powerful effects of war is to dehumanise and check the   influence of the good men engaged while it affords a splendid   opportunity to the vicious and brutal to give the rein to their   passions and work their will with impunity    but while this is so with the combatants many of those outside the   ring are stirred to pity and to noble deeds  witness the   selfsacrificing labours of the volunteer heroes and heroines who do   their work in an hospital such as this and the generous deeds evoked   from the peoples of other lands such as the sending of two splendid   and completely equipped ambulance trains of twentyfive carriages   each by the berlin central committee of the international association   for the relief of sick and wounded soldiers in the field the   thousands of pounds that have been contributed by the russians for the   comfort of their sick and wounded and the thousands contributed by   england for that fund which embraces in its sympathies both russian   and turk  it seems to me that a great moral war is going on just   nowa war between philanthropy and selfishness but i grieve to say   that while the former saves its thousands the latter slays its tens   of thousands  glorious though the result of our labours is it is as   nothing compared with the torrent of evil which has called us out and   the conclusion which has been forced upon me is that we shouldevery   one of us man woman and childhold and pertinaciously enforce the   precept that war among civilised nations is outrageous and   intolerable  of course we cannot avoid it sometimes  if a man will   insist on fighting me i have no resource left but to fight him   but for two civilised nations to go to war for the settlement of a   dispute is an unreasonable and childish and silly as it would be for   two gentlemen who should differ in opinion to step into the middle   of a peaceful drawingroom button up their coats turn up their   wristbands and proceed to batter each others eyes and noses   regardless of ladies children and valuables  war would be a   contemptible farce if it were not a tremendous tragedy  my mothers reply to this letter was characteristic and brief    my dear jeff she wrote in regard to your strictures on war i have   only to say that i agree with you as i have always done on all   points heart and soul  dont forget to keep your feet dry when   sleeping out at nights and never omit to take the globules  while i was busy at sistovatoo busy with the pressing duties of my post to think much of absent friends my poor servant lancey was going through a series of experiences still more strange and trying than my own  as i have said he had been appointed by sanda pasha to a post in connection with a turkish ambulance corps  he was on his way to the front when the detachment with which he travelled met with a reverse which materially affected his fortunes for some time after  there were two turkish soldiers with whom lancey was thrown much in contact and with whom he had become very intimate  there was nothing very particular in the appearance of the two men except that they formed contrasts one being tall and thin the other short and thick both were comrades and bosom friends and both took a strong fancy to their english comrade  lancey had also taken a fancy to them  it was in short the old story of kindred souls and despite the fact that these turks were to lancey furriners and unbelievers while he was to them a giaour they felt strong human sympathies which drew them powerfully together  the name of the thick little man was ali bobo that of the tall comrade eskiwin  that these two loved each other intensely although turks was the first thing that touched lanceys feelings  on discovering that ali bobo happened to have dwelt for a long time with an english merchant in constantinople and could speak a little of something that was understood to be english he became intimate and communicative  not more tender was the love of david and jonathan than was that of eskiwin and ali bobo  as the screw to the nut so fitted the one to the other  eskiwin was grave his friend was funny  ali bobo was smart his comrade was slow  they never clashed  jacob lancey being quiet and sedate observed the two admired each philosophised on both and gained their esteem  their friendship alas was of short duration  yous goodish sorro man said ali bobo to lancey one evening as they sat over the campfire smoking their pipes in concert  lancey made no reply but nodded his head as if in approval of the sentiment  heskiwin es a good un too haint e bobo asked lancey pointing with his thumb to the tall turk who sat crosslegged beside him smoking a chibouk  ali bobo smiled in the way that a man does when he thinks a great deal more than he chooses to express  at that moment the officer in command of the detachment galloped furiously into the camp with the information that the russians were upon them  instantly all was uproar and a scramble to get out of the way eskiwin however was an exception  he was a man of quiet promptitude deliberately dropping his pipe he rose and saddled his horse while his more excitable comrades were struggling hurriedly and therefore slowly with the buckles of their harness  ali bobo was not less cool though more active  lancey chanced to break his stirrupleather in mounting  i say bobo he called to his stout little friend who was near lend a and like a good fellow  this brute wont stand still  give us a leg  the little turk put his hand on lanceys instep and hoisted him into the saddle  next moment the whole party was in full retreat  not a moment too soon either  a scattering volley from the russians who were coming on in force quickened their movements  the faint moonlight enabled the turks to distance their pursuers and soon the chase appeared to be given up  still most of the detachment continued its headlong retreat for a considerable time  suddenly eskiwin observed that ali bobo swayed from side to side as he rode and then fell heavily to the ground  he pulled up at once and dismounted  lancey who saw what had happened also dismounted  the rest of the detachment was out of sight in a moment  there was no sound of pursuers and they found themselves left thus in a lonely spot among the hills  on examining the fallen turk it was found that he had been hit by two balls  one had apparently penetrated his shoulder the other had grazed his temple  it was the latter which had brought him to the ground but the shoulderwound seemed to be the more dangerous  dead said lancey solemnly as he kneeled beside the body  eskiwin made no answer his grave countenance expressed nothing but stern decision  his friends face was colourless motionless and growing cold  he raised bobos hand and let it drop as he gazed mournfully into his face  just then the sound of the pursuers was heard as if searching the neighbouring thicket  eskiwin rose slowly and with his bayonet began to dig a grave  the soil was soft  a hollow was soon scooped out and the dead turk was put therein  but while the two men were engaged in burying it the russians were heard still beating about in the thicket and apparently drawing near  lancey felt uneasy  still eskiwin moved with slow deliberation when the grave was covered he kneeled and prayed  come come you can do that on horseback said lancey with impatience  eskiwin took no notice of the irreverent interruption but calmly finished his prayer cast one sorrowful glance on the grave and remounted his charger  lancey was about to do the same being retarded by the broken stirrupleather when a tremendous shout caused his horse to swerve break its bridle and dash away  at the same moment a band of don cossacks came swooping down the gorge  lancey flung himself flat beneath a mass of underwood  the cossacks saw only one horseman and went past the place with a wild yell  another moment and lancey was left alone beside the grave  to find his way out of the thicket was now the poor mans chief care but this was difficult for besides being ignorant of the road he had to contend with darkness the moon having become obscured  it is a wellknown fact that when a lost man wanders he does so in a circle  twice during that night did lancey start with a view to get away from that spot and twice did he find himself after two hours wandering at the side of ali bobos grave  a third time he set out and at the end of that effort he not only came back to the same spot but chanced inadvertently to plant his foot over the stomach of the luckless turk  this was too much even for a dead man  ali bobo turned in his shallow grave scattered the sod and sitting up looked round him with an expression of surprise  at that moment the moon came out as if expressly for the purpose of throwing light on the dusty bloodstained and cadaverous visage of the turk  jacob lancey although a brave man was superstitious  on beholding the yellow countenance and glaring eyeballs turned full upon him he uttered a yell of deadly terror turned sharp round and fled stumbling over stumps and stones in his blind career  the don cossacks heard the yell and made for the spot  lancey saw them coming doubled and eluded them  perceiving only a wounded man sitting on the ground the foremost cossack levelled his lance and charged  ali bobos stare of surprise developed into a glare of petrified consternation  when the cossack drew near enough to perceive an apparently dead man sitting up in his grave he gave vent to a hideous roar of horror turned off at a tangent and shot away into the bushes  those in rear supposing that he had come on an ambuscade followed his example and in another moment ali bobo was left alone to his moonlight reflections  that these were of a perplexing nature was evident from his movements allowing his eyes to resume their ordinary aspect he looked round him with a troubled expression while his fingers played slowly with the loose earth that still covered his legs  then he shook his head after that he scratched it and put on his fez which had fallen off finding apparently that meditation was of no avail he finally heaved a deep sigh rose shook off the dust picked up his rifle and marched away  he had not gone far when he came upon lancey who having fled with such haste that he could scarcely breathe had been fain to lie down and rest for a few minutes  hearing a step behind him he started up  one glance sufficed  the dead turk again  with another horrific howl he plunged headlong into the nearest thicket and disappeared  a humorous smile stole over the features of ali bobo as he began to understand the situation  he searched the thicket but his late companion was not to be found  continuing his march therefore he travelled all night  next morning he found his detachment and introduced himself to his friend eskiwin whose astonishment i need scarcely say was great but his joy was greater  ali bobos wounds turned out after all to be slight and were not permitted by him to interfere long with his service in the field    chapter sixteen  lancey gets embroiled in troubles and sees some peculiar service  meanwhile jacob lancey impressed with the belief that the turkish detachment had taken to the mountains travelled as rapidly as possible in that direction  next morning at daybreak he found himself so thoroughly exhausted as to be unable to proceed  with difficulty he climbed a neighbouring eminence which being clear of bushes gave him a view of the country around  there was a small village or hamlet within a stones throw of him  the sight revived his drooping spirits  he descended to it at once but found no one stirringnot even a dog  perceiving a small outhouse with its door ajar he went to it and peeped in  there were a few bundles of straw in a corner  the temptation was irresistible  he entered flung himself on the straw and fell sound asleep almost immediately  the sun was shining high in the heavens when he was awakened by a rude shake  he started up and found himself in the rough grasp of a bulgarian peasant  lancey although mentally and morally a man of peace was physically pugnacious  he grappled at once with the bulgarian and being as we have said a powerful fellow soon had him on his back with a hand compressing his windpipe and a knee thrust into his stomach  it would certainly have fared ill with the bulgarian that day if a villager had not been attracted to the hut by the noise of the scuffle  seeing how matters stood he uttered a shout which brought on the scene three more villagers who at once overwhelmed lancey bound him and led him before the chief man of the place  this chief man was a turk with a very black beard  lancey of course expected to receive severe punishment without trial  but on hearing that he had merely attacked a bulgarian the turk seemed rather inclined to favour the prisoner than otherwise  at all events after ascertaining that he could not communicate with him by any known language he sent him to his kitchen to obtain a meal and afterwards allowed him to depart to the evident indignation of the bulgarian and his friends who did not however dare to show their feelings  for some time lancey wandered about endeavouring to make friends with the people but without success  as the day advanced the men and most of the women went to work in the fields  feeling that he had not obtained nearly enough of sleep our wanderer took an opportunity of slipping into another outhouse where he climbed into an empty loft there was a small hole in the loft near the floor  as he lay down and pillowed his head on a beam he found that he could see the greater part of the village through the hole but this fact had barely reached his brain when he had again fallen into the heavy slumber of an exhausted man  his next awakening was caused by shouts and cries  he raised himself on one elbow and looked out of his hole  a large body of russian soldiers had entered the village and were welcomed with wild joy by the bulgarians while the turkish inhabitantsthose of them who had not been able or willing to leaveremained quiet but polite  the column halted  the men swarmed about the place and requisitioned as the phrase goes whatever they wantedthat is they took what they chose from the people whether they were willing or not  to do them justice they paid for it though in most cases the payment was too little  there was a good deal of noisy demonstration and some rough treatment of the inhabitants on the part of those who had come to deliver them but beyond being cleaned out and an insufficient equivalent left in money they were not greatly the worse of this visit from the regulars  the loft where lancey had ensconced himself did not attract attention he felt therefore comparatively safe and while he watched the doings of the soldiery opened his wallet and made a hearty meal on the debris of his rations  before he had finished it the trumpets sounded the troops fell in and the column left the place  then occurred a scene which astonished him not a little  no sooner were the troops out of sight than the bulgarian population rising en masse fell upon their turkish brethren and maltreated them terribly they did not indeed murder them but they pillaged and burned some of their houses and behaved altogether in a wild and savage manner lancey could not understand it  perhaps if he had known that these bulgarians had for many years suffered horrible oppression and contemptuous treatment from the turks under whose misrule they lay he might have felt less surprise though he might not have justified the act of revenge  if it be true that the worm turns on the foot that crushes it surely it is no matter of wonder that human beings who have long been debased defrauded and demoralised should turn and bite somewhat savagely when opportunity offers  it had occurred to lancey when the russians had arrived that it would be well for him to descend and join these troops so as to get out of his present predicament but remembering that he had actually accepted service with the turks and that being clothed in a semiturkish costume he might be taken for a spy he resolved to remain where he was  the riot in the village after the russian column had left confirmed him in his intention to remain quiet  your wisest plan jacob he soliloquised is to old on and bide your time  dont urry yourself on any account  scarcely had he made this resolve when looking through his hole of observation he observed a body of spearmen galloping along the road that led to the village  the inhabitants also observed them with some anxiety for by that time they had come to know the difference between regular and irregular troops  the horsemen proved to be cossacks  the bulgarians of course regarded them as friends  they formed a portion of the army of deliverers from turkish misrule  as such they were received with cheers  the cheers were returned heartilyin some cases mingled with laughterby the gay cavaliers who had also come to make requisitions  their mode of proceeding however was quite different from that of their regular brethren  leaping from their saddles they set about the business without delay  some went to the fields and cut grain for fodder others entered the houses and carried off victuals and wine while many chased and caught pigs and poultry  they were evidently in a hurry  so much so that they had no time to put off in making payment  it was obviously to be regarded as an outstanding debt against them by the villagers  as the rearguard passed out of the place the corporal in command observed a fat young pig in the middle of a byroad  he turned aside sharply charged picked the pig neatly up on the point of his lance and galloped after his friends accompanied by a tune that would have done credit to a scotch bagpipe  all this did lancey see from his secret point of observation and deeply did his philosophic mind moralise on what he saw  the village in which he had sought shelter was in the very heart of the district swept by the wave of war  the panorama of incidents commenced to move again at an early hour  when morning light had just begun to conquer night lancey was once more awakened from a refreshing sleep by a noise in the room below  he looked down and saw an old old woman with bent form tottering step and wrinkled brow  she was searching for something which evidently she could not find  scraping various things however and tasting the ends of her thin fingers suggested that she was in search of food lancey was a sympathetic soul  the old womans visage reminded him of his own motherdead and gone for many a day but fresh and beautiful as ever in the memory of her son  he descended at once  the old woman had flung herself down in despair in a corner of the hovel  lancey quickly emptied the remnants of food in his wallet into her lap  it would have saddened you reader to have seen the way in which that poor old thing hungrily munched a mouthful of the broken victuals without asking questions though she glanced her gratitude out of a pair of large black eyes while she tied up the remainder in a kerchief with trembling haste  no doubt soliloquised lancey as he sat on a stool and watched her you were a pretty gal once an somebody loved you  it did not occur to lancey for his philosophy was not deep that she might have been loved more than once even although she had not been a pretty gal neither did it occur to himfor he did not knowthat she was loved still by an old old man in a neighbouring hut whose supper had been carried off by the cossacks and whose welfare had induced her to go out in search of food  while the two were thus engaged their attention was attracted by a noise outside  hastening to the door lancey peeped out and beheld a band of bashibazouks galloping up the road  the turks of the village began to hold up their heads again for they regarded these as friends but scant was the courtesy they received from them  to dismount and pillage and to slay where the smallest opposition was offered seemed the order of the day with these miscreants  for some time none of them came near to the hut where lancey and the old woman were concealed as it stood in an outoftheway corner and escaped notice  while the robbers were busy a wild cheer accompanied by shots and cries was heard some distance along the road  the bashibazouks heard it and fled  a few minutes later lancey saw turkish soldiers running into the village in scattered groups but stopping to fire as they ran like men who fight while they retreat  immediately after there was a rush of men and a column of turkish infantry occupied the village in force  they were evidently hard pressed for the men ran and acted with that quick nervous energy which denotes imminent danger  they swarmed into the houses dashed open the windows knocked out loopholes in the walls and kept up a furious fusillade while whistling balls came back in reply and laid many of them low  one party of turks at last made a rush to the hut where lancey sat with the old woman  there was no weapon of any sort in the hut and as lanceys arms had been taken from him when he was captured he deemed it the wisest policy to sit still  leaping in with a rush the turks shut and barred the door  they saw lancey but had evidently no time to waste on him  the windowframe was dashed out with riflebutts and quick firing was commenced by some while others made loopholes in the mud walls with their bayonets bullets came pinging through the window and brought down masses of plaster from the walls  suddenly a terrible yell rang in the little room and the commander of the party raising both hands above him dropped his sword and fell with a terrible crash  he put a hand to his side and writhed on the floor in agony while blood flowed copiously from his wound  the poor fellows pain lasted but a moment or two  his head fell back suddenly and the face became ashy pale while his glaring eyeballs were transfixed in death  no notice was taken of this except by a man who sat down on the floor beside his dead commander to bandage his own wounded arm  before he had finished his task a shout from his comrades told that danger approached  immediately the whole party rushed out of the hut by a back door  at the same instant the front door was burst open and a soldier leaped in  it was evident to lancey that in the midst of smoke and turmoil a mistake had been made for the man who appeared was not a russian but a turk  he was followed by several companions  casting a savage piercing look on lancey and apparently not feeling sure from his appearance whether he was friend or foe the man presented his rifle and fired  the ball grazed lanceys chest and entering the forehead of the old woman scattered her brains on the wall  for one moment lancey stood horrorstruck then uttered a roar of rage rose like a giant in his wrath and seized a rifle which had been dropped by one of the fugitive soldiers  in an instant the bayonet was deep in the chest of his adversary  wrenching it out he swung the rile round and brought the butt down on the skull of the man behind which it crushed in like an eggshell  staggered by the fury of the onslaught those in rear shrank back  lancey charged them and drove them out pellmell  finding the bayonet in his way he wrenched it off and clubbing the rifle laid about him with it as if it had been a walkingcane  there can be no question that insanity bestows temporary and almost supernatural power  lancey was for the time insane  every sweep of the rifle stretched a man on the ground  there was a wavering band of turks around him  the cheers of victorious russians were ringing in their ears  bullets were whizzing and men were falling  shelter was urgently needful  little wonder then that one tall sturdy madman should drive a whole company before him  the russians saw him as they came on and cheered encouragingly  he replied with savage laughter and in another moment the turks were flying before him in all directions  then lancey stopped let the butt of his rifle drop leaned against the corner of a burning house and drew his left hand across his brow  some passing russians clapped him on the back and cheered as they ran on to continue the bloody work of ameliorating the condition of the bulgarian christians  nearly the whole village was in flames by that time  from the windows of every house that could yet be held a continuous fire was kept up the russians replied to it from the streets rushing in little bands from point to point where shelter could be found so as to escape from the withering shower of lead  daring men with apparently charmed lives ran straight up in the face of the enemy sending death in advance of them as they ran  others piling brushwood on a cart pushed the mass before them for the double purpose of sheltering themselves and of conveying combustibles to the door of the chief house of the town to which most of the inhabitants with a company of turks had retired  but the brushwood proved a poor defence for many of those who stooped behind it as they ran suddenly collapsed and dropped as men are wont to do when hit in the brain  still a few were left to push the cart forward  smoke disconcerted the aim of the defenders to some extent and terror helped to make the firing wild and noneffective  against the townhouse of the village some of the russians had already drawn themselves up so flat and close that the defenders at the windows could not cover them with their rifles  these ran out ever and anon to fire a shot and returned to reload  meanwhile the brushwood was applied to the door and set on fire amid yells of fiendish joy  lancey had followed the crowd almost mechanically  he had no enemyno object  the turk as it happened was for the time being his friend  the muscovite was not and never had been his foe  after the first deadly burst of his fury on seeing the innocent old woman massacred had passed his rage lost all point  but he could not calm his quivering nerves or check the fierce flow of his boiling blood  onward he went with the shouting cheering yelling and cursing crowd of soldiery his clothes cut in many places with bullets though flesh and bone were spared  close to the townhouse stood the dwelling of the turk who had released him and shown him hospitality when he was seized by the inhabitants the door of the house was being burst open by clubbed rifles  the memory of a helping hand however slight was sufficient to give direction to the rage of the madman for such he still undoubtedly was at the momentlike many another man who had become sane enough the following day when the musterroll was called  up to that moment he had been drifting before the gale  he now seized the helm of his rage and upsetting two or three of the men who stood in his way soon drew near to the front  as he came forward the door gave way  a tremendous discharge of firearms laid low every man in advance but of what avail is it to slay hundreds when thousands press on in rear  lancey sprang over the dead and was met by the points of half a dozen bayonetsthe foremost man being his deliverer with the black beard  grounding his rifle with a crash and holding up his left hand he shouteda friend  at the same moment he was thrown down and leaped over by the soldiers behind who were stabbed by the turks and fell on him  but lancey staggered again to his feet and using his superior strength to push aside and crush through those in front he gained an empty passage before the others did and rushed along towards a door at the end of it  opening the door and entering he was arrested by the sight of a beautiful turkish girl who stood gazing at him in horror  before he had time to speak or act a door at the other end of the room opened and the turk with the black beard entered sword in hand  the girl rushed into his arms with a cry of joy  but this was changed into alarm as the turk flung her off and ran at lancey  there was no time for explanation  the russians were already heard coming along the passage by which he had reached the apartment  lancey felt intuitively that a brave man would not stab him in the back instead of defending himself he dropped his rifle turned and hastily shut and bolted the door then turning towards the turk held aloft his unarmed hands  the turk was quick to understand  he nodded and assisted his ally to barricade the door with furniture so that no one could force a passage for a considerable time  then they ran to the other door which had not yet been menaced  they were almost too late for shouts and tramping feet were heard approaching  lancey caught up his rifle stepped out of the room shut the door and locking it on the turk and his daughter commenced to pace calmly up and down in front of it like a sentinel  another moment and the russians rushed up but halted and looked surprised on beholding a sentinel there who did not even condescend to stop in his slow measured march or to bring his arms to the charge to stop them  one of them advanced to the door but lancey grasped his waist with one hand gently almost remonstratively and shook his head  as the man persisted lancey gave him a throw which was peculiarly cornish in its characterhe slewed his hip round under the russians groin and hurled him back heels over head amongst his comrades after which feat he resumed the sedate march of a sentinel  by this time he had been recognised as the man who had routed a whole turkish company and was greeted with a laugh and a loud cheer as the men turned away and ran to effect some other work of destruction  now my fine fellow said lancey opening the door and entering youll ave to defend yourself for im neither a friend o the turk nor the rooshian  theyre fools if not worse both of em in my opinion but one good turn desarves another so now you an i are quits adoo  hurrying out of the house lancey picked up a russian cap and greatcoat as he ran and put them on having a vague perception that they might help to prevent his being made prisoner  he was right  at all events in the confusion of the moment he passed through the village and escaped unnoticed into a neighbouring thicket whence he succeeded in retiring altogether beyond the range of the assailed position    chapter seventeen  in which some desperate enterprises are undertaken  at this time the russians had taken up a strong position in the balkan mountain range and entrenched themselves within a short distance of the enemy  after a night and a day of aimless wandering jacob lancey found himself at last in a rocky defile between the hostile lines  how he got there he could not tell but there he was in a position of imminent danger with the sentinels of the belligerent armies on either side of him  evening was setting in when he made this discovery and recoiled happily without having been seen into a narrow rocky place where the fastfailing light had already deepened into gloom  a cold white fog was slowly creeping up from the valleys and covering the hillsides  it is in such places and circumstances that men conceive and execute designs which according to their nature are deeds of recklessness or of heroism  two such ventures were afoot that night  in the russian camp preparations were being made for a night attack on a village in possession of the turks and out of which with a view to future movements it was deemed necessary to drive them  in this village there dwelt a youth an intimate friend of dobri petroff  the two had played with each other in childhood had roamed about the country together in boyhood and when they reached mans estate had become faster friends than ever being bound by the ties of intellectual as well as physical sympathy  when this friend petko borronow left yenilik at the death of his mother it was to take charge of the little farm in the balkan mountainsthe desolate home where his sister giuana an invalid and a beautiful girl was now left in solitude  in his capacity of scout petroff was always in the neighbourhood of headquarters and was frequently summoned to the tent of the general commanding to be interrogated  thus he chanced to overhear occasional remarks and hints which when pieced together by his intelligent mind showed him pretty clearly what was pending  he sat by the campfire that night buried in meditation with a series of troubled wrinkles on a brow that was usually open and unclouded many a time did he light his pipe and forget to smoke it and relight it and again let it die out until his comrades were impressed by his absence of mind  well did the scout know by that time the certain fate of a village which was to be fought for by contending armies  to warn his friend borronow in time to remove his sister from the doomed village became to the scout a duty which must be performed at all hazards but how to do this without deserting his post and appearing to go over to the enemy was the difficulty  something troubles you said his young friend andre vanovitch who had for some time sat smoking quietly at his side gazing into the fire and thinking no doubt of the girl with the auburn hair far away in the land of the muscove  yes im troubled about friends was the scouts laconic answer  oh theyre all right you may be sure now that our fellows have crossed the danube in such force said andre supposing that the other referred to his family  perhaps returned petroff and relapsed into silence  suddenly it occurred to him that he had overheard some expression among the officers around the general of a desire to know more particularly about the disposition of the turkish force and the suggestion that a spy should be sent out  his brow cleared at once with almost a triumphant look on his countenance he turned sharply to andre and seized his arm  well dobri said the latter with a smile and look of surprise i have had perfect faith in the strength of your grip without requiring positive proof  listen said the scout earnestly  i have a job to do and a risk to run  that is obvious to every one in the division returned andre with a touch of the smile still curling his young moustache  ay but i mean a private job and a great riskthe risk of being shot as a traitor or a spy and i want you andre to clear my character with the russians if it fares ill with me  petroffs unwonted energy of action and earnestness of look and tone produced their effect on the young dragoon  he listened intently while his friend told him of his intended plan  but why go into the enemys lines without permission objected andre why risk being thought a deserter when you have only to go and ask leave  it seems to me they would be only too glad to accept your services as a spy  im not certain that they would accept them replied the scout with a return of the perplexed look and if they chanced to refuse leave my case would be hopeless because i could not and would not dare to act in opposition to positive orders whereas if i go off without leave i shall only be blamed for undertaking a foolish or reckless act that is if i return in safety  if i dont return at all it wont matter what is said or done but i should count on you andre explaining that i did not desert  but returned andre if you merely go to warn and save your friends i think the general wont think much of your spying  you do me injustice lad said petroff quietly  i shall enter the enemys lines as a real spy  i will visit every point of his position ascertain the number of his troops count his guns and bring in such information as will make the general wink i hope at my having acted without orders  it would please me better to go with permission but i cannot allow the lives of my friends to hang upon the chance humour of a russian general  you must remember andre that i am not a russian soldier and may therefore take upon me to exercise a little more personal liberty than you can  why you know continued the scout with a touch of humour in his glance as he rose and made some preliminary preparations i might refuse to lead you russians or might lead you to your destruction  you would be shot if you did returned the dragoon quietly  and what if i am willing to be shot in a good cause  i should be no greater hero than every man in your armies  but now andre one more shake of your hand  we may never meet again and i wont part without saying ive taken a fancy to you  god knows i can truly say the same to you cried andre leaping up with enthusiasm and seizing the scouts hand with a grasp as powerful as his own  and dont be angry added petroff in a gentle tone as he tightened his belt if i again urge you to keep the locket always in remembrance youre not likely ever to forget the auburn hair but you may lad you may for there is no perfection in this world and soldiering is a dangerous life  andre smiled halfcontemptuously  he felt that the advice was needless  petroff also smiled kindly for he knew that it might be needful  neither of these men was very deeply impressed with the fact that keeping before the mental eye the maker of the auburn hair and of all other blessed human influences was a better and safer refuge  but what matter  does not our creator in all his dealings make use of means does he not lead us step by step from a lower to a higher level  there are no readymade human angels in this life male or female with fullgrown wings to bear them over the troubles of earth to a state of sudden sanctification  we are in a rebel world and when lifted from the pit by a saviours hand the steps by which the spirit of god leads us upwards are numerous as well as varied including sometimesi write without irreverencesuch footholds as auburn hair  disguised as a bulgarian rustic dobri petroff left the russian camp passed the outposts and under cover of the fog gained the neutral ground between the two armies  of course the sentries on both sides were numerous as well as vigilant especially so on such a night  it therefore behoved him to advance with extreme caution  creeping from mound to rock and bush to knoll he reached a small clump of bushes into which he entered for the purpose of resting a few minutes and considering well his future movements  a thrill of excitement ran through his frame when he discovered that he was not alone in this thicket  a man sat there leaning against a tree as if asleep  the scout crouched and drew a revolver  a moment sufficed to show that his arrival had not been observed  no wonder for his approach had been like that of a cat  he was now in great perplexity  the man was evidently not a sentinel of either belligerentthat was plain but it was equally plain that he was armed to shoot him would be impossible without putting the sentries of both sides on the alert  to pass him in so small a thicket without attracting attention would be difficult  to draw back would necessitate a long detour involving loss of precious time and increase of risk  a thought occurred to him  many a time had he hunted among these mountains and well accustomed was he to glide with serpentine caution towards his game  he would stalk him  petroff seldom thought twice in cases of emergency  he unbuckled his sword quietly and hung it on a branch and leant his carbine against a tree resolving to trust to his great personal strength alone for he did not mean to sacrifice life if he could avoid it  in case of being driven to extremity his knife and revolver would suffice  then sinking down until he became lost among the deep shadows of bush and brake he began the slow laborious and silent process of gliding towards his unconscious victim  this was one of those ventures to which we have referred as being afoot on that foggy night  the other venture had some points of similarity to it though the end in view was different  let us turn aside for a little to the turkish camp  there round one of the watchfires a considerable distance to the rear stood a group of turkish soldiers chatting and smoking  although not so noisy as the russians round their campfires these turks were by no means taciturn  there was a touch now and then of dry humour in the remarks of some and a sedate chuckle occasionally  among them stood eskiwin and his resuscitated friend ali bobo  the latter although not naturally boastful had been so nettled by a big comrade underrating his courage and muscular power in regard to which latter he bobo was rather vain that he vowed he would prove both by going to the front and bringing in singlehanded a live russian sentinel  the big comrade laughed contemptuously whereupon ali bobo rose to carry out his threat but was warned by his mates of the danger of being shot by his own commander for going on such an errand without leave  bobo replied that his captain would forgive him when he presented his russian prisoner  as it was clear that the angry little man was in earnest his friend eskiwin vowed he would go with him and the big comrade agreed to regard the deed as a sufficient proof of ali bobos strength and prowess if a russian should be brought in by the two of them  bobo would have preferred to go alone but eskiwin would take no denial  accordingly the two adventurous fellows went off and were soon lost in the fog  in a short time they reached the front and began to move with excessive caution in order to pass their own sentries unobserved  ali bobo it must be remarked had not originated this idea of stalking sentinels  some albanians in the army had already done so with great success but these ferocious murderers had done it for the mere pleasure of killing their enemies without any other end in view  their method was to creep towards a wearied sentinel which they did with comparative ease being expert mountaineers  each man on reaching his victim sprang on him from behind clapped a hand on his mouth crushed his neck after the manner of garrotters with his strong left arm and drawing a long keen knife thrust it into his heart  but our adventurers had no such murderous design as this  to capture a live russian was their aim  the front reached and the turkish line of sentries safely passed in the fog they came unexpectedly on two russian horsemen who were cautiously riding towards the turkish lines  these horsemen were sergeant gotsuchakoff and corporal shoveloff  they had been visiting the outposts and before returning were making a little private reconnaissance of the enemys disposition for gotsuchakoff and shoveloff were enthusiasts in their way and fond of adventure  the ground at the spot being much broken and affording facility for concealment especially to men on foot eskiwin and ali bobo crept unseen upon a low cliff and lay down behind a mass of rocks  the russians chanced to select the same spot as a point of observation but instead of riding to the top of the eminence where they would have been rather conspicuous they rode under the cliff and halted just belownot far distant from the spot where the turks lay so that eskiwin craning his long neck over the rocks could look down on the helmets of the russian cavaliers  for some minutes the sergeant and corporal conversed in whispers  this was exceedingly tantalising to the friends above  the hiss of their voices could be distinctly heard  eskiwins long arm could almost have reached them with a lance  presently the corporal rode slowly away became dim in the fog and finally disappeared while the sergeant remained immoveable like an equestrian statue  this whispered ali bobo solemnly is more than i can stand  eskiwin whispered in reply that he would have to stand it whether he could or not  bobo didnt agree with him not an unusual condition of mind with friends  he looked round  a huge stone lay at his elbow  it seemed to have been placed there on purpose  he rose very slowly lifted the stone held it in a position which is familiar to scotch highlanders and hurled it with tremendous force down on the head of sergeant gotsuchakoff  the sergeant bowed to circumstances  without even a cry he tumbled off his horse and laid his helmet in the dust  the turks leaped down seized him in their powerful arms and carried him away while the frightened horse bolted  it followed probably an animal instinct and made for the russian lines  the corporal chanced to return at that moment  the turks dropped their burden and lay flat down beside it  seeing that his friend was gone and hearing the clatter of his retreating charger corporal shoveloff put spurs to his steed and followed  the turks then rose tied the legs of the sergeant with his own swordbelt lest he should recover inopportunely and bore him to a neighbouring thicket which loomed darkly through the fog  fate smiles upon us whispered ali bobo as the comrades entered the bushes and laid their burden down  if bobo had known that he had laid that burden down within ten yards of the spot where dobri petroff was preparing as i have described to stalk the figure he had discovered in the same thicket he might have recalled the sentiment in reference to fate  but bobo did not know  suddenly however he discovered the figure that petroff was stalking it was leaning against a tree  he pointed it out to eskiwin while the scout interrupted in his plans sank into darkness and watched the result with much curiosity and some impatience  just then the figure roused itself with a heavy sigh looked sleepily round and remarking in an undertone its an orrible sitooation turned itself into a more comfortable position and dropped off again with another sigh  but ali bobo did not allow it to enjoy repose  he glided forward and with a spring like that of a cat laid his hand upon its mouth and threw it violently to the ground  with the aid of eskiwin he pinned it and then proceeded to gag it  all this dobri petroff observed with much interest not unmingled with concern for he perceived that the newcomers were turks and did not like the idea of seeing a man murdered before his eyes  but the thought of his friend petko borronow and what he had at stake restrained him from action  he was however at once relieved by observing that while the short turk kneeled on the prisoners chest and kept his mouth covered so as to prevent his crying out the tall turk quickly tied his legs and hands  it was thus clear that immediate death was not intended  the scouts interest to say nothing of surprise was increased by what followed  when the short turk pointing a revolver at the prisoners head removed his hand so as to admit of speech that prisoners first utterance was an exclamation of astonishment in tones which were familiar to petroffs ear  this was followed by exclamations of recognition from the turks and the short man seizing one of victims tied hands shook it warmly  at that moment the scouts eyes were opened still wider with amazement for the unfortunate sergeant gotsuchakoffwho as i have said had been laid down a few yards from him and whom he had almost forgottenbegan to recover consciousness and growled something in an undertone about its being far too soon to turn out  petroff recognised the wellknown growl of the sergeant  in an instant he glided to his side laid his hand on his mouth and whispered  gotsuchakoff be still for your life  i am dobri petroff  do you understand  he looked close to the sergeants eyes and saw that he was understood at once he removed his hand and untied the belt which fastened the sergeants feet  gotsuchakoff was too well used to wars alarms to give way to unreasonable curiosity  he instantly perceived that the scout required of him the utmost circumspection for some reason or other and in the spirit of a true soldier awaited orders in total silence ready for prompt action  this was well because there was little time to spare  when petroff directed the sergeants attention to the turks they were busy undoing the bonds of their prisoner  without saying another word the scout glided swiftly forward  he was promptly followed by the sergeant  next moment both men leaped on the turks and had them by their throats  eskiwin was no match for gotsuchakoff who bore him back and held him like a vice  as for ali bobo strong though he was he felt himself to be a perfect baby in the grasp of the scout  the two men submitted at once and while petroff ordered them in a low tone to keep silence enforcing the order with the touch of a revolvers muzzle the sergeant quickly bound their arms behind them  the scout turned to the prisoner who was sitting on the ground with eyes dilated to the uttermost and mouth wide open  he sat perfectly speechless  there was just light enough to make darkness visible  petroff looked close in to the face of the man whom he had been about to stalk  lancey he exclaimed  dobri peterhuff gasped the other  why where did you come from asked the scout in turkish which he was aware lancey had been attempting to learn  dobri my friend replied the other solemnly in english if this is a dream it is the most houtrageous dream that ive ad since i was a babby  but im used to em nowonly i do wish it was morning  the scout smiled not because of what was said which of course he did not understand but because of the englishmans expression  but time pressed too much had already been lost  he therefore contented himself by giving lancey a friendly slap on the shoulder and turned to the sergeant  gotsuchakoff said he im out on special service and have already been delayed too long  this man pointing to lancey is an englishman and a friendremember that  the others are turks  you know what to do with them  i cannot help you but you wont need help  just so replied gotsuchakoff with an intelligent nod only lend a hand to tie them together and then be off about your business  lancey said ali bobo while the operation was being performed zat big bulgar beast he say yous his friend  big he is a beast hes not and a friend he was replied lancey with a dazed look  further conversation was cut short by the sergeant ordering the trio to move on  he led them towards the russian lines by a cord passed round bobos neck and carried a revolver in his right hand  dobri petroff immediately disappeared in the opposite direction  at a later hour that night he entered the cottage of young borronow giuana petkos sister reclined on a rude but comfortable couch  she was singularly pretty and innocentlooking but very delicate and young her friends called her formosa giuana or pretty jane  petko had been seated beside her talking about the war when his friend entered with a quick stealthy motion and laid a hand on his shoulder  dobri exclaimed the youth  petko there is danger at hand  mischief is in the air  time is precious  i may not say what it is but you know mei am not easily alarmed  you must promise me to quit this village with your sister within one hour  but dobri whywhat  petko no questions  more than that no remarks interrupted the scout earnestly and firmly  another time i will explain  at present i ask you to trust believe and obey your friend  if you would save your life and that of giuana leave this village within an hour  go where you will but leave it  i will both trust and obey you dobri said petko returning the squeeze of his friends hand which he had not yet let go  i said that time pressed petko god be with you  farewell  the scout turned stooped to kiss giuana on her pale cheek and before either could utter another word was gone  by midnight dobri petroff had made his roundsnow as a carter gruffly and clumsily driving a cart and horse of which he had managed to possess himself anon as a stupid countryman belonging to the village on the height noisily wanting to know why the turks had robbed him of the said cart and horse which he had conveniently tipped over a precipice and vowing that he would carry his complaint against the army to the sultan himself once he was fain to act the part of a drunk man almost incapable of taking care of himself  during his perambulations he ran frequent risk of being shot by irascible bashibazouks or wearied albanians was more than once looked on with suspicion and frequently suffered rough treatment but he acted his part well  nothing could draw from him a word or look beyond average intelligence  no indignity could rouse him to more than the warfare of abuse and the result was that long before dawn he found himself once more close to the front  but fortune seemed inclined to fail him here  he was creeping cautiously among a heap of rocks when a sentinel of the advanced line of the turks discovered and challenged him  petroff knew well that escape by running would be impossible for he was only six yards distant  he made therefore no reply but sank on the ground keeping his eye however sharply on the advancing sentinel  his only cause of anxiety was that the turk might fire at him in which case his doom would have been sealed  the turk however preferred to advance and thrust his bayonet into him  petroff had calculated on and was prepared for this  he caught the bayonet and checked its progress between his ribs  another moment and the turk lay on his back with the stock of his own rifle broken over his skull  the scuffle had attracted the next sentry who ran to his comrades assistance  the scout instantly made the best use of his legs  he was as fleet as a mountain deer but the rifleball was fleeter  he felt a sharp pain in his left arm and almost fell  the alarm was given  sentries on both sides fired and another bullet grazed his temple causing blood to flow freely down his face  still he ran steadily on and in a few minutes was safe within the russian lines  he was seized of course by those who first met him and not being known to them was at once carried before a captain of dragoons who knew him  by the captain he was sent to the tent of the generalthe younger skobeleffto whom he related the important information which he had obtained at so great risk  thank you my fine fellow said the general when petroff had finished you have done good serviceare you badly wounded  nonothing worth mentioning replied the scout but as he spoke a feeling of giddiness oppressed him  he fainted and fell as he left the generals tent and was carried on a stretcher to the rear  before the grey dawn had dissipated the mists of morning the village on the height was fought for lost and won its dwellings were reduced to ashes and those of its inhabitants who had escaped massacre were scattered like sheep among the gorges of their native hills but petko and giuana borronow were safeat least for the timewith a kinsman among the higher heights of the balkan range    chapter eighteen  treats of one of our great ironclads  while these stirring events were taking place among the mountains i had made arrangements to quit the hospitals at sistova and proceed with a detachment of russian troops to the front  the evening before my departure i received a most unexpected and interesting letter from my friend u biquitous the effects of which were so surprising and i may add unparalleled that i cannot forbear quoting it  after a few of those sage reflections in which biquitous is prone to indulge he went on to say    you will be surprised to hear that there is some probability of my   meeting you shortly as i have become a special correspondent like   yourself  my paper however is an illustrated one an irish weekly   of some merit named the evergreen isle which will now it is   expected advance to the front rank of such periodicals  i purpose   using the pencil as well as the pen and unlike you and subject to   no restrictions of any kind  i have carteblanche in fact to draw   what i like write what i please go where i feel inclined stay as   long as i may and quit when i must  veracity is no object  i am   told to keep as many servants and as large a retinue as i find   convenient and to spare no expense  for the duties of this situation   i am to receive no salary but am at liberty to pay my own expenses   the honour of the thing is deemed more than sufficient compensation    in virtue of this appointment i went recently to see and take notes   of her majestys famous ironclad turretship the thunderer   knowing how much you are interested in the navy of england i will   relate a little of what i saw premising how ever that although   strict veracity is not required of me i am as you know a man of   principle and therefore impose it on myself so that whatever i say   in this letter in regard to this splendid manofwar may be relied on   as absolutely true    well then the gallant captain of the thunderer who is said to be   one of the best disciplinarians in the service and to have done many   a deed of daring in the course of his adventurous career received me   very kindly  he is every inch a sailor and as there are full   seventythree inches of him i may be excused for styling him a   splendid specimen  in consequence of my being a friend of a friend of   his the captain invited me to spend several days on board  during my   stay i inhabited the captains fighting cabinand this by the   way reminds me that i was introduced to a young lieutenant on board   named firebrand who says he met you not long ago at portsmouth and   mortally offended your mother by talking to her about the   thunderers crinoline  the fighting cabin is so styled because it   may be inhabited in safety while the ship is in action being within   the ships tremendous armour plating  in times of peace the captain   occupies a large handsome cabin on the deck which although made of   iron capable of resisting winds and waves and beautifully furnished   is nevertheless liable to be swept bodily into the sea if hit by the   giant shot of modern days  a corresponding cabin on the port side of   the ship constitutes the wardroom  this also might be blown to   atoms with the officers and all their belongings if a shell were to   drop into it  but the officers also have places of refuge below while   in action    a large proportion of what meets the eye above the waterline of this   ironclad and looks solid enough is of this comparatively flimsy   build not meant to resist shot or shell willing as it were to be   blown away if the enemy can manage it though proof against   riflebullets  there is a huge central erection styled the flying   or hurricane deck from which enormous davits project with several   boats pendent therefrom  out of this flying structure rise the great   iron mastwith a staircase inside leading to the topand the two   smokefunnels of the engines  in the heart of it rises the fighting   tower an armoured core as it were from which the captain and   officers may survey the aspect of affairs while fighting steer and   by means of electricity etcetera work the monster guns of the ship   if all the flimsy work about the vessel were blown into the sea her   vitality would not be affected though her aspect would indeed be   mightily changed for the worse but the thunderer in her entirety   with her lowarmoured hull her central fightingtower her   invulnerable turrets with their two 35ton and two 38ton guns and   all her armament and men would still be there as able and ready for   action as ever    very simply yet very tastefully arranged did the captains fighting   cabin seem to me as i lay down on its narrow but comfortable bed the   first night of my visit and looked around me  besides a commodious   little chest of drawers there were on one wall telescopes swords   and naval caps on another a compact library  above my head   stretching diagonally across the bed was an object which caused me no   little surprise and much speculation  in appearance it resembled a   giant flute with finger holes that no man of mortal mould could have   covered  not till next morning did i discover that this tube was part   of a system of airdistributing pipes supplied by fanners worked by   steam whereby fresh air is driven to every part of the vessel    so said i to myself turning to the prettilypainted wall at my   side and giving it a slight tap the proverbial twoinch plank   between me and death is here increased to somewhere about thirty   inches    in this soliloquy i referred to the thunderers armourplates of   from ten to twelve inches thick which are affixed to a timber backing   of eighteen inches in two layers  with such a backing of solid   comfort between me and death i felt soothed and dropped asleep    it was saturday night  on sunday morning i was awakened by a rushing   of water so furious that i fancied the sea must have proved more than   a match for the 12inch armour and 18inch backing but a moment or   two of attentive reflection relieved me  your friend firebrands   voice was audible  i listened  he muttered something and yawned   vociferously then muttered againsplendpropnsayiaou    splendid proportions he resumed again after a pause during which   the rush of water became more alarming sundry gasps and much hard   breathing being mingled with itmagnificent continued firebrand   in the low calm tone of a contemplative connoisseur couldnt have   believed it if i hadnt seen it  quite herculean    from all this i came gradually to understand that some of the   officers were performing their morning ablutions with sponge and   towel while firebrand was looking languidly over the edge of his   hammock indulging in a critical commentary    just then i was surprised to hear a muffled thunderous bang  it was   the big drum and next moment the ships band announced itself with   a single bar excellently played of god save the queen    every sunday i found was begun by a careful and minute inspection   of the crew and ship  after breakfast the captain followed by all   his chief officers went through every hole and corner of the mighty   iron fabric  i followed in his wake  at first the thought did not   occur to me but after all was over it struck me that this act was   somewhat appropriate to the day  the great thunderer had as it   were gone into a condition of introspection    it was a species of selfexamination on the part of the great   warship through the medium of its mindthe captain  here was the   father of a tremendously large family going the rounds on sunday   morning to observe whether his moral precepts and personal example   during the week had been attended with appropriate resultsto see   that his boys were neat and clean and ready for church and that   they had arranged their rooms before breakfast    first of all the men were mustered by bugle on the upper deck   marines on one side bluejackets on the other  then we walked slowly   along the front ranks and down the rear with critical eyes  i   observed a crooked collar the captain observed it too and put it   straight i saw an illputon belt the captain also saw it pointed   and referred to it in an undertone  a hole in a pair of trousers i   did not observe but the captain saw it and commented on it in a   somewhat severer manner  nothing was passed over  every brawny   powerful broadshouldered bluejacket there was in nautical   phraseology overhauled from stem to stern  a comment here a word of   approval there or a quiet reprimand was all that passed but being   uttered to the attentive ears of the responsible officers this was   sufficient  after inspection the men were dismissed and the captain   with his following descended to the interior of the ship  it would   take reams of paper my dear jeffry to refer to all that was said and   done  i must give you but a brief outline  we went along the sides   of the vessel where the arms were ranged and any speck of rust or   appearance of careless treatment of the polished and glittering   weapons was noted and the responsible officer called then and there   to account  so was it in every department  the thunderer lies low   as i have said much of her is below water therefore light is scarce   and valuable  during our perambulation we came to some machinery and   bulkheads etcetera which were dingy in colour  paint them white   said the captain to the officer of each department i dont point out   details but use as much white paint as you can  it makes the ship   look light and cheerful  every order given was emphatic yet   considerate given to the officer in whose department the hitch   occurred and retailed by him to subordinates who knew well that they   would come to grief if they did not make a note of it  many of the   departments were so well managed that no fault at all could be   found and it was evident that the captain in such cases found a   pleasure in giving honour to whom honour was due    some men said firebrand who chanced to be close to me and to   whom i commented on the advantage of thorough obedience some men   however carry this quality a little too far  i knew of a man once   named billy ewart who prided himself greatly on the care with which   he fulfilled every part of his duty so that it was impossible for the   strictest disciplinarian to find fault with him  he had charge of the   main deck  one day the admiral inspected the ship and took occasion   to praise billy ewart for cleaning so well the main deck and   everything connected with it  the only dirty things i see he said   pointing to a hencoop are the legs of your geese  this was of   course a joke but it preyed on billys mind and at next inspection   he had the geese whitewashed and their legs and bills blackleaded   poor billy had no peace after that even at the theatres when he   chanced to be observed there by his mates one would call to another   i say jack who whitewashed the geese    as firebrand concluded we had completed the inspection of the main   deck and descended to the lower deck where the men lived and messed   and where a clean and trim bluejacketcook of the mess for the   daystood at the head of each table  the tables and cans and tins   and platters and men were required to be as clean and bright as a new   pin  then on we went to the berth of the warrantofficers and after   that down still lower to the engineroom  there the chief engineer   came to the front and became responsible for the mighty cranks and   gigantic cylinders and aweinspiring beams and complicated mazes of   machinery which raised him in my mind to little short of a   demigodfor you must know that i like yourself am full of   admiration and ignorance in regard to engineering forces  next we   went to the lowest depths of all among the boilers which appeared to   me like an avenuea positive street sirin pandemonium  it was   here that the tremendous explosion occurred in july 1876 when upwards   of forty men were killed and many wounded the captain himself who   was in the engineroom at the time having narrowly escaped   suffocation  thereafter the magazines of shot and shell were   visited and in short every hole and corner of the ship and thus in   an hour or so it was ascertained that the nelsonian demand and   englands expectation had been fulfilledevery man had done his   duty and the great ironclad was pronounced to be in a healthy   sabbatic state of mind and body    in this satisfactory frame we finally went to the fore part of the   ship where we found the crew assembled and where standing at the   capstan the captain read the church of england service the responses   being effectively rendered by the stalwart crew  in regard to this   service i will only remark that i observed the introduction of a   prayer which was entirely new to me namely that for the blessing of   god on the ship its crew its duties and its destination to which i   could and did with all heartiness respond amen because as long as   gods blessing rests on the thunderer she will not be sent out to do   battle in an unrighteous cause    next morning i had an opportunity of witnessing the biggun turret   drill    it was an imposing spectacle a fine display of the power of mind   over matter  force might weight appeared to have attained their   culminating exemplification here and yet the captain said to me that   his 35ton and 38ton guns are mere pistols to the things which are   being prepared for vessels of our navy yet to come    my dear fellow do you know what a 38ton gun means  have you ever   seen one  can you appreciate the fact that its weight is equal to   thirtyeight carts of coals  did you ever see the powder with which   it is fed  one grain of it was given to me as a great favour by the   chief gunners matei think that is his correct title but am not   quite sure  he presented it in a cardboard box  i now send you its   portrait    facsimile of a grain of powder for the 38ton guns of the   thundereractual size    here it is as large as lifereally so without a touch of   exaggeration  i have measured it carefully with a tape footrule and   i find the dimensions to be five inches and a quarter in   circumference    it is a solid cube of gunpowder  the cartridge which holds this   powder is a pillow an absolute bolster of some three feet in length   and twelve inches in diameter  it had need be for the shell which it   is meant to propel is the size of a small boy and the weight of an   average ox namely 814 lbs  the length of each 38ton gun is nineteen   feet and its range about 6000 yards  just try to imagine an ox being   propelled through space between three and four miles at a rate which   i dont recollect and which doesnt signify  try also to remember   that each gun costs between 2000 pounds and 3000 pounds and that   every time a turret lets fly a shot from one of her guns the expense   is 12 pounds 10 shillings  the 80ton guns which are to supersede   these will it is said cost upwards of 10000 pounds each  this will   enable you to form some idea of englands greatness    the drill and working of these guns is magnificent  nearly   everything in the foreturret is worked by steam and hydraulic power   so that comparatively few men are required to move the iron monsters   let me ask you to imagine the men at their stations  some are inside   the turret and as guns and turret move in concert the men inside move   with them  those outside the turret stand at its base and are   therefore below the iron deck and protected by the iron sides of the   ship  the insiders revolve aim and fire the gun the outsiders   load  the first lieutenant standing at the base of the tower close   to the hole by which it is entered so that he may be heard by both   out and insiders shouts close up in the voice of a stentor  at   this some men grasp levers others stand by wheels which let on   respectively hydraulic power and steam  the captain of the tower   seated on an elevated position puts his head through a manhole in   the roof of the turret which hole is covered with a bulletproof iron   hood having a narrow opening in front  he surveys the supposed   enemy and his duty is to revolve the tower take aim and let go the   firing machinery ie pull the trigger  the outsiders stand by the   locking bolt levers shotracks etcetera  then in the attitude of   readyforaction all become motionless attentive statuesa regular   tableauvivant    stentor again shouts cast loose  to my ignorant eye energetic   confusion ensues  the captain of the turret is causing it to revolve   this way and that with its crew and guns by a mere touch of his   finger  lever and wheelmen do their duty the guns are run in or   out when required with the ease of popguns till certain marks on   carriages and slides correspond then they are laid firinggear is   cleared and made ready while the outsiders take out the tompion open   the port and scuttle of the gun about to be loaded bring forward a   bolster of powder or a representative mass of wood and place a   giant shot on a trolly which is just a little railwaycarriage to   convey the shot on rails from its rack to the gun  meanwhile the   captain of the turret gives the order starboard or port loading   position turns the turret until the gun is opposite its   loadinghole and then depresses its muzzle to the same point jams   it against the hole and the turret is locked    sponge and load is now givenbut not by stentor  the forces at   work are too great in some cases to be left to the uncertain human   voice  a piece of mechanism called a telltale communicates with   infallible certainty that the monster is quite ready to feed  a   hydraulic ramrod thereupon wets his whistle with a sponge on the end   of which is a small reservoir of water  the monster is temperate   this withdrawn a wad is placed on the end of the ramrod  three men   shove a bolster of powder into the guns mouth  the huge shot is then   hydraulically lifted to the muzzle  no mortal man could move that   shot a hairsbreadth in the right direction but the hydraulic ram is   brought to bear and shoves the delicious morceau not down but   up his throat with an ease that would be absurd if it were not   tremendous  the telltale now intimates to the insiders gun   loaded  the captain of the turret gives the order run out   hydraulic at work again  in a few seconds the gun muzzle is raised   and projects through its porthole  when the object and distance are   named the captain of the turret takes aim and then follows in more   or less rapid succession elevate depress extreme elevation   or the reverse readyfire when the thunderer is shaken to   her centre and twelve pounds ten shillings sterling go groaning   uselessly into the deep or crashing terrifically through the   armourplates of an unfortunate enemy    my dear fellow this gives you but a faint outline of it but time   and paper would fail me if i were to tell in detail of the mode by   which all this can be done by the captain of the thunderer himself   by means of speakingtubes and electricity and a director so that   he can while standing in the fighting tower aim point and fire as   if with his own hand guns which he cannot see and which are forty   feet or so distant from him  would that i could relate to you a tithe   of what i have seenthe day for instance when the bluejackets to   the number of one hundred and fifty had a fieldday on shore and   went through infantry drillskirmishing and allas well to my   unpractised eye as if they had been regular boiled lobsters to say   nothing of their manoeuvres with the gatling gun  this latter weapon   perhaps you dont know is simply a bundle of gigantic muskets which   load and fire themselves by the mere turning of a handlea martial   barrelorgan in short which sends a continuous shower of balls in   the face of an advancing or on the back of a retreating foe  the   greater involves the less  no one can deny that and it is my opinion   that in the british navy the sailor now includes the soldier  he is   as it were a bluejacket and a boiled lobster rolled into one   tremendous sausagea sausage so tough that would be uncommonly   difficult for any one in yankee phrase to chaw him up    then there is the whitehead torpedo    a thing of beauty says the poet is a joy for ever  the poet   who said it was anno i wont go that length but it is clear that   he had not seen a whitehead torpedo  that delicate instrument is   indeed a thing of beauty for it is elegantly formed of polished   steel but when it happens to stick its head into a ships stern it   is not a joy even for a moment and it effectually stops for ever   all consideration of its qualities by those who chance to feel them   it is shaped like a fish and has a tail  its motive power is in its   tail which is a screw propeller  it has lungs consisting of a tank   for holding compressed air  it has a stomach composed of a pair of   pneumatic engines which drive it through the water  its body is   fourteen feet long more or less  its head contains an explosive   charge of 110 pounds of wet guncotton with a dry disc of the same in   its heart  it goes off by concussion and could sink our largest   ironcladthere is no doubt whatever about that  its cost is between   four and five hundred pounds sterling  one of the peculiarities of   this celebrated torpedo is that it can be regulated so as to travel   at a given depth below water  this is not so much to conceal its   course which is more or less revealed by the airbubbles of its   atmospheric engine as to cause it to hit the enemy ten or twelve feet   below her waterline  what the effect of this new warmonster shall be   is at present in the womb of futurity  i hope sincerely that the   world may suffer no greater loss from it than its cost    by the way i must not forget to tell you that i have grown at least   an inch since i saw you last in consequence of having been mistaken   for the captain of the thunderer  that the mistake was made by a   pretty innocent sweet ignorant young girl with intensely blue   eyes does not abate my vanity one jot  that such a mistake should be   made by anybody was complimentary  it happened thusi was seated   alone in the captains cabin writing for the evergreen isle when a   party of ladies and gentlemen passed the door and looked in  they   were being shown over the ship  that said the bluejacket who   conducted them is the captains cabin  and is that whispered   blueeyes in the sweetest of voices the captain  my heart   stopped  u biquitous the captain of the thunderer  i felt   indignant when bluejacket replied with a contemptuous growlno   miss taint  they passed on but i could not rest  i rose and   followed blueeyes about the ship like a loving dog at a respectful   distance  i tried to find out her name but failedher address but   failed again  then they left and she vanished from my sightfor   ever    but enough of this  adieu my dear jeffry till we meetyours   affectionately ub    psi mentioned you to the captain as a friend of mine and an   enthusiastic torpedoist  be sure you call on him if you should ever   find yourself in the neighbourhood of the mighty thunderer    chapter nineteen  describes a stirring fight  it was late when i folded this letter about the surprising effects of which i have yet to speak  having been very much overwrought in the hospitals that day i flung myself on my bed and fell into a sound sleep having previously cautioned my assistant who occupied a couch opposite mine not to disturb me except in a case of necessity  it could not have been long afterwards when i was awakened by him violently and told that a telegram had just arrived summoning me home i sprang up and read it anxiously  there was no explanation  the telegram was simple but urgent  my mother my sister nicholas illness death disaster of some sort filled my mind as i huddled on my clothes and made hurried preparations to obey the summons  of course no inquiries could be made  the telegram was peremptory  i crushed a few things into a portmanteau and obtaining permission left the hospital without a moments delay  the distance to the coast was considerable but i had ample means and found no difficulties in the way  it is always so in this lifeat least in regard to ordinary thingswhen one possesses unlimited means  now i must pause at this point and beg the reader to bear with me while i relate a few things that may appear at first sight overdrawn  let judgment be suspended until all has been told  there was no difficulty whatever i repeat in reaching varna  from thence to constantinople was merely a matter of a few hours in an ordinary steamer  my personal acquaintance with several european ambassadors enabled me to pass the lines and travel in the enemys country without obstruction or delay  my position as occasional warcorrespondent of the scottish bawbee would have procured me interviews with many celebrities but anxiety prevented my taking advantage of this  in process of time i arrived at besika bay and here i found the british fleet at anchor  of course i had been aware of its presence there and felt some pleasure in contemplating a visit to some of the ships in several of which i had friends  it was with great surprise that i found the thunderer among the warships assembled in the bay  i had never heard of her having left england though i had been told that her sistership the devastation was at besika  remembering the injunction of my friend biquitous i went on board the thunderer and was hospitably received by the captain  he had only time however to shake hands and beg me to make myself at home  there was obviously something of importance about to happen for great activity prevailed among officers and men  it seemed to my untutored eye as if they were getting up steam and preparing for some sort of expedition  the captain did not invite me to accompany them nevertheless i went  it was not long before the object of the expedition was revealed  a monster russian ironclad it was said lay somewhere outside  we were sent to observe her  in the evening we sighted her  there was another russian warshipa frigateclose to her  the ironclad was similar to ourselves a long low hulla couple of turrets with a central flying structure or hurricanedeck  we made straight towards her  the bugle sounded and the crew was called to quarters  my dear sir said i to the captain has war been declared between england and russia  the captain made no reply  on repeating the question anxiously he merely said  never mind  i was surprised almost hurt and greatly perplexed for the captain was noted for politeness and urbanity but of course i retired at once  next moment i saw a puff of smoke burst from the side of the russian ironclad and a shot leaped towards us  its size was such that we could trace it from the muzzle of the gun  describing as i thought for strange is the power of thought a rather high trajectory it passed over us and plunged into the sea with a swish that sent hundreds of tons of water like an inverted cascade into the air  a gush of indignation filled my breast  that the warship of a nation with which we were at peace should fire at us without provocation was more than i could endure  are you going to stand that captain  i asked with an uncontrollable gush of indignation at the russians audacity  the captain gave one sardonic laugh and a shrug of his shoulders but vouchsafed no reply  hearing one of the officers give some order about whitehead torpedoes i ran to the room where these monsters were kept  i was just in time to see one lifted on to a species of carriage and wheeled to the side of the ship  here a powerful airpump was set to work and the torpedos lungs were filled almost to the bursting point  its deadly head brought from the magazinewas at the same time attached to its body another instant and a port was thrown open in the thunderers side through which the whitehead was launched  it went with a sluggish plunge into the sea  while it was in the act of passing out a trigger was touched which set the pneumatic engines agoing  the screwpropelling tail twirled and the monster descending ten feet below the surface sped on its mission  i rushed on deck  the airbubbles showed me that the engine of destruction had been aimed at the russian frigate  in a few seconds it had closed with it  i could see that there was terrible consternation on board  next moment a fountain of foam shot from the deep and partially obscured the frigate i saw men leaping overboard and spars falling for a few moments then the frigate lurched heavily to port and went head foremost to the bottom  i stood gazing in a species of horrified abstraction from which i was recalled by some of our men running to the side of the vessel  they were about to lower the steamlaunch  it was to be sent out as a torpedoboat and young firebrand whom i now observed for the first time took command  just then a torpedoboat was seen to quit the side of the russian  we were ready for her  our largest gatling gun had been hoisted to that platform on our mast which is styled the top  when within range this weapon commenced firing  it was absolutely horrible  one man turned a handle at the breech another kept supplying the selfacting cartridgebox  as the handle was turned the cartridges dropped into their places and exploded  six or nine tubes i forget which were thus made to rain bullets without intermission  they fell on the screen of the advancing torpedoboat like hail but quite harmlessly  then i heard a voice within the foreturret give a command which sounded like extreme depression  it was quickly followed by fire and the thunderer quivered from keel to truck under the mighty explosion  the great 38ton gun had been splendidly served for the monster ball hit the boat amidships and crushed the bow under water at the same instant the stern leaped into the air and she went down with a dive like a greenland whale  hearty cheers burst from the men in the top  these were echoed with a muffled sound from the men shut up in the armoured hull belowfor it must be remembered that not a soul had been visible all this time on the thunderer except the men in the top and those who had been sent to lower the steamlaunch  apparently rendered savage by this event the russians let fly a volley from their four greatguns but without serious result  they had been admirably pointed however for the two outer shots hit our turrets deeply indented them and glanced off while the inner shots went slap through the flying structure as if it had been made of pasteboard leaving cleancut holes which of course only made the place more airy  night had now fallen  the danger of attack by torpedoboats having been recognised both ironclads had let down their crinolines  but the captain of the thunderer had resolved on aawhat shall i call it a dodge which would probably deceive the enemy  he had an electric light on board  every one knows nowadays that this is an intense light which being thrown on a given point illuminates it with a glare equal almost to that of day  after dark the captain shot this light from his masthead straight at the enemy and in the full glare of it our steamlaunch or torpedoboat was sent out  i was amazed beyond measure  forgetting myself for a moment i exclaimed captain you are mad  as might have been expected the captain made no reply  the steamlaunch carried two torpedoes each containing 100 pounds of powder  be careful to sheer off quickly after exploding said the captain to firebrand quietly  firebrand replied yes sir respectfully but i heard him distinctly add in a low tone to himself ill run slap into her and blow her to atoms as well as myself  somebody must fail in every action  its a forlorn hope at sea thats allfull steam he added aloud to the engineer  as the boat rushed away in the blaze of the electric light the captains ruse suddenly dawned on my mind  the russian at once saw the boat and with naturally nervous haste knowing the terrible nature of such boats made preparations to thwart her  close in the wake of the boat the thunderer followed with the intent to run the russian down with her ram which is a tremendous iron beak projecting below water from her bow  the dodge was to dazzle the enemy with the electric light and while her attention was concentrated on the torpedoboat to ram her  steady said firebrand in a deep voice  something else was replied by somebody in a deeper voice  the boat ploughed on its way like a furious hornet  fire shouted the russians  instantly from turret bulwark and masthead leaped livid flames of fire and the sea was torn up by bullets while fearful spouts were here and there raised by shots from the heavy guns  everything was concentrated on the torpedoboat  it was obvious that the dazzling light at the masthead of the thunderer had blinded her adversary as to her own movements  let drive  i heard the order of the russian captain as distinctly as if i had been on board his own ship and was somewhat surprised at its being given in slang english  the result was a rain of musketry which rattled on the iron armour of the launchs protecting screen as the sticks rattle on a kettledrum  ready said firebrand with suppressed intensity  as the boat drew near the russian small shot was tearing up the sea like a wintry storm  the order having been given the torpedospars were lowered so that each torpedo sank ten feet under water  fire yelled firebrand  electricity was applied both torpedoes exploded and the launch sheered off gallantly in cataracts of foam  at the same moment the russians observed us not ten yards distant coming stem on at full speed  her turret guns were concentrated and fired so were ours  the crash was indescribably hideous yet it was as nothing compared with that which followed a few seconds later  our ram entering the russian fairly amidships cut her almost in two  we backed out instantly intending to repeat the operation  well was it for us that we did so  we had just backed a few hundred yards astern and given the order to go ahead full steam when the russians magazine exploded  our charge had somehow fired it  instantly there was a crashing roar as if heaven and earth had met in chaotic conflict  the air was darkened with bursting clouds of blackest smoke in the midst of which beams guns pistons boilers armourplates human limbs and heads were seen hurling about like the debris of a wrecked universe much of this came down upon our iron deck  the clatter was appalling it was a supreme moment  i was standing on the flying structure beside one of the officers  glorious he muttered while a pleasant smile played upon his lips  just then i chanced to look up and saw one of the russian foreturret 85ton guns falling towards me  it knocked me off the flying structure and i fell with an agonising yell on the deck below  hallo exclaimed a familiar voice as a man stooped to raise me  i looked up  it was my hospitalassistant  i had fallen out of bed  you seem to have had a night of it sircheering and shouting to such an extent that i thought of awaking you once or twice but refrained because of your strict orders to the contrary  not hurt i hope  so then i said with a sigh of intense relief as i proceeded to dress the whole affair has beena dream  ah thought i on passing through the hospital for the last time before quitting it and gazing sadly on the ghastly rows of sick and wounded well were it for this unfortunate world if war and all its horrors were but the phantasmagoria of a similar dream    chapter twenty  treats of war and some of its glorious results  in process of time i reached the front and chanced to arrive on the field of action at a somewhat critical moment  many skirmishes and some of the more important actions of the war had been fought by that timeas i already knew too well from the hosts of wounded men who had passed through my hands at sistova and now it was my fate to witness another phase of the dreadful game  everywhere as i traversed the land there was evidence of fierce combats and of wanton destruction of property burning villages fields of produce trodden in the earth etcetera  still further on i encountered long trains of wagons bearing supplies and ammunition to the front  as we advanced these were met by bullocktrains bearing wounded men to the rear  the weather had been bad  the road was almost kneedeep in mud and so cut up by traffic that pools occurred here and there into which wagons and horses and bullocks stumbled and were got out with the greatest difficulty  the furious lashing of exhausted and struggling cattle was mingled with the curses and cries of brutal drivers and the heartrending groans of wounded soldiers who lying in many cases with undressed wounds on the hard springless and jolting vehicles suffered excruciating agony  many of these unable to endure their sufferings died and thus the living and the dead were in some cases jolted slowly along together  the road on each side was lined with dead animals and menthe latter lying in a state of apparent rest which called forth envious looks from the dying  but a still sadder spectacle met my eye when from another road which joined this one there came a stream of peasantry old men women and children on foot and in country carts of all kinds flying from the raging warriors who desolated their villages and seeking they knew not whereanywherefor refuge  too often they sought in vain  many of these people had been woundedeven the women and little oneswith bullet sword and spear  some carried a few of their most cherished household articles along with them  others were only too glad to have got away with life  here an old man who looked as if he had been a soldier long before the warriors of today were born was gently compelled by a terrorstricken young woman with a wounded neck to lay his trembling old head on her shoulder as they sat on a little straw in the bottom of a native cart  he had reached that venerable period of life when men can barely totter to their doors to enjoy the sunshine and when beholders regard them with irresistible feelings of tenderness and reverence  war had taught the old man how to stand erect once morethough it was but a spasmodic effortand his poor fingers were clasped round the hilt of an old cavalry sabre from which female hands had failed to unclasp them  there in another cart lay an old woman who had been bedridden and utterly helpless for many a year but war had wrought miracles for her  it had taught her once again to use her shrunken limbs to tumble out of the bed to which she had been so long accustomed and where she had been so lovingly nursed and to crawl in a paroxysm of terror to the door afraid lest she should be forgotten by her children and left to the tender mercies of cossack or bashibazouk needless fear of course for these children were only busy outside with a few absolute necessaries and would sooner have left their own dead and mangled bodies behind than have forgotten granny  elsewhere i saw a young woman prone on her back in another cart with the pallor of death on her handsome face and a tiny little head pressed tenderly to her swelling breast  it was easy to understand that war had taught this young mother to cut short the period of quiet repose which is deemed needful for woman in her circumstances  still another cart i must mention for it contained a singular group  a young man with a powerfullymade frame which must once have been robust but was now terribly reduced by the wasting fires of a deadly fever was held forcibly down by a middleaged man whose resemblance to him revealed his fatherhood  two women helped the man yet all three were barely able to restrain the youth who in the fury of his delirium gnashed with his teeth and struggled like a maniac  i knew nothing about them but it was not difficult to read the history of one who had reached a critical period in a fell disease who had perchance fallen into a longdesired and muchneeded slumber that might have turned the scale in his favour when the hope of parents and the chances of life were scattered suddenly by the ruthless trump of war  war had taught him how to throw off the sweet lethargy that had been stealing over him and to start once again on that weary road where he had been grappling in imagination with the braincreated fiends who had persecuted him so long but who in reality were gentle spirits compared with the human devils by whom he and his kindred were surrounded  on this journey too i met many brethren of the medical profession who urged by the double motive of acquiring surgical skill and alleviating human woe were pressing in the same direction  some had been fortunate enough like myself to obtain horses others despising difficulties were pushing forward through the mud on foot  i need scarcely add that some of us turned aside from time to time as opportunity offered to succour the unfortunates around us  at last i reached the front went to headquarters presented my credentials and was permitted to attach myself to one of the regiments at once i made inquiries as to the whereabouts of nicholas naranovitsch and was so fortunate as to find him  he was in the act of mounting his horse as i reached his quarters  it is impossible to describe the look of surprise and delight with which he greeted me  my dear fellow said he turning at once to his girths and stirrups after the first hearty squeeze what breeze of good fortune has blown you here  any news from home  yes all well and a messageby the way i had almost forgot it fumbling in my pocket for you  almost forgot it echoed nicholas looking round with a smile and a glance which was meant for one of withering rebuke  here it is i exclaimed handing him a threecornered note which had come in my mothers letter  he seized it eagerly and thrust it into the breastpocket of his coat  now look here jeff he said having seen to the trappings of his steed you know what war is  great things are at stake  i may not delay even to chat with you  but a few words will suffice  do you know anything about your servant lancey  nothing  i would give anything to hear that the poor fellow was alive have you  yes i have seen him  i chanced this very morning while galloping across country with an order from the general to see him among the campfollowers  why there i know not  to search for him now would be like looking for a needle in a haystack but i observed that he was in company with our bulgarian friend the scout dobri petroff who is so well known that he can easily be found and will probably be able to lead you to him  now only one word for myself dont forget a message to bellasaysaybah  you english are such an undemonstrative set that i dont like to put it in words butyou ought to know what to say and when youve said it just add like a good fellow that i would have said a great deal more if i had had the saying of it myself  dyou understand  all right said i with a laugh  we english feel although we dont demonstrate much and can act when occasion requires it with as much energy as russians ill say all you could wish and some things mayhap that you couldnt have said yourselfbut where are you going in such haste  to battle jeff he replied with one of those proud glances of the eyes which must be somewhat akin to the expanded nostrils of the warhorse when he scents the battle from afar  at least he added to convey orders which will have some bearing on what is about to follow the turk is brave  we find that he fights well  ha said i quickly you find him a plucky fellow and begin to respect him  yes truly he is a worthy foe returned nicholas with animation  just so i rejoined unable to repress a feeling of bitterness a worthy foe simply because he possesses the courage of the bulldog a worthy foe despite the fact that he burns pillages violates murders destroys and tortures in cold blood  what if bella were in one of these bulgarian villages when given over to the tender mercies of a troop of bashibazouks  nicholas had his left hand on the reins and resting on the pommel of his saddle as i said this  he turned and looked at me with a face almost white with indignation  jeff how can you suggest  bashibazouks are devils  well then said i interrupting let us suppose cossacks or some other of your own irregulars instead  i stopped for nicholas had vaulted on his horse and in another second was flying at full speed over the plain  perhaps i was hard on him but after the miseries i witnessed that day i could not help trying to send the truth home  time pressed now  the regiment to which i was attached had received orders to march  i galloped off in search of it  at first i had thought of making a hurried search for lancey or the scout but gave up the idea well content to have heard that the former was alive  the turks at this time were advancing under mahomet ali pasha on the position occupied by the russians on the lom river  as i joined my regiment and reported myself i heard distant cannonading on the left and observed troops moving off in all directions  we soon got the order to march and on going to the top of a small eminence came in sight of the field of action  to my unaccustomed eyes the country appeared to be alive with confused masses of moving men from some of which masses there burst at intervals the rolling smoke of riflefiring  of course i knew that there was order and arrangement but the only order that impressed itself on me was that of the russian regiment at my side as the men strode steadily forward with compressed lips and stern yet eager glances  the turkish troops had moved out and taken up a position on the face of a hill under cover of some woods  as battalion after battalion marched away i for the first time became impressed with the multitudes of men who constitute an army and at the same time with the feeling that something like a pitched battle was about to be fought  from the elevated position on which we stood i could see that numbers of russian cavalry were prowling about over the plain as if watching the movements of the enemy  the intention of the turks soon became evident for they suddenly swarmed out of the woods and advanced to the attack  a russian battery on our right instantly opened on them  this was replied to vigorously by a turkish battery opposite  while these two turned their attention on each other the troops in the plain below came into action they swarmed over the numerous undulations skirmished through the scrub and the fields of corn and maize attacked a village in a hollow and charged on various batteries and positions of strengthsometimes one side sometimes the other being successful  the thunder of the great guns increased the tremendous rattle of small arms became continuous with now and again exceptionally strong bursts when whole battalions fired in volleys  the smoke soon became so dense as partly to obscure the vision  at that moment a turkish battalion was seen to approach the mound on which we stood with the evident intention of storming it  at the same time i observed a squadron of russian cavalry trot smartly round the skirt of a wood on our left and take up a position  they were not fifty yards from the spot where i stood  i could even see the expression of their faces and i fancied that the figure and countenance of the righthand man of the troop were familiar to me  hes a finelooking man sir is he not said a voice at my elbow  i turned in amazement  it was dobri petroff  there was no room for more than a squeeze of the hand at such a moment  that is our friend andre vanovitch sir  as he spoke i saw the captain of the troop fall from his horse  a stray ball had killed him and this was the first thing that drew my attention to the fact that bullets were whistling over our own heads now and then  this happened at the very moment when a staff officer galloped up to the troop with an order  seeing what had happened this officer put himself at the head of the troop and gave the command to advance  i recognised the voice at once as that of nicholas  they swept past close in front of us at full gallop and i could see on the face of nicholas and on that of the stalwart andre the same open gladsome noble expression suggestive of high chivalrous sentiment and a desire to do noble selfsacrificing deeds for fatherland  my own heart bounded within me as i looked at them and i could not resist bursting into a cheer which was taken up and prolonged wildly by the troops around  the squadron came upon the turks unexpectedly but they stood like true men  courage however was of no avail  the dragoons were heavy and irresistible  they cut right through the turks turned charged again and scattered them like chaff  i could perceive in the midst of the fray the lithe forms of nicholas and andre laying about them with tremendous impetuosity  personal valour is necessary but it is not omnipotent nowadays  when the squadron returned reduced almost to a skeleton the turks had reformed were largely reinforced and came at us again with steady determination  at the same time reinforcements came pouring in on our side and i soon found that the position we occupied was deemed one of considerable importance  the turks came on steadily and now i learned for the first time the power of modern weapons  our men were armed with breechloaders so that no time was lost in loading  our commander acted on a principle which is said to be usually adopted by general skobeleff  he reserved his fire until the turks were within a hundred yards and then gave the order to commence  the scene that followed is indescribable  eight hundred men fell at once before the withering blast of lead  the firing was continuous  no troops on earth could have stood it  the turks were instantly shattered and repulsed  when they had retired and the smoke had partially cleared away i saw the plain covered with slaughtered men  some were prone and motionless in death  some were moving slightly  others were struggling as if in a delirium of agony which it was frightful to witness  a few had life enough to rise stagger forward several paces fall and rise again to repeat the process until death ensued  i stood fascinated  god help us  i exclaimed aloud these murdered hundreds represent thousands of bleeding hearts at home and yet the maniacs continue to kill each other as if human lives were of no account and human souls not worth a thought  pardon me sir said a voice at my side the maniacs who cause all this are not here but at the place you mentioned just nowat home these fine fellows are their unhappy tools who with untold depths of enthusiasm and kindliness in their nature and a good deal of devilment too are compelled willing or not willing to fight for what is called religion and country  i found that the speaker was the special correspondent of a scotch newspaper  as brother specials we fraternised immediately but we had scarcely had time to exchange a few rapid queries and replies when our men were ordered to advance to the attack  very soon the ambulance corps was busily employed and i had to devote my entire energies to the wounded who came pouring in  oh it was pitiful to see the hundreds of strong and stalwart youths who might have been the glory of succeeding generations brought in with frames shattered beyond recovery with brave lip compressed to check the rising cry of agony with eyes glaring in the terrible conflict between lusty manhood and sudden death or with nerves utterly unstrung giving vent to the shrieks of the maniac  several surgeons and students among us had extemporised an hospital in the shelter of a cliff  one of the students whose mind was in advance of his years and whose spirit seemed roused came suddenly to me during a brief interval in our labours  our rulers are fools or worse said he with indignation what is the use of diplomacy if it cannot prevent this  i remonstrated with the youth on the impropriety of his language but my new friend the special broke in with  ah young man you have not yet seen enough of life to understand it a man is a machine which regulates itself more or less for its own interests  a household does the same a town does likewise so does a state  no doubt a man sometimes fights with himselfso too households are addicted to disagreement and towns are often afflicted with difference of opinion while a state is not unacquainted with internal commotions but in each and all of these cases reason and common sense prevent the people from degenerating into pure savages  it is reserved for governments alone when they come into collision with each other to do that  peoples dont desire war my good sir it is governmentin other words the noncombatant gentlemen at the head of the worlds affairswho thirst for blood backed up of course by such of the people as are more or less interested in the breaking out of war in all ordinary matters humanity is satisfied to submit its cases to courts of law to umpires to individual or collective arbitrators  if things dont go right it is usually understood among christian men and women that a little touch of forbearance here of selfsacrifice there of pocketing of slight affronts elsewhere will bring things into the best possible condition and where these plans wont doas in the case of drunkards maniacs and villainsthey understand and quietly practise the power of overwhelming constraint  if the turks had been overwhelmingly constrained by europe during the late conference at constantinople we should have had no war  i never met with any nation so fond of argument as the scotch surrounded as we were by dead and dying men the special and the student who was also scotch sat down and lighted their pipes to have it out  to do them justice there was a lull at the time in the arrival of wounded men  but said the student in that tone which is so well known to the argumentative is not overwhelming constraint tyranny  my friend replied the special lighting his pipe at the others cigar if a blackguard stole a poor widows purse and six policemen took him up compelled him to restore it and put him in limbo would you call that tyranny  of course not  but it would be overwhelming constraint would it not  wellahyesi seebut  of course theres a but  quite right  that is the word by which it is conveniently stated that the mind is not yet clear  far be it from me to coerce you  i would if i could clear you  listen then  has not the turk treated his christian subjects in a way that can only be expressed as diabolical  unquestionably  every one admits that but he promises to govern them better in future  if a thief said the special were to promise amendment and restoration of stolen property would you let him off with the stolen property in his pocket  certainly not answered the student  well then the turk has stolen the liberty of his christian subjectsto say nothing of his own subjectsand he only promises to give it back  he promised that more than twenty years ago but has not done it yet  ought he not to have been overwhelmingly constrained by the european conference to fulfil his promises  and if he had been thus constrained would not war have been avoided  but perhaps he would have resisted said the student  no the turk is not mad therefore he would not have resisted united europe returned the special and even suppose that he had his resistance could not have produced such a frightful war as this for europe would have crushed him at once with comparatively little bloodshed  as it is we have left the muscovite with good or bad intentions i know not which to tackle him aloneand the result is before you  if the russian is upright in his intentions we have treated him shabbily if he is false we have given him a splendid opportunity to carry out his plans  i pronounce no opinion on russia the sin of this war lies with europe certainly not with england for whether she behaved rightly or wrongly she was not omnipotent at the conference perhaps i should say that the sin lies with the members of that conference who misrepresented europe and allowed a notorious criminal to escape  there are various opinions on that subject said the student  there are various opinions on every subject replied the special but that is no reason why men and women should be content to have no opinion at all or a bigoted onewhich latter means an opinion founded largely on feeling and formed before both sides of a question have been considered  an ambulancewagon drove up at this moment  the student and i forgetting the subject of discussion hastened with our brethren to attend to the wretched beings who were laid shattered bleeding and dying on the ground before us while the special seeing that we had run short of water caught up a couple of buckets and ran to a neighbouring spring  it chanced that the ground between our place of shelter and the spring was at that time swept by the fire of contending troops but in spite of this the special coolly filled his buckets and brought them inhappily without being injured  the battle raged during the whole of that day all over the plain  being taken up almost exclusively with our duties we surgeons had little time to observe the progress of the fight nevertheless mindful of my character as a reporter i took advantage of an occasional moment of relaxation to jot down a few notes  there was a hill not far from that on which we stood which was held by a russian regiment  around it the fight appeared to rage very fiercely the roar of artillery and the incessant rattle of small arms had by this time gathered in force until it resembled a storm  hundreds of white puffs all over the field told of death from shots which were too far off to be heard while the belching of a battery on the hill just mentioned caused the very earth to tremble  the turks at this point executed a flank movement and attempted to take the hill by storm  at the same time one of their batteries appeared on the top of a ridge opposite and began to play on the hill with terrible precision  to counteract this a russian battery of three guns was despatched  i saw the horses come galloping in from the rear one of the guns was limbered up and off they went like the wind  at that moment a shell from the turkish battery fell right under the gun and exploding blew it with the men and horses into the air  the other guns reached the hill in safety wheeled into position and for a time checked the turkish fire  nevertheless undeterred by the withering salvos the turks came on in powerful columns till they drew near to the hotly contested point  at the foot of it the russians had dug trenches and thrown up earthworks the night before  i observed with surprise that as the attacking columns advanced the russian riflefire ceased though the battery continued to cut lanes in the living masses  it occurred to me that our men were reserving fire according to the skobeleff plan  in this i was right  when the turks were within a hundred yards of the trenches the defenders fired as one man  the front ranks of the enemy fell like corn before the scythe those in rear charged with irresistible impetuosity over their dead comrades  but the russians had anticipated such an event  they had placed mines in the ground which when the turks passed over them were fired and hundreds of men were blown into the air  this checked them  for a time they recoiled and were thrown into disorder  at that moment a young officer rallied them and charged again  the trenches were entered and a handtohand conflict ensued  with my fieldglass i could see the fierce expressions of the men as they drove their reeking bayonets right through their enemies and the appalling gasp and glare of eye in those whose mortal career had been thus suddenly brought to a close  yells of fury shouts curses clubbed rifles battered skulls unearthly shrieks smoke and bloodwho can imagine or describe such a scene  the russian soldier fights well  his courage is equal to that of the men of other nations and his weight gives him the advantage over some but nothing can resist the power of overwhelming numbers  sitting on a height and comfortably watching the battle through telescopes the turkish generals quietly move the men on the bloody board  hundreds of turks have perished  what matter there are thousands on thousands ready to follow  turkey must maintain her integrity  pashas must wallow in wealth  millions of peasants must toil to accomplish these ends if need be they must die  the need at present isto die  push on more battalions to reinforce them is the order  no doubt the hundreds who have fallen and the thousands who must yet fall will leave hundreds of wives and thousands of children to hopeless mourning but what of that they are only canaille cared for by nobody in particular but god  no doubt the country must suffer for it  we must pay for war  we shall have an enormous national debtthat cant be helped and other countries have the samebesides we can borrow from rich trusting nations and repudiate our debts our land shall feel the drain of its best young blood for generations yet to come but time heals most sores people will multiply as heretofore fate is unavoidable and allah is great  moreover what does it all matter to us so long as our integrity is maintained our seraglios remain intact and our coffers are filled  that hillock must be taken  it is a priceless hillock  like other hillocks no doubt and not very promising in an agricultural point of view but still a priceless hillock which must be carried at any cost for on our obtaining it depends somehow we cant say exactly how the honour of our name the success of our arms the weal of the turkish empire  and so another order is given fresh troops are hurled into the trenches already filled with dead and dying and the hillock is carried by storm swept over with fierce cries of allah  allah which mingle strangely with russian curses and is then left behind and regarded with as much indifference as if it were the most insignificant mass of earth and stone in all bulgaria  flying backwards the beaten russians come panting towards the hill on which we stand and rally while our men advance meet and stop the enemy charge and overthrow them turn the tide of battle retake the hillock which has cost so much and ultimately things remain in statu quo when the blessed shades of evening put an end to the frightful sceneleaving nothing whatever accomplished on either side except the legitimate and ordinary end of most wars namelydeath and destruction  i had just finished dressing the wounds of a soldier at the end of this terrible episode when a touch on my shoulder caused me to look up  it was dobri petroff  have you seen your servant lancey he asked quickly  no  i had intended to ask if you knew anything about him when the beginning of this carnage drove him and everything else out of my mind do you know where he is  i saw him not five minutes since looking wildly for you  while petroff was speaking lancey appeared running towards me bloodstained blackened with powder and with a rifle on his shoulder    chapter twenty one  more of the results of war  i need not trouble the reader with an account of the meeting with my faithful servant  while we were still engaged in questioning each other i noticed that the countenance of our friend the scout wore an anxious and almost impatient expression  anything wrong dobri  i inquired  god knows he replied in a solemn tone which impressed me much  a rumour has come that the circassians or the bashibazouksi know not which but both are fiends and cowardshave been to venilik and  he stopped abruptly  but that village was in the hands of the russians i said at once understanding his anxiety  it may be so but i go to see without delay he replied and have only stopped thus long to know if you will go with me  these brutes kill and wound women and children as well as men  perhaps your services maywill you go  he spoke so earnestly and his face looked so deadly pale that i felt it impossible to refuse him  i was much exhausted by the prolonged labours of the day but knew that i had reserve strength for an emergency  give me a few minutes said ijust to get leave you know  i cant go without leave  the scout nodded  in ten minutes i had returned  meanwhile lancey had prepared my horse and his own  swallowing a can of water i vaulted into the saddle  it was very dark but petroff knew every foot of the country  for several hours we rode at a smart gallop and then as day was breaking drew near to venilik  as we approached i observed that the bold countenance of the scout became almost pinchedlooking from anxiety  presently we observed smoke against the sky and then saw that the village had undoubtedly been burned  i glanced at petroff nervously  there was no longer a look of anxiety on his face but a dark vindictive frown  he increased his pace to racing speed  as we followed close at his heels i observed that he drew a knife from his belt and with that as a spur urged on his jaded steed  at last we reached the outskirts of the village and dashed through  blackened beams ruined houses dead men and women met our horrified gaze on every side  at the wellknown turn of the road where the bypath joined it dobri vaulted from his horse and let the animal go while he ran towards his dwelling  we also dismounted and followed him  then a great and terrible shout reached our ears  when we came to the cottage we found the scout standing motionless before his old home with his hands clasped tightly and his eyes riveted to the spot with a glare of horror that words cannot describe  before him all that had been his home was a heap of blackened ashes but in the midst of these ashes were seen protruding and charred bones  it did not require more than one glance to show that recognition of the remains was impossible  everything was reduced to cinders  as we gazed an appalling cry rang in our ears and next moment a young woman darted out from behind a piece of the blackened walls with a knife in her hand  hah are you come back you devils she shrieked and flew at dobri who would certainly have been stabbed for he paid no attention to her if i had not caught her wrist and forced the knife from her grasp even then she sprang at him and fastened her fingers in his neck while she cried give me back my child i say give me my child you fiend  she stopped and looked earnestly in his face then springing back and standing before him with clenched hands she screamed  ha haa it is you dobri why did you not come to help us traitor cowardto leave us at such a time  did you not hear the shrieks of marika when they dragged her from your cottage  did you not see the form of little dobri quivering on the point of the circassians spear were you deaf when ivankas deathshriek pierced my ears like  oh god forgive me dobri i did not mean to  she stopped in the torrent of her wrath stretched both arms convulsively towards heaven and with a piercing cry for mercy fell dead at our feet  still the scout did not move  he stood in the same halfshrinking attitude of intense agony glaring at the ruin around him  dobri said i at last gently touching his arm and endeavouring to arouse him  he started like one waking out of a dream hurled me aside with such violence that i fell heavily to the ground and rushed from the spot at full speed  lancey ran after him but soon stopped  he might as well have chased a mountain hare  we both however followed the track he had pursued and catching our horses passed into the village  its of no use to follow sir said lancey we cant tell which way es gone  i felt that pursuit would indeed be useless and pulled up with the intention of searching among the ruins of the village for some one who might have escaped the carnage and could give me information  the sights that met our eyes everywhere were indeed terrible  but i pass over the sickening details with the simple remark that no ordinary imagination could conceive the deeds of torture and brutality of which these turkish irregulars had been guilty  we searched carefully but for a long time could find no one  cattle were straying ownerless about the place while dogs and pigs were devouring the murdered inhabitants  thinking it probable that some of the people might have taken refuge in the church we went to it passing from the broad glare of day into the darkened porch i stumbled over an object on the ground  it was the corpse of a young woman with the head nearly hacked off the clothes torn and the body half burnt but this was as nothing to the scene inside  about two hundred villagerschiefly women children aged and sickhad sought refuge there and been slaughtered indiscriminately  we found the dead and dying piled together in suffocating heaps  little children were crawling about looking for their mothers wounded mothers were struggling to move the ghastly heaps to find their little ones  many of these latter were scarce recognisable owing to the fearful swordcuts on their heads and faces  i observed in one corner an old man whose thin white hair was draggled with blood  he was struggling in the vain endeavour to release himself from a heap of dead bodies that had either fallen or been thrown upon him  we hastened to his assistance  after freeing him i gave him a little brandy from my flask  he seemed very grateful and on recovering a little told us with many a sigh and pause for breath that the village had been sacked by turkish irregular troops circassians who after carrying off a large number of young girls returned to the village and slaughtered all who had not already fled to the woods for refuge  while the old man was telling the mournful tale i observed a little girl run out from behind a seat where she had probably been secreting herself and gaze wildly at me  bloodstained dishevelled haggard though she was i instantly recognised the pretty little face  ivanka  i exclaimed holding out my arms  with a scream of delight she rushed forward and sprang into them  oh how the dear child grasped metwined her thin little arms round me and strained as if she would crush herself into my bosom while she buried her face in my neck and gave way to restful moans accompanied by an occasional convulsive sob  well did i understand the feelings of her poor heart  for hours past she had been shocked by the incomprehensible deeds of blood and violence around her had seen as she afterwards told me her brother murdered and her mother chased into the woods and shot by a soldier had sought refuge in the church with those who were too much taken up with their own terrible griefs to care for her and after hours of prolonged agony and terror coupled with hunger and thirst had at last found refuge in a kindly welcome embrace  after a time i tried to disengage her arms but found this to be impossible without a degree of violence which i could not exert overcome by the strain and probably by long want of rest the poor child soon fell into a profound slumber  while i meditated in some perplexity as to how i should act my attention was aroused by the sudden entrance of a number of men  their dress and badges at once told me that they formed a section of that noble band of men and women who following close on the heels of the dogs of war do all that is possible to alleviate the sufferings of hapless victimsgods work going on side by side with that of the devil  in a few minutes surgeons were tenderly binding up wounds and ambulancemen were bearing them out of the church from which the dead were also removed for burial  come lancey said i our services here are happily no longer required  let us go  where to sir said lancey  to the nearest spot i replied after a moments thought where i can lie down and sleep  i am dead beat lancey for want of rest and really feel unable for anything  if only i can snatch an hour or two that will suffice  meanwhile you will go to the nearest station and find out if the railway has been destroyed  we hurried out of the dreadful slaughterhouse ivanka still sound asleep on my shoulder and soon discovered an outhouse in which was a little straw  rolling some of this into a bundle for a pillow i lay down so as not to disturb the sleeping child  another moment and i too was steeped in that profound slumber which results from thorough physical and mental exhaustion  lancey went out shut the door fastened it and left us    chapter twenty two  the fall of plevna  the events which followed the massacre in the bulgarian village remain in my mind and ever must remain as a confused dream for i was smitten that night with a fever during the course of whichpart of it at leasti was either delirious or utterly prostrate  and who can tell save those who have passed through a similar condition the agonies which i endured and the amazing fancies by which i was assailed at that time  of course i knew not where i was and i cared not  my unbridled fancy led me everywhere  sometimes i was in a bed sometimes on horseback now in hospital attending wounded people most of whom i noticed were women or little children then on a battlefield cheering the combatants with all my power or joining them but when i chanced to join them it was never for the purpose of taking but of saving life  often i was visited by good spirits and also by bad  one of these latter a little one made a deep impression on me  his particular mission seemed to lie in his power to present before me within a flaming frame pictures of whatever i wished to behold  he was wonderfully tractable at first and showed me whatever i asked formy mother bella nicholas and many of my friendsbut by degrees he insisted on showing what i did not wish to see and among these latter pictures were fearful massacres and scenes of torture and bloodshed  i have a faint recollection of being carried somewhere in a jolting wagon of suffering from burning thirst which no one seemed to care to relieve of frequent abrupt stoppages while shouts shrieks and imprecations filled my ears but whether these things were realities or fancies or a mingling of both i cannot tell for assuredly the bad spirit never once succeeded in showing me any picture half so terrible as those realities of war which i had already beheld  one day i felt a peculiar sensation  it seemed to me that my intellectual faculties became more active while those of my body appeared to sink  come said i to the demon who had wearied me so much come you troublesome little devil and show me my man lancey  i can see better than usual present him  immediately lancey stood by my side  he looked wonderfully real and i noticed that the fiery frame was not round him as it used to be  a moment later the pretty face of ivanka also glided into the picture  hallo  i exclaimed i didnt ask you to send her here  why dont you wait for orderseh  at this lancey gently pushed ivanka away  no dont do that i cried hastily i didnt mean that order her back againdo you hear  lancey appeared to beckon and she returned  she was weeping quietly  why do you weep dear  i asked in russian  oh you have been so ill she replied with an anxious look and a sob  so then i said looking at lancey in surprise you are not delusions  no sir we aint but i sometimes fancy that everythink in life is delusions since we comed to this orrible land  i looked hard at ivanka and lancey again for some moments then at the bed on which i lay  then a listless feeling came over me and my eyes wandered lazily round the chamber which was decidedly eastern in its appearance  through a window at the farther end i could see a garden the sun was shining brightly on autumnal foliage amidst which a tall and singularlooking man walked slowly to and fro  he was clad in flowing robes with a red fez on his head which was counterbalanced by a huge red beard  at all events he must be a delusion said i pointing with a hitch of my nose to the man in question  no sir e aint wery much the rewersebut you mustnt speak sir the doctor said we was on no account to talk to you  but just tell me who he is i pleaded earnestly i cant rest unless i know  well sir i spose it wont do no arm to tell you that es a pasha sanda pasha by namea hold and hintimate friend of minethe scotch boy you know that i used to tell you about  we are livin in one of is willas  es in disgrace is sanda pasha just now an superseded the day you was took bad sir russians came into the willage an wen i come back i found em swarmin in the ouses an loopoling the walls for defence but sanda pasha came down on em with a harmy of turks an drove em out  es bin alickin of em all up an down the country ever since but the other pashas they got jealous of im specially since es not a real turk born an the first rewerse that come to imas it will come to every one now an again sirthey left im in a fix instead of sending im reinforcements so e was forced to retreat an the sultan recalled im  it do seem to me that the turkish government dont know good men when theyve got em an whats more dont deserve to ave em  but long before these things appened wen e found that you was my master an ivanka our friend e sent us to the rear with a strong guard an ere we are now in one of is willas in what part o the land is more than i can tellnear gallipopolly or somethink like that i believe  so then we are prisoners said i  well i spose we are sir or somethink o the sort but bless your art sir its of no manner of consiquence  we are treated like princes and live like fightingcocksbut you mustnt talk sir you mustnt indeed for the doctor gave strict orders that we was to keep you quiet  lanceys communications were of so surprising a nature so varied and so suggestive that my mind was overwhelmed in the mere attempt to recall what he had said in another moment i had forgotten all and dropped into a deep dreamless refreshing slumber  during the period that i was thus fighting as it were with deathin which fight through gods blessing i finally gained the victorythe fight between the russians and the turks had progressed apace victory leaning now to the former now to the latter  many bloody engagements had taken place on the plains of bulgaria and among the balkan mountains while osman pasha had carried on for some time that celebrated defence of plevna which afterwards carried him to the front rank of the turkish generals and raised him in the worlds estimation above them all  everywhere breechloading weapons torpedoes telegraphs monster cannon and novel appliances of modern warfare had proved that where hundreds fell in the days of our fathers thousands fall in our ownthat the bloody game is immensely more expensive and deadly than it used to be and that if war was folly before it is sheer madness now  the first great attack had been made on the redoubts in front of plevna and in assaulting one of these poor dobri petroff distinguished himself so highly for desperate reckless courage that he drew the special attention of general skobeleff who sent for him probably to offer him some appointment but whatever it might be the scout declined promotion or reward  his object was to seek what he styled honourable death in the front of battle  strange to say he led a sort of charmed life and the more he sought death the more it appeared to avoid him  somewhat like skobeleff himself he stood unhurt many a time when balls were whistling round him like hail and comrades were mown down in ranks and heaps around him  in all armies there are men who act with heroic valour and desperate daring  some are urged thereto by calm contempt of danger coupled with a strong sense of duty  it was something like this probably that induced skobeleff to expose himself so recklessly on almost all occasions  it was simply despair coupled with natural lionlike courage that influenced the wretched scout  nicholas naranovitsch had also acquired a name among his fellows for that grand sweeping fervour in attack which we are wont to associate with the heroes and demigods of ancient story  but nicholass motive was a compound of great physical strength hotblooded youth and a burning desire to win distinction in the path of duty  one consequence of the scouts return to headquarters was that he frequently met nicholas and felt an intense drawing towards him as being one who had shown him sympathy and kindness in that home which was now gone for ever  deep was the feeling of pity which nicholas felt when the scout told him in a few sternlyuttered sentences what had occurred at venilik and when dobri expressed a desire to attach himself to nicholas as his servant the latter was only too glad to agree  each knew the other well by report and felt that the connection would be mutually agreeable  at last one of the greatest events of the war approached  plevna had been so closely hemmed in by russian troops and cut off from supplies that the garrison was reduced to starvation  in this extremity as is well known osman pasha resolved on the desperate attempt to cut his way out of the beleaguered position  snow had fallen heavily and the ground was white with itso were the huts of the russian soldiers who welcoming the snowfall as a familiar reminiscence of home went about cooking their food and singing joyously  the houses of plevna with blue lines of smoke curling above them were faintly visible through the driving snow  now and then the sullen boom of a great gun told of the fell work that the forces had assembled there to execute  we are ordered to the front tonight dobri said nicholas as he entered his tent hurriedly unbuckled his sword and sat down to a hasty meal  our spies have brought information that osman means to play his last card  our field telegraphs have spread the news  we even know the particular point where the attempt to cut through our lines is to be made  the troops are concentrating  i have obtained leave to join the advance columns  just see that my revolvers are in order and look to your own  come after that and feed  without food a man can do nothing  the scout made no reply  ever since the terrible calamity that had befallen him he had been a taciturn semimaniac but there was a glitter in his black eye that told of latent fires and deadly purpose within  during the night another spy came in reporting that osman was concentrating his men near the bridge over the vid and that he had issued three days rations to the troops with a hundred and fifty cartridges and a new pair of sandals to each man  about the same time there came a telegram to the effect that lights were moving about with unwonted activity in plevna and something unusual was evidently afoot thus the report of the first spy was partly corroborated  meanwhile nicholas and dobri petroff mounting in the dark hours of morning rode through the snowstormwhich was gradually abatingin the direction of the bridge over the vid while skobeleff himself proceeded towards the krishina redoubts which it was reported were being abandoned  the report was true he took possession of these redoubts unopposed and instantly put them in a state of defence  meanwhile osman with his brave but wornout band made his last sortie from plevna  the grey light of a dull wintry morning broke and revealed masses like darker clouds of the threatening storm driving across the plain  these were the ottoman troopssome say 20000 menrushing like baited tigers towards the trenches  suddenly there came the thunderous roar of a hundred heavy guns followed by the crash and incessant rattle of the rifles  the deciding battle had begun  the mists of early morning mingled with the smoke of firearms so that the movements of men were not visible in many places  in others a few fighting companies were just visible showing indistinctly through the haze for a minute or two while sheets of flame played in front of their rifles like trickling lines of electric light  elsewhere from the cliffs above the vid globes of fire were seen to rend the mists as cannon played their part in the deadly game while the fearful cries of maddened and wounded men mingled with the crashing of artillery  here and there numerous bullockwagons were seen rolling slowly along and horses and cattle were galloping wildly about the plain  it was a scene that might have made the flesh of the most callous people creep with pitying horror  advancing as far as possible under cover of their bullockwagons the turks began to play their part with vigour but the russians opened on them from one of their batteries with shell and shrapnel whilst the men in the trenches sent a rain of bullets from their berdan breechloaders the terrified oxen tearing about madly or falling soon rendered the wagoncover useless  then the turks forsook it and with a wild shout charged the first line of trenches  these were held by a siberian regiment  the turks swept over them like a tornado poured into the battery where the artillerymen who stood to their guns like heroes were bayoneted almost to a man  thus the first investing circle was broken but here ottoman courage was met by irresistible force and valour quite equal to its own and here the tide of battle turned  nicholas naranovitsch despatched by general strukoff galloped towards the scene of action  come dobri he cried with blazing eyes that told of excitement almost too strong to be mastered there is work for you and me now  petroff mounted and ready awaiting the orders of his master sprang out at the summons from a troop of the first brigade of grenadiers who were at she moment preparing to advance  they dashed forward  an order had been intrusted to nicholas but he never delivered it  he was met by advancing hosts of the enemy  he turned aside intending to execute his mission if possible by a detour  in this effort he was caught up as it were and carried on by the russian grenadiers who flung themselves on the turks with irresistible fury  in another moment his horse fell under him  dobri instantly dismounted but the horse which he meant to offer to his master also fell and the two were carried onward  the opposing forces met  a handtohand fight ensuedman to man bayonet to bayonet  the turks clung to the guns in the captured battery with obstinate bravery  nicholas and dobri having both broken their sabres at the first onset seized the rifles of fallen men and laid about them with a degree of overpowering energy which conserved and expended rightly for the good of man might have made each a noted benefactor of the human race but which in this instance resulted only in the crushing in of a few dozen turkish skulls  gradually the stabbing and smashing of gods image on the part of the russians began to tell  the turks gave way and finally took to flight  but shortly before this occurred there was a desperate effort made by a handful of turks to retrieve the fortunes of the day  it was personally led by sanda pasha who reinstated by the vacillating and contemptible powers at constantinople had been senttoo lateto the relief of plevna  at the first rush the pasha fell  he was only wounded but his followers thought he was killed and stung with rage and despair fought like fiends to avenge him  at that moment the russian general rode up to a neighbouring eminence and had his attention drawn to this point in the battle  he ordered up reinforcements  nicholas and his man now seemed on the point of having their wishes gratified  poor petroffs desire to meet an honourable death had every chance of being realised while the thirst for military distinction in nicholas had at last a brilliant opportunity of being quenched  as the fight in this part of that bloody field progressed it concentrated into a knot around the two heroes  just then a fresh body of turkish infantry charged led by the nubian hamed pasha whose horse had been killed under him  dobri petroff and hamed rushed at one another instantly each seemed at once to recognise the other as a worthy foeman  the great hacked sword whistled for a few minutes round the scouts head so fast that it required his utmost agility to parry cut and thrust with his rifle but a favourable chance soon offered and he swung the stock of his piece at his adversarys head with such force as to break the sword short off at the hilt  the nubian sprang at dobri like a tiger  they grappled and these men of herculean mould were so well matched that for a few seconds they stood quivering with mighty but fruitless efforts to bear each other down  it was at this moment that the russian reinforcements came up fired a volley and charged  dobri and hamed dropped side by side pierced with bullets  nicholas also fell  the raging hosts passed over them and the turks were driven over the plain like autumn leaves before the gale  immediately after a battery of horse artillery swept across the hotlycontested ground the wheels of the heavy ordnance and the hoofs of the halfmad horses crashing over the heads said limbs of all who chanced to lie in their way  oh it is bitter to reflect on the grand courage that is misdisplayed in the accursed service of war  beaten overwhelmed crushed all but annihilated the poor peasantsoldiers of turkey who probably knew nothing whatever about the cause for which they fought took shelter at last behind the broken wagons under which they had advanced and then turned at bay  others made for the deep banks of the vid where they reformed and instantly began to return the russian fire  the sortie was now virtually repulsed  it was about halfpast eight the turks evidently apprehensive that the enemy would charge and drive them back into the gorge which led to plevna remained on the defensive the russians obviously afraid lest the enemy should attempt another sortie also remained on the defensive  for four hours they continued in this condition during which period the battle raged it was said with the utmost fury but it is also admitted that very little damage was done to either side for both armies were under cover  in other words the belligerents remained for four hours in the condition of a couple of angry costermongers hooting and howling at each other without coming to blows while shot and shell and powder and lead were being expended for nothing at a rate which added thousands sterling to the burdens of the peaceloving members of both countries  about twelve oclock according to an eyewitness the firing began to diminish on both sides as if by mutual agreement  i have a very thorough appreciation of this idea of mutual agreement it is well known among schoolboys  when two of these specimens of the rising generation have been smashing each others faces blackening each others eyes and bleeding each others noses for threequarters of an hour without having decided a victory they both feel a strong desire to stop are ready to give in and on the smallest encouragement from seconds will shake hands  indeed this wellknown and somewhat contemptible state of mind is familiar to a larger growth of boys happily not in englandcalled duellists  we deliberately call the state of mind contemptible because if a matter is worth fighting for physically it ought to be fought for to the bitter end  if it is not worth fighting for there should be no fighting at all  however as i have said the fire began to slacken about midday and then gradually ceased  the silence that succeeded was deeply impressivealso suggestive  halfanhour later a white flag was seen waving from the road that ran round the cliffs beyond the bridge  plevna had fallen  osman pasha and his army had surrendered  in other wordsthe fate of the turkish empire was sealed    chapter twenty three  woe to the auburn hair  after the battleprowling villains punished  when the white flag was seen a loud shout went up from the russian army then a party of officers rode forward and two turkish horsemen were seen advancing  they stated that osman himself was coming to treat with the russians  the spot on which they stood was covered with the grim relics of battle the earth had been uptorn by exploding shells  here lay a horse groaning and struggling in its agony  close to it lay an ox silently bleeding to death his great round patient eyes looking mournfully at the scene around him  close by was a cart with a dead horse lying in the yoke as he had fallen and a turkish soldier stretched alongside whose head had been carried away by a cannon shot  under the wagon was a wounded man and close to him four others who drained of nearly all their lifeblood lay crouched together in helplessness with the hoods of their ragged grey overcoats drawn down on their faces  these latter gazed at the murky sky in listless indifference or at what was going on in a sort of weary surprise  among them was nicholas naranovitsch  russian surgeons were already moving about the field of battle doing what they could but their efforts were trifling compared with the vast necessity  at last there was a shout of osman  he comes  we will give him a respectful reception exclaimed one russian officer in what is supposed by some to be the gallant spirit of true chivalry  that we will cried another we must all salute him and the soldiers must present arms  he is a great soldier exclaimed a third and has made a heroic defence  even skobeleff himself seems to have been carried away by the feeling of the moment if we may credit report for he is said to have exclaimed  he is the greatest general of the age for he has saved the honour of his country i will proffer him my hand and tell him so  so thought i when afterwards meditating on this subject the turks have for centuries proved themselves to be utterly unworthy of selfgovernment they have shown themselves to be ignorant of the first principles of righteousnessmeum and tuum they or rather their rulers have violated their engagements and deceived those who trusted them have of late repudiated their debts and murdered robbed violated tortured those who differed from them in religious opinions as is generally admittednevertheless now because one of their generals has shown somewhat superior ability to the rest holding in check a powerful enemy and exhibiting with his men a degree of bulldog courage which though admirable in itself all history proves to be a common characteristic of all nationsthat honour which the country never possessed is supposed to have been saved  all honour to the brave truly but when i remember the butcheries that are admitted by friend and foe of the turk to have been committed on the russian wounded by the army of plevna and which seem to have been conveniently forgotten at this dramatic incident of the surrender when i reflect on the frightful indifference of osman pasha to his own wounded and the equally horrible disregard of the same hapless wounded by the russians after they entered plevnai cannot but feel that a desperate amount of error is operating here and that multitudes of mankind especially innocent loving and gentle mankind to say nothing of tender enthusiastic loveblinded womankind are to some extent deceived by the false ring of that which is not metal and the falser glitter of a tinsel which is anything but gold  however osman did not come after all  he had been wounded and the russian generals were obliged to go to a neighbouring cottage to transact the business of surrender  as the cavalcade rode away in the direction of the cottage referred to a russian surgeon turned aside to aid a wounded man  he was a tall strapping trooper  his head rested on the leg of his horse which lay dead beside him  he could not have been more than twenty years of age if so much  he had carefully wrapped his cloak round him  his carbine and sabre were drawn close to his side as if to protect the weapons which it had always been his pride to keep bright and clean  he was a fresh handsome lad with courage and loveableness equally stamped upon his young brow  he opened his eyes languidly as the doctor attended to him  come my fine fellow keep up your heart said the doctor tenderly you will perhapsthat is to say the ambulancewagons will be round immediately and  thank you interrupted the trooper quietly gods blessing rest upon you  i know what you meanlook sir  he tried to take a locket from his neck as he spoke but could not  the doctor gently assisted him  see he said take this to dobri petroffthe scout  you know him  every one knows dashing dobri  i know him  well  tell him to give it to herhe knows whoandandsay it has kept me inin heaven when sometimes it seemed to me as if i had got into hell  from whom asked the doctor anxiously as the youths head sank forward and the terrible pallor of approaching death came on  from andre  alas alas for maria with the auburn hair  the doctor rose  his services were no longer needed  mounting his horse he rode away  the ground over which he galloped was strewn with weapons  the formal surrender had been made and each turk obeying literally the order to lay down his arms had deposited his rifle in the mud where he stood  that night a faint light shone through the murky clouds and dimly illumined the grim battlefield  it was deserted by all but the dead and dying with now and then a passing picket or fatigueparty  as the night advanced and the cold became piercing even these seemed to have finally retired from the ghastly scene  towards morning the moon rose high and piercing the clouds at times lit up the whole battlefield  ah there was many a pale countenance turned wistfully on the moon that night gazing at it until the eyes became fixed in death  there was one countenance which deadly white and gashed by a turkish sabre had been ruddy with young life in the morning  it was that of nicholas naranovitsch  he lay on his back near his dead horse and close to a heap of slaughtered men he was so faint and so shattered by sabrecuts and bullets as to be utterly unable to move anything but his eyes  though almost in a state of stupor he retained sufficient consciousness to observe what went on around him  the night or rather the early morning had become very still but it was not silent for deep sighs and low moanings as of men suffering from prolonged and weary pain struck on his listening ear now and then some wretch unable to bear his misery would make a desperate effort to rise only however to fall back with a sharp cry or a deepdespairing groan  here and there a man might be seen creeping a few paces on his hands and knees and then dropping to rest for a time after which the creeping was resumed in the vain hope no doubt that some place of shelter or an ambulance might be reached at last one of these struggling men passed close to nicholas and stopped to rest almost at his side  in a few minutes he rose again and attempted to advance but instead of doing so writhed in a hideous contortion over on his back and stretching himself with a convulsive shudder died with his teeth clenched and his protruding eyeballs glaring at the sky  suddenly a low sweet sound broke on nicholass ear  it swelled gradually and was at length recognised as a hymn with which he had been familiar in childhood  some dying christian soldier near him had apparently sought relief in singing praise to god  nicholas wept as he listened  he soon found that there were sympathetic listeners besides himself for the strains were taken up by one and another and another until the hymn appeared to rise from all parts of the battlefield  it was faint however and tremulous for the lifeblood was draining rapidly from the hearts of those who raised it  ere long it altogether ceased  for some time nicholas had been aware that a wounded man was slowly gasping out his life quite close to him but from the position in which he lay it was not possible to see more than his red fez  presently the man made a powerful effort raised himself on one elbow and displayed the ghastly black countenance of hamed pasha  he looked unsteadily round him for a moment and then sank backward with a longdrawn sigh  close to him under a heap of slain dobri petroff himself lay  for a long time he was unconscious and had been nearly crushed to death by the weight of those above him  but the life which had been so strong in his huge body seemed to revive a little and after a time he succeeded in freeing himself from the load and raising himself on his hands but he could not get up on his feet  a wound in the neck which had partly closed while he was in a recumbent position now burst out afresh  he looked at the blood with a faint sad smile and sank down again  nicholas recognised him and tried to speak but he could neither speak nor move  it seemed to him that every part of his frame had been paralysed except his brain and eyes  presently the scout felt for something at his side  his flask was there putting it to his lips he drank a little and was evidently refreshed for he raised himself again and began to look about him  another moment and petroff had discovered the pasha who lay near him with a look of intense longing in his eyes as he saw the flask and heard the gurgling water  a fierce frown crossed the scouts brow for a moment but it was instantly chased away by a look of pity  he dragged himself slowly towards the dying turk and held the flask to his lips  with a murmur of thankfulness and a look of gratitude at his late enemy the pasha uttered a faint sigh and closed his eyes in the last long sleep of death  the effort to drag himself even a few paces served to show petroff how severely he had been wounded  he was in the act of raising the flask to his lips a second time when nicholas by a desperate effort succeeded in uttering a low groan  the scout turned quickly observed his master and crept to his side  drink sir he said knowing well that water was what nicholas required most at such a time  the avidity with which the latter obeyed prevented him observing that the scout was almost sinking  the successive efforts he had made had caused the blood to pour copiously from his wounds  you are badly hurt dobri i fear he said when the lifegiving draught had sent new vigour into his frame and loosed his tongue  ay replied the scout with a faint smilei shall soon be with you now marika and with the little ones and the dear lord you loved so well and tried so hard to make me follow too  and you succeeded marika though you little th  he stopped abruptly swayed a moment to and fro then fell heavily forward with his head on the bosom of his friend  take some more water dobri said nicholas anxiously  quick before you lose consciousness  i have not power to move a limb to help you dobri  he called in vainthe scout had fainted  nicholas had not power at first to remove the poor fellows head from his chest and he felt as if he should be suffocated  by degrees however he managed to roll it slightly to one side and at the same time returning vigour enabled him to raise his right arm  he observed that his hand still grasped a revolver but for some time he had no power to unclasp it  at last he succeeded and raising petroffs flask with difficulty to his lips obtained another draught  just at that moment the moon which had passed behind a dark cloud shone through an opening and he saw three men not far off searching among the dead  he was about to call to them but a thought occurred and he restrained himself  he was right the three men one of whom was habited like a priest were rifling the dead  he saw them come up to a prostrate form which struggled on being touched  one of the three men instantly drew a knife and stabbed the wounded man  when they had searched the body and taken from it what they required they came towards the spot where nicholas lay  a feeling of horror came over him for a moment but that seemed to give him strength for he instantly grasped his revolver  hoping however that they might pass without observing him he shut his eyes and lay quite still  the three murderers drew near talking in low tones and seemed about to pass when one of them stopped  heres a biglooking fellow whose boots will just fit me he said stooping and seizing the scouts leg  theres an officer behind him said the villain in the priests dress he will be more worth stripping  nicholas pointed his revolver full in the mans face and fired but his aim was unsteady  he had missed  again he pulled the trigger but it had been the last shot  the man sprang upon him  the report however had attracted the notice of a picket of russian soldiers who well aware of the deeds of foul villainy that are practised by the followers of an army on battlefields at night immediately rushed up and secured the three men  they are murderers exclaimed nicholas in reply to a question from the sergeant in command  lead them out said the sergeant promptly  the men were bound and set up in a row  readypresent  a volley rang out in the night air and three more corpses were added to the deathroll of the day  it was summary justice but richly deserved  thereafter the soldiers made a roughandready stretcher of muskets on which nicholas who had fainted was carefully laid and borne from the field    chapter twenty four  farewell to sanda pashaa scuffle and an unexpected meeting  some time after the events narrated in the last chapter i was seated in an apartment of sanda pashas residence in adrianople the turkish city next in importance to constantinople  my health had returned and although still somewhat weak i felt sufficiently strong to travel and had once or twice urged my kind host who was fast recovering from his wound to permit me if possible to return to the russian lines  i had had from him of course a full account of the fall of plevna and i had also learned from another source that nicholas had been desperately wounded but the latter information was a mere rumour which only rendered me the more anxious to get away  the pashas chief secretary who spoke russian well informed me at this time of some of the doings of his countrymen in the city and neighbourhood  i could hardly credit him but english correspondents afterwards confirmed what he said  the daily executions of bulgarians on the slightest pretexts without trial were at that time so numerous that it seemed as if the turks had determined to solve the question of bulgarian autonomy by killing or banishing every male in the province in one instance fifteen bulgarian children the youngest of whom was ten years of age and the eldest fifteen were condemned to hard labour for life  it was said but not proved i believe that these young people had committed murder and contributed to the insurrection  at this time there were over 20000 refugees in adrianople all of whom were women and children whose protectors had either been massacred or forced to join the army  the secretary evidently rejoiced in the slaying and otherwise getting rid of bulgarian men but he seemed to have a slight feeling of commiseration for the helpless refugees among whom i had myself witnessed the most heartrending scenes of mental and physical suffering  wherever i wandered about the town there were groups of these trembling ones on whose pallid faces were imprinted looks of maniacal horror or of blank despair  little wonder  some of them had beheld the fathers brothers lovers around whom their heartstrings twined tortured to death before their eyes  others had seen their babes tossed on spearpoints and bayonets while to all the future must have appeared a fearful prospect of want and of dreary sighing for a touch of those vanished hands that had passed from earth for ever  philanthropic societies said the secretary have done great things for turkey and for russia too  had it not been for the timely aid sent out by the charitable people in england and other countries it is certain that many thousands of these refugees would already have been in their graves  i did not like the tone or looks of this secretary  he was an oily man with a touch of sarcasm  doubtless there are many of them i returned sharply who wish that they had fallen with their kindred  but you say truth the tenderhearted and liberal ones of england and elsewhere have done something to mitigate the horrors of war and yet there is a party among us who would draw the sword if they were allowed and add to the number of these wretched refugees  a pretty spectacle of consistency truly is presented by war  if we english were to join the turks as of course you wish us to do and help you to maintain your misrule to say nothing of the massacres which have been and still are going on around us we should have to keep our philanthropic societies at work still longer and thus we should be seen cutting men down with one hand and binding them up with the otherroaring like fiends as we slaughter sires and at the same time with the same voice softly comforting widows and fatherless children  oh sir if there is a phrase of mockery on the face of this earth it is the term civilised warfare  before the secretary had time to reply the pasha entered accompanied by lancey  mr childers said the pasha sitting down on a cushion beside me i have managed it at last though not without difficulty but when a man wants to help an old schoolmate in distress he is not easily put down you have to thank lancey for anything i have done for you  there is it seems to be an exchange of prisoners soon and i have managed that you and lancey shall be among the number  you must be ready to take the road tomorrow  i thanked the pasha heartily but expressed surprise that one in so exalted a position should have found difficulty in the matter  exalted he exclaimed with a look of scorn im so exalted as to have very narrowly missed having my head cut off  bah there is no gratitude in a turkat least in a turkish grandee  i ventured to suggest that the pasha was in his own person a flator rather sturdycontradiction of his own words but he only grinned as he bowed being too much in earnest to smile  do you forget he continued that i am in disgrace  i have served the turk faithfully all my life and now i am shelved at the very time my services might be of use because the sultan is swayed by a set of rascals who are jealous of me  and is it not the same with better men than myself  look at mehemet ali our late commanderinchief deposed from office by men who had not the power to judge of his capacitiesfor what  did he not say with his own lips to one of your own correspondents that although he had embraced the religion of mohammed they never could forget or forgive the fact that he was not born a turk but regarded him as a giaour in disguise that his elevation to power excited secret discontent among the pashas which i know to be true that another pasha thwarted instead of aiding him while yet another was sent to act the spy on him  is not this shameful jealousy amongst our leaders at a time when all should have been united for the common weal well known to have operated disastrously in other cases  did not osman pasha admit as much when he complained bitterly after the fall of plevna that he had not been properly supported  our rank and file are lions in the fieldthough i cannot allow that they are lambs anywhere elsebut as for ourbah  i have said enough  besides to tell you the truth i am tired of the turks and hate them  here my servant interrupted the pasha with a coolness and familiarity that amused me much  sandy said he with a disapproving shake of the head you oughtnt to go an speak like that of your hadopted nation  the pashas indignation vanished at once  he turned to lancey with a curious twinkle in his eye  but my good fellow he said it isnt my hadopted nation  when i came here a poor homeless wanderer the turks adopted me not i them because they found me useful  that returned lancey should ave called hout your gratitood  so it did lancey  didnt i serve them faithfully from that day to this to the best of my power and didnt i shave my head and wear their garb and pretend to take to their religion all out of gratitude  worse and worse retorted lancey that was houtrageous ypocrisy im afraid sandy that youre no better than you used to be wen you smashed the schoolwindows an went about playin truant on the scottish ills  no better indeed returned the pasha with a sudden touch of sadness that is true but how to become better is the difficulty  islamism fills a land with injustice robbery and violence while in order that such things may be put right the same land is desolated covered with blood and filled with lamentation in the name of christianity  here i could not refrain from reminding the pasha that the professors of religion did not always act in accordance with their profession and that the principles of the prince of peace when carried out even with average sincerity had an invariable tendency to encourage peace and goodwill among men which was more than could be said of the doctrines of mohammed  it may be so said the pasha with a sigh  meanwhile to return to our point you will find everything ready for your journey at an early hour tomorrow  but what of little ivanka petroff  i asked  she must go with us  the pasha seemed a little perplexed  i had not thought of that he said she will be wellcared for here  i cannot go without her said i firmly  no more can i said lancey  well that shall also be arranged returned the pasha as he left us  never saw nothink like im observed lancey e sticks at nothink believes nothink cares for nothink an can do hanythink  you are showing want of gratitude now lancey for it is plain that he cares a good deal for you  lancey admitted that he might perhaps have been a little harsh in expressing himself and then went off to prepare for the journey  we are going back again to your own country ivanka said i gently stroking the childs head as we sat together in the same room some hours later  ivanka raised her large eyes to mine  there is no home now she said in a mournful voice  but we shall find father there perhaps  the child dropped her eyes and shook her head but made no further remark  i saw that tears were trickling down her cheeks and feeling uncertain as to how far she realised her forlorn condition refrained from further speech and drew her little head upon my breast while i sought to comfort her with hopes of soon meeting her father  snow lay on the ground when we bade farewell to our kind host goodbye sanda pasha i shall hope to see you in england one of these days said i at parting  farewell sandy said my man grasping the pashas hand warmly and speaking in a deeply impressive tone take the advice of a wery old friend who as your welfare at art an leave off your evil ways wich its not possible for you to do wile youve got fifty wives more or less shaves your ead like a turk and hacts the part of a ypocrite  come back to your own land my friend wich is the only one i knows on worth livin in an dress yourself like a christian  the pasha laughed returned the squeeze heartily and said that it was highly probable he would act upon that advice ere another year had passed away  half an hour later we were driving over the white plains on which the sun shone with dazzling light  i felt unusual exhilaration as we rattled along in the fresh frosty air and crossed the fields which with the silvered trees and bushes contrasted so pleasantly with the clear blue sky  i began to feel as if the horrible scenes i had lately witnessed were but the effects of a disordered imagination which had passed away with fever and bodily weakness  ivanka also appeared to revive under those genial influences with which god surrounds his creatures for she prattled a little now and then about things which attracted her attention on the road but she never referred to the past  lancey too was inspirited to such an extent that he tackled the turkish driver in his own tongue and caused the eyes of that taciturn individual occasionally to twinkle and his moustache to curl upwards  that night we slept at a small roadside inn  next day we joined a group of travellers and thus onward we went until we reached the region where the war raged  here we were placed under escort and with some others were exchanged and set free  immediately i hired a conveyance and proceeded to the russian rear where i obtained a horse and leaving ivanka in charge of lancey at an inn hastened to headquarters to make inquiries about nicholas and petroff  on the way however i halted to telegraph to the scottish bawbee and to write a brief account of my recent experiences among the turks  i was in the midst of a powerful articlepowerful of course because of the subjecton one of the warepisodes when i heard a foot on the staircase  i had placed my revolver on the table for i was seated in a room in a deserted village  one wall of the room had been shattered by a shell while most of the furniture was more or less broken by the same missile and i knew well that those sneakmarauders who infest the rear of an army were in the habit of prowling about such places  suddenly i heard a loud shout on the staircase followed by the clashing of swords  i leaped up seized the revolver and ran out  one man stood on the stair defending himself against two circassians  i knew the scoundrels instantly by their dress and not less easily did i recognise a countryman in the grey tweed shooting coat glengarry cap and knickerbockers of the other  at the moment of my appearance the englishman who was obviously a dexterous swordsman had inflicted a telling wound on one of his adversaries  i fired at the other who leaping nearly his own height into the air fell with a crash down the staircase  he sprang up however instantly and both men bolted out at the front door and fled  the englishman turned to thank me for my timely aid but instead of speaking looked at me with amused surprise  can it be  i exclaimed not possible you biquitous  i told you we should probably meet he replied sheathing his sword but i was not prophetic enough to foretell the exact circumstances of the meeting  come along my dear fellow said i seizing his arm and dragging him upstairs how glad i am what an unexpectedoh never mind the look of the room its pretty tight in most places and ive stuffed my overcoat into the shellhole  dont apologise for your quarters jeff returned my friend laying his sword and revolver on the table the house is a palace compared with some places ive inhabited of late  the last for instance was so filthy that i believe on my conscience an irish pig with an average allowance of selfrespect would have declined to occupy ithere it is youll find it somewhere near the middle  he handed me a small sketchbook and while i turned over the leaves busied himself in filling a short meerschaum  why how busy you must have been said i turning over the wellfilled book with interest  slightly so he replied  some of these will look pretty well i flatter myself in the evergreen isle if they are well engraved but that is the difficulty  no matter how carefully we correspondents execute our sketches some of these engraversi wont say all of them make an awful mess of em  yes you may well laugh at that one  it was taken under fire and i can tell you that a sketch made under fire is apt to turn out defective in drawing  that highly effective and happy accidental touch in the immediate foreground i claim no credit for  it was made by a bullet which first knocked the pencil out of my hand and then terminated the career of my best horse while that sunny gleam in the middle distance was caused by a piece of yellow clay being driven across it by the splinter of a shell  on the whole i think the sketch will hardly do for the evergreen though it is worth keeping as a reminiscence  my friend and i now sat down in front of a comfortable fire fed with logs from the roof of a neighbouring hut but we had not chatted long before he asked me the object of my visit to headquarters  to inquire about my friend nicholas karanovitsch i said  from the sudden disappearance of the look of careless pleasantry from my friends face and the grave earnest tone in which he spoke i saw that he had bad news to tell  have you not heard he said and paused  not dead  i exclaimed  no not dead but desperately wounded  he went on in a low rapid voice to relate all the circumstances of the case with which the reader is already acquainted first touching on the chief points to relieve my feelings  nicholas was not dead but so badly wounded that there was no chance of his ever again attaining to the semblance of his old self  the doctors however had pronounced him at last out of danger  his sound constitution and great strength had enabled him to survive injuries which would have carried off most men in a few days or hours  his whole frame had been shattered his handsome face dreadfully disfigured his left hand carried away and his right foot so grievously crushed by a guncarriage passing over it that they had been obliged to amputate the leg below the knee  for a long time he had lain balancing between life and death and when he recovered sufficiently to be moved had been taken by rail to switzerland  he had given strict orders that no one should be allowed to write to his friends in england but had asked very anxiously after me  biquitous gave me a great many more particulars but this was the gist of his sad news  he also told me of the fall of dobri petroff  nicholas had fainted as i told you he said just before the picket by which he had been rescued lifted him from the ground and he was greatly distressed on recovering to find that his faithful follower had been left behind  although he believed him to be dead he immediately expressed an earnest wish that men should be sent to look for and recover the body  they promised that this should be done but he never learned whether or not they had been successful  and you dont know the name of the place in switzerland to which nicholas has been sent  i asked  not sure but i think it was montreux on the lake of geneva  after all this sad news i found it impossible to enjoy the society of my eccentric friend and much though i liked him resolved to leave the place at once and make arrangements to quit the country  i therefore bade him farewell and hastened back to the inn where i had left ivanka and lancey  the grief of the dear child on hearing that her father had fallen on the battlefield was for a time uncontrollable  when it had abated i said  there is no one here to love you now my little darling but god still loves you and you see has sent me and lancey to take care of you come we will return to venilik  i did not dare at this time to raise hopes which might soon be dashed to pieces in the heart of the poor forlorn child and therefore did not say all that was in my mind but my object in returning to venilik was to make inquiry after her mother  my own hopes were not strong but i did not feel satisfied that we had obtained sufficient proof that marika had been killed  our search and inquiries however were vain  venilik was almost deserted  no one could tell anything about the petroff family that we did not already know  it was certainly known that many personsmen and womenhad fled to the neighbouring woods and that some had escaped but it was generally believed that marika had been burnt in her own cottage  no doubt however was entertained as to the fate of her little boy for there were several people who had seen him thrust through and held aloft on the point of a circassian spear  when i told of dobri petroff having fallen by the side of nicholas several of the villagers said they had heard of that from other sources  as nothing further could be done i resolved to adopt ivanka and take her away with me  my preparations were soon made a conveyance was obtained and before many days were over i found myself flying by road and rail far from the land where war still raged where the fair face of nature had been so terribly disfigured by human wrathso fearfully oppressed with human woe    chapter twenty five  describes a wreck and the triumph of love  a swiss chalet on a woody knoll high up on the grand slopes that bathe their feet in the beautiful lake of geneva  it is eveninga bright winter eveningwith a golden glory in the sky which reminds one powerfully of summer and suggests the advent of spring  in the neighbouring town of montreux there are busy people engaged in the labours of the day  there are also idlers endeavouring to kill the little span of time that has been given them in which to do their quota of duty on the earth  so also there are riotous young people who are actively fulfilling their duty by going off to skate or slide down the snowclad hills after the severer duties connected with book and slate have been accomplished  these young rioters are aided and abetted by sundry persons of maturer years who having already finished the more important labours of the day of life renew their own youth and encourage the youngsters by joining them  besides these there are a few cripples who have been sent into the world with deficient or defective limbsdoubtless for wise and merciful ends merciful i say advisedly for shall not the judge of all the earth do right  these look on and rejoice perchance in the joy of the juveniles  among them however are some cripples of a very different stamp  the creator sent these into the world with broad shoulders deep chests good looks gladsome spirits manly frames and vigorous wills  war has sent them herestill in young manhoodwith the deep chests pierced by bullets or gashed by sabres with the manly frames reduced to skeletons the gladsome spirits gone the ruddy cheeks hollow and wan and the vigorous willssubdued at last  a few of these young cripples move slowly about with the aid of stick or crutch trying to regain in the genial mountain air some of the old fire which has sunk so lowso very low  others seated in wheelchairs doubled up like old old men are pushed about from point to point by stalwart mountaineers while beside them walk sisters mothers or perchance young wives whose cheery smiles and lightsome voices as they point out and refer to the surrounding objects of nature cannot quite conceal the feelings of profound and bitter sorrow with which they think of the glorious manhood that has been lost or the tender pitiful heartbreaking solicitude with which they cherish the poor shadow that remains  in a large airy apartment of the chalet on the woody knoll there is one who occupies a still lower level than those to whom we have just referredwho cannot yet use the crutch or sit in the wheelchair and on whose ear the sounds of glee that enter by the open window fall with little effect  he reclines at full length on a bed  he has lain thus with little effort to move and much pain when such effort was made for many weary weeks  only one side of his face is visible and that is scarred and torn with wounds some of which are not yet healed  the other side is covered with bandages  i am seated by his side ivanka is sitting opposite near to the invalids feet listening intently if i may be allowed to say so with her large black eyes to a conversation which she cannot understand  you must not take so gloomy a view of your case nicholas  the doctors say you will recover and my good fellow you have no idea what can be done by surgery in the way of putting a man together again after a breakdown  bella would be grieved beyond measure if i were to write as you wish  i spoke cheerily more because i felt it to be a duty to do so than because i had much hope  the invalid paused for a few minutes as if to recover strength  then he said  jeff i insist on your doing what i wish  it is unkind of you to drag me into a dispute when i am so weak  tell the dear girl that i give her upi release her from our engagement  it is likely that i shall die at any rate which will settle the question but if i do recoverwhy just think my dear fellow i put it to you what sort of husband should i make with my ribs all smashed my right leg cut off my left hand destroyed an eye gone and my whole visage cut to pieces  no jeff  he paused the light vein of humour which he had tried to assume passed off and there was a twitching about the muscles of his mouth as he resumed  no bella must never see me again  ivanka looked from the invalids face to mine with eyes so earnest piercing and inquiring that i felt grieved she did not understand us  im sorry nicholas very sorry said i but bella has already been written to and will certainly be here in a day or two  i could not know your state of mind on my first arrival and acting as i fancied for the best i wrote to her  nicholas moved uneasily and i observed a deep flush on his face but he did not speak  that evening ivanka put her arms round my neck told me she loved nicholas because of his kindness to her father and besought me earnestly to tell her what had passed between us  a good deal amused i told her as much as i thought she could understand  oh  i should so like to see bella she said  so you shall dear when she comes  does she speak russian  yes  she has been several times in russia and understands the language well  as i had predicted bella arrived a few days after receiving my letter my mother accompanied her  oh jeff this is dreadful said my poor mother as she untied her bonnetstrings and sat down on the sofa beside bella who could not for some time utter a word  what child is that added my mother quickly observing ivanka  it is the daughter of dobri petrofflet me introduce you ivanka to my mother and to my sister bellayou know bella  i had of course written to them a good deal about the poor child and bella had already formed an attachment to her in imagination  she started up on hearing ivankas name and held out both hands  the child ran to her as naturally as the needle turns to the pole  while my mother and i were talking in a low tone about nicholas i could not avoid hearing parts of a conversation between my sister and ivanka that surprised me much  yes oh yes i am quite sure of it  your brother told me that he said he would never never never be so wicked as to let you come and see him although he loved you so much that he  hush my dear child not so loud  bellas whisper died away and ivanka resumed  yes he said there was almost nothing of him left  he was joking you know when he said that but it is not so much of a joke after all for i saw  oh hush dear hush tell me what he said and speak lower  ivanka spoke so low that i heard no more but what had reached my ear was sufficient to let me know how the current ran and i was not sorry that poor bellas mind should be prepared for the terrible reality in this way  the battle of love was fought and won that day at nicholass bedside and as usual woman was victorious  i shall not weary the reader with all that was said  the concluding sentences will suffice  no nicholas said bella holding the right hand of the wounded soldier while my mother looked on with tearful and ivanka with eager eyes no i will not be discarded  you must not presume on the strength of your being weak to talk nonsense  i hold you sir to your engagement unless indeed you admit yourself to be a faithless man and wish to cast me off  but you must not dispute with me in your present condition  i shall exercise the right of a wife by ordering you to hold your tongue unless you drop the subject  the doctor says you must not be allowed to talk or excite yourself and the doctors orders you know must be obeyed  even if he should order a shattered man to renounce all thoughts of marriage asked nicholas  if he were to do that retorted bella with a smile i should consider your case a serious one and require a consultation with at least two other doctors before agreeing to submit to his orders  now the question is settled so we will say no more about it  meanwhile you need careful nursing and mother and i are here to attend upon you  thus with gentle raillery she led the poor fellow to entertain a faint hope that recovery might be possible and that the future might not be so appallingly black as it had seemed before  still the hope was extremely faint at first for no one knew so well as himself what a wreck he was and how impossible it would be for him under the most favourable circumstances ever again to stand up and look like his former self  poor bella had to force her pleasantry and her lightsome tones for she also had fears that he might still succumb but being convinced that a cheerful hopeful state of mind was the best of all medicines she set herself to administer it in strong doses  the result was that nicholas began to recover rapidly  time passed and by slow degrees he migrated from his bed to the sofa  then a few of his garments were put on and he tried to stand on his remaining leg  the doctor who assisted me in moving and dressing the poor invalid comforted him with the assurance that the stump of the other would in course of time be well enough to have a cork foot and ankle attached to it  and do you know he added with a smile they make these things so well now that one can scarcely tell a false foot from a real onewith joint and moveable instep and toes that work with springs so that people can walk with them quite creditablyindeed they can i do not jest i assure you  nothing however can replace the left hand or the lost eye returned nicholas with a faint attempt at a smile  there my dear sir returned the doctor with animation you are quite wrong  the eye indeed can never be restored though it will partially close and become so familiar to you and your friends that it will almost cease to be noticed or remembered but we shall have a stump made for the lower arm with a socket to which you will be able to fix a fork or a spoon or  why doctor interrupted nicholas what a spoon you must be to  come returned the doctor heartily thatll do  my services wont be required here much longer i see for i invariably find that when a patient begins to make bad jokes there is nothing far wrong with him  one morning when we had dressed our invalid and laid him on the sofa he and i chanced to be left alone  come here jeff he said assist me to the glassi want to have a look at myself  it was the first time he had expressed such a desire and i hesitated for a moment not feeling sure of the effect that the sight might have on him  then i went to him and only remarking in a quiet tone youll improve you know in the course of time i led him to the lookingglass  he turned slightly pale and a look of blank surprise flitted across his face but he recovered instantly and stood for a few seconds surveying himself with a sad expression  well might he look sad for the figure that met his gaze stooped like that of an aged man the head was shorn of its luxuriant curls the terrible sabrecut across the cheek from the temple to the chin which had destroyed the eye had left a livid wound a single glance at which told that it would always remain as a ghastly blemish and there were other injuries of a slighter nature on various parts of the face which marred his visage dreadfully  yes jeff he said turning away slowly with a sigh and limping back to his couch theres room for improvement  i thought myself not a badlooking fellow once  its no great matter to have that fancy taken out of me perhaps but i grieve for bella and i really do think that you must persuade her to give up all idea of  now nic said i dont talk nonsense  but i dont talk nonsense he exclaimed flushing with sudden energy i mean what i say  do you suppose i can calmly allow that dear girl to sacrifice herself to a mere wreck that cannot hope to be long a cumberer of the ground  and do you suppose i retorted with vehemence that i can calmly allow my sister to be made a widow for lifea widow i say for she is already married to you in spirit and nothing will ever induce her to untie the knot  you dont know bellaah you neednt smileyou dont indeed  she is the most perversely obstinate girl i ever met with last night when i mentioned to her that you had been speaking of yourself as a mere wreck she said in a low easygoing meek tone jeff i mean to cling to that wreck as long as it will float and devote my life to repairing it  now when bella says anything in a low easygoing and especially in a meek tone it is utterly useless to oppose her she has made up her mind drawn her sword and flung away the scabbard doubleshotted all her guns charged every torpedo in the ship and finally nailed her colours to the mast  then said nicholas with a laugh i suppose i must give in  yes my boy you had better  if you dont just think what will be the consequences  first of all you will die sooner than there is any occasion for then bella will pine mope get into bad health and gradually fade away  that will break down my mother whose susceptible spirit could not withstand the shock  of course after that my own health would give way and the hopes of a dear littlewell that is to say ruination and widespread misery would be the result of your unnatural and useless obstinacy  to save you all from that said nicholas of course i must give in  and nicholas did give in and the result was not half so disastrous as he had feared    chapter twenty six  some more of wars consequences  let us turn once more to the balkan mountains  snow covers alike the valley and the hill  it is the depth of that inhospitable season when combative men were wont in former days to retire into winter quarters repose on their laurels and rest a while until the benign influences of spring should enable them to recommence the glorious work of slaying one another  but modern warriors like modern weapons are more terrible now than they used to be  they scout inglorious reposeat least the great statesmen who send them out to battle scout it for them  while these men of superspartan mould sit at home in comfortable conclave over mild cigar and bubbling hookah quibbling over words the modern warrior is ordered to prolong the conflict and thus it comes to pass that muscovite and moslem pour out their blood like water and change the colour of the balkan snows  in a shepherds hut far up the heights which the smoke of battle could not reach and where the din of deadly strife came almost softly like the muttering of distant thunder a young woman sat on the edge of a couch gazing wistfully at the beautiful countenance of a dead girl  the watcher was so very pale wan and haggard that but for her attitude and the motion of her great dark eyes she also might have been mistaken for one of the dead  it was marika who escaped with only a slight fleshwound in the arm from the soldier who had pursued her into the woods near her burning home  a young man sat beside her also gazing in silence at the marble countenance  no petko no said marika looking at the youth mournfully i cannot stay here  as long as the sister of my preserver lived it was my duty to remain but now that the bullet has finished its work i must go  it is impossible to rest  but marika urged petko borronow taking his friends hand you know it is useless to continue your search  the man who told me said he had it from the lips of captain naranovitsch himself that dear dobri died at plevna with his head resting on the captains breast and  the youth could not continue  yes yes returned marika with a look and tone of despair i know that dobri is dead i saw my darling boy slain before my eyes and heard ivankas dying scream no wonder that my brain has reeled so long  but i am strong now  i feel as if the lord were calling on me to go forth and work for himself since i have no one else to care for  had giuana lived i would have stayed to nurse her but  oh that the fatal ball had found my heart instead of hers cried the youth clasping his hands and gazing at the tranquil countenance on the bed  better as it is said marika in a low voice  if you had been killed she would have fallen into the hands of the bashibazouks and that would have been worsefar worse  the lord does all things well  he gave and he has taken awayoh let us try to say blessed be his name  she paused for a few minutes and then continued  yes petko i must go  there is plenty of work in these days for a christian woman to do  surely i should go mad if i were to remain idle you have work here i have none therefore i must go  nurses are wanted in the ambulance corps of ourourdeliverers  there was no sarcasm in poor marikas heart or tone but the slight hesitation in her speech was in itself sarcasm enough  with the aid of her friend petko the poor bereaved heartstricken woman succeeded in making her way to russian headquarters where her sad tale and the memory of her heroic husband at once obtained for her employment as a nurse in the large hospital where i had already spent a portion of my timenamely that of sistova  here although horrified and almost overwhelmed at first at the sight of so much and so terrible suffering she gradually attained to a more resigned and tranquil frame of mind  her sympathetic tenderness of heart conduced much to this for she learned in some degree to forget her own sorrows in the contemplation of those of others  she found a measure of sad comfort too while thus ministering to the wants of worn shattered and dying young men in the thought that they had fought like lions on the battlefield as dobri had fought and had lain bleeding crushed and helpless there as dobri had lain  some weeks after her arrival there was a slight change made in the arrangements of the hospital  the particular room in which she served was selected as being more airy and suited for those of the patients who from their enfeebled condition required unusual care and nursing  the evening after the change was effected marika being on what may be called the nightshift was required to assist the surgeons of the ward on their rounds  they came to a bed on which lay a man who seemed in the last stage of exhaustion  no bones broken said one surgeon in a low tone to another to whom he was explaining the cases but blood almost entirely drained out of him very doubtful his recovery  will require the most careful nursing  marika stood behind the surgeons  on hearing what they said she drew nearer and looked sadly at the man  he was gaunt cadaverous and careworn as if from long and severe suffering yet living skeleton though he was it was obvious that his frame had been huge and powerful  marikas first sad glance changed into a stare of wild surprise then the building rang with a cry of joy so loud so jubilant that even those whose blood had almost ceased to flow were roused by it  she sprang forward and leaped into the mans outstretched arms  ay it was dobri petroff himselfor rather his attenuated shadowwith apparently nothing but skin and sinew left to hold his bones together and not a symptom of blood in his whole body  the little blood left however rushed to his face and he found sufficient energy to exclaim thank the lord ere his senses left him  it is said that joy never kills  certainly it failed to do so on this occasion  dobri soon recovered consciousness and then little by little with many a pause for breath and in tones that were woefully unlike to those of the bold lionlike scout of former days he told how he had fainted and fallen on the breast of his master how he had lain all night on the battlefield among the dead and dying how he had been stripped and left for dead by the ruffian followers of the camp and how at last he had been found and rescued by one of the ambulancewagons of the red cross  when marika told him of the death of their two children he was not so much overwhelmed as she had anticipated  im not so sure that you are right marika he said after a long sad pause  that our darling boy is now in heaven i doubt not for you saw him killed  but you did not see ivanka killed and what you call her deathshriek may not have been her last  we must not be too ready to believe the worst  if i had not believed you and them to have been all murdered together i would not have sought death so recklessly  i will not give up hope in that god who has brought you back and saved me from death  i think that darling ivanka is still alive  marika was only too glad to grasp at and hold on to the hope thus held outfeeble though the ground was on which it rested and it need scarcely be said that she went about her hospital duties after that with a lightness and joy of heart which she had not felt for many a day  dobri petroffs recovery was now no longer doubtful  day by day his strength returned until at last he was dismissed cured  but it must not be supposed that dobri was himself again  he stood as erect indeed and became as sturdy in appearance as he used to be but there was many a deepseated injury in his powerful frame which damaged its lithe and graceful motions and robbed it of its youthful spring  returning to the village of venilik at the conclusion of the armistice the childless couple proceeded to rebuild their ruined home  the news of the bold blacksmiths recovery and return with his wife to the old desolated home reached me at a very interesting period of our family historymy sister bellas wedding day  it came through my eccentric friend u biquitous who after going through the russoturkish war as correspondent of the evergreen isle had proceeded in the same capacity to greece  after detailing a good many of his adventures and referring me to the pages of the ei for the remainder of his opinions on things in general he went on by the way in passing through bulgaria lately i fell in with your friend dobri petroff the celebrated scout of the balkan army  he and his pretty wife send their love and all sorts of kind messages which i totally forget  dobri said he supposed you would think he was dead but he isnt and i can assure you looks as if he didnt mean to die for some time to come  they are both very low however about the loss of their children though they still cling fondly to the belief that their little girl ivanka has not been killed  here then was a piece of news for my mother and familyfor we had regularly adopted ivanka and the dear child was to act that very day as one of bellas bridesmaids  i immediately told my mother but resolved to say nothing to ivanka nicholas or bella till the ceremony was over  it was inexpressibly sad to see nicholas naranovitsch that day for despite the fact that by means of a cork foot he could walk slowly to the church without the aid of a crutch his empty sleeve marred visage and slightly stooping gait but poorly represented the handsome young soldier of former days  but my sister saw none of the blemishesonly the beautiesof the man  youve only got quarter of a husband bella he said with a sad smile when the ceremony was over  you were unnecessarily large before retorted bella  you could stand reducing besides you are doubled today which makes you equal to two quarters and as the wife is proverbially the better half that brings you up nearly to three quarters so dont talk any more nonsense sir with good nursing i shall manage perhaps to make a whole of you once more  so be it said nicholas kissing her  when they had left us my mother called me  jeff she said with a look of decision in her meek face which i have not often observed there i have made up my mind that you must go back to turkey  indeed  yes jeff  you had no right my dear boy to bring that child away from her home in such a hurry  but said i remonstratively her home at the time i carried her off was destroyedindeed most of the village was a smoking ruin and liable at any moment to be replundered by the irregular troops of both sides while ivankas parents were reported deadwhat could i do  i dont know what you could do in those circumstances but i know what you can do now and that is pack your portmanteau and prepare to take ivanka to venilik  the child must be at once restored to her parents i cannot bear to think of their remaining in ignorance of her being alive  very likely nicholas and bella will be persuaded to extend their honeymoon to two or even three months and join you in a tour through the south of europe after which you will all come home strong and well to spend the winter with me  agreed mother your programme shall be carried out to the letter if i can manage it  when asked my mother did your friend say he passed through that village  i opened his letter to ascertain when my eye fell on a postscript which had escaped me on the first perusal  it ran thus    ps i see no reason why i should not ask you to wish me joy  im   going to be married my boy to blueeyes  i could not forget her  i   had no hope whatever of discovering her  i had settled in my mind to   live and die an old bachelor when i suddenly met her  it was in   piccadilly when i was home some months ago in reference to an   increase of my nominal salary from the ei which by the way came to   nothingits original figure  i entered a bus and ran my head   against that of a lady who was coming out  i looked up to apologise   and was struck dumb  it was blueeyes  i assisted her to alight and   stammered i know not what something likea thousand pardons   surely we have metexcuse mea mistakethunderercaptain great   guns torpedoes and blazes in the midst of which she smiled   bowed and moved on  i moved after her  i traced her reverentially   to a house  it was that of a personal friend  i visited that friend   i became particularly intimate with that friend i positively bored   that friend until he detested me  at last i met her at the house of   that friend andbut why go on  i am now captain of the blueeyes   and would not exchange places with any officer in the royal navy we   are to be married on my return if im not shot assassinated or   hanged in the meantime  ub  ah jeff said my mother how i wish that you would  she stopped  i know what youre going to say i returned with a smile and there is a charming little  well jeff why dont you go on  well i dont see why i should not tell you mother that there is a charming little womanthe very best woman in the worldwho has expressed herself willing toyou understand  yes i understand  reader i would gladly make a confidant of yourself in this matter and tell you all about this charming little woman if it were not for the fact that she is standing at my elbow at this very minute causing me to make blots and telling me not to write nonsense  before dismissing u biquitous i may as well introduce here the last meeting i had with him  it was a considerable time after the war was overafter the congress had closed its labours and my friend had settledif such a term could be applied to one who never settlednear london  nicholas and i were sitting in a bower at the end of our garden conversing on the war which had been happily brought to a close bella and my mother were seated opposite to us the latter knitting a piece of worstedwork the size of whose stitches and needles was suited to the weakness of her eyes and the former busy with a pencil sketch of the superb view of undulating woodland which stretched away for miles in front of our house  no doubt it is as you state jeff said nicholas in reply to my last remark war is a miserable method of settling a dispute quite unworthy of civilised to say nothing of christian men but then how are we to get along without it  its of no use saying that an evil must be put downput a stop tountil you are able to show how it is to be stopped  that does not follow said i quickly it may be quite possible for me to see point out and condemn an evil although i cannot suggest a remedy and my earnest remonstrances regarding it may be useful in the way of helping to raise a general outcry of condemnation which may have the effect of turning more capable minds than my own to the devising of a remedy  seasickness is a horrible malady i perceive it i know it to be so  i loudly draw attention to the fact i wont be silenced hundreds thousands of other miserables take heart and join me  we cant stand it we shant is the general cry  the attention of an able engineer is attracted by the noise we make and the calaisdouvre steamboat springs into being a vessel which is supposed to render seasickness an impossibility  whether it accomplishes this end or not is beside the question  the point is that by the vigorous use of our tongues and pens in condemnation of an admitted evil we have drawn forth a vigorous attempt to get the better of it  but you dont expect to do away with war altogether said nicholas  certainly not i am not mad i am only hopeful  as long as sin reigns in this world we shall have more or less of war and i dont expect universal peace until the prince of peace reigns  nevertheless it is my duty to seek peace and in every way to promote it  come now let us have this matter out said nicholas lighting a cigar  you are as fond of argument as a scotsman nic murmured bella putting a powerful touch in the foreground of her sketch  suppose now continued nicholas that you had the power to influence nations what would you suggest instead of war  arbitration said i promptly i would have the nations of europe to band together and agree never to fight but always to appeal to reason in the settlement of disputes  i would have them reduce standing armies to the condition of peace establishmentsthat is just enough to garrison our strongholds and be ready to back up our police in keeping ruffians in order  this small army would form a nucleus round which the young men of the nation would rally in the event of unavoidable war  ha exclaimed nicholas with a smile of sarcasm you would then have us all disarm beat our swords into reapinghooks and melt our bayonets and cannon into pots and pans  a charming idea  now suppose there was one of the nationssay russia or turkeythat declined to join this peaceful alliance and when she saw england in her disarmed condition took it into her head to pay off old scores and sent ironclads and thousands of welltrained and wellappointed troops to invade you what would you do  defend myself said i  what with your peacenucleus surrounded by your rabble of untrained young men  nicholas said my mother in a mild voice pausing in her work you may be as fond of argument as a scotsman but you are not quite as fair you have put into jeffs mouth sentiments which he did not express and made assumptions which his words do not warrant  he made no reference to swords reapinghooks bayonets cannon pots or pans and did not recommend that the young men of nations should remain untrained  bravo mother thank you said i as the dear old creature dropped her mild eyes once more on her work you have done me nothing but justice there is one point however on which i and those who are opposed to me coincide exactly it is this that the best way to maintain peace is to make yourself thoroughly capable and ready for war  with your peculiar views that would be rather difficult i should fancy said nicholas with a puzzled look  you fancy so because you misunderstand my views said i besides i have not yet fully explained thembut here comes one who will explain them better than i can do myself  as i spoke a man was seen to approach with a smart freeandeasy air  it is my friend u biquitous said i rising and hastening to meet him  ah jeff my boy glad ive found you all together cried my friend wringing my hand and raising his hat to the ladies  just come over to say goodbye  im engaged again on the evergreen islesame salary and privileges as beforefreer scope if possible than ever  and where are you going to mr biquitous asked my mother  to cyprus madamthe land of theof thethe something or other not got coached up yet but you shall have it all in extenso ere long in the evergreen with sketches of the scenery and natives  ill order a copy to be sent you  very kind thank you said my mother you are fond of travelling i think  fond of it exclaimed my friend yes but that feebly expresses my sentimentsi revel in travelling i am mad about it  to roam over the world by land and sea gathering information recording it collating it extending it condensing it and publishing it for the benefit of the readers of the evergreen isle is my chief terrestrial joy  why mr biquitous said bella looking up from her drawing with a slight elevation of the eyebrows i thought you were a married man  ah  mrs naranovitsch i understand your reproofs but that madam i call a celestial joy  looking into my wifes blue eyes is what i call stargazing and that is a celestial not a terrestrial occupation next to making the stars twinkle i take pleasure in travellingflying through space    crashing on the railroads   skimming on the seas   bounding on the mountaintops   battling with the breeze   roaming through the forest   scampering on the plain   never stopping always going   round and round again  how very beautifulso poetical said bella  so suggestively peaceful murmured nicholas  your own composition asked my mother  a mere morceau replied my friend modestly tossed off to fill up a gap in the evergreen  you should write poetry said i  think so  well ive had some notion at times of trying my hand at an ode or an epic but man i find too many difficulties in the way  as to feet now i cant manage feet in poetry  if it were inches or yards one might get along but feet are neither one thing nor another then rhyme bothers me  ive often to run over every letter in the alphabet to get hold of a rhymeclick thick pick rick chick brickthat sort of thing you know  sentiment too is very troublesome  either i put too much or too little sentiment into my verses sometimes they are all sentiment together not unfrequently they have none at all or the sentiment is false which spoils them you know  yes much though i should like to be a poet i must content myself with prose  just fancy now my attempting a poem on cyprus what rhymes with cyprus  fyprus gyprus highprus kyprus lyprus tryprus and so on to the end  its all the same nothing will do  no doubt hook would have managed it theodore could do anything in that way but i cant  most unfortunate  but for these difficulties you might have been a second milton  you leave your wife behind i suppose said bella completing her sketch and shutting the book  what exclaimed my volatile friend becoming suddenly grave leave blueeyes behind me leave the mitigator of my woes the doubler of my joys the light of my life behind me  no mrs naranovitsch blueeyes is necessary to my existence she inspires my pen and corrects my spelling she lifts my soul when required above the petty cares of life and enables me to take flights of genius which without her were impossible and you know that flights of genius are required occasionally of the correspondent of a weeklyat least of an irish weekly  yes blueeyes goes with me  we shall levant together  are bad puns allowed in the evergreen  i asked  not unless excessively bad returned my friend they wont tolerate anything lukewarm  well now biquitous said i sit down and give nicholas who is hard to convince your opinion as to the mode in which this and other countries ought to prepare for selfdefence  in earnest do you mean  in earnest said i  well then said my friend if i were in power i would make every man in great britain a trained soldier  humph said nicholas that has been tried by other nations without giving satisfaction  but continued u biquitous impressively i would do so without taking a single man away from his home or interfering with his duties as a civilian  i would have all the males of the land trained to arms in boyhoodduring schooldaysat that period of life when boys are best fitted to receive such instruction when they would go in for military drill as they now go in for football cricket or gymnasticsat that period when they have a good deal of leisure time when they would regard the thing more as play than workwhen their memories are strong and powerfully retentive and when the principles and practice of military drill would be as thoroughly implanted in them as the power to swim or skate so that once acquired theyd never quite lose it  i speak from experience for i learned to skate and swim when a boy and i feel that nothingno amount of disusecan ever rob me of these attainments  still further in early manhood i joined the great volunteer movement and though i have now been out of the force for many years i know that i could fall in and behave tolerably well at a moments notice while a weeks drill would brush me up into as good a soldier as i ever was or am likely to be  remember i speak only of rank and file and the power to carry arms and use them intelligently  i would compel boys to undergo this training but would make it easy on doctors certificate or otherwise for anxious parents to get off the duty feeling assured that the fraction of trained men thus lost to the nation would be quite insignificant  afterwards a few days of drill each year would keep men well up to the mark and even in regard to this brushingup drill i would make things very easy and would readily accept every reasonable excuse for absence in the firm belief that the willing men would be amply sufficient to maintain our reserve force  as to the volunteers i would encourage them as heretofore and give them more honour and privileges than they possess at present  thus would an army be ever ready to spring into being at a days notice and be thoroughly capable of defending hearths and homes in a few weeks  for our colonies and our authority at home i would have a very small wellpaid and thoroughly efficient standing army which would form a perfect model in military matters and a splendid skeleton on which the muscle and sinew of the land might wind itself if invasion threatened for the rest i would keep my bayonets and artillery in serviceable condition and my powder dry  if all europe acted thus she would be not less ready for war than she is now and would have all her vigorous men turned into producers instead of consumers to the immense advantage of the states coffers to the great comfort of the women and children to the lessening of crime and poverty and to the general wellbeing of the world at large  my dear sir said nicholas with a laugh you were born before your time  it may be so returned the other lightly nevertheless i will live in the hope of seeing the interests of peace more intelligently advanced than they have been of late and if the system which i suggest is not found to be the best i will rejoice to hear of a better and will do my best to advocate it in the evergreen isle  but now i must go blueeyes and cyprus await me  farewell  u biquitous shook hands heartily and walked rapidly away down the avenue where he was eventually hidden from our view by a bush of laurel  to return from this digression  it is not difficult in these days to put a girdle round the world ivanka and i soon reached the village of venilik  it was a sad spectacle of ruin and desolation but we found dobri petroff and marika in the old home which had been partially rebuilt the blacksmiths anvil was ringing as merrily as ever when we approached and his blows appeared to fall as heavily as in days gone by but i noticed when he looked up that his countenance was lined and very sad while his raven locks were prematurely tinged with grey  shall i describe the meeting of ivanka with her parents  i think not the imagination is more correct and powerful than the pen in such cases new life seemed from that moment to be infused into the muchtried pair  marika had never lost her trust in god through all her woes and even in her darkest hours had refused to murmur  she had kissed the rod that smote her and now she praised him with a strong and joyful heart  alas there were many others in that village and thousands of others throughout that bloodsoaked land who had no such gleam of sunshine sent into the dark recesses of their woeworn heartspoor innocent souls these who had lost their joy their possessions their hope their all in this life because of the mad unreasonable superstition that it is necessary for men at times to arrange their differences by war  war what is it  a monster which periodically crushes the energies desolates the homes swallows thousands of the young lives and sweeps away millions of the money of mankind  it bids christianity stand aside for a time  it legalises wholesale murder and robbery  it affords a safe opportunity to villainy to work its diabolic will so that some of the fairest scenes of earth are converted into human shambles  it destroys the labour of busy generations past and present and saddles heavy national debt on those that are yet unborn  it has been estimated that the national debts of europe now amount to nearly 3000 millions sterling more than threefourths of which have been required for war and warlike preparations and that about 600 millions are annually taken from the capital and industry of nations for the expense of past and the preparation for future wars  war tramples gallantry in the dust leaves women at the mercy of a brutal soldiery slaughters old men and tosses babes on bayonetpoints  all this it does and a great deal more in the way of mischief what does it accomplish in the way of good  what has mankind gained by the wars of napoleon the first which cost it is said two million of lives to say nothing of the maimedforlife and the bereaved  will the gain or the loss of alsace and lorraine mitigate or increase in any appreciable degree the woe of french and prussian widows  will the revenues of these provinces pay for the loss consequent on the stagnation of trade and industry  what has been gained by the crimean war which cost us thousands of lives and millions in money  nothing whatever  the treaties which were to secure what had been gained have been violated and the empire for which we fought has been finally crushed  when waged in selfdefence war is a sad a horrible necessity  when entered into with a view to national aggrandisement or for an idea it is the greatest of crimes  the man who creeps into your house at night and cuts your throat while you are asleep in bed is a sneaking monster but the man who sits at home at ease safe from the tremendous dogs which he is about to let loose and with diplomatic pen signs away the peace of society and the lives of multitudes without serious cause is a callous monster  of the two the sneak is the less objectionable because less destructive  during this visit to venilik i spent some time in renewing my inquiries as to the fate of my yachts crew but without success and i was forced to the sad conclusion that they must either have been drowned or captured and it may be killed after reaching the land  long afterwards however i heard it rumoured that mr whitlaw had escaped and returned to his native country  there is therefore some reason to hope that that sturdy and truehearted american still lives to relate among his other stirring narratives an account of that memorable night when he was torpedoed on the danube  before finally bidding adieu to the petroff family i had many a talk with dobri on the subject of war as we wandered sadly about the ruined village  the signs of the fearful hurricane by which it had been swept were still fresh upon it and when i looked on the burnt homesteads the trampled crops and neglected fields the crowds of newmade graves the curs that quarrelled over unburied human bones the bloodstained walls and doorposts the wan almost bloodless faces of the few who had escaped the wrath of man and reflected that all this had been brought about by a christian nation fighting in the interests of the prince of peace i could not help the fervent utterance of the prayer o god scatter thou the people that delight in war  the end
