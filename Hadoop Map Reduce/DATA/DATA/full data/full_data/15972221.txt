spirit of culture       der tag   or   the tragic man    a bare chamber lighted by a penny dip which casts shadows on a hard   chair by a table sits an emperor in thought to him come his   chancellor and an officer   chancellor your imperial majesty  officer sire  emperor the emperor rises is that the paper    indicating a paper in the chancellors hand  chancellor presenting it it awaits only your imperial majestys   signature  officer when you have signed that paper sire the fatherland will be   at war with france and russia  emperor at last this little paper  chancellor not of the value of a birds feather until it has your royal   signature the  emperor then it will sing round the planet the vibration of it will   not pass in a hundred years my friend how still the world has grown   since i raised this pen all europes listening europe thats   germany when i have signed and yet  officer your imperial majesty is not afraid to sign  emperor flashing afraid  officer abject oh sire  emperor i am irresistible today red blood boils in my veins to me   every open door is the gift of a world i hear a thousand   nightingales i would eat all the elephants in hindustan and pick my   teeth with the spire of strassburg cathedral  officer that is the fatherland today such as we are that you have   made us each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his   deity it was you fashioned us into a sword sire and now the sword   must speak  emperor approvingly there the sword spokeand yet the wise one   said take not your enemies together but separately lest the meal   go to them instead of to you one at a time to chancellor why am   i not a friend of russia till france is out of the way or frances   friend until the bear is muzzled that was your part  chancellor for that i strove but their mean minds suspected me sire   your signature  emperor what of britain  officer intently thisthe day to which we have so often drunk   draws near  emperor the day to the day all salute the day with their swords   but when  officer now if she wants it  emperor there is no road to britainuntil our neighbors are subdued   then for us there will be no roads that do not lead to britain  chancellor suavely your imperial majesty britain will not join in   just now  emperor if i was sure of that  chancellor i vouch for it so well weve chosen our time it finds her   at issue with herself her wild women let loose her colonies ready to   turn against her ireland aflame the paltry british army sulking with   the civic powers  emperor these wounds might heal suddenly if german bugles sounded it   is a land that in the past has done things  officer in the past your imperial majesty but in the past alone lies   britains greatness  emperor yes thats the german truth britain has grown dull and   sluggish a belly of a land she lies overfed no dreams within her   such as keep powers aliveand timid toowithout red blood in her   but in its stead a thick yellowish fluid the most shell play for is   her own safety pretend to grant her that and shell seek her soft bed   again britains part in the worlds making is done i was her   epitaph  chancellor how well you know her sire all she needs is some small   excuse for saying i acted in the best interests of my moneybags   that excuse ive found for her i have promised in your name a secret   compact with her that if she stands aloof the parts of france we do   not at present need we will not at present take  emperor a secret bargain over the head of france her friend surely an   infamous proposal  chancellor the british government will not think so trust me to know   them sire your signature  emperor gleaming i can fling a million men within the week across   the border by way of alsace and lorraine  officer with a frown there are a hundred gates to open that way  emperor my guns shall open them  officer with meaning you can think of no easier road sire  emperor i think of it night and day  officer one further norththrough belgium  emperor if i could dare but no that road is barred  officer misunderstanding on the contrary sire  emperor barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear againstby honor   by my plighted word  officer yet sire  emperor after hesitating no no i will not so stain my name  chancellor i am with you sire but i fear it will not be so with   france she has grown cynical she will find the road through belgium  emperor you seek to tempt me she also signed the treaty  chancellor your imperial majesty judges others by yourself i have   private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage   france will call the treaty but a scrap of paper  emperor i think your private ground may be your own private newspaper  chancellor she will say that necessity knows no law or some such   dastard words  emperor belgium is no craven she will fight the betrayer  chancellor france will hack her way through her  emperor my chancellor that is a hideous phrase  chancellor i ask your pardon sire it came somehow pat to my lips  officer your imperial majesty the time passes will it please you to   sign  chancellor bonaparte would have acted quickly  emperor bonaparte  chancellor the paper sire  emperor leave it now with me return in an hour and you shall have it   signed  officer warningly the least delay  chancellor overmuch reflection  emperor i wish to be alone    they retire respectfully but anxious he is left alone in     thought  emperor even a kings life is but a day and in his day the sun is only   at its zenith once this is my zenith others will come to germany   but not to me the world pivots on me tonight they said bonaparte   coupling me with him to dim napoleon paris in three weekssay four   to cover any chance miscalculation russia on her back in six with   poland snapping at her and then after a breathing space we   reachthe day we sweep the english channel changing its name as we   embark and cross by way of calais which will have fallen easily into   our hands the british fleet destroyedfor that is part of the   plandover to london is a week of leisured marching and london   itself unfortified and panicstricken falls in a day v√¶ victis   ill leave conquered britain some balls to play with so that there   shall be no uprising next i carve america in great mouthfuls for my   colonists for now i strike the seas its all so docketed i feel   its as good as done before i set forth to do it dictator of the   world and all for pacific ends for once the whole is mine we come   at last to the great desideratum a universal peace rulers over all   god in the heavens i upon the earthwe two raising his brows   threateningly and there are still the zeppelins ill sign    he sits in thought he is very tired and soon he is asleep the     lighting becomes strange he dreams and we see his dream the     spirit of culture appears a noble female figure in white robes  emperor whos that  culture a friend i am culture who has so long hovered wellplaced   over happy germany  emperor who gives her royal honor a frienda consort i would hear   you say o queen that i have done some things for you  culture you have done much for me i have held my head higher since you   were added to the roll of sovereigns i may have smiled at you at   times as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one   but as kings go you have been a worthy king  emperor it was all done for you  culture so for long i thought i looked upon germanys golden   granaries plucked from ground once barren its busy mills and   furnaces its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble   seats of learning all mellowing in the sun and i heard you say they   were dedicate to me and i was proud you have honored me my emperor   and now i am here to be abased by you all the sweet garments you have   robed me in tear them off me and send me naked out of germany  emperor you would not have me sign  culture i warn you first to know yourself you who have gloated in a   lookingglass too long  emperor i sign so that germany may be greater still to spread your   banner farther thus i make the whole world cultured  culture my banner needs no such spreading it has ever been your   weakness to think that i have no other home save here in germany i   have many homes and the fairest is in france  emperor if that were true germany would care less for you  culture if that is true i have never had a home in germany i am no   single nations servant no single races queen i am not of german   make my banner is already in every land on which you would place your   heel culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom ill not have you   say you fight for me find some other reason  emperor the jealousies of nations  culture all are guilty there jealousy not love of money is the root   of all evil that was a misprint yet i know of nothing those others   want that is yours to give save peace what do you want of them   bites out of each and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry   the blood be on their heads they force me into war  emperor germany must expand that is her divine mission i have it from   on high  culture your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete  emperor all germany is with me i hold in leash the mightiest machine   for war the world has forged  culture i have seen your legions and all are with you never was a   lord more trusted o emperor does that not make you pause  emperor france invades little belgium  culture chivalrous france never emperor i leave one last word to you   at the parting of the ways france russia britain these are great   opponents but it is not they will bring the pillars of germany down   beware of belgium    she goes he is left in two minds he crosses to sign he flings     down the pen he strikes the bell chancellor and officer     reappear  chancellor your imperial majesty has signed  emperor thus he tears the paper  officer sire  emperor say this to russia france and britain in my imperial name so   long as they keep within their borders i remain in mine  officer but sire  emperor you know as i do that it is all they ask for  chancellor you were the friend of austria  emperor ill prove it tell her from me that servia has yielded on   every point which doth become a nation and that austria may accept her   terms  chancellor nay sire  emperor and so there will be no war  officer sire we beg  emperor these are my commands    they have to go chagrined but deferential  emperor the decision lay with me and i said there shall be peace that   be my zenith    he goes back to the chair he sleeps peacefully in the distance a     bell tolls the angelus and suddenly this is broken by one boom of a     great gun which reverberates and should be startling the spirit     of culture returns now with a wound in her breast she surveys him     sadly  culture sleep on unhappy king he grows restless better to wake   if even your dreams appal you    he wakes and for a moment he scarcely understands that he has     been dreaming the realization is tragic to him  emperor you you have come here to mock me  culture oh no  emperor i dreamed there was no war in my dream they came to me and i   forbade the war i saw the fatherland smiling and prosperous as it   was before the war  culture it was you who made the war o emperor  emperor huskily belgium  culture there is no belgium now but over what was belgium there rests   a soft light as of a helm and through it is a flaming sword  emperor i dreamed i had kept my plighted word to belgium  culture it was you o emperor who broke your plighted word and laid   waste the land in the lust for victory you violated even the laws of   war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may   dare again face their maker your way to him is lighted now by   smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of   mine and you shall seek him over roads cobbled with the moans of   innocents  emperor in my dream i thought england was grown degenerate and would   not fight  culture she fought you where cr√©cy was and agincourt and waterloo   with all their dead to help her the dead became quick in their   ancient graves stirred by the tread of the island feet and they   cried out how is england doing the living answered the dead upon   their bugles with the alls well england o emperor was grown   degenerate but you you have made her great  emperor france russia  culture they are here around your walls  emperor my people  culture i see none marching but men whose feet make no sound shades of   your soldiers who pass on and on in neverending lines  emperor do they curse me  culture none curses they all salute you as they pass they have done   your bidding  emperor the women curse me  culture not even the women they too salute you you were their   father and could do no wrong  emperor and you  culture i have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you   farewell  emperor god cannot let my germany be utterly destroyed  culture if god is with the allies germany will not be destroyed   farewell    she is going she lifts a pistol from the table and puts it in his     hand it is all she can do for her old friend she goes away with     shining eyes the penny dip burns low the great emperor is lost in     its shadows
