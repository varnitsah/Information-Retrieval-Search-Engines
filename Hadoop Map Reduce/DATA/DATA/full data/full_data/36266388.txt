that will make you sit up and take notice  my dear patsy was the reply its already sitting up i am an taking waffles if anything at all would make me take notice its your own pretty phiz  major remarked uncle john helping himself to waffles from a fresh plate nora brought in you irish are such confirmed flatterers that you flatter your own daughters patsy isnt at all pretty this morning shes too red and freckled  patsy laughed and her blue eyes danced  that comes from living on your old farm at millville she retorted weve only been back three days and the sunburn sticks to me like a burr to a kitten  pay no attention to the ould rascal patsy advised the major composedly an stop wavin that letter like a white flag of surrender whos it from  kenneth  aha an how is our lad  why hes got himself into a peck of trouble thats what i want to talk to you and uncle john about she replied her happy face growing as serious as it could ever become  cant he wiggle out asked uncle john  out of what  his trouble  it seems not listen  oh tell us about it lassie said the major if i judge right theres some sixty pages in that epistle dont bother to read it again  but every word is important declared patsy turning the letter over except the last page with a swift flush  uncle john laughed his shrewd old eyes saw everything  then read us the last page my dear  ill tell you about it said patsy quickly its this way you see kenneth has gone into politics  more power to his elbow exclaimed the major  i cant imagine it in kenneth said uncle john soberly whats he in for  forforlets see oh here it is for member of the house of representatives from the eighth district  hes flying high for a fledgling observed the major but kenneths a bright lad and a big gun in his county hell win hands down  patsy shook her head  hes afraid not she said and its worrying him to death he doesnt like to be beaten and thats whats troubling him  uncle john pushed back his chair  poor boy he said what ever induced him to attempt such a thing  he wanted to defeat a bad man who now represents kenneths district explained patsy whose wise little head was full of her friends difficulties and  and the bad man objects to the idea and wont be defeated added the major its a way these bad men have  uncle john was looking very serious indeed and patsy regarded him gratefully her father never would be serious where kenneth was concerned perhaps in his heart the grizzled old major was a bit jealous of the boy  i think said the girl that mr watson got ken into politics for he surely wouldnt have undertaken such a thing himself and now hes in he finds hes doomed to defeat and its breaking his heart uncle john  the little man nodded silently his chubby face was for once destitute of a smile that meant a good deal with uncle john and patsy knew she had interested him in kenneths troubles  once said the major from behind the morning paper i was in politics meself i ran for coroner an got two whole votesme own an the undertakers its because the publics so indiscriminating that ive not run for anything sinceexcept th streetcar  but its a big game said uncle john standing at the window with his hands deep in his pockets and an important game every good american should take an interest in politics and kenneth especially who has such large landed interests ought to direct the political affairs of his district  im much interested in politics too uncle declared the girl if i were a man ididbe president  an id vote fer ye twenty times a day mavourneen cried the major but luckily yell be no presidentunless its of a womans club  theres the bell cried patsy it must be the girls no one else would call so early  its beths voice talking to nora added her father listening and then the door flew open and in came two girls whose bright and eager faces might well warrant the warm welcome they received  oh louise cried patsy however did you get up so early  ive got a letter from kenneth was the answer and im so excited i couldnt wait a minute  imagine louise being excited said beth calmly as she kissed uncle john and sat down by patsys side she read her letter in bed and bounced out of bed like a cannonball we dressed like the lightning change artist at the vaudeville and im sure our hats are not on straight  this bids fair to be a strenuous day observed the major patsys had a letter from the boy herself  oh did you inquired louise and do you know all about it dear  she knows sixty pages about it replied major doyle  well then whats to be done  the question was addressed to patsy who was not prepared to reply the three cousins first exchanged inquiring glances and then turned their eager eyes upon the broad chubby back of uncle john who maintained his position at the window as if determined to shut out the morning sunlight  louise merrick lived with her mother a few blocks away from patsys apartment and her cousin beth degraf was staying with her for a time they had all spent the summer with uncle john at millville and had only returned to new york a few days before beths home was in ohio but there was so little sympathy between the girl and her parents that she was happy only when away from them her mother was uncle johns sister but as selfish and cold as uncle john was generous and genial beths father was a genius and a professor of musicone of those geniuses who live only in their own atmosphere and forget there is a world around them so beth had a loveless and disappointed childhood and only after uncle john arrived from the far west and took his three nieces under his wing as he said did her life assume any brightness or interest  her new surroundings however had developed beths character wonderfully and although she still had her periods of sullen depression she was generally as gay and lovable as her two cousins but in a quieter and more selfpossessed way  louise was the eldesta fair dainty creature with that indescribable air which invariably wins the admiring regard of all beholders whatever gown the girl wore looked appropriate and becoming and her manner was as delightful as her appearance she was somewhat frivolous and designing in character but warmhearted and staunch in her friendships indeed louise was one of those girls who are so complex as to be a puzzle to everyone including themselves  beth degraf was the beauty of the group of three and she also possessed great depth of character beth did not like herself very well and was always afraid others would fail to like her so she did not win friends as easily as did louise but those who knew the beautiful girl intimately could read much to admire in the depth of her great dark eyes and she was not the least interesting of the three nieces whose fortunes had been so greatly influenced by aunt jane and uncle john merrick  but patricia doyleusually called patsy by her friendswas after all the general favorite with strangers and friends alike there was a subtle magnetism about the girls laughing freckled face and dancing blue eyes that could not well be resisted patsy was not beautiful she was not accomplished she had no especial air of distinction but she was winning from the top of her red hair to the tips of her toes and so absolutely unaffected that she won all hearts  and for wisdom shes got solomon beat to a frazzle declared the major to uncle john in discussing his daughters character but it is possible that major doyle was prejudiced  well whats to be done demanded louise for the second time  we dont vote in kens district remarked the major or there would be six votes to his credit and that would beat my own record by four  ken is so impressionable that im afraid this defeat will ruin his life said beth softly i wish we could get him away couldnt we get him to withdraw  he might be suddenly called to europe suggested louise that would take him away from the place and give him a change of scene  patsy shook her head  kenneth isnt a coward she said he wont run away he must accept his defeat like a man and some time try again eh uncle john  uncle john turned around and regarded his three nieces critically  what makes you think he will be defeated he asked  he says so himself answered patsy  he writes me he can see no hope for the people are all against him added louise  pah said uncle john contemptuously what else does the idiot say  that hes lonely and discouraged and had to pour out his heart to some one or go wild said patsy the tears of sympathy filling her eyes  and you girls propose to sit down and allow all this inquired their uncle sternly  we answered louise lifting her brows and making a pretty gesture what can we do  go to work said uncle john  how asked patsy eagerly  politics is a game declared mr merrick its never won until the last card is played and success doesnt lie so much in the cards as the way you play em here are three girls with plenty of shrewdness and energy why dont you take a hand in the game and win it  oh uncle john  the proposition was certainly disconcerting at first  yes yes laughed the major derisively put on some blue stockings read the history of womans suffrage cultivate a liking for depraved eggs and then face kenneths enraged constituents  i shouldnt mind daddy if it would help kenneth any declared patsy stoutly  go on uncle john said beth encouragingly  women in politics observed their uncle have often been a tremendous power you wont need to humiliate yourselves my dears all youll need to do is to exercise your wits and work earnestly for the cause there are a hundred ways to do that  mention a few proposed the major  i will when i get to elmhurst and look over the ground answered uncle john  youre going on then  yes  ill go with you said patsy promptly  so will i said beth kenneth needs moral encouragement and support as much as anything else just now  hes imagining all sorts of horrors and making himself miserable said louise lets all go uncle and try to cheer him up  by this time uncle john was smiling genially  why i was sure of you my dears from the first he said the majors an old croaker but hed go too if it were not necessary for him to stay in new york and attend to business but we mustnt lose any time if were going to direct the politics of the eighth district election the eighth of november  i can go any time and so can beth said louise  all i need is the blue stockings laughed patsy  it wont be play this means work said uncle john seriously  well i believe were capable of a certain amount of work replied beth arent we girls  we are  all right said mr merrick ill go and look up the next train go home louise and pack up ill telephone you  that bad man d better look out chuckled the major he doesnt suspect that an army of invasion is coming  daddy cried patsy you hush up we mean business  if you win said the major ill run for alderman on a petticoat platform and hire your services     chapter ii  the artist   to most people the great rambling mansion at elmhurst with its ample grounds and profusion of flowers and shrubbery would afford endless delight but kenneth forbes the youthful proprietor was at times dreadfully bored by the loneliness of it all though no one could better have appreciated the beauties of his fine estate  the town an insignificant village was five miles distant and surrounding the mansion were many broad acres which rather isolated it from its neighbors moreover elmhurst was the one important estate in the county and the simple hardworking farmers in its vicinity considered justly enough that the owner was wholly out of their class  this was not the owners fault and kenneth had brooded upon the matter until he had come to regard it as a distinct misfortune for it isolated him and deprived him of any social intercourse with his neighbors  the boy had come to live at elmhurst when he was a mere child but only as a dependent upon the charities of aunt jane who had accepted the charge of the orphan because he was a nephew of her dead lover who had bequeathed her his estate of elmhurst aunt jane was kenneths aunt merely in name since she had never even married the uncle to whom she had been betrothed and who had been killed in an accident before the boy was born  she was an irritable old woman as kenneth knew her and had never shown him any love or consideration he grew up in a secluded corner of the great house tended merely by servants and suffered to play in those quarters of the ample grounds which aunt jane did not herself visit the neglect which kenneth had suffered and his lonely life had influenced the youths temperament and he was far from being an agreeable companion at the time aunt jane summoned her three nieces to elmhurst in order to choose one of them as her heiress these girls bright cheery and wholesome as they were penetrated the boys reserve and drew him out of his misanthropic moods they discovered that he had remarkable talent as an artist and encouraged him to draw and paint something he had long loved to do in secret  then came the great surprise of the boys life which changed his condition from one of dependency into affluence aunt jane died and it was discovered that she had no right to transfer the estate to one of her nieces because by the terms of his uncles deed to her the property reverted on her death to kenneth himself louise merrick beth degraf and patsy doyle the three nieces were really glad that the boy inherited elmhurst and returned to their eastern homes with the most cordial friendship existing between them all  kenneth was left the master of elmhurst and possessor of considerable wealth besides and at first he could scarcely realize his good fortune or decide how to take advantage of it he had one good and helpful friend an old lawyer named watson who had not only been a friend of his uncle and the confidant of aunt jane for years but had taken an interest in the lonely boy and had done his best to make his life brighter and happier  when kenneth became a landed proprietor mr watson was appointed his guardian and the genial old lawyer abandoned the practice of law and henceforth devoted himself to his wards welfare and service  they made a trip to europe together where kenneth studied the pictures of the old masters and obtained instruction from some of the foremost living artists of the old world  it was while they were abroad a year before the time of this story that the boy met aunt janes three nieces again they were doing europe in company with a wealthy bachelor uncle john merrick a generous kindhearted and simpleminded old gentleman who had taken the girls under his wing as he expressed it and had really provided for their worldly welfare better than aunt jane his sister could have done  this uncle john was indeed a whimsical character as the reader will presently perceive becoming a millionaire against his will as he declared he had learned to know his nieces late in life and found in their society so much to enjoy that he was now wholly devoted to their interests his one friend was major doyle patsys father a dignified but agreeable old irish gentleman who amused uncle john nearly as much as the girls delighted him the major managed john merricks financial affairs leaving the old millionaire free to do as he pleased  so he took the girls to europe and the four had a fine adventurous trip as may be imagined kenneth and mr watson met them in sicily and afterward in the italian cities and the friendship already existing between the young people was more firmly cemented than before  in the spring kenneth returned with his guardian to elmhurst where he devoted himself largely to painting from the sketches he had made abroad while mr watson sat beside him comfortably smoking his pipe and reading his favorite authors the elder man was contented enough in his condition but the boy grew restless and impatient and longed for social intercourse his nature was moody and he had a tendency to brood if left much to himself  uncle john had carried his nieces to a farm at millville in the adirondack region for the summer so that kenneth heard but seldom from his friends  such was the disposition of the characters when our story opens  kenneth forbes although i have called him a boy had attained his majority on the fifteenth day of may at this time mr watson rendered his accounts and turned over the estate to its owner he would then have retired but kenneth would not let him go twentyone years of age sounds mature but the owner of elmhurst was as boyish and inexperienced as it is possible for one twentyone years old to be he had grown accustomed moreover to depend much on mr watsons legal acumen in the management of his affairs and would have been embarrassed and bewildered if obliged to shoulder the burden all at once  the lawyer who had always had an affection for the young man perceived this clearly so an arrangement was made that he should remain with his young friend indefinitely and strive to teach him such elements of business as would enable him in time to attend to his extensive interests understandingly and wisely  the country around elmhurst is thickly settled with agriculturists for the farms are rich and productive in that part of the state but it is not a flat country and nature has given it many pretty woodland glades and rocky glens to add to its charm  from the hill country at the west came several rushing streams which tumbled along rocky paths to the river nine miles below elmhurst and there are scenes along these routes that might well delight the eye of an artist kenneth had often wandered into these outoftheway places when a halfforgotten neglected lad but had not visited them for years now however with the spirit of loneliness upon him he suddenly thought of a glen that would make an interesting study for a picture so one morning he mounted his horse and rode away to pay the place a preliminary visit  the farmers along the road nodded at the young fellow goodnaturedly as he passed them everyone knew him well by sight yet kenneth could not have named many of his neighbors having held little intercourse with them it struck him this morning that they had little cause to be interested in him he had been an unsociable lad and since he had become master of elmhurst had done little to cultivate acquaintance with the people who lived around him  one reason for this was that they held little in common with him the neighboring farmers were honest thrifty souls and among them were many both shrewd and thoughtful but they naturally would not force themselves upon the society of the one really rich man in their community especially as that man had shown no desire to know them  kenneth was the subject of much speculation among them and opinions widely differed concerning his character some called him a prig and declared that he was stuck up and conceited others said he was a nambypamby without brains or wit but there were a few who had occasionally talked with the boy who understood him better and hinted that he might develop into quite a man in time  kenneth surprised himself this morning by greeting several of his neighbors with unusual cordiality he even stopped a man who was driving along the highway to inquire about his horse which he perceived was very lame the boy knew something about horses and suggested a method of treatment that he thought would help the nag a suggestion the farmer received with real gratitude  this simple incident cheered kenneth more than you might suppose and he was actually whistling as he rode through the glen where the country road wound its way beside the noisy rushing stream  pausing in front of the picturesque table rock that he had come to inspect the boy uttered an exclamation of chagrin and disappointment painted broadly upon the face of the rock in great white letters was the advertisement of a patent medicine the beauty of the scene was ruinedonly the glaring advertisement caught and held the eye of the observer  at first kenneths mind held only a feeling of disgust that such a desecration of natures gifts to humanity should be allowed then he remembered another place further along the glen which was almost as pretty as this had been before the defiling brush of the advertiser had ruined it so he spurred his horse and rode up the winding way to the spot there a redlettered announcement of simpsons soap stared him in the face  this was too much for his temper and his disappointment quickly turned to resentment while he sat on his mare considering the matter the man with the lame horse whom he had passed overtook him  can you tell me kenneth asked who owns this property  why i do replied the man reining up  and you permitted these vile signs to be painted on the rocks demanded the boy angrily  o course replied the man with a grin of amusement i cant farm the rocks can i an these ere signs pays me ten dollars a year each  kenneth groaned  ill give you fifteen dollars a year each if youll let me wash off the letters and restore the scene to its original beauty he declared  im willin was the response but ye see theyre contracted id git into trouble with the signpainter  who is he  lives in cleveland ive got his name up t th house if youll come along he comes up here every spring and paints fences an rocks payin spot cash fer th privilege  oh i see  then he contracts with the soap man an the medicine man to paint up their ads youre the young un from elmhurst aint ye  yes  well id like to earn that extra five well enough my names parsons ive got three signs let on my property in the glen ef yell jest ride up t the house ill giv ye the fellers name  all right come along said kenneth with sudden resolve  the farmer rode a time in silent thought he could not go fast for the beast was very lame finally he remarked  ef ye buy up the sign painters sos ye can wash off the letters like enough yell hev to pay him fer th paint an paintin too  i dont mind was the response  the farmer chuckled here was an interesting adventure for a fact what on earth could possess the young un from elmhurst to object to signs and be willing to pay for having them erased  like enough yell hev to pay back the money the soap an medicine men guv th painter too he hazarded  like enough said kenneth grimly  one of his stubborn moods had seized him at all hazards he was resolved to eliminate those ugly signs  he got the name of the sign painter accepted a glass of buttermilk at the farm house and then rode slowly home by another route so that he might not have to face the signs again  but on this route he saw even more they were painted on the fences and barns as he passed along he scowled at each one but they did not appear to him quite so inharmonious as those which marred the more picturesque and retired spots which were his favorite haunts     chapter iii  don quixote   when kenneth got home he told mr watson of his discovery and asked the old gentleman to write to the sign painter and find out what could be done the lawyer laughed heartily at his young friends whim but agreed to help him  if you are going to try to prevent rural advertising he remarked youll find your hands full  kenneth looked up smiling  thank you he said  for what  for finding me something to do im sick of this inaction  again the lawyer laughed  what is your idea he asked  to remove such eyesores as advertising signs from the neighborhood of elmhurst  its a titans task ken  so much the better  the lawyer grew thoughtful  i believe its impossible he ventured  better yet i dont say ill succeed but i promise to try i want something to occupy myselfsomething really difficult so that i may test my own powers  but my dear boy this foolish proposition isnt worthy your effort if you want to be up and doing well find something else to occupy your mind  no mr watson im set on this its a crime to allow these signs to flaunt themselves in our prettiest scenes my instinct revolts at the desecration besides no one else seems to have undertaken the task of exterminating them  true enough if youre serious ken ill frankly say the thing cant be done you may perhaps buy the privilege of maintaining the rocks of the glen free from advertising but the advertisers will paint more signs on all the approaches and you wont have gained much  ill drive every advertising sign out of this country  impossible the great corporations who control these industries make their fortunes by this style of advertising the rural districts are their strongholds and they must advertise or they cant sell their products  let them advertise in decent ways then what right has any soap maker to flaunt his wares in my face whether im interested in them or not  the right of custom people have submitted to these things so long that the manufacturers consider themselves justified in covering every barn rock and fence with their signs i see no way to stop them  nor i at present but there must be a way  drive out one and another will take his place they pay liberally for locations  pshaw ten dollars a year for a rock as big as a barn  but they rent thousands of such positions and in the aggregate our farmers get large sums from them  and ruin the appearance of their homes and farms  mr watson smiled  theyre not artists ken they cant realize on appearances but they can use the money the signs bring them  they need to be educated thats all these farmers seem very honest decent fellows  they are ken i wish you knew them better  so do i mr watson this campaign ought to bring us closer together for i mean to get them to help me  youll have to buy them im afraid  not all of them there must be some refinement among them  but the lawyer was not convinced however it was not his desire to stifle this newborn enthusiasm of kenneths even though he believed it misdirected he wanted the young man to rouse himself and take an interest in life and if his antagonism to advertising signs would effect this the futile fight against them was to be welcomed it would cost the boy something but he would gain his moneys worth in experience  after a few days the sign painter answered the letter he would relinquish the three signs in the glen for a payment of fifty dollars each with the understanding that no other competing signs were to take their place kenneth promptly mailed a check for the amount demanded and early next morning started for the glen with what he called his eliminators  these eliminators consisted of two men with cans of turpentine and gasoline and an equipment of scrubbing brushes parsons the farmer came over to watch this novel proceeding happy in the possession of three crisp fivedollar notes given in accordance with the agreement made with him all day the two men scrubbed the rocks faithfully assisted at odd times by their impatient employer but the thick splashes of paint clung desperately to the rugged surface of the rock and the task was a hard one when evening came the letters had almost disappeared when viewed closely but when kenneth rode to the mouth of the glen on his way home and paused to look back he could see the injunction take smiths liver pills staring at him in grim defiance of the scrubbing brushes  but his energy was not exhausted no one ever knew what it cost in labor and material to erase those three signs but after ten days they had vanished completely and the boy heaved a sigh of satisfaction and turned his attention to extending the campaign  on the farm nearest to elmhurst at the north which belonged to a man named webb was a barn facing the road that displayed on its side a tobacco sign kenneth interviewed mr webb and found that he received no money for the sign but the man contended that the paint preserved his barn from the weather on that side so kenneth agreed to repaint the entire barn for him and actually had the work done as it took many coats of paint to blot out the sign it was rather a expensive operation  by this time the campaign of the youthful proprietor of elmhurst against advertising signs began to be talked of throughout the county and was the subject of much merriment among the farmers some of them were intelligent enough to admire the young quixote and acknowledged frankly that it was a pity to decorate their premises with signs of patent medicines and questionable soaps  but the majority of them sneered at the champion and many refused pointblank to consider any proposition to discard the advertisements indeed some were proud of them and believed it a mark of distinction to have their fences and sheds announce an eyeremedy or several varieties of pickles  mr watson at first an amused observer of the campaign soon became indignant at the way that kenneth was ridiculed and reviled and he took a hand in the fight himself he decided to call a meeting of the neighboring farmers at the district schoolhouse on saturday night where kenneth could address them with logical arguments and endeavor to win them over to his way of thinking  the invitation was promptly accepted by the rural population not so much because they were interested in the novel ideas of the young artist as because they expected to be amused by hearing the boyish master of elmhurst lecture at em so they filled the little room to overflowing and to add to the dignity of the proceedings the hon erastus hopkins state representative for the district lent his presence to the assemblage  not that the honorable erastus cared a fig about this foolish talk of exterminating advertising signs he was himself a large stockholder in a breakfastfood factory which painted signs wherever it could secure space these signs were not works of art but they were distinctly helpful to business and only a fool in the opinion of the honorable erastus would protest against the inevitable  what brought the legislator to the meeting was the fact that he was coming forward for reelection in november and believed that this afforded a good chance to meet some of his constituents and make a favorable impression so he came early and shook hands with everyone that arrived and afterward took as prominent a seat as possible  indeed the gathering had at first the appearance of being a political one so entirely did the representative dominate it but mr watson took the platform and shyly introduced the speaker of the evening  the farmers all knew mr watson and liked him so when kenneth rose they prepared to listen in respectful silence  usually a young man making his maiden speech is somewhat diffident but young forbes was so thoroughly in earnest and so indignant at the opposition that his plans had encountered that he forgot that it was his first public speech and thought only of impressing his hearers with his views exulting in the fact that on this occasion they could not talk back as they usually did in private when he tried to argue with them so he exhorted them earnestly to keep their homes beautiful and free from the degradation of advertising and never to permit glaring commercialism to mar the scenery around them he told them what he had been able to accomplish by himself in a short time how he had redeemed the glen from its disgraceful condition and restored it to its former beauty he asked them to observe webbs pretty homestead no longer marred by the unsightly sign upon the barn and then he appealed to them to help him in driving all the advertising signs out of the community  when he ended they applauded his speech mildly but it was chiefly for the reason that he had spoken so forcibly and well  then the honorable erastus hopkins quick to catch the lack of sympathy in the audience stood up and begged leave to reply to young forbes  he said the objection to advertising signs was only a rich mans aristocratic hobby and that it could not be indulged in a democratic community of honest people his own firm he said bought thousands of bushels of oats from the farmers and converted them into the celebrated eagleeye breakfast food three packages for a quarter they sold this breakfast food to thousands of farmers to give them health and strength to harvest another crop of oats thus he benefited the community going and coming what should he not advertise this mutualbenefit commodity wherever he pleased and especially among the farmers what aristocratic notion could prevent him it was a mighty good thing for the farmers to be reminded by means of the signs on their barns and fences of the things they needed in daily life  if the young man at elmhurst would like to be of public service he might find some better way to do so than by advancing such crazy ideas but this continued the representative was a subject of small importance what he wished especially to call their attention to was the fact that he had served the district faithfully as representative and deserved their suffrages for renomination and then he began to discuss political questions in general and his own merits in particular so that kenneth and mr watson disgusted at the way in which the honorable erastus had captured the meeting left the schoolhouse and indignantly returned to elmhurst  this man hopkins said mr watson angrily is not a gentleman hes an impertinent meddler  he ruined any good effect my speech might have created said kenneth gloomily  give it up my boy advised the elder man laying a kindly hand on the youths shoulder it really isnt worth the struggle  but i cant give it up and acknowledge myself beaten protested kenneth almost ready to weep with disappointment  well well lets think it over ken and see what can be done perhaps that rascally hopkins was right when he advised you to find some other way to serve the community  i cant do better than to make it cleanto do away with these disreputable signs said the boy stubbornly  you made a fine speech declared mr watson gravely puffing his pipe i am very proud of you my lad  kenneth flushed red he was by nature shy and retiring to a degree only his pentup enthusiasm had carried him through the ordeal and now that it was over he was chagrined to think that the speech had been so ineffective he was modest enough to believe that another speaker might have done better     chapter iv  kenneth takes a bold step   this man hopkins gets on my nerves said mr watson a week or two after the eventful meeting in the schoolhouse he was at the breakfast table opposite kenneth and held up a big glaring postcard which was in his mail  what is it now asked the boy rousing himself from a fit of abstraction  an announcement offering himself for renomination at the primaries its like a circus advertisement isnt it a shame to think that modern politics has descended to such a level in our free and enlightened republic  kenneth nodded stirring his coffee thoughtfully he had lost his spirit and enthusiasm since the meeting and was fast relapsing into his old state of apathy and boredom it grieved mr watson to note this  hopkins isnt fit to be the representative for this district observed the old gentleman with sudden energy  the boy looked at him  who is hopkins he asked  his mother once kept a stationery shop in town and he was stable boy at the hotel but he was shrewd and prospered and when he grew up became a countyclerk or taxcollector then an assessor and finally he ran last term for state representative from this district and was elected by a mighty small majority  why small asked kenneth  because hes a democrat and the district is strongly republican but thompson ran against him on the republican ticket and couldnt win his party vote  whos thompson  the general store keeper he has a reputation for short weights and measures  the boy sipped his coffee thoughtfully  tell me sir how did you happen to know all this he asked  ive been looking up hopkinss record i have disliked the man ever since he treated us so shabbily on the night of the meeting  never mind him weve done with him  mr watson shifted uneasily in his chair  i wonder if we have he said  why not sir  well kenneth we have to reside at elmhurst which is hopkinss district also i believe elmhurst to be the most important estate in the district and you to be the largest taxpayer this man wishes to go to the state legislature and make laws for you to obey  well  well its our duty to watch him if he isnt a fit man its our duty to prevent him from representing us  the young man nodded somewhat dreamily  some of these country yokels must represent us he observed it doesnt matter much whether its hopkins or someone else  except that you being a prominent man owe it to the community to protect its interests added the lawyer  do you want me to mix in these petty politics asked the boy irritably  oh do as you like my boy if you can shirk your duties with a clear conscience ive nothing to say  for a time the young man was silent finally he asked  why isnt hopkins a good representative  hes what is called a grafter a term signifying that he is willing to vote for any measure that he is paid to vote for whether it benefits his constituents or not  oh is he singular in this  by no means the grafter is all too common in politics  again the boy fell into a thoughtful mood  mr watson am i a democrat or a republican  the old gentleman laughed outright  dont you know ken  no sir i havent asked myself before  then i advise you to be a republican  why  because hopkins is a democrat and we may then fight him openly  what is the difference sir between the two parties  there is no difference of importance all americans are loyal citizens whichever side they adopt in politics but the two parties are the positive and negative poles that provide the current of electricity for our nation and keep it going properly also they safeguard our interests by watching one another  what is your preference sir  ive always been a republican whenever i dabbled in politics which hasnt been often  then i will be a republican  very good  i am sorry to say that i know nothing about politics and have no convictions on the subject who is to oppose the honorable erastus on theon our side  i dont know yet the primaries for the nomination are not to be held for two weeks and the republican candidates seem shy about coming forward  didnt you say the district was republican  yes but since hopkins defeated them last term they seem to be terrified and no one likes to offer himself as a possible sacrifice  that feeling will probably elect mr hopkins declared kenneth with conviction  unless  unless what sir  unless we come to the rescue of the republicans and take a hand in local politics ourselves my lad  kenneth pushed back his chair and rose from the table he walked to the window and stood there whistling for a few moments and then left the room without a word  for a time mr watson sat silently musing  perhaps im inviting trouble he murmured but i am sure i am doing right the boy needs a good shaking up and more knowledge of his fellowmen if i can get kenneth interested this plan of mine will be of great benefit to him  then he too left the breakfast table and wandering into the garden saw kenneth busy at his easel in a shady corner  for a day or so the subject was not resumed and then mr watson casually introduced it  a law could be passed in the state legislature forbidding the display of all advertising signs in public places in this county he suggested  the boy looked at him eagerly  are you sure he asked  i am positive was the answer it is merely a question of privilege  and you think we might hire hopkins to pass such a law  no we couldnt trust him  then what do you propose  ill think it over my lad and let you know  then he walked away leaving kenneth much pleased with the idea he had advanced indeed he was so much interested in the suggestion that he himself referred to the subject at the first opportunity  i dont like to be beaten sir once ive undertaken to do a thing he said so if such a law can be passed ill do all i can to elect the man who will pass it  i thought as much the old lawyer replied smiling but theres only one man who could go to the legislature with enough influence to win the votes to carry such a unique measure through  and who is that sir  kenneth forbes the owner of elmhurst and the largest taxpayer in the county  me sir  youre the man  a state representative  its an honorable office its an important office properly filled you might not only beautify your district by having those objectionable signs prohibited but do many other things to better the condition of the farmers and that isnt all  whats the rest mr watson  you owe something to yourself lad all your young life youve been too selfcontained and exclusive in your habits the noblest study of mankind is man it would broaden you to go into politics for a time and do much to develop your character and relieve the monotony of your existence  kenneth frowned  it wont be easy you know itll be a fight and a hard one for hopkins wont give up his job if he can help it  the boy brightened again  i like a good fight he said wistfully if i thoughtif i believed i could fill the position with crediti might undertake it  ill answer for that retorted the old man highly pleased with his easy victory you win the fight ken and ill guarantee youll outclass the majority of your fellow representatives its a good state too  so the thing was undertaken and both the young man and the old threw themselves into the contest with energy and determination  mr watson rode in his buggy all over their district during the next fortnight and interviewed the farmers and townsmen of the legislative district when it became noised about that the young owner of elmhurst now barely twentyone had determined to enter politics and asked for the nomination of representative no other republican ventured to oppose him  it was understood to mean a hard fight and even the most sturdy republican was inclined to fear that the present incumbent of the office would be elected to succeed himself  so the primaries were held and kenneth attended and made a speech and was warmly applauded his nomination was a matter of course and he went home the unanimous choice of his party because none of the older and more discreet politicians ventured to risk defeat  the hon erastus hopkins well knew this feeling and smiled in his pompous and most sardonic manner when he learned who was his opponent having conquered an old and tried republican warrior in the last campaign he had no fears in regard to this mere boy who could know little of political intrigue  he wont put up enough of a fight to make it interesting im afraid mr hopkins confided to his cronies  but he didnt intend to take chances so he began the campaign with his usual vigor  it was now the middle of september and the election was to be early in november     chapter v  planning the work   the honorable erastus hopkins was thoroughly enjoying his campaign  he was not an especially popular man in his district and he knew it physically he was big and stout with a florid face and small eyes that blinked continually his head was bald his hands fat and red and his feet enormous  to offset this mr hopkins wore a silk hat and a prince albert coat morning noon and night his gold watchchain was huge and imposing he had a big diamond shirtstud and upon his puffy fingers several rings he conveyed nevertheless the impression that he was more prosperous than refined and the farmers and townsmen were as quick to recognize this as was mr watson himself  moreover the honorable erastus was dubbed closefisted by his neighbors he never spent a penny on anyone but himself and being unscrupulous in politics he was naturally unscrupulous in smaller things of a business nature but since he had risen from a stableboy to his present affluent position he had never been unwise or careless enough to be caught in any crooked action and while his acquaintances had an indefinite fear of dealing with him they could not accuse him openly  it seems strange that such a man should have been chosen to represent a wealthy and important district in the state legislature but politics can show many a similar case in the first place mr hopkins was aggressive and knew political methods thoroughly he had usurped the position of democratic leader in his community and the others were afraid to antagonize him openly when he was nominated for representative he managed to dictate by shrewd methods the nomination of thompson the storekeeper on the republican ticket thompson owed hopkins a large sum of money and hopkins held a mortgage on the stock therefore thompson dared not make a fight and although the republican vote was normally the largest in the district hopkins had managed to win enough of them to his side to win  he had been a little anxious about his renomination because he knew that he had not represented his district very satisfactorily but when kenneth forbes received the nomination on the republican ticket he felt that all was over but the shouting and that he would win in a walk had it been an issue between the personality of the two men hopkins would have had little chance of success but young forbes had already raised another issue by his antisign speech at the schoolhouse and hopkins intended to force that issue and so defeat kenneth because of the ridicule the latters position had already brought upon him  he began to circulate humorous stories about kenneths antipathy to signboards saying that the young man demanded that the signs be taken off the zodiac and that he wouldnt buy goods of the village grocer because the man had a sign out  mr hopkins also printed thousands of large handbills reading the signs of the times vs aristocratic snobbery vote for the hon erastus hopkins the man who believes in advertising  these things had their effect upon all classes of people there were many goodnatured laughs at young forbess expense all this was soon realized at elmhurst and had the effect of plunging the youthful aspirant for political honors into the depths of despair the campaign was hot against him but kenneth made no defense  at this juncture with election but three weeks away he received a telegram asking him to send the drag and baggage wagon to the noon train it was signed by john merrick and the boy was overjoyed at the prospect of seeing his jolly old friend again and the girls well some of them surely must be coming or uncle john wouldnt have asked for the drag  now then the election can go to blazes said kenneth cheerfully to mr watson the sight of some friendly faces will be a great relief  the old lawyer sighed his attempt to wake up kenneth had resulted in failure mainly because the boy had become discouraged so early in the game kenneth felt keenly the humiliating experiences he had passed through and had sunk back into his old moody reserve  but here was a welcome diversion the visitors whoever they might prove to be would afford relief to the situation and brighten the dullness of life at the big house so both kenneth and mr watson were with the drag at the station when the noon train drew in  and there were patsy doyle beth degraf and louise merrick a bevy of dainty and sprightly girls alighting eagerly from the coaches with uncle john handing out the grips and packages and giving the checks for the baggage with businesslike celerity to thomas the groom  weve come for a visit ken cried palsy laughing at his eager delight are you glad to see us boy and do you suppose old martha has our rooms aired  and its a long visit too added uncle john as youll believe when you see the pile of baggage youd think these minxes were prepared for a tour of the world each one of em brought a carload of clothes  but they couldnt phase kenneth in that way his sensitive face had not beamed with so much animation for months  the guests were helped into the tall drag and merrily they drove the five miles to elmhurst not a word of politics being spoken on the way  the girls had not been to the house since aunt janes death two years ago and after a hasty luncheon they began an inspection of every room as well as the garden grounds and stables the horses cows pig and chickens were alike inspected the roses and dahlias visited and admired and after all this they returned to their rooms with old martha the housekeeper and proceeded to unpack their trunks and get settled kenneth had been their guide and companion in these various explorations but when the girls went to their rooms he wandered into the library where uncle john and mr watson had been having a quiet talk over their pipes of tobacco they welcomed the young man but adroitly turned the topic of conversation and again the subject of was rejoined  it was a merry dinner party that graced the table during dinner that evening and the boy forgot his troubles and was as jolly and sociable as he had ever been in his life  but when they were all assembled in the long living room where they grouped themselves around the fireplace a sudden change took place in the demeanor of the young ladies patsy the delegated leader looked gravely at the boy and asked  how goes the campaign ken  whwhat campaign he stammered to gain time  why this election business tell us about it said patsy  some other time girls answered the boy red and distressed itit wouldnt interest you a bit  why not asked louise softly  because it doesnt interest me he replied  are you so sure of election inquired beth  im sure of defeat if you must know he declared scowling at the recollection of his predicament  you havent been cowardly enough to give up asked patricia boldly  what do you mean by that patsy doyle he asked the scowl deepening  just what i say ken a brave man doesnt know when hes beaten much less beforehand  he looked at her fixedly  im not brave my dear he replied more gently than they had expected the people here dont understand me nor i them im laughed at and reviled a subject for contemptuous jeers andand it hurts me i dont like to be beaten id fight to the last gasp if i had any show to win but these conditions which i foolishly but honestly brought about myself have defeated me so far in advance that i have absolutely no hope to redeem myself thats all dont speak of it again girls play me that nocturne that i like beth  weve got to speak of this kenneth and speak of it often for we girls have come down here to electioneer and for no other reason on earth declared patsy  what you electioneera slight smile curled his lips  exactly were here to brace up and get to work  and to win added beth quietly  and to put you in the legislature where you belong declared louise  kenneth turned to mr merrick  talk to them uncle john he begged  i have said the little man smiling and theyve convinced me that they mean business its all up with you my boy as a private citizen youre as good as elected  kens eyes filled  youre all very kind sir he said as you were bound to be andand i appreciate it allvery much but mr watson will tell you that the case is hopeless and theres nothing to be done  how about it watson inquired uncle john turning to the lawyer  ill explain the proposition sir so you will all understand it he replied and drew his chair into the circle to begin with kenneth visited the glen one day to make a sketch and found his old tablerock covered with an advertising sign  how preposterous exclaimed louise  there were three of these huge signs in different parts of the glen and they ruined its natural beauty kenneth managed to buy up the spaces and then he scrubbed away the signs by that time he had come to detest the unsightly advertisements that confronted him every time he rode out and he began a war of extermination against them  quite right said patsy nodding energetically  but our friend made little headway because the sympathies of the people were not with him  why not sir inquired beth while kenneth sat inwardly groaning at this baring of his terrible experiences  because through custom they had come to tolerate such things and could see no harm in them replied the lawyer they permit their buildings which face the roads to be covered with big advertisements and the fences are decorated in the same way in some places a signboard has been built in their yards or fields advertising medicines or groceries or tobacco in other words our country roads and country homes have become mere advertising mediums to proclaim the goods of more or less unscrupulous manufacturers and so all their attractiveness is destroyed kenneth being a man of artistic instincts and loving country scenes resented this invasion of commercialism and tried to fight it  and so ran my head against a stone wall added the young man with a bitter laugh  but you were quite right said patsy decidedly such things ought not to be permitted  the people think differently he replied  then we must educate the people to a different way of thinking announced louise  in three weeks  that is long enough if we get to work isnt it girls said beth  kenneth accepted the nomination with the idea of having a law passed prohibiting such signs explained the lawyer but mr hopkins his opponent has used this very thing to arouse public sentiment against him farmers around here are thrifty people and they fear to lose the trifling sums paid them for the privilege of painting signs on their premises  patsy nodded gravely  we will change all that she said the thing is really more serious than we expected and more difficult but we came here to work and win and were going to do it arent we uncle john  ill bet on your trio patsy replied her uncle but i wont bet all im worth  its all foolishness declared kenneth  i do not think so said the lawyer gravely the girls have a fine show to win i know our country people and they are more intelligent than you suppose once they are brought to a proper way of thinking they will support kenneth loyally  then we must bring them to a proper way of thinking said patsy with decision from this time on ken we become your campaign managers dont worry any more about the matter go on with your painting and be happy we may require you to make a few speeches but all the details will be arranged for you  do you intend to permit this uncle john asked kenneth  im wholly in sympathy with the girls ken and i believe in them  but consider the humiliation to which they will subject themselves ive had a taste of that medicine myself  were going to be the most popular young ladies in this district exclaimed patsy dont you worry about us ken but tell me how big is your district  it includes parts of three countiesmonroe washington and jackson counties  what county is this  monroe  any cities  no only a few towns its mostly a rural district fairview just across the border in washington county is the biggest village  have you an automobile  no i dont like the things ive always loved horses and prefer them to machines  how much money are you prepared to spend  how muchwhats that he asked bewildered  you cant win a political election without spending money declared patsy wisely ill bet the bad man is scattering money in every direction it will cost something on our side to run this campaign in a way to win  the young man frowned  i dont mind spending money patsy he said but i dont approve of buying votes and i wont allow it either  tuttut who said anything about buying votes but were going to work on a broad and liberal basis i assure you and we need money  spend all you like then so long as you dont try to corrupt the voters  very good now then how much land do you own at elmhurst  kenneth looked inquiringly at the lawyer  about twelve hundred acres said mr watson it is divided into small farms which are let out on shares  how many votes do you control among your servants and tenants proceeded patsy in a businesslike tone  perhaps thirty or forty  and what is the total vote of the district  thirtyfive hundred  patsy gasped  so many  fully that many said mr watson smiling  then weve got to have over seventeen hundred and fifty votes to elect kenneth  exactly  the girl drew a long breath and looked at beth and louise then they all laughed  suppose you resign as campaign managers said kenneth beginning to be amused  oh no itsits easier than we expected isnt it girls  its childs play observed louise languidly  the boy was astonished  very well said he try it and see  of course said patsy cheerfully tomorrow morning we begin work     chapter vi  a good start   at an early breakfast next morning patsy announced the program for the day  uncle john and i will drive over to the village she said and perhaps well be gone all day dont worry if were not back for luncheon louise and mr watson are going in the phaeton to visit some of the nearby farmers take one road dear and follow it straight along as far as it keeps within our legislative district and visit every farmhouse on the way  the farmers will all be busy in the fields said kenneth  louise doesnt care about the farmers retorted patsy shes going to talk to their wives  wives dont vote patsy  they tell their husbands how to vote though declared louise with a laugh let me win the women and ill win the men  what am i to do asked beth  youre to stay at home and write several articles for the newspapers there are seven important papers in our district and five of them are republican make a strong argument beth youre our publicity department also get up copy for some handhills and circular letters i want to get a circular letter to every voter in the district  all right said beth i know what you want  there was an inspiring air of business about these preparations and the girls were all eager to begin work scarcely was breakfast finished when the two equipages were at the door louise and mr watson at once entered the phaeton and drove away the girl delighted at the prospect of visiting the farmers wives and winning them by her plausible speeches conversation was louises strong point she loved to talk and argue and her manner was so confiding and gracious that she seldom failed to interest her listeners  patsy and uncle john drove away in kenneths buggy to the town and during the fivemile drive patsy counseled gravely with her shrewd uncle in regard to ways and means  this thing requires prompt action patsy he said and if were going to do things that count theyve got to be done on a big scale  true she admitted but oughtnt we to be a little careful about spending kenneths money  ill be your temporary banker said the old gentleman and keep track of the accounts if we win well present kenneth our bill and if we fail ill have the satisfaction of getting rid of some of that dreadful income that is swamping me  this was always uncle johns cry his enormous fortune was a constant bugbear to him he had been so interested in his business enterprises for many years that he had failed to realize how his fortune was growing and it astounded him to wake up one day and find himself possessed of many millions he had at once retired from active business and invested his millions in ways that would cause him the least annoyance but the income on so large a sum was more than he could take care of and even major doyle who managed these affairs for his brotherinlaw was often puzzled to know what to do with the money that accumulated  doubtless no one will ever know how much good these two kindly men accomplished between them in their quiet secretive way dozens of deserving young men were furnished capital to start them in business dozens more were being educated at universities at uncle johns expense managers of worthy charities were familiar with john merricks signature on checks and yet the vast fortune grew with leaps and bounds mr merricks life was so simple and unostentatious that his personal expenses however erratic some of his actions could not make much headway against his interest account and nothing delighted him more than to find a way to get even with fate by reckless squandering as he quaintly expressed it he was far too shrewd to become the prey of designing people but welcomed any legitimate channel in which to unload his surplus  so mr merrick had been revolving the possibilities of this unique political campaign in his mind and had decided to do some things that would open the bucolic eyes of kenneths constituents in wonder he did not confide all his schemes to patsy but having urged his nieces to attempt this conquest he had no intention of allowing them to suffer defeat if he could help it  the little town of elmwood was quiet and practically deserted when they drove into it the farmers were too busy with the harvest to come to town for trading except on saturdays and the arrival and departure of the two daily trains did not cause more than a ripple of excitement in the village  patsy decided she would shop at each and every store in the place and engage the storekeepers in conversation about the election  its important to win these people she declared because they are close to every farmer who comes to town to trade and their own votes count too  ill run over to the bank said uncle john and get acquainted there  so he tied the horses to a post and let patsy proceed alone upon her mission while he wandered over to a little brick building of neat appearance which bore the inscription bank in gold letters on its plateglass window  mr warren in he asked the clerk at the window  the banker a dignified old gentleman of considerable ability came out of his private office and greeted his visitor very cordially he had known uncle john when the millionaire visited elmhurst two years before and since then had learned more particulars concerning him so there was no need of an introduction and mr warren was delighted at the prospect of business relations with this famous personage  the bank although small and only one story high was the most modern and imposing building in the village and it was fitted with modern conveniences for mr warren had been successful and prosperous in his private office were local and long distance telephones a direct connection with the telegraph operator at the station and other facilities for accomplishing business promptly uncle john had remembered this fact and it had a prominent place in his plans  he followed the banker into his private office and told him briefly his intention to forward the interests of his young friend kenneth forbes for member of the legislature  the old gentleman shook his head at first predicting failure young forbes was his most important customer and he respected him highly but this antisign issue bade fair to ruin all his chances  the idea is too progressive and advanced to be considered at this time he stated positively the encroachments of advertisers on personal property may lead to a revolt in the future but it is still too early to direct popular opinion against them  isnt forbes a better man for the place than hopkins asked uncle john  undoubtedly sir and i think forbes would have won had not hopkins forced this unfortunate issue upon him as it is our young friend cannot avoid the consequences of his quixotic action  he doesnt wish to avoid them was the quiet reply were going to win on that issue or not at all  im afraid its hopeless sir  may i count on your assistance  in every way  thank you mr warren im going to spend a lot of money put this draft for fifty thousand to my credit as a starter  ah i begin to understand but  you dont understand at all yet may i use your long distance telephone  of course sir  uncle john had secured considerable information from mr watson and this enabled him to act comprehensively the advertising sign business in this part of the state was controlled by two firms who contracted directly with the advertisers and then had the signs painted upon spaces secured from the farmers by their wideawake agents these signs were contracted for by the year but the firms controlling the spaces always inserted protective clauses that provided for the removal of any sign when certain conditions required such removal in such cases a rebate was allowed to the advertiser this protective clause was absolutely necessary in case of fire alteration or removal of buildings or destruction of fences and signboards by weather or the requirements of the owners it was this saving clause in the contracts of which uncle john had decided to take advantage the contracting sign painters were merely in the business to make money  mr merrick got the head of the concern in cleveland over the telephone within half an hour he talked with the man at length and talked with the convincing effect that the mention of money has when he hung up the receiver uncle john was smiling then he called for the chicago firm with this second advertising company he met with more difficulties and mr warren had to come to the telephone and assure the man that mr merrick was able to pay all he agreed to and that the money was on deposit in his bank that enabled mr merrick to conclude his arrangements he knew that he was being robbed but the cooperation of the big chicago firm was necessary to his plans  then the telephone having served its purpose mr warren took uncle john across the street to the newspaper office and introduced him to charley briggs the editor  briggs was a man with one eye a sallow complexion and sandy hair that stuck straight up from his head he set type for his paper besides editing it and uncle john found him wearing a much soiled apron with his bare arms and fingers smeared with printers ink  mr merrick wants to see you on business charley said the banker whatever he agrees to i will guarantee to the full resources of my bank  the editor pricked up his ears and dusted a chair for his visitor with his apron it wasnt easy to make a living running a paper in elmwood and if there was any business pending he was anxious to secure it  uncle john waited until mr warren had left him alone with the newspaper man then he said  i understand your paper is democratic mr briggs  thats a mistake sir replied the editor evasively the herald is really independent but in political campaigns we adopt the side we consider the most deserving of support  youre supporting hopkins just now  only mildly only mildly sir  what is he paying you  why rast and i havent come to a definite settlement yet i ought to get a hundred dollars out of this campaign but rast thinks fifty is enough you see he plans on my support anyhow and dont like to spend more than hes obliged to  why does he plan on your support  hes the only live one in the game mr merrick rast is one of ushes one of the peopleand its policy for me to support him instead of the icicle up at elmhurst who dont need the job and dont care whether he gets it or not  is that true  i think so and theres another thing young forbes is dead against advertising and advertising is the life of a newspaper why there isnt a paper in the district thats supporting forbes this year  youve a wrong idea of the campaign mr briggs said uncle john it is because mr forbes believes in newspaper advertising and wants to protect it that hes against these signs thats one reason anyhow cant you understand that every dollar spent for painting signs takes that much away from your newspapers  why perhaps theres something in that mr merrick id never looked at it that way before  now see here mr briggs ill make you a proposition ill give you two hundred and fifty to support mr forbes in this campaign and if hes elected ill give you five hundred extra  do you mean that sir asked the editor scarcely able to believe the evidence of his ears  i do draw up a contract and ill sign it and heres a check for your twofifty in advance  the editor drew up the agreement with a pen that trembled a little  and now said uncle john get busy and hustle for kenneth forbes  i will sir said briggs with unexpected energy i mean to win that extra five hundred     chapter vii  patsy makes progress   meantime patsy was in the thick of the fray the druggist was a deepdyed democrat and sniffed when she asked him what he thought of forbes for representative  hes no politician at alljust an aristocrat declared latham a dapper little man with his hair slicked down to his ears and a waxed moustache and hes got fool notions too if he stopped the advertising signs i wouldnt sell half as many painkillers and liverpills  hes my cousin said patsy mendaciously for although they called themselves cousins there was no relationship even of marriage as patsys aunt jane had merely been betrothed to kenneths uncle when he died  im sorry for that miss replied the druggist hes going to be badly beaten  i think ill take two ounces of this perfumery it is really delightful some druggists have so little taste in selecting such things  yes miss i do rather pride myself on my perfumes replied latham graciously now heres a sachet powder that gives fine satisfaction  ill take a couple of packets of that too since you recommend it  latham began doing up the purchases there was no other customer in the store  you know miss i havent anything against mr forbes myself his people are good customers its his ideas i object to and hes a republican  havent you ever voted for a republican asked the girl dont you think it better to vote for the best man rather than the best party in a case like this  why perhaps it is but in what way is mr forbes the best man  hes honest he doesnt want to make any money out of the office on the contrary hes willing and able to spend a good deal in passing laws that will benefit his district  and hopkins  dont you know mr hopkins she asked pointedly  yes miss i do and latham frowned a little  as regards the advertising signs continued the girl ive heard you spoken of as a man of excellent taste and i can believe it since ive examined the class of goods you keep and your store is as neat and attractive as can be the fight is not against the signs themselves but against putting them on fences and barns and so making great glaring spots in a landscape where all should be beautiful and harmonious i suppose a man of your refinement and good taste has often thought of that and said the same thing  whyahemyes of course miss i agree with you that the signs are often out of place andand inharmonious  to be sure and so you must sympathize with mr forbess campaign  in that way yes of course said mr latham puzzled to find himself changing front so suddenly  mr hopkins has taken a lot of money out of this town remarked patsy examining a new kind of tooth wash but i cant find that hes ever given much of it back  thats true he buys his cigars of thompson the general store man and i keep the finest line ever brought to this town  oh that reminds me exclaimed patsy mr forbes wanted me to purchase a box of your choicest brand and have you just hand them out to your customers with his compliments he thinks he ought to show a little cordiality to the men who vote for him and he said you would know just the people to give them to  latham gasped but he assumed an air of much importance  i know every man that comes to this town miss as well as any youll find he said  the best brand mind you mr latham said the girl how much will they be  why the very bestthese imported perfectos you knoware worth six dollars a box of fifty perhaps for election purposes something a little cheaper  oh no the best is none too good for the friends of mr forbes you know and fiftywhy fifty will scarcely go around ill pay for a hundred mr latham and youll see they go to the right persons  of course of course miss and much obliged you see young forbes is well liked and hes quite a decent fellow i wouldnt be surprised if he gave hopkins a hard fight  ill tell you a secret said patsy sweetly mr forbes is bound to be elected why its all arranged in advance mr latham and the better element like yourself is sure to support him by the way you wont forget to tell people about those signs i hope that the fight is not against advertising but for beautiful rural homes and scenes  oh ill fix that miss  doyle im miss doyle mr forbess cousin  ill see that the people understand this campaign miss doyle you can depend on me  and if the cigars give out dont hesitate to open more boxes ill call in now and then and settle for them  i really think this young lady might have been ashamed of herself but she wasnt she smiled sweetly upon the druggist when he bowed her out and mr latham from that moment began to seek for friends of mr forbes to give cigars to if they were not friends he argued with them until they were for he was an honest little man in his way and tried to act in good faith  so the girl went from one shop to another making liberal purchases and seeking for every opening that would enable her to make a convert and her shrewd irish wit made her quick to take advantage of any weakness she discovered in the characters of the people she interviewed  when noon came uncle john hunted her up which was not difficult in elmwood and together they went to the village hotel to get something to eat the midday dinner was not very inviting but patsy praised the cooking to the landlords wife who waited upon the table and uncle john bought one of the landlords cigars after the meal and talked politics with him while he smoked it  then patsy went over to the general store and there she met her first rebuff thompson the proprietor was a sourvisaged man tall and lanky and evidently a dyspeptic having been beaten by hopkins at the last election when he ran against him on the republican ticket thompson had no desire to see forbes more successful than he had been himself and there were other reasons that made it necessary for him to support hopkins  so he was both gruff and disagreeable when patsy after buying a lot of ribbons of him broached the subject of politics he told her plainly that her cousin hadnt a ghost of a show and that he was glad of it  the young fool had no business to monkey with politics he added and this will teach him to keep his fingers out of someone elses pie  it isnt mr hopkinss pie declared patsy stoutly it belongs to whoever gets the votes  well thats hopkins he knows the game and forbes dont  cant he learn asked the girl  no hes an idiot always was a crank and an unsociable cuss when a boy and hes worse now hes grown up oh i know forbes all right and i havent got no use for him neither  argument was useless in this case the girl sighed gathered up her purchases and went into the hardware store  immediately her spirits rose here was a man who knew kenneth believed in him and was going to vote for him she had a nice talk with the hardware man and he gave her much useful information about the most important people in the neighborhoodthose it would be desirable to win for their candidate when he mentioned thompson she said  oh hes impossible ive talked with him  thompson is really a good republican replied mr andrews the hardware man but hes under hopkinss thumb and doesnt dare defy him  doesnt he like mr hopkins asked patsy in surprise  no he really hates him you see thompson isnt a very successful merchant he has needed money at times and borrowed it of hopkins at a high rate of interest its a pretty big sum now and hopkins holds a mortgage on the stock if he ever forecloses as he will do some day thompson will be ruined so hes obliged to shout for hopkins whether he believes in him or not  i think i understand him now said patsy smiling but he neednt have been so disagreeable  hes a disagreeable man at any time returned mr andrews  has he any political influence asked the girl  yes considerable otherwise he couldnt have secured the nomination when he pretended to run against hopkinsfor it was only a pretense you see hes a well known republican and when he sides for hopkins hes bound to carry many republicans with him  but there were other important people whom mr andrews thought might be influenced and he gave patsy a list of their names he seemed much amused at the earnestness of this girlish champion of the republican candidate  i do not think we can win he said as she left him but we ought to make a good showing for your cousin and ill do my very best to help you  as she rode home with uncle john in the afternoon after a day of really hard work patsy sized up the situation and declared that she was satisfied that she had made progress she told mr merrick of the mortgage held over thompson by mr hopkins and the little man made a mental note of the fact he also was satisfied with his days work and agreed to ride over to fairview the next day with her and carry the war into this the largest village in kenneths district  meantime louise and mr watson were having some interesting interviews with the farmers wives along the marville road the old lawyer knew nearly everyone in this part of the country for he had lived here all his life but he let louise do the talking and was much pleased at the tact and good nature she displayed in dealing with the widely different types of character she encountered  her method was quite simple and for that reason doubly effective she sat down in mrs simmonss kitchen where the good woman was ironing and said  im a cousin of mr forbes up at elmhurst you know hes running for a political office so as to do some good for his county and district and ive come to see if youll help me get votes for him  law sakes child exclaimed mrs simmons i aint got nuthin to do with politics  no but youve got a lot to do with mr simmons and thats where we need your help you see mr forbes thinks mr simmons is one of the most important men in this district and hes very anxious to win his vote  why dont you see dan then hes outn the rye field replied the woman  its because im only a girl and he wouldnt listen to me replied louise sweetly but he takes your advice about everything i hear  he dont take it as often as he orter dont dan interrupted mrs simmons pausing to feel whether her iron was hot  perhaps not agreed louise but in important things such as this hes sure to listen to you and we women must stick together if we want to win this election  but i dont know nothin about it protested mrs simmons an i dont believe dan does  you dont need to know much mrs simmons replied the girl what a pretty baby that is all you need do is to tell dan he must vote for mr forbes and see that he agrees to do so  why was the pointed query  well there are several reasons one is that mr hopkinsmr erastus hopkins you know is the other candidate and a person must vote for either one or the other of them  dans a friend o rastus said the woman thoughtfully i seen em talkin together the other day  but this isnt a matter of friendship its business and mr forbes is very anxious to have your husband with him if mr forbes is elected it means lighter taxes better roads and good schools if mr hopkins is elected it does not mean anything good except for mr hopkins  i guess youre right about that laughed the woman rast dont let much get away from him  youre very clever mrs simmons you have discovered the fact without being told  oh i know rast hopkins an so does dan  then i can depend on you to help us asked the girl patting the tousled head of a little girl who stood by staring at the pretty lady  ill talk to him but i dunno what good itll do said mrs simmons thoughtfully  i know he wont refuse to do what you ask him for a man always listens to his wife when he knows shes right youll win mrs simmons and i want to thank you for saving the election for us if we get mr simmons on our side i believe well be sure to defeat hopkins  oh ill do what i kin was the ready promise and after a few more remarks about the children and the neatness of the house louise took her leave  will she win him over asked the girl of mr watson when they were jogging on to the next homestead  i really cant say my dear replied the old lawyer thoughtfully but i imagine shell try to and if dan doesnt give in mrs simmons will probably make his life miserable for a time you flattered them both outrageously but that will do no harm  and so it went on throughout the day sometimes the farmer himself was around the house and then they held a sort of conference louise asked his advice about the best way to win votes and said she depended a great deal upon his judgment she never asked a man which side he favored but took it for granted that he was anxious to support mr forbes and this subtle flattery was so acceptable that not one declared outright that he was for hopkins whatever his private views might have been  when evening came and they had arrived at elmhurst again louise was enthusiastic over her work of the day and had many amusing tales to tell of her experiences  how many votes did you win asked uncle john smiling at her  i cant say she replied but i didnt lose any if one sows plenty of seed some of it is bound to sprout  we can tell better after election said mr watson but im satisfied that this is the right sort of work mr merrick to get results  so am i returned uncle john heartily are you willing to keep it up louise  of course she exclaimed we start again bright and early tomorrow morning     chapter viii  the honorable erastus is astonished   the honorable erastus hopkins had been absent at the state capital for several days looking after various matters of business for he was a thrifty man and watched his investments carefully  whenever his acquaintances asked about his chances for reelection the honorable erastus hopkins winked laughed and declared its a regular walkover  who is opposing you once asked a grayhaired senator of much political experience who had met mr hopkins at luncheon  young feller named forbesa boy sirwith no notion about the game at all he was pledged to an unpopular issue so i was mighty glad to have him run against me  what issue is he pledged to asked the senator  oh hes agin putting advertising signs on fences and barns and wants to have them prohibited like the infernal fool he is  indeed then hes a progressive fellow and you say his issue is unpopular  thats what it is itll kill his chancesif he ever had any  strange mused the senator that issue has been a winning one usually  what do you mean asked the astonished hopkins  why the antisign fight has won in several places throughout the country and local laws have been passed prohibiting them didnt you know that  no said hopkins  well its true of course i do not know the temper of your people but in a country district such as yours i would think an issue of that sort very hard to combat  nonsense exclaimed the honorable erastus evry man jacks agin the fool notion  then perhaps the people dont understand it  forbes has given up already continued hopkins laughing at the recollection hes gone back into his shell like a turtle an wont come out to fight i tell you senator hes the worst licked candidate that ever ran for office  nevertheless the suggestion that the antisign issue had been successful in other localities made mr hopkins a trifle uneasy and he decided to return home and keep the fight going until after election whether young forbes came out of his shell or not  he arrived at hilldale on the early morning train and went to his house for breakfast to his amazement he found two great banners strung across the village streets bearing the words vote for forbesthe peoples champion  who in thunder could a done that murmured mr hopkins staring openmouthed at the great banners then he scratched his head with a puzzled air and went home  mrs hopkins a tiredlooking woman in a bedraggled morning wrapper was getting the breakfast she did not participate largely in the prosperity of her husband and often declared she was worked to death although there were no children to care for  when did those forbes banners go up asked mr hopkins irritably  i dunno rast i dont keep track o such things but all the town was out to the girls meetin last night an i went along to watch the fun  what girls meeting  the girls thet air workin fer to elect mr forbes it was in the town hall an all three of the girls made speeches  what about  about mr forbes and how he orter be elected he wants to beautify the farm places by doin away with signs an he wants better roads an three new schoolhouses cause the ones weve got now aint big enough an  you blamed idiot what are you talking about roared the exasperated hopkins  oh you neednt rave at me rast hopkins just cause youre gettin licked i thought your goose was cooked the minnit these girls got to work  mr hopkins stared at her with a dazed expression  be sensible mary and tell me who these girls are i havent heard of em  why theyre cousins o kenneth forbes it seems an come from new york to git him elected  what are they like  theyre swell dressers rast an nice appearin girls and mighty sharp with their tongues they had a good meetin last night and therell be another at the town hall next week  pah girls forbes oughter be ashamed of himself to send a bunch o girls out electioneerin i never heard of such an irregular thing what do the boys say  folks dont say much to me rast they wouldnt you know but i guess your game is up  he made no reply here indeed was information of a startling character and it came upon him like thunder out of a clear sky yet the thing might not be so important as mrs hopkins feared  very thoughtfully he unfolded the morning paper and the next moment uttered a roar of wrath and vexation briggs was one of his standbys and the herald heretofore had always supported him yet here across the first page were big black letters saying vote for forbes and the columns were full of articles and paragraphs praising forbes and declaring that he could and would do more for the district than hopkins  i must see briggs muttered the honorable erastus hes tryin to make me put up that hundredan i guess ill have to do it  he looked over the other newspapers which were heaped upon his desk in the sittingroom and was disgusted to find all but one of the seven papers in the district supporting forbes really the thing began to look serious and he had only been absent a week  he had not much appetite for breakfast when mrs hopkins set it before him but the honorable erastus was a born fighter and his discovery had only dismayed him for a brief time already he was revolving ways of contesting this new activity in the enemys camp and decided that he must talk with the boys at once  so he hurried away from the breakfast table and walked downtown latham was first on his route and he entered the drug store  hullo jim  good morning mr hopkins anything i can do for you asked the polite druggist  yes a lot tell me what these fool girls are up to that are plugging for forbes ive been away for a week you know  cant say mr hopkins im sure business is pretty lively these days and it keeps me hustling ive no time for politics  but weve got to wake up jim we democrats or theyll give us a run for our money  oh this is a republican district sir we cant hope to win it often and especially in a case like this  why not  looks to me as if youd bungled things hopkins but im not interested in this campaign excuse me if theres nothing you want ive got a prescription to fill  mr hopkins walked out moodily it was very evident that latham had changed front but they had never been very staunch friends and he could find a way to even scores with the little druggist later  thompson was behind his desk at the general store when hopkins walked in  look here said the honorable representative angrily whats been going on in elmwood whats all this plugging for forbes mean  thompson gave him a sour look over the top of his desk  addressin them remarks to me rast  yesto you youve been loafing on your job old man and it wont doit wont do at all you should have put a stop to these things what right have these girls to interfere in a game like this  oh shut up rast  thompson by crickey i wont stand this from you goin back on me eh  im a republication rast  so you are said mr hopkins slowly his temper at white heat and that mortgage is two months overdue  go over to the bank and get your money then its waiting for you hopkinsinterest and all go and get it and let me alone im busy  perhaps the politician had never been so surprised in his life anger gave way to sudden fear and he scrutinized the averted countenance of thompson carefully  whered you raise the money thompson  none of your business i raised it  forbes eh forbes has bought you up i see grateful fellow aint youwhen i loaned you money to keep you from bankruptcy  you did hopkins you made me your slave and threatened me every minute unless i did all your dirty work grateful youve led me a dogs life but im through with you nowfor good and all  hopkins turned and walked out without another word in the dentists office dr squiers was sharpening and polishing his instruments  hello archie  hello rast bout time you was getting back old man were having a big fight on our hands i can tell you  tell me more said mr hopkins taking a chair with a sigh of relief at finding one faithful friend whats up archie  an invasion of girls mostly they took us by surprise the other day and started a campaign worthy of old political warhorses theres some shrewd politician behind them i know or they wouldnt have nailed us up in our coffins with such businesslike celerity  talk sense archie what have they done what can they do pah girls  dont make a mistake rast thats what i did before i understood when i heard that three girls were electioneering for forbes i just laughed then i made a discovery theyre young and rich and evidently ladies theyre pretty too and the men give in at the first attack they dont try to roast you thats their cleverness they tell what forbes can do with all his money if hes representative and they swear hell do it  never mind said hopkins easily well win the men back again  but these girls are riding all over the country talking to farmers wives and theyre organizing a womans political club the club is to meet at elmhurst and to be fed on the fat of the land so every woman wants to belong theyve got two expensive automobiles down from the city with men to make them go and theyre spending money right and left  thats bad said hopkins shifting uneasily for i havent much to spend myself but most money is fooled away in politics when i spend a cent it counts i can tell you  youll have to spend some rast to keep your end up im glad youre back for we democrats have been getting demoralized some of the boys are out for forbes already  hopkins nodded busy with his thoughts  ive talked with latham but he didnt count and theyve bought up thompson what else theyve done i cant tell yet but one things certain doc well win out in a canter im too old a rat to be caught in a trap like this ive got resources they dont suspect  i believe you rast theyve caught on to the outside fakes to win votes but they dont know the inside deals yet  youre right but i must make a bluff to offset their daylight campaign so as not to lose ground with the farmers theyre the ones that count after all not the town people see here doc i had an idea something might happen and so i arranged with my breakfast food company to let me paint a hundred signs in this neighborhood a hundred mind you and that means a big laugh on forbes and the good will of the farmers who sell their spaces and not a cent out of my pocket hows that for a checkmate  thats fine replied dr squiers theres been considerable talk about this sign business and im told that at the meeting last night one of the girls made a speech about it and said the farmers were being converted and were now standing out for clean fences and barns  thats all humbug  i think so myself these people are like a flock of sheep get them started a certain way and you cant head them off observed the dentist  then we must start them our way declared hopkins ive got the order for these signs in my pocket and ill have em painted all over the district in a week keep your eyes open doc if weve got to fight we wont shirk it but i dont look for much trouble from a parcel of girls  mr hopkins was quite cheerful by this time for he had thought out the situation and his fighting blood was up as he expressed it  he walked away whistling softly to himself and decided that he would go over to the livery stable get a horse and buggy drive out into the country and spend the day talking with the farmers  but when he turned the corner into the side street where the livery was located he was astonished to find a row of horses and wagons lining each side of the street and in each vehicle two men in white jumpers and overalls the men were in charge of huge cans of paints assorted brushes ladders scaffolds and other paraphernalia  there must have been twenty vehicles altogether and some of the rigs were already starting out and driving briskly away in different directions  mr hopkins was puzzled he approached one of the whiteoveralled men who was loading cans of paint into a wagon and inquired  who are you fellows  sign painters answered the man with an amused look  who do you work for  the carson advertising sign company of cleveland  oh i see replied hopkins got a big job in this neighborhood  pretty big sir  whos your foreman  smith hes in the livery office  then the man climbed into his wagon and drove away and hopkins turned into the livery office a thinfaced man with sharp eyes was talking with the proprietor  is this mr smith asked hopkins  yes  of the carson advertising sign company  yes  well ive got a big job for you my names hopkins i want a hundred big signs painted mighty quick  sorry sir weve got all we can handle here for two or three weeks  its got to be done quick or not at all cant you send for more men  weve got thirtyeight on this job and cant get any more for love or money had to send to chicago for some of these  rush job  yes sir youll have to excuse me ive got to get started this is only our second day and were pretty busy  wait a minute called the bewildered hopkins following smith to his buggy what concern is your firm doing all this painting for  a man named merrick  then the foreman drove away and mr hopkins was left greatly puzzled  merrickmerrick he repeated i dont remember any big advertiser by that name it must be some new concern anyhow it all helps in my fight against forbes  he again returned to the livery office and asked for a rig  everything out mr hopkins ive hired everything to be had in town for this signpainting gang  but mr hopkins was not to be balked as long as these signpainters were doing missionary work for his cause among the farmers he decided to drive over to fairview and see the party leaders in that important town so he went back to dr squierss house and borrowed the doctors horse and buggy  he drove along the turnpike for a time in silence then it struck him that there was a peculiar air of neatness about the places he passed the barns and fences all seemed newly painted and he remembered that he hadnt seen an advertising sign since he left town  a mile farther on he came upon a gang of the sign painters who with their huge brushes were rapidly painting the entire length of a weatherworn fence with white paint  mr hopkins reined in and watched them for a few moments  you signpainters dont seem to be getting any signs started he observed  no replied one of the men laughing this is a peculiar job for our firm to tackle weve made a contract to paint out every sign in the district  paint em out  yes cover them up with new paint and get rid of them  but how about the advertisers dont they own the spaces now  they did but theyve all been bought up john merrick owns the spaces now and were working for john merrick  whos he  some friend of mr forbes up at elmhurst  mr hopkins was not a profane man but he said a naughty word and then he cut his horse so fiercely with the whip that the poor beast gave a neigh of terror and started down the road at a gallop     chapter ix  ol will rogers   beth had her folding table out in the rose garden where kenneth was working at his easel and while the boy painted she wrote her campaign letters and editorials  at first ken had resented the management of his campaign by his three girl friends but soon he was grateful for their assistance and proud of their talents it was at their own request that he refrained from any active work himself merely appearing at the meetings they planned where he made his speeches and impressed his hearers with his earnestness he was really an excellent speaker and his youth and enthusiasm counted much in his favor  he protested mildly when louise invited the womens political club to meet at elmhurst on thursday afternoon but mr watson assured him that this was an important play for popularity so he promised to meet them tables were to be spread upon the lawn for the late october weather was mild and delightful and louise planned to feed the women in a way that they would long remember  patsy had charge of the towns and louise of the country districts but beth often aided louise who had a great deal of territory to cover  the automobiles uncle john had ordered sent down were a great assistance to the girls and enabled them to cover twice as much territory in a day as would have been done with horses  but although they worked so tirelessly and earnestly it was not all plain sailing with the girl campaigners yet though they met with many rebuffs they met very little downright impertinence twice louise was asked to leave a house where she had attempted to make a proselyte and once a dog was set upon beth by an irate farmer who resented her automobile as much as he did her mission as for patsy she was often told in the towns that a young girl ought to be in better business than mixing up in politics and she was sensitive enough once or twice to cry over these reproaches when alone in her chamber but she maintained a cheerful front and in truth all the girls enjoyed their work immensely  while beth and kenneth were in the garden this sunny afternoon james came to say that a man wanted to see one of the politics young ladies  shall we send him about his business beth asked the boy  oh no we cant afford to lose a single vote bring him here james please said the girl  so presently a wizened little man in worn and threadbare garments his hat in his hand came slowly into the garden his sunken cheeks were covered with stubby gray whiskers his shoulders were stooped and bent from hard work and his hands bore evidences of a life of toil yet the eyes he turned upon beth as she faced him had a wistful and pleading look that affected her strangely  afternoon miss he said in a hesitating voice iim rogers miss ol will rogers ii spose you haint heerd o me before  im glad to meet you mr rogers replied the girl in her pleasant voice have you come to see me about the election  itsits sumpn bout the lection an then agin it aint but i run the chanct o seein ye because were in desprit straits an nell advised that i hev a talk with ye frank an outright says nell dont beat about the bush says she go right to th point an theyll say yes or no  beth laughed merrily and the boy smiled as he wielded his brush with delicate strokes  ye mustnt mind me miss said will rogers in a deprecating tone imim sommut broke up an discouraged an aint th man i used to be nell knows that an she orter came herself but it jes made her cry to think o it an so i says ill come an do the best i kin  beth was really interested now  sit down on this bench mr rogers she said and ill listen to whatever you have to say  he sat down willingly bent forward as he rested upon the garden bench and twirled his hat slowly in his hands  taint easy ye know miss to say some things an this is one o the hardest he began  go on said beth encouragingly for old will had suddenly stopped short and seemed unable to proceed  they say miss as you folks is aspendin uv a lot o money on this election agittin votes an sich like he said in an altered tone  it costs a little to run a political campaign acknowledged beth  they say moneys bein poured out liken waterto git votes he persisted  well mr rogers  well thets how it started ye see were so agonizin poor nell thought we orter git some o the money while its goin  the girl was much amused such frankness was both unusual and refreshing  have you a vote to sell she asked  he did not answer at once but sat slowly twirling his hat  thats jet what nell thought yed ask he said finally an she knew if ye did it was all up with our plan guess ill be goin miss  he rose slowly from his seat but the girl did not intend to lose any of the fun this queer individual might yet furnish  sit down mr rogers she said and tell me why you cant answer my questions  i guess ill hev to speak out an tell all said he his voice trembling a little although i thought fer a minnit i could see my way without i cant sell my vote miss cause ive been plannin tvote fer mr forbes anyhow but we wanted some uv th money thats being wasted an we wanted it mighty bad  why  thets the hard part uv it miss but im goin to tell you did ye ever hear o lucy  no mr rogers  lucys our girlthe ony chick er child we ever had shes a pretty girl is lucy a good deal liken her mother wi the same high spirits my nell had afore she broke down mostly nell cries nowadays  yes go on  lucy had a schoolin an we worked hard to give it her fer my land aint much account nohow an when she grew up she had more boys comin to see her than any gal this side o fairview an one o em caught lucys fancy but she was too young to marry an she wanted to be earnin money so she got a job workin fer doc squiers over to elmwood hes the dentist there an lucy helped with the housework an kept the office slicked up an earned evry penny she got  he stopped here and looked vacantly around  beth tried to help the old man  and then she asked softly  then come the trouble miss one day ol mis squiers the docs mother missed a dimon ring she laid it on the mantel an it was gone an she said as lucy took it lucy didnt take it an after theyd tried to make my gal confess as she was a thief they give er three days to hand up the ring or the money it was worth or else theyd hev her arrested and sent t jail lucy didnt take it ye know she jes couldnt do sech a thing natcherly  i know said beth sympathetically  so she comes home heartbroken an told us about it an we didnt hev th money nuther it were sixty dollars they wanted or th ring an we didnt hev neither of em  of course not  well tom come over thet night to see lucy hearin she was home an  who is tom  thets tom gates him thetbut im comin to thet miss tom always loved lucy an wanted to marry her but his folks is as poor as we are so the young uns had to wait tom worked at the mill over t fairviewthe big sawmill where they make the lumber an things  i know  he was the bookkeeper fer tom had schoolin too an he took private lessons in bookkeepin from ol cheeseman so he had got hired at the mill an had a likely job an was doin well an when tom heerd about lucys trouble an thet she had only two days left before goin to jail he up an says ill get the money lucy don you worry a bit oh tom says she hev you got sixty dollars saved already ive got it lucy says he an ill go over tomorrow an pay doc squiers don you worry any more forget all about it well o course miss that helped a lot nell an lucy both felt the disgrace of the thing but it wouldnt be a public disgrace like goin to jail so we was all mighty glad tom had that sixty dollars  it was very fortunate said beth filling in another pause  the nex day tom were as good as his word he paid doc squiers an got a receipt an giv it to lucy then we thought th trouble was over but it had ony just begun monday mornin tom was arrested over t the mill fer passin a forged check an gettin sixty dollars on it lucy was near frantic with grief she walked all the way to fairview an they let her see tom in the jail he tol her it was true he forged th check but he did it to save her he was a man an it wouldnt hurt fer him to go to jail so much as it would a girl he said he was glad he did it an didnt mind servin a sentence in prison i think miss as tom meant thetevry word uv it but lucy broke down under the thing an raved an cried an nuther nell ner i could do anything with her she said shed ruined toms life an all thet an she didnt want to live herself then she took sick an nell an i nursed her as careful as we could hown the wurld she ever got away we cant make out nohow  did she get away asked the girl noting that the old mans eyes were full of tears and his lips trembling  yes miss shes bin gone over ten days now an we dont even know where to look fer her our girlour poor lucy she aint right in her head ye know or shed never a done it shed never a left us like this in th world taint like our lucy  kenneth had turned around on his stool and was regarding old will rogers earnestly brush and pallet alike forgotten beth was trying to keep the tears out of her own eyes for the old mans voice was even more pathetic than his words  ten days ago said kenneth and she hasnt been found yet  we cant trace her anywhere an nell has broke down at las an dont do much but cry its hard siri cant bear to see nell cry shed sich high sperrits onct  wheres the boy tom asked kenneth somewhat gruffly  hes in the jail yet waitin to be tried court dont set till next week they say  and where do you live rogers  five miles up the fairview road taint much of a placenell says ive always bin a shifles lot an i guess its true yesterday your hired men painted all the front o my fencepainted it whitenot only where th signs was but th whole length of it we didnt ask it done but they jes done it i watched em an nell says if we ony had th money thet was wasted on thet paint an labor we might find our lucy its a shame says nell all thet lection money bein thrown away on paint when it might save our poor crazy child i hope it aint wrong sir but thets what i thought too so we laid plans fer me to come here today ef i kin get ahold o any o thet money honest i want to do it  have you got a horse asked kenneth  not now i owned one las year but he died on me an i cant get another nohow  did you walk here asked beth  yes miss o course ive walked the hull county over atryin to find lucy i don mind the walking much  there was another pause while old will rogers looked anxiously at the boy and the girl and they looked at each other then beth took out her purse  i want to hire your services to help us in the election she said briskly ill furnish you a horse and buggy and you can drive around and talk with people and try to find lucy at the same time this twenty dollars is to help you pay expenses you neednt account for it just help us as much as you can  the old man straightened up and his eyes filled again  nell said if it was a matter o charity i mustnt take a cent he observed in a low voice  it isnt charity its business and now that we know your story we mean to help you find your girl anyone would do that you know tell me what is lucy like  shes like nell used to be  but we dont know your wife describe lucy as well as you can is she tall  middlin miss  light or dark  heh  is her hair light or dark colored  middlin jes middlin miss  well is she stout or thin  i should say sorter betwixt an between miss  how old is lucy  jes turned eighteen miss  never mind beth interrupted the boy you wont learn much from old wills description but well see what can be done tomorrow call james and have him sent home in the rig hes going to use it seems to me youre disposing rather freely of my horses and carts  yes ken youve nothing to say about your belongings just now but if you object to this plan  i dont the girl must be found and her father is more likely to find her than a dozen other searchers he shall have the rig and welcome  so it was that will rogers drove back to his heartbroken wife in a smart topbuggy with twenty dollars in his pocket and a heart full of wonder and thanksgiving     chapter x  the forged check   kenneth and beth refrained from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogerss visit but they got mr watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check  it was a serious crime indeed mr watson told them and tom gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in states prison as a consequence of his rash act  but it was a generous act too said beth  i cant see it in that light said the old lawyer it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved i do not doubt the girl was unjustly accused the squierses are a selfish hardfisted lot and the old lady especially is a well known virago but they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff so this boy was doubly foolish in ruining himself to get sixty dollars to pay an unjust demand  he was softhearted and impetuous said beth and being in love he didnt stop to count the cost  that is no excuse my dear declared mr watson indeed there is never an excuse for crime the young man is guilty and he must suffer the penalty  is there no way to save him asked kenneth  if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom but under the circumstances i doubt if such an arrangement could be made  were going to try it anyhow was the prompt decision  so as soon as breakfast was over the next morning beth and kenneth took one of the automobiles the boy consenting unwillingly to this sort of locomotion because it would save much time fairview was twelve miles away but by ten oclock they drew up at the county jail  they were received in the little office by a man named markham who was the jailer he was a roundfaced respectable appearing fellow but his mood was distinctly unsociable  want to see tom gates eh well what for he demanded  we wish to talk with him answered kenneth  talk whats the good youre no friend of tom gates i cant be bothered this way anyhow  i am kenneth forbes of elmhurst im running for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly  oh say thats different observed markham altering his demeanor you mustnt mind my being gruff and grumpy mr forbes ive just stopped smoking a few days ago and its got on my nerves something awful  may we see gates at once asked kenneth  surely ill take you to his cell myself its just shocking how such a little thing as stoppin smoking will rile up a fellow come this way please  they followed the jailer along a succession of passages  smoked ever sence i was a boy you know an had to stop last week because doc said it would kill me if i didnt remarked the jailer leading the way sometimes im that yearning for a smoke im nearly crazy an i dunno which is worst dyin one way or another this is gates cellthe best in the shop  he unlocked the door and called  heres visitors tom  thank you mr markham replied a quiet voice as a young man came forward from the dim interior of the cell how are you feeling today  worse tom worse n ever replied the jailer gloomily  well stick it out old man dont give in  i wont tom smokin ll kill me sure an theres a faint hope o livin through this struggle to give it up this visitor is mr forbes of elmhurst an the young lady is  miss degraf said kenneth noticing the boys face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it will you leave us alone please mr markham  surely mr forbes youve got twenty minutes according to regulations ill come and get you then sorry we havent any reception room in the jail all visits has to be made in the cells  then he deliberately locked kenneth and beth in with the forger and retreated along the passage  sit down please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice theres a bench here  weve come to inquire about your case gates said kenneth it seems you have forged a check  yes sir i plead guilty although ive been told i ought not to confess but the fact is that i forged the check and got the money and im willing to stand the consequences  why did you do it asked beth  he was silent and turned his face away  a fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates with steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth he was of sturdy athletic build and dressed neatly in a suit that was of coarse material but well brushed and cared for  beth thought his appearance pleasing and manly kenneth decided that he was ill at ease and in a state of dogged selfrepression  we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it but there is no doubt you have acted very foolishly  do you know lucy sir asked the young man  no  lucy is very proud the thing was killing her and i couldnt bear it i didnt stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and im glad i did  you have made her still more unhappy said beth gently  yes shell worry about me i know im disgraced for life but ive saved lucy from any disgrace and shes young shell forget me before ive served my term andand take up with some other young fellow  would you like that asked beth  no indeed he replied frankly but it will be best that way i had to stand by lucyshes so sweet and gentle and so sensitive i dont say i did right i only say id do the same thing again  couldnt her parents have helped her inquired kenneth  no old will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since mrs rogers had her accident  oh did she have an accident asked beth  yes didnt you know shes blind  her husband didnt tell us that said the girl  he was fairly prosperous before that for mrs rogers was an energetic and sensible woman and kept old will hard at work one morning she tried to light the fire with kerosene and lost her sight then rogers wouldnt do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin  i understand now said beth  lucy could have looked after her mother said young bates but old will was stubborn and wouldnt let her so the girl saw something must be done and went to work thats how all the trouble came about  he spoke simply but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them it was evident that his feelings were deeper than he cared to make evident  whose name did you sign to the check asked kenneth  that of john e marshall the manager of the mill he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern its a stock company and rich i was bookkeeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature as regards my robbing the company ill say that i saved them a heavy loss one day i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant but marshall never even thanked me he only discharged the man who was responsible for the fire  how long ago were you arrested asked beth  its nearly two weeks now but ill have a trial in a few days they say my crime is so serious that the circuit judge has to sit on the case  do you know where lucy is  shes at home i suppose i havent heard from her since the day she came here to see meright after my arrest  they did not think best to enlighten him at that time it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth  im going to see mr marshall said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you  thank you sir it wont be much but im grateful to find a friend im guilty you know and theres no one to blame but myself  they left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office  toms a very decent lad remarked the jailer on the way he aint a natural criminal you know just one o them that gives in to temptation and is foolish enough to get caught ive seen lots of that kind in my day you dont smoke do you mr forbes  no mr markham  then dont begin it or if you do never try to quit itsits awful it is and it ruins a mans disposition  the mill was at the outskirts of the town it was a busy place perhaps the busiest in the whole of the eighth district and in it were employed a large number of men the office was a small brick edifice separated from the main buildings in which the noise of machinery was so great that one speaking could scarcely be heard the manager was in kenneth and beth learned but could not see them until he had signed the letters he had dictated for the noon mail  so they sat on a bench until a summons came to admit them to mr marshalls private office  he looked up rather ungraciously but motioned them to be seated  mr forbes of elmhurst he asked glancing at the card kenneth had sent in  yes sir  ive been bothered already over your election campaign resumed the manager arranging his papers in a bored manner some girl has been here twice to interview my men and i have refused to admit her you may as well understand sir that i stand for the democratic candidate and have no sympathy with your side  that doesnt interest me especially sir answered kenneth smiling im not electioneering just now ive come to talk with you about young gates  oh well sir what about him  im interested in the boy and want to save him from prosecution  hes a forger mr forbes a deliberate criminal  i admit that but hes very young and his youth is largely responsible for his folly  he stole my money  it is true mr marshall  and he deserves a term in states prison  i agree to all that nevertheless i should like to save him said kenneth his trial has not yet taken place and instead of your devoting considerable of your valuable time appearing against him it would be much simpler to settle the matter right here and now  in what way mr forbes  ill make your money loss good  it has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance  i can well believe it sir ill pay twice sixty dollars for the delivery to me of the forged check and the withdrawal of the prosecution  and the costs  ill pay all the costs besides  youre foolish why should you do all this  i have my own reasons mr marshall please look at the matter from a business standpoint if you send the boy to prison you will still suffer the loss of the money by compromising with me you can recover your loss and are paid for your annoyance  youre right give me a check for a hundred and fifty and ill turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings  kenneth hesitated a moment he detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates he had hoped to find mr marshall a man of sympathy but the manager was as cold as an icicle  beth uneasy at his silence nudged him  pay it ken she whispered  very well mr marshall said he i accept your terms  the check was written and handed over and marshall took the forged check from his safe and delivered it with the other papers in the case to mr forbes he also wrote a note to his lawyer directing him to withdraw the prosecution  kenneth and beth went away quite happy with their success and the manager stood in his little window and watched them depart there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face  of all the easy marks i ever encountered muttered mr marshall this young forbes is the easiest why hes a fool thats what he is he might have had that forged check for the face of it if hed been sharp you wouldnt catch rast hopkins doing such a fool stunt not in a thousand years  meantime beth was pressing kenneths arm as she sat beside him and saying happily  im so glad kenso glad and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars and now we must find the girl  yes replied the boy cheerfully we must find lucy     chapter xi  a mysterious disappearance   a woman was sitting in a low room engaged in knitting her feet were stretched out toward a small fire that smouldered in an open hearth she wore a simple calico gown neat and wellfitting and her face bore traces of much beauty that time and care had been unable wholly to efface  suddenly she paused in her work her head turned slightly to one side to listen  come in sir she called in a soft but distinct voice come in miss  so kenneth and beth entered at the halfopen porch door and advanced into the room  is this mrs rogers asked beth looking at the woman curiously the womans eyes were closed but the lashes fell in graceful dark curves over her withered cheeks the girl wondered how she had been able to know her visitors sex so accurately  yes i am mrs rogers said the sweet sad voice and i think you are one of the young ladies from elmhurstperhaps the one will talked to  you are right mrs rogers i am elizabeth degraf  and your companionis it mr forbes the woman asked  yes madam replied kenneth astonished to find wills wife speaking with so much refinement and gracious ease  you are very welcome will you please find seats my affliction renders me helpless as you may see  we are very comfortable i assure you mrs rogers said beth we have come to ask if you have heard anything of your daughter  not a word as yet miss degraf will is out with the horse and buggy doing his best to get information but lucy has been gone so long now that i realize it will be difficult to find her if indeed the poor girl has notis not  her voice broke  oh you dont fear that do you mrs rogers asked beth quickly  i fear anythingeverything wailed the poor creature the tears streaming from between her closed lids my darling was frantic with grief and she couldnt bear the humiliation and disgrace of her position will told you didnt he  yes of course but it wasnt so bad mrs rogers it wasnt a desperate condition by any means  with poor tom in prison for yearsand just for trying to help her  tom isnt in prison you know any more said beth quietly he has been released  released when  last evening his fault has been forgiven and he is now free  the woman sat silent for a time then she asked  you have done this mr forbes  why miss degraf and i assisted perhaps the young man is not really bad and  toms a fine boy she cried with eagerness hes honest and true mr forbeshe is indeed  i think so said kenneth  if he wasnt my lucy would never have loved him he had a bright future before him sir and thats why my child went mad when he ruined his life for her sake  was she mad do you think asked beth softly  she must have been said the mother sadly lucy was a sensible girl and until this thing happened she was as bright and cheerful as the day is long but she is very sensitiveshe inherited that from me i thinkand toms action drove her distracted at first she raved and rambled incoherently and will and i feared brain fever would set in then she disappeared in the night without leaving a word or message for us which was unlike herand weve never heard a word of her since thethe river has a strange fascination for people in that condition at times in my life it has almost drawn me into its depthsand i am not mad i have never been mad  let us hope for the best mrs rogers said beth somehow i have an idea this trouble will all turn out well in the end  have you asked the woman earnestly  yes it all came about through such a little thingmerely an unjust accusation  the little things are the ones that ruin lives she said will you let me tell you something of myself you have been so kind to us my dear that i feel you ought to know  i shall be glad to know whatever you care to tell me said beth simply  i am the wife of a poor farmer began the woman speaking softly and with some hesitation but gaining strength as she proceeded as a girl i was considered attractive and my father was a man of great wealth and social standing we lived in baltimore then i fell in love with a young man who after obtaining my promise to marry him found some one he loved better and carelessly discarded me as i have said i have a sensitive nature in my girlhood i was especially susceptible to any slight and this young mans heartless action made it impossible for me to remain at home and face the humiliation he had thrust upon me my father was a hard man and demanded that i marry the man he had himself chosen but i resented this command and ran away my mother had passed on long before and there was nothing to keep me at home i came west and secured a position to teach school in this county and for a time i was quite contented and succeeded in living down my disappointment i heard but once from my father he had married again and disinherited me he forbade me to ever communicate with him again  at that time will rogers was one of the most promising and manly of the country lads around here he was desperately in love with me and at this period when i seemed completely cut off from my old life and the future contained no promise i thought it best to wear out the remainder of my existence in the seclusion of a farmhouse i put all the past behind me and told will rogers i would marry him and be a faithful wife but that my heart was dead he accepted me on that condition and it was not until after we were married some time that my husband realized how impossible it would ever be to arouse my affection then he lost courage and became careless and reckless when our child cameour lucywill was devoted to her and the baby wakened in me all the old passionate capacity to love lucy drew will and me a little closer together but he never recovered his youthful ambition he was a disappointed man and went from bad to worse i dont say will hasnt always been tender and true to me and absolutely devoted to lucy but he lost all hope of being loved as he loved me and the disappointment broke him down he became an old man early in life and his lack of energy kept us very poor i used to take in sewing before the accident to my eyes and that helped a good deal to pay expenses but now i am helpless and my husband devotes all his time to me although i beg him to work the farm and try to earn some money  i wouldnt have minded the poverty i wouldnt mind being blind even if lucy had been spared to me i have had to bear so much in my life that i could even bear my childs death but to have her disappear and not know what has become of herwhether she is living miserably or lying at the bottom of the riverit is this that is driving me distracted  kenneth and beth remained silent for a time after mrs rogers had finished her tragic story for their hearts were full of sympathy for the poor woman it was hard to realize that a refined beautiful and educated girl had made so sad a mistake of her life and suffered so many afflictions as a consequence that old will had never been a fitting mate for his wife could readily be understood and yet the man was still devoted to his helpless unresponsive spouse the fault was not his  the boy and the girl both perceived that there was but one way they could assist mrs rogers and that was to discover what had become of her child  was lucy like you or did she resemble her father asked beth  she isshe was very like me when i was young replied the woman there is a photograph of her on the wall there between the windows but it was taken five years ago when she was a child now she isshe was eighteen and a welldeveloped young woman  ive been looking at the picture said kenneth  and you mustnt think of her as dead mrs rogers said beth pleadingly im sure she is alive and that we shall find her were going right to work and everything possible shall be done to trace your daughter dont worry please be as cheerful as you can and leave the search to us  the woman sighed  will believes she is alive too she said he cant sleep or rest till he finds her for my husband loves her as well as i do but sometimes i feel its wicked to hope she is alive i know what she suffers for i suffered myself and life isnt worth living when despair and disappointment fills it  i cannot see why lucy shouldnt yet be happy protested beth tom gates is now free and can begin life anew  his trouble will follow him everywhere said mrs rogers with conviction who will employ a bookkeeper or even a clerk who has been guilty of forgery  i think i shall give him employment replied kenneth  you mr forbes  yes im not afraid of a boy who became a criminal to save the girl he loved  but all the world knows of his crime she exclaimed  the world forgets these things sooner than you suppose he answered i need a secretary and in that position tom gates will quickly be able to live down this unfortunate affair and if he turns out as well as i expect he will soon be able to marry lucy and give her a comfortable home so now nothing remains but to find your girl and well try to do that i assure you  mrs rogers was crying softly by this time but it was from joy and relief when they left her she promised to be as cheerful as possible and to look on the bright side of life  i cant thank you she said so i wont try you must know how grateful we are to you  as beth and kenneth drove back to elmhurst they were both rather silent for they had been strongly affected by the scene at the farmhouse  its so good of you ken to take tom gates into your employ said the girl pressing her cousins arm and im sure hell be true and grateful  i really need him beth said the boy there is getting to be too much correspondence for mr watson to attend to and i ought to relieve him of many other details its a good arrangement and im glad i thought of it  they had almost reached elmhurst when they met the honorable erastus hopkins driving along the road on the seat beside him was a young girl and as the vehicles passed each other beth gave a start and clung to the boys arm  oh ken she cried did you see did you see that  yes its my respected adversary  but the girl its lucyim sure its lucy shes the living image of mrs rogers stopstopand lets go back  nonsense beth said the boy it cant be  but it is im sure it is  i saw the girl he said she was laughing gaily and talking with the honorable erastus is that your idea of the mad brokenhearted lucy rogers  nno she was laughing ken i noticed it  and she wasnt unhappy a bit you mustnt think that every pretty girl with dark eyes you meet is lucy rogers you know and theres another thing  what ken  any companion of mr hopkins can be easily traced  thats true answered the girl thoughtfully i must have been mistaken she added with a sigh     chapter xii  beth meets a rebuff   the campaign was now growing warm mr hopkins had come to realize that he had the fight of his life on his hands and that defeat meant his political ruin closefisted and miserly as he was no one knew so well as the honorable erastus how valuable this position of representative was to him in a financial way and that by winning reelection he could find means to reimburse himself for all he had expended in the fight so to the surprise of the democratic committee and all his friends mr hopkins announced that he would oppose forbess aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary  he did not laugh at his opponents any longer to himself he admitted their shrewdness and activity and acknowledged that an experienced head was managing their affairs  one of mr hopkinss first tasks after calling his faithful henchmen around him was to make a careful canvass of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished  this canvass was quite satisfactory for final report showed only about a hundred majority for forbes the district was naturally republican by six hundred majority and hopkins had previously been elected by a plurality of eightythree so that all the electioneering of the girl politicians and the expenditure of vast sums of money in painting fences and barns buying newspapers and flaunting forbes banners in the breezes had not cut into the hopkins following to any serious extent  but to offset this cheering condition the democratic agents who made the canvass reported that there was an air of uncertainty throughout the district and that many of those who declared for hopkins were lukewarm and fainthearted and might easily be induced to change their votes this was what must be prevented the weakkneed contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or another secured from the opposition  the democratic committee figured out a way to do this monroe county where both forbes and hopkins resided was one of the democratic strongholds of the state the portions of washington and jefferson counties included in the eighth district were as strongly republican and being more populous gave to the district its natural republican majority on the same ticket that was to elect a representative to the state legislature was the candidate for sheriff of monroe county a man named cummings was the republican and seth reynolds the liveryman the democratic nominee under ordinary conditions reynolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect hopkins the democrats would bargain with the republicans to vote for the republican sheriff if the republicans would vote for the democratic representative this trading votes which was often done was considered by the politicians quite legitimate the only thing necessary was to fix seth reynolds and this hopkins arranged personally the office of sheriff would pay about two thousand a year and this sum hopkins agreed to pay the liveryman and so relieve him of all the annoyance of earning it  reynolds saw the political necessity of this sacrifice and consented readily to the arrangement mr cummings who was to profit by the deal was called to a private consultation and agreed to slaughter kenneth forbes to secure votes for himself it was thought that this clever arrangement would easily win the fight for hopkins  but the honorable erastus had no intention of taking chances or monkeying with fate as he tersely expressed it every scheme known to politicians must be worked and none knew the intricate game better than hopkins this was why he held several long conferences with his friend marshall the manager at the mill and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy mr hopkins had picked her up from the path leading from the rear gate of the elmhurst grounds and she had given him accurate information concerning the movements of the girl campaigners the description she gave of the coming reception to the womans political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mr hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were  he talked for an hour with the girl gave her explicit instructions thrust some money into her hand and then drove her back to the bend in the path whence she quickly made her way up to the great house  louise was making great preparations to entertain the womans political league an organization she had herself founded the members of which were wives of farmers in the district these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing mr forbes louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their goodwill that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted  patsy and beth supported their cousin loyally and assisted in the preparations the fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served  the day of the entertainment was as sunny and mild as heart could desire  by ten oclock the farm wagons began to drive up loaded with women and children for all were invited except the grown men this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elmhurst and the only one within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been invited guests so all were eager to attend and enjoy the novel event  the gardens and grounds were gaily decorated with chinese and japanese lanterns streamers and forbes banners there were great tanks of lemonade and tables covered with candies and fruits for the children and maids and other servants distributed the things and looked after the comfort of the guests the band played briskly and before noon the scene was one of great animation a speakers stand profusely decorated had been erected on the lawn and hundreds of folding chairs provided for seats the attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted foreseeing great success for their fête  we ought to have more attendants beth said louise approaching her cousin wont you run into the house and see if martha cant spare one or two more maids  beth went at once and found the housekeeper in her little room martha was old and somewhat feeble in body but her mind was still active and her long years of experience in directing the household at elmhurst made her a very useful and important personage she was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt jane was the mistress here and beth was her especial favorite  so she greeted the girl cordially and said  maids my dear i havent another one to give you and my legs are too tottering to be of any use i counted on eliza parsons the new girl i hired for the linen room and to do mending but eliza said she had a headache this morning and couldnt stand the sun so i let her off but she didnt seem very sick to me  perhaps she is better and will help us until after the luncheon is served said beth where is she martha ill go and ask her  id better show you the way miss shes in her own room  the housekeeper led the way and beth followed when she rapped upon the door a sweet quiet voice said  come in  the girl entered and gave an involuntary cry of surprise standing before her was the young girl she had seen riding with mr hopkinsthe girl she had declared to be the missing daughter of mrs rogers  for a moment beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face she was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at elmhurst a plain black gown with white apron and cap  ii beg your pardon said beth with a slight gasp for the likeness to mrs rogers was something amazing arent you lucy rogers  the maid raised her eyebrows with a gesture of genuine surprise then she gave a little laugh and replied  no miss beth im elizabeth parsons  but it cant be protested the girl how do you know my name and why havent i seen you here before  im not a very important person at elmhurst replied eliza in a pleasant even tone i obtained the situation only a few days ago i attend to the household mending you know and care for the linen but one cant be here without knowing the names of the young ladies so i recognize you as miss beth one of mr forbess cousins  you speak like an educated person said beth wonderingly where is your home  for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor  will you excuse my answering that question she asked  it is very simple and natural persisted beth why cannot you answer it  excuse me please ii am not well today i have a headache  she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rocked slowly back and forth  im sorry said beth i hoped you would be able to assist me on the lawn there are so many people that we cant give them proper attention  eliza parsons shook her head  i am not able she declared i abhor crowds theythey excite me in some way and ii cant bear them you must excuse me  beth looked at the strange girl without taking the hint to retire somehow she could not rid herself of the impression that whether or not she was mistaken in supposing eliza to be the missing lucy she had stumbled upon a sphinx whose riddle was well worth solving  but eliza bore the scrutiny with quiet unconcern she even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted beth was a beautiful girlthe handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact her manner was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of wellbred composure and calm reliance beth felt that she was intruding and knew that she ought to go yet some fascination held her to the spot her eyes wandered to the maids hands however her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story the thin fingers clasped and unclasped in little spasmodic jerks and belied the quiet smile upon the face above them  i wish said beth slowly i knew you  a sudden wave of scarlet swept over elizas face she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath  i wish i knew myself she cried fiercely why do you annoy me in this manner what am i to you will you leave me alone in my own room or must i go away to escape you  i will go said beth a little frightened at the passionate appeal  eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked in the lock the sound made beth indignant and she hurried back to where her cousins were busy with the laughing chattering throng of visitors     chapter xiii  the boomerang   the lawn fête was a tremendous success and every farmers wife was proud of her satin badge bearing the monogram w p l and the words forbes for representative  certain edibles such as charlotterusse spanish cream wine jellies and mousses to say nothing of the caviars and anchovies were wholly unknown to them but they ate the dainties with a wise disregard of their inexperience and enjoyed them immensely  the old butler was a general in his way and in view of the fact that the staff of servants at elmhurst was insufficient to cope with such a throng he allowed louise to impress several farmers daughters into service and was able to feed everyone without delay and in an abundant and satisfactory manner  after luncheon began the speechmaking interspersed with music by the band  louise made the preliminary address and although her voice was not very strong the silent attention of her hearers permitted her to be generally understood  she called attention to the fact that this campaign was important because it promised more beautiful and attractive houses for the farmers and townsmen alike  we had all grown so accustomed to advertising signs she said that we failed to notice how thick they were becoming or how bold and overpowering from a few scattered announcements on fence boards they had crowded themselves into more prominent places until the barns and sheds and the very rocks were daubed with glaring letters asking us to buy the medicines soaps tobaccos and other wares the manufacturers were anxious to sell every country road became an advertising avenue scarcely a country house was free from signs of some sort yet the people tamely submitted to this imposition because they knew no way to avoid it when mr forbes began his campaign to restore the homesteads to their former beauty and dignity a cry was raised against him but this was because the farmers did not understand how much this reform meant to them so we gave them an object lesson we painted out all the signs in this section at our own expense that you might see how much more beautiful your homes are without them we believe that none of you will ever care to allow advertising signs on your property again and that the quiet refinement of this part of the country will induce many other places to follow our example until advertisers are forced to confine themselves to newspapers magazines and circulars their only legitimate channels this much mr forbes has already done for you and he will now tell you what else if he is elected he proposes to do  kenneth then took the platform and was welcomed with a hearty cheer he modestly assured them that a representative in the state legislature could accomplish much good for his district if he honestly desired to do so that was what a representative was forto represent his people it was folly to elect any man who would forget that duty and promote only his own interests through the position of power to which the people had appointed him mr forbes admitted that he had undertaken this campaign because he was opposed to offensive advertising signs but now he had become interested in other issues and was anxious to be elected so that he could carry on the work of reform they needed more schoolhouses for their children and many other things which he hoped to provide as their representative  during this oration beth happened to glance up at the house and her sharp eyes detected the maid eliza standing shielded behind the halfclosed blind of an upper window and listening to as well as watching the proceedings below then she remembered how the girl had been laughing and talking with mr hopkins when she first saw her and with sudden dismay realized that eliza was a spy in the service of the enemy  her first impulse was to denounce the maid at once and have her discharged but the time was not opportune so she waited until the festivities were ended  it had been a great day for the families of the neighboring farmers and they drove homeward in the late afternoon full of enthusiasm over the royal manner in which they had been entertained and admiration for the girls who had provided the fun and feasting indeed there were more kindly thoughts expressed for the inhabitants of elmhurst than had ever before been heard in a single day in the history of the county and the great and the humble seemed more closely drawn together  when the last guest had departed beth got her cousins and kenneth together and told them of her discovery of the spy  kenneth was at first greatly annoyed and proposed to call martha and have the false maid ejected from the premises but patsys wise little head counselled caution in handling the matter  now that we know her secret she said the girl cannot cause us more real harm and there may be a way to circumvent this unscrupulous hopkins and turn the incident to our own advantage lets think it over carefully before we act  theres another thing said beth supporting her cousin im interested in the mystery surrounding the girl i now think i was wrong in suspecting her to be the lost lucy rogers but there is surely some romance connected with her and she is not what she seems to be id like to study her a little  it was absurd to connect her with lucy rogers observed kenneth for there is nothing in her character to remind one of the unhappy girl  except her looks added beth shes the living image of mrs rogers  that isnt important replied louise it is probably a mere coincidence none of us have ever seen the real lucy and she may not resemble her mother at all  mrs rogers claims she does said beth but anyhow i have a wish to keep this girl at the house where i can study her character  then keep her my dear decided kenneth ill set a couple of men to watch the gates and if she goes out well know whom she meets the most she can do is to report our movements to mr hopkins and theres no great harm in that  so the matter was left for the time and as if to verify beths suspicions eliza was seen to leave the grounds after dusk and meet mr hopkins in the lane they conversed together a few moments and then the maid calmly returned and went to her room  the next day mr hopkins scattered flaring handbills over the district which were worded in a way designed to offset any advantage his opponent had gained from the lawn fête of the previous day they read hopkins the man of the times is the champion of the signs of the times forbes who never earned a dollar in his life but inherited his money is trying to take the dollars out of the pockets of the farmers by depriving them of the income derived by selling spaces for advertising signs he is robbing the farmers while claiming he wants to beautify their homes the farmers cant eat beauty they want money therefore they are going to vote for the honorable erastus hopkins for representative then followed an estimate of the money paid the farmers of the district by the advertisers during the past five years amounting to several thousands of dollars in the aggregate the circular ended in this way hopkins challenges forbes to deny these facts hopkins is willing to meet forbes before the public at any time and place he may select to settle this argument in joint debate  the girls accepted the challenge at once within two days every farmer had received a notice that mr forbes would meet mr hopkins at the fairview opera house on saturday afternoon to debate the question as to whether advertising signs brought good or evil to the community  the campaign was now getting hot because of the activity of the opposing candidates every voter in the district had become more or less interested in the fight and people were taking one side or the other with unusual earnestness  mr hopkins was not greatly pleased that his challenge had been accepted he had imagined that the forbes party would ignore it and leave him the prestige of crowing over his opponents timidity but he remembered how easily he had subdued kenneth at the schoolhouse meeting before the nominations and had no doubt of his ability to repeat the operation  he was much incensed against the girls who were working for kenneth forbes for he realized that they were proving an important factor in the campaign he even attributed to them more than they deserved for uncle johns telling activities were so quietly conducted that he was personally lost sight of entirely by mr hopkins  mr hopkins had therefore become so enraged that against the advice of his friends he issued a circular sneering at women in politics the newspapers having been subsidized by the opposition so early in the game mr hopkins had driven to employ the circular method of communicating with the voters scarcely a day passed now that his corps of distributors did not leave some of his literature at every dwelling in the district  his tirade against the girls was neither convincing nor in good taste he asked the voters if they were willing to submit to petticoat government and permit a lot of boardingschool girls with more boldness than modesty to dictate the policies of the community these frizzleheaded females continued the circular are trying to make your wives and daughters as rebellious and unreasonable as they are themselves but no man of sense will permit a woman to influence his vote it is a disgrace to this district that mr forbes allows his girlish campaign to be run by a lot of misses who should be at home darning stockings or if they were not able to do that practicing their musiclessons  good exclaimed shrewd miss patsy when she read this circular if im not much mistaken mr hopkins has thrown a boomerang every woman who attended the fête is now linked with us as an ally and every one of them will resent this foolish circular  im sorry said kenneth that you girls should be forced to endure this i feared something like it when you insisted on taking a hand in the game  but they laughed at him and at mr hopkins and declared they were not at all offended  one cannot touch pitch without being defiled said mr watson gravely and politics as mr hopkins knows it is little more than pitch  i cannot see that there is anything my girls have done to forfeit respect and admiration asserted uncle john stoutly to accuse them of boldness or immodesty is absurd they have merely gone to work in a businesslike manner and used their wits and commonsense in educating the voters really my dears im more proud of you today than ive ever been before he concluded  and uncle john was right there had been no loss of dignity by any one of the three and their evident refinement as well as their gentleness and good humor had until now protected them from any reproach it had remained for mr hopkins to accuse them and his circular had a wide influence in determining the issue of the campaign     chapter xiv  lucys ghost   kenneth had sent word to tom gates asking the young man to come to elmhurst but it was not until two days after the lawn party that tom appeared and asked permission to see mr forbes  beth and louise were with kenneth at the time and were eager to remain during the interview so the young man was shown into the library  beth could scarcely recognize in him the calm and cheerful tom gates they had visited in the county jail for his face was drawn with care and anxiety eyes were bloodshot and his former neat appearance was changed to one careless and untidy  kenneth scrutinized him closely  what have you been up to tom he asked  ive been searching for lucy sir night and day i havent slept a wink since i heard the awful news of her sickness and escape where do you think she can be sir  his question was full of agonized entreaty and his manner pitifully appealing  i dont know answered kenneth where have you searched  everywhere sir that she might be likely to go ive inquired in every town and along every road leading out of the county she didnt take a train because poor lucy hadnt any moneyand ive asked at all the stations andandalong the river they say no girl answering her description has been seen  its strange remarked kenneth thoughtfully while the girls regarded the youth with silent sympathy  if you knew lucy sir youd realize how strange it is went on young gates earnestly she was such a gentle shrinking girl as shy and retiring as a child and she never did a thing that would cause anyone the least worry or unhappiness but she was out of her head sir and didnt know what she was about that was the reason she went away and from the moment she left her home all trace of her was lost  one would think observed kenneth that a poor demented girl wandering about the country would be noticed by scores of people did she take any clothing with her  only the dress she had on sir and not even a hat or a shawl  what was her dress like asked beth quickly  it was a light grey in color and plainly made she wore a white collar but that is all we can be certain she had on you see her mother is blind and old will doesnt observe very closely  does lucy resemble her mother inquired beth  very much miss she was a beautiful girl everyone acknowledged and its all my faultall my fault i thought to save her and drove her mad instead  you might have known that declared kenneth a girl of her character sensitive to a fault would be greatly shocked to find the man she loved a criminal  it was for her sake  that is a poor excuse if you had waited lucy would have proved her innocence  they threatened to arrest her sir it would have killed her  they wouldnt dare arrest her on suspicion  the squierses would dare do anything you dont know old mrs squiers  i know the law sir and in any event it was a foolish thing as well as criminal to forge a check to get the money they demanded  you are right sir replied tom gates despondently it was foolish and criminal i wouldnt mind my own punishment but it drove my lucy mad  see here said kenneth sternly you are getting morbid young man and pretty soon youll be mad yourself if lucy is found do you want her to see you in this condition  can she be found sir do you think  we are trying to find her replied kenneth you have failed it seems and will rogers had failed ive had one of the cleverest detectives of chicago trying to find her for the last three days  oh kenneth exclaimed beth i didnt know that how good of you  it must have been the detective that came to see mrs rogers said tom musingly she told me a strange man had been there from mr forbes to inquire all about lucy  yes he makes a report to me every evening remarked kenneth and mr burke says this is the most mystifying case he has ever encountered so far there isnt a clew to follow but you may rest assured that what any man can do burke will do  im so grateful sir said tom  then you must show it by being a man and not by giving way to your trouble in this foolish manner  ill try sir now that theres something to hope for  theres a good deal to hope for despair wont help you you must go to work  i will it wont be very easy to get work for ive disgraced myself in this neighborhood and i cant leave here till something is known of lucys fate but ill do somethingany kind of workif i can get it  i need someone to assist me in my correspondence said kenneth would you like to be my secretary  me mr forbesme  yes tom ill pay you twenty dollars a week to start with and more if you serve me faithfully and youll board here of course  then tom gates broke down and began to cry like a child although he tried hard to control himself  youyou must forgive me mr forbes he said penitently iive been without sleep for so long that i havent any nerves left  then you must go to sleep now and get a good rest he turned to beth will you see martha he asked and have her give tom gates a room  she went on her errand at once and gradually the young man recovered his composure  i can do typewriting and stenography mr forbes he said and i can keep accounts ill serve you faithfully sir  well talk of all this by and by tom replied kenneth kindly just now you must have some sleep and get your strength back and dont worry about lucy burke will do everything that can be done and i am confident he will be able to trace the girl in time  thank you sir  then he followed the butler away to his room and after the girls had discussed him and expressed their sympathy for the unfortunate fellow they all turned their attention to the important matter of the campaign the debate with hopkins was the thing that occupied them just now and when patsy joined the group of workers they began to discuss some means of scoring a decisive victory at the fairview opera house the honorable erastus still insisted upon making the antisign fight the prominent issue of the campaign and they must reply forcibly to the misleading statements made in his last handbill  meantime tom gates was sunk in the deep sleep of physical exhaustion and the day wore away before he wakened when at last he regained consciousness he found the sun sinking in the west and feared he had been guilty of indiscretion he remembered that he was mr forbess secretary now and that mr forbes might want him he was not yet thoroughly rested but night was approaching and he reflected that he could obtain all the sleep that he needed then  so greatly refreshed and in a quieter mood than he had been for days the young man dressed and entered the hall to find his way downstairs  it happened that beth whose room was near this rear corridor had just gone there to dress for dinner and as she was closing her door she heard a wild impassioned cry  lucy  quickly she sprang out into the hall and turned the corner in time to see a strange tableau  young gates was standing with his arms outstretched toward eliza parsons who a few paces away had her back to the door of her own chamber from which she had evidently just stepped she stood motionless looking curiously at the youth who confronted her  lucy dont you know me he asked his voice trembling with emotion  to begin with said the girl composedly my name happens to be eliza and as weve not been properly introduced i really dont see why i should know you she added with a light laugh  tom gates shrank away from her as if he had been struck  you cant be lucy he murmured and yetand yetoh you must be lucy you must know me look at me dearim tom im your own tom lucy  its very gratifying im sure young man said the girl a touch of scorn in her tones if youre my own tom youll perhaps stand out of my way and let me go to my work  without another word he backed up again the wall and permitted her to sweep by him which she did with a gesture of disdain  when eliza parsons had disappeared down the back stairs beth drew a long breath and approached tom gates who still stood by the wall staring at the place where the girl had disappeared  i overheard said beth tell me tom is she really like lucy  he looked at her with a dazed expression as if he scarcely comprehended her words  could you have been mistaken persisted the questioner  he passed his hand over his eyes and gave a shudder  either it was lucy or her ghost he muttered  eliza parsons is no ghost declared beth shes one of the maids here at elmhurst and youre quite likely to see her again  has she been here long he asked eagerly  no only a few days  oh  when i first saw her i was struck by her resemblance to mrs rogers continued the girl  but shes so different said tom choking back a sob lucy couldnt be soso airy so heartless she isnt at all that style of a girl miss  she may be acting suggested beth  but he shook his head gloomily  no lucy couldnt act that way shes quick and impulsive but sheshe couldnt act and she wouldnt treat me that way either miss beth lucy and i have been sweethearts for years and i know every expression of her dear face but the look that this girl gave me was one that my lucy never could assume i must have been mistaken iim sure i was mistaken  beth sighed she was disappointed  i suppose continued tom that ive thought of lucy so long and so much lately and worried so over her disappearance that im not quite myself and imagined this girl was more like her than she really is what did you say her name was  eliza parsons  thank you can you tell me where ill find mr forbes  hes getting ready for dinner now and wont need you at present  then ill go back to my room itit was a great shock to me that likeness miss degraf  i can well believe it said beth and then she went to her own apartment greatly puzzled at a resemblance so strong that it had even deceived lucy rogerss own sweetheart     chapter xv  signs of the times   if she is really lucy rogers shell be missing tomorrow morning said beth when she had told her cousins of the encounter in the corridor  but eliza parsons was still at elmhurst the next day calmly pursuing her duties and evidently having forgotten or decided to ignore the young man who had so curiously mistaken her for another beth took occasion to watch her movements so far as she could and came to the conclusion that the girl was not acting a part she laughed naturally and was too lighthearted and gay to harbor a care of any sort in her frivolous mind  but there was a mystery about her that could not be denied even if she were but a paid spy of erastus hopkins there was a story in this girls life brief as it had been  beth was full of curiosity to know this story  as for tom gates he had been so horrified by his mistake that he tried to avoid meeting eliza again this was not difficult because the girl kept pretty closely to the linen room and tom was chiefly occupied in the library  kenneth had little chance to test his secretarys abilities just then because the girls pounced upon the new recruit and used his services in a variety of ways tom gatess anxiety to give satisfaction made him willing to do anything but they refrained from sending him often to town because he was sensitive to the averted looks and evident repulsion of those who knew he had recently been a jailbird but there was plenty for him to do at elmhurst where they were all as busy as bees and whatever the young man undertook he accomplished in a satisfactory manner  saturday forenoon the three girls with kenneth mr watson and uncle john rode over to fairview to prepare for the debate that was to take place in the afternoon leaving only tom gates at home as mr hopkins had thrust upon his opponent the task of naming the place and time the republican candidate was obliged to make all the arrangements and pay all the costs but whatever the girl managers undertook they did well so the opera house had been in the hands of a special committee for two days the orchestra had been hired and the news of the joint debate had spread far and wide  the party from elmhurst lunched at the fairview hotel and then the girls hurried to the opera house while kenneth remained to attend a conference of the republican committee these gentlemen were much worried over the discovery of a scheme to trade votes that had been sprung and that forbes and reynolds were being sacrificed for hopkins and cummings mr cummings was called into the meeting and he denied that the trading was being done with his consent but defiantly refused to make a public announcement to that effect  the matter was really serious because every vote lost in that way counted as two for the other side and hopkinss rabid handbills had influenced many of the more ignorant voters and created endless disputes that were not of benefit to the republican party  as nearly as we can figure from our recent canvass said mr cunningham the chairman we are fast losing ground and our chances of success are smaller than if no interest in the election had been aroused hopkins has cut our majority down to nothing and it will be a hard struggle to carry our ticket through to success this is the more discouraging because mr forbes has spent so much money while hopkinss expenses have been very little  i do not mind that said kenneth quietly it was my desire that the voters should fully understand the issues of the campaign then if they vote against me it is because they are not worthy of honest representation in the legislature and i shall in the future leave them to their own devices  the committee adjourned a little before two oclock with rather grave faces and prepared to attend the debate at the opera house mr cunningham feared this debate would prove a mistake as it would give hopkins a chance to ridicule and browbeat his opponent in public and his greatest talent as a speaker lay in that direction  as kenneth and his supporters approached the opera house they heard loud cheering and from a bandwagon covered with bunting and banners in which he had driven to the meeting descended the honorable erastus he met kenneth face to face and the latter said pleasantly  good afternoon mr hopkins  ah its forbes isnt it replied hopkins slightingly ive met you before somewheres havent i  you have sir  glad youre here forbes glad youre here continued the representative airily as he made his way through the crowd that blocked the entrance these meetings are educational to young men girls all well i hope  there was a boisterous laugh at this sally and mr hopkins smiled and entered the opera house while kenneth followed with the feeling that he would take great delight in punching the honorable erastuss nose at the first opportunity  the house was packed full of eager spectators who had come to see the fun although the girls had taken charge of all the arrangements they had devoted the left side of the ample stage to the use of the hopkins party where a speakers table and chairs for important guests had been placed the right side was similarly arranged for the forbes party and between the two the entire center of the stage was occupied by a group of fifty young girls above this group a great banner was suspended reading the signs of the times a catchword mr hopkins had employed throughout the campaign but the most astonishing thing was the appearance of the group of girls they all wore plain white slips upon which a variety of signs had been painted in prominent letters some costumes advertised bakingpowders others patent medicines others soaps chewing tobacco breakfast foods etc from where they were seated in full view of the vast audience the girls appeared as a mass of advertising signs and the banner above them indicated quite plainly that these were the signs of the times  mr hopkins as he observed this scene smiled with satisfaction he believed some of his friends had prepared this display to assist him and to disconcert the opposition for nothing could have clinched his arguments better than the pretty young girls covered with advertisements of well known products even the eagle eye breakfast food was well represented  after the orchestra had finished a selection mr hopkins rose to make the first argument and was greeted with cheers  we are having a jolly campaign my dear friends he began but you musnt take it altogether as a joke because while mr forbess erratic views and actions have done little real harm we have been educated to an appreciation of certain benefits we enjoy which otherwise might have escaped our attention  this is a progressive strenuous age and no section of the country has progressed more rapidly than this the eighth district of our great and glorious state i may say without danger of contradiction that the people i have the honor to represent in the state legislature and expect to have the honor of representing the next term are the most intelligent the most thoughtful and the most prosperous to be found in any like district in the united states cheers who then dares to denounce them as fools who dares interfere with these liberties who dares intrude uninvited into their premises and paint out the signs they have permitted to occupy their fences and barns and sheds who would do these things but an impertinent meddler who is so inexperienced in life that he sets his own flimsy judgment against that of the people  the orator paused impressively to wait for more cheers but the audience was silent in the outskirts of the crowd a faint hissing began to be heard it reached the speakers ear and he hurriedly resumed the oration  i do not say mr forbes is not a good citizen said he but that he is misguided and unreasonable a certain degree of deference is due the young man because he inherited considerable wealth from his uncle and  again the hisses began and mr hopkins knew he must abandon personal attacks or he would himself be discredited before his hearers kenneth and his supporters sat silent in their places the three girls who were now well known in the district forming part of the republican group and none of them displayed the least annoyance at the vituperation mr hopkins had employed  i have already called your attention in my circulars resumed the speaker to the fact that advertising signs are the source of large income to the farmers of this district i find that three thousand seven hundred and eightythree dollars have been paid the farmers in the last five years without the least trouble or expense on their part and this handsome sum of money belongs to them and should not be taken away stop and think for a moment advertising is the life of every business and to fight successfully the great army of advertisers whose business is the lifeblood of our institutions is as impossible as it is absurd suppose every farmer in this district refused to permit signs upon his property what would be the result why the farmers of other sections would get that much more money for letting privileges and you would be that much out of pocket without suppressing the evilif evil can attach to an industry that pays you good money without requiring either investment or labor in return  after continuing in this strain for some time mr hopkins announced that he would now give way to his youthful and inexperienced opponent and asked the audience to be patient with mr forbes and considerate of his extraordinary prejudices  hopkinss policy of discrediting his opponent in advance was not very effective for when kenneth arose he was more enthusiastically cheered than hopkins had been the meeting was disposed to be fairminded and quite willing to give mr forbes a chance to explain his position  the arguments of our distinguished representative are well worthy of your consideration he began quietly it is only by understanding fully both sides of an argument that you can hope to arrive at a just and impartial decision mr hopkins has advocated advertising signs on the ground that your financial gain warrants permitting them to be placed upon your premises i will not deny his statement that three thousand seven hundred and eightythree dollars have been paid the farmers of this district by advertisers in the last five years it is quite likely to be true i have here the report of the department of agriculture showing that the total amount paid to farmers of the eighth district in the last five years for produce of all kinds is eleven millions fivehundred thousand dollars  a murmur of amazement rose from the audience kenneth waited until it had subsided  this seems surprising at first he said and proves how startling aggregate figures are you must remember i have covered five years in this estimate as did mr hopkins in his and if you will figure it out you will see that the yearly average of earnings is about six hundred dollars to each farmer that is a good showing for we have a wealthy district but it is not surprising when reduced to that basis mr hopkins slates that the farmers of this district received three thousand seven hundred and eightythree dollars during the last five years for advertising signs let us examine these figures onefifth of that sum is seven hundred and fiftysix dollars and sixty cents as the income to you per year we have in this district twentyfive hundred farmers according to the latest reports of the bureau of statistics and dividing seven hundred and fiftysix dollars and sixty cents by twentyfive hundred we find that each farmer receives an average of thirty and onequarter cents per year for allowing his fences and buildings to be smothered in lurid advertising signs so we find that the money received by the farmers from the advertising amounts to about onequarter of one per cent of their income a matter so insignificant that it cannot affect them materially one way or another  but mr hopkins states that you give nothing in return for this onequarter of one per cent while i claim you pay tremendously for it for you sacrifice the privacy of your homes and lands and lend yourselves to the selfish desire of advertisers to use your property to promote their sales you have been given an example of clean barns and fences and i cannot tell you how proud i am of this district when i ride through it and see neatly painted barns and fences replacing the flaring and obtrusive advertising signs that formerly disfigured the highways why should you paint advertising signs upon your barns any more than upon your houses carry the thing a step farther and you may as well paint signs upon your childrens dresses in the manner you see illustrated before you  at this louise made a signal and the fifty children so grotesquely covered with signs rose and stepped forward upon the stage the orchestra struck up an air and the little girls sang the following ditty    teas and soaps   pills and dopes we all must advertise   copper cents   not common sense are the things we prize   we confess   such a dress isnt quite becoming   but we suppose   hopkins knows this keeps business humming  as the girls ceased singing kenneth said  to the encroaching advertiser these signs of the times are considered legitimate there is no respect for personal privacy on the advertisers part once they used only the newspapers the legitimate channels for advertising then they began painting their advertising on your fences when the farmers protested against this the advertisers gave them a few pennies as a sop to quiet them after this they gave you small sums to paint the broad sides of your barns your board fences and to place signs in your field if you allowed them to do so they would paint signs on the dresses of your children and wives so callous are they to all decency and so regardless of private rights look on this picture my friends and tell me would you prefer to see thisor this  at the word each child pulled away the signpainted slip and stood arrayed in a pretty gown of spotless white  the surprise was so complete that the audience cheered shouted and laughed for several minutes before silence was restored then the children sang another verse as follows    now it is clear   that we appear just as we should be   we are seen   sweet and clean from corruption free   were the signs   of the times fair as heavens orbs   if we look good   then all men should vote for kenneth forbes  the cheering was renewed at this and mr hopkins became angry he tried to make himself heard but the popular fancy had been caught by the object lesson so cleverly placed before them and they shouted forbes forbes forbes until the honorable erastus became so furious that he left the meeting in disgust  this was the most impolite thing he could have done but he vowed that the meeting had been packed with forbes partisans and that he was wasting his time in addressing them  after he was gone kenneth resumed his speech and created more enthusiasm the victory was certainly with the republican candidate and the elmhurst people returned home thoroughly satisfied with the result of the joint debate     chapter xvi  a clew at last   the servants at elmhurst all ate in a pleasant dining room with windows facing a garden of geraniums tom gates had been at the house two days before he encountered eliza parsons at the table for the servants were not all able to take their meals at the same time  it was at luncheon the day of the joint debate at fairview that the young man first met eliza who sat opposite him the only other person present was old donald the coachman who was rather deaf and never paid any attention to the chatter around him  as he took his seat tom gave a halffrightened glance into elizas face and then turned red as she smiled coquettishly and said  dear me its the young man who called me his dear lucy  youyoure very like her stammered tom unable to take his eyes from her face even now ii cant believe im mistaken  she laughed merrily in a sweet musical voice and then suddenly stopped with her hand on her heart and cast at him a startled look that was in such sharp contrast to her former demeanor that he rose from his chair  sit down please she said slowly and then she studied his face with sober earnestnesswith almost wistful longing but she shook her head presently and sighed and a moment later had regained her lightness of manner  its a relief to have a quiet house for a day isnt it she asked eating her soup calmly ill be glad when the elections over  have you been here long he asked although beth had told him of elizas coming to elmhurst  only a short time and you  two days said he but where did you live before you came here  she shook her head  i wish you would answer me he begged i have a reason for asking  what reason she demanded suddenly serious again  two people have never lived that were so near alike as you and lucy rogers  indeed  will you show me your left arm  no  she was again studying his face  if you are lucy rogers you have a scar therea scar where you burned yourself years ago  she seemed frightened for a moment then she said  i have no scar on my left arm  will you prove it  no you are annoying me what did you say your name is  tom gates  she was thoughtful for a moment and then shook her head  i have never heard of you she declared positively and resumed her eating  tom was nonplussed one moment he believed she was lucy and the next told himself that it was impossible this girl possessed mannerisms that lucy had never exhibited in all the years he had known her she was bold and unabashed where lucy was shy and unassuming this girls eyes laughed while lucys were grave and serious yet they were the same eyes  let me tell you about my lost lucy he said with a glance at the unconscious donald  go ahead if it will relieve you she answered demurely  she lived on a farm five miles from here and she was my sweetheart her mother is blind and her father old and feeble she worked for a dentist in the town and was accused of stealing a ring and it nearly broke her heart to be so unjustly suspected in order to make good the loss of the ring a valuable diamondii got into trouble and lucy was so shocked and distressed that sheshe lost her headbecame mad you knowand left home during the night without a word to any one we havent been able to find her since  thats too bad remarked eliza parsons buttering her bread  about the time that lucy went away you appeared at elmhurst continued tom and in face and form youre the image of my lucy that is why i asked you to tell me where you came from and how you came here  ah you think im mad do you asked the girl with a quizzical smile well im not going to satisfy your curiosity even to prove my sanity and im not anxious to pose as your lost lucy so please pass the sugar and try to be sociable instead of staring at me as if i scared you  tom passed the sugar but he could not eat nor could he tear himself away from this strange girls presence he tried again to draw her into conversation but she showed annoyance and resented his persistence presently she went away giving him an amused smile as she left the rooma smile that made him feel that this was indeed a case of mistaken identity  in fact tom gates on sober reflection knew that the girl could not be lucy yet he could not still the yearning in his heart whenever he saw her his heart declared that she was lucy and his head realized that she could not be  while he waited in the library for mr forbes to return from fairview a man was shown into the room and sat down quietly in a corner  he was a small lean man of unassuming appearance with a thin face and gray eyes set close together when he looked at tom gates he scarcely seemed to see him and his manner conveyed the impression that he disliked to attract notice  waiting for mr forbes sir asked tom  yes was the quiet reply  suddenly it struck the young man that this might be the detective who called every evening to give his report and if so tom was anxious to talk with him so he ventured to say  its mr burke isnt it  the man nodded and looked out of the window  im tom gates sir  yes i know  youve seen me before asked the youth astonished  no ive heard of you thats all  tom flushed remembering his recent crime but he was eager to question the detective  have you heard anything of lucy rogers mr burke  not yet  is there no trace of her at all  a slight tracenothing worth mentioning said mr burke  for a few moments tom sat in silence then he said  i thought id found her day before yesterday  yes there was little interest in the tone  theres a girl in the house sir one of the maids who is the living image of lucy rogers  you ought to be able to identify her suggested the detective his gaze still out of the window  but they are not alike except in looks her form and face are identical with lucys i was so sure that i begged her to let me see if there was a scar on her left arm but she refused  was there a scar on lucy rogerss left arm  yes sir several years ago when we were children we were making candy in the kitchen and lucy burned herself badly it left a broad scar on her left forearm which she will bear as long as she lives  it is well to know that said mr burke  this girl continued tom musingly says her name is eliza parsons and she says it in lucys voice but her manner is not the same at all eliza laughs at me and quizzes me she is forward and scornful andand perfectly selfpossessed which lucy could not be under the circumstances  have you seen her closely asked the detective  yes sir  and are still unable to decide who she is  thats it sir im unable to decide its lucy and yet it isnt lucy  who is eliza parsons  she refuses to say where she came from but it seems she arrived at elmhurst only a day or two after lucy disappeared from home its that coincidence that makes me doubt the evidence of my own senses  who hires the servants here  i dont know sir  mr burke abandoned the conversation then and confined his gaze to the landscape as it showed through the window tom busied himself addressing circulars of instruction to the republicans who were to work at the polling places this was saturday and the election was to be on the following tuesday the meeting at fairview was therefore the last important rally of the campaign  at dusk the party arrived from fairview in the automobiles the girls greatly delighted with the success of the meeting they all followed kenneth into the library where the butler had just lighted the lamps the evenings were getting cool now and a grate fire was burning  kenneth greeted mr burke and introduced him to the young ladies who begged to remain during the interview  we are all alike interested in lucy rogers mr burke said the boy so you may speak freely is there any news  nothing of importance sir unless a clew has been found in your own house replied the detective  here at elmhurst asked the astonished kenneth  yes tom gates has seen a girlone of your maidswho so strongly resembles lucy rogers that he at first believed she was the missing girl  i know said beth quickly its eliza parsons but tom was mistaken he saw her in the dim light of a corridor and the resemblance confused him  ive seen her since remarked tom and the likeness is really bewildering its only her manner that is different  when i first saw her before tom came i was astonished at her resemblance to mrs rogers announced beth i have never seen lucy but i know mrs rogers and it seemed to me that eliza was exactly like her in features mr forbes and i first saw her riding in a buggy with mr hopkins that was before either of us knew she was employed at elmhurst you see she isnt one of the servants who come much in contact with the family she does the mending and takes charge of the linen room  beth then related the manner in which they first noticed eliza and how they had discovered her to be a spy in the service of mr hopkins  the detective was much interested in the recital and seemed surprised that he had not been informed of this before  of course said kenneth the girl is not lucy rogers it is not possible they could be the same  why not asked mr burke  well lucy was a gentle sweet country girl of little experience in life her nature was so susceptible so very sensitive that when she discovered tom gates whom she loved to be guilty of a forgery she worried herself into an attack of brainfever or at least she became insane reproaching herself for having driven the boy to this dreadful deed under the influence of her mania she wandered away from her home and has not been seen since thats the story of lucy rogers now look at eliza parsons she appeared the very day after lucys disappearance to be sure but that proves they are not the same person for eliza is not demented she is a cold hard woman of the world in spite of her tender years she is doing the work of an experienced spy while any deceit was foreign to lucys nature instead of being plunged in grief eliza is happy and gay reckless of consequences and fully selfpossessed she is also well and healthy to all appearances taking all these things into consideration it is impossible to connect the two girls in any waysave the coincidence of personal resemblance  mr burke listened to this quietly and then shook his head  your arguments all tend to make me suspect that she is lucy rogers he said quietly  for a moment there was an impressive silence while everyone eagerly inquiringly or doubtfully looked at the detective according to their diverse acceptance of his statement  in pursuance of the task set me began mr burke i had met with such absolute failure to trace the missing girl that i began to suspect no ordinary conditions were attached to this case in my experience which covers many years i have had occasion to study sudden dementia caused by shocks of grief or horror and i have come to comprehend the fact that the human mind once unbalanced is liable to accomplish many surprising feats usually the victim is absolutely transformed and becomes the very opposite in many ways of the normal personality i imagine this is what happened to lucy rogers  do you imagine that lucy would try to deceive me sir asked tom reproachfully  i am sure she doesnt know who you are answered the detective positively she doesnt even know herself i have known instances where every recollection of the past was wiped out of the patients mind  there was another thoughtful pause for the detectives assertions were so astonishing that they fairly overwhelmed his hearers  then louise asked  is such a case of dementia hopeless mr burke  not at all hopeless often i admit it develops into permanent insanity but there are many examples of complete recovery our first business must be to assure ourselves that we are right in this conjecture i may be entirely wrong for the unexpected is what i have been taught to look for in every case of mystery that has come under my observation but i believe i have the material at hand to prove the personality of this eliza parsons and after that i shall know what to do who employs your servants mr forbes  martha my housekeeper usually employs the maids  will you send for her please  kenneth at once obeyed the request and presently martha entered the library  she was a little withered old woman but with a pleasant face and shrewd but kindly eyes  martha said kenneth did you employ the new linen maid eliza parsons  yes sir she replied apparently surprised at the question  this is mr burke martha please answer any questions he may ask you  yes master kenneth  did the girl bring any recommendations asked the detective  martha reflected  i do not think she did sir  are you accustomed to hiring maids without recommendations asked mr burke  oh eliza had a letter from my cousin mrs hopkins who lives in elmwood  is mrs hopkins your cousin asked kenneth  yes sir she were a phibbs before she married erastus and my name is phibbs  what did the letter from mrs hopkins say  it said she knew eliza to be a clever and worthy girl and if i had a place for her i couldnt do better than take her on so i needed a linen maid and eliza went right to work isnt she satisfactory sir has she been doing anything wrong  no please do not mention this interview to her at present miss phibbs said the detective that is all i believe  would you like to see eliza asked kenneth when the housekeeper had retired  not at present i want to interview mrs hopkins first  tonight asked tom eagerly  i will go at once with mr forbess permission  certainly sir said kenneth shall we see you tomorrow  just as soon as i have accomplished anything  would you like a horse or an automobile  your man may drive me to the town sir if it is convenient  kenneth gave the required order and then mr burke asked  how far are you prepared to go in this matter sir  in what way  in expending money  will any large expenditure be required  i cannot say but we may require the services and advice of an expert physiciana specialist in brain diseases  do you know of one asked kenneth  yes but he must be brought from buffalo it will be expensive sir that is why i ask if your interest in the girl warrants our going to the limit to save her  kenneth was thoughtful while the girls looked at him expectantly and tom gates with visible anxiety  my original idea was merely to find the missing girl in order to relieve the anxiety of her blind mother said young forbes to accomplish that i was willing to employ your services but as a matter of fact i have never seen the girl lucy rogers nor am i particularly interested in her  i am declared beth  and i  and i repeated patsy and louise  i think said uncle john who had been a quiet listener until now that kenneth has assumed enough expense in this matter  oh uncle the remonstrance was from all three of the girls  therefore continued mr merrick i propose that i undertake any further expense that may be incurred so as to divide the burden  thats better declared patsy but i might have known uncle john would do that  you have my authority to wire the physician if necessary or to go to any expense you deem advisable continued mr merrick turning to the detective we seem to have undertaken to unravel an interesting mystery and well see it through to the end  very good sir said mr burke and left them with a brief nod of farewell  somehow said beth ive a lot of confidence in that little man  why hes a detective replied uncle john with a smile and the chief business of detectives is to make mistakes     chapter xvii  mrs hopkins gossips   the home of representative hopkins was not a very imposing edifice it was a modest frame building standing well back in a little yard at the outskirts of the village and mrs hopkins did the housework unaided to save the expense of a maid it never occurred to the politician who had risen from the position of a poor stableboy to one of affluence to save his wife from this drudgery to him poor mary was merely one of his possessions and it would have astonished him to know that her sharp tongue and irritable temper were due to overwork and neglect the honorable erastus was not averse to champagne dinners and other costly excesses while at the state capital and his fellow legislators considered him a good fellow although rather lax in keeping his end up moreover he employed a good tailor and was careful to keep up an appearance of sound financial standing but his home which he avoided as much as possible had little share in his personal prosperity mary hopkinss requests for new and decent gowns were more often refused than acceded to and he constantly cautioned her to keep down expenses or she would drive them both to the poorhouse  the woman well knew that erastus could afford to keep her in luxury if he would but some women are so constituted that they accept their fate rather than rebel and mary hopkins lived the life of a slave contenting herself with petty scoldings and bickerings that did nothing to relieve her hard lot  she had little interest in politics and resented the intrusion of the many who came to the house to see and consult with her husband during the tiresome political campaigns on these occasions mr hopkins used the sittingroom as his office and committee headquarters but this did not materially interfere with his wifes comfort as she was usually busy in the kitchen  on this saturday evening however they had an early supper and she finished her dishes betimes and sat down to darn stockings in the sittingroom erastus had hurried away to a meeting of his henchmen in the town and would not be home until after his wife was in bed  so she was rather surprised when a timid knock sounded upon the door she opened it to find a little lean man standing upon the porch  mrs hopkins he asked quietly  yes what do you want  your husband asked me to come here and wait for him its important or i wouldnt disturb you  well then come in she replied tartly thank the lord this thing is nearly over and well have a few weeks of peace  it is rather imposing on you remarked the man following her to the sittingroom where he sat down with his hat in his hands a political campaign is trying to everybody im tired out and sick of the whole thing myself  then why dont you chuck it she retorted scornfully and go to work makin an honest living  oh this is honest enough he said mildly  i dont believe it all them secret confabs an trickery to win votes cant be on the square dont talk to me politics is another name for rascality  perhaps youre right maam perhaps youre right he said with a sigh  she looked at him sharply  you dont belong in elmwood  no maam im from beyond fairview ive come to see your husband on business  she sniffed at that but picked up her darning and relapsed into silence the little man was patient he sat quietly in his chair and watched her work  his mildness disarmed mary hopkins she was not especially averse to having him sit there it relieved the loneliness of her occupation on occasions she loved to talk as erastus had long ago discovered and this visitor would not try to shut her up the way erastus did  you dont often get out maam into society and such like ventured the caller presently  what makes you think that she demanded  a woman cant keep a house neat and trim like this and be a social gadder he observed  youre right about that she returned somewhat mollified if i was like them girls up at elmhurst fussin round over politics all the time this house would go to rack an ruin  oh them he said with mild scorn them girls ll never be housekeepers  not for a minute she affirmed  there was another pause then but the ice was broken a subtle sympathy seemed established between the two  what do you think of rasts chances she asked presently as she threaded new cotton into her needle  i guess hell win hes worked hard enough anyhow  has he  yes rasts a good worker he dont leave any stone unturned hes up to all the tricks o the trade is rast hopkins  here he began shaking with silent laughter and mrs hopkins looked at him curiously  what are you laughing at she inquired with a sniff of disdain  atat the way he come it over the gals up at elmhurst rasts a pretty slick one he is  what do you mean  why settin that liza to watch em and tell all they does whod a thought of it but rast hopkins  i dont see anything mighty funny about that declared mrs hopkins contemptuously the girls too pert and forward for anything i told rast not to fool with her or shed make him trouble  did you now exclaimed the man wonderingly  yes indeed said mrs hopkins pleased to have made an impression i suspected there was something wrong about her the morning she came to the house here and she changed her name too as brassy as you please  well i declare said the visitor did you know her before that mrs hopkins  why i didnt exactly know her but i seen her workin around miss squierss place many a time and she didnt seem to mount to much even then one day she stole a dimond ring offn old miss squiers and dug out and i told nancy thennancys young miss squiersthat id always had my suspicions of the hussy she hid the ring in a vase on the mantle and they found it after she was gone  well well i didnt know that about her said the man looking with admiration at mrs hopkins  thats why i told rast not to have any truck with her when she came here bright and early one morning and asked for work  oh she came here did she  while i was gettin breakfast she said her name was eliza parsons an she was looking fer a job i told her i knew her record an to get out and while we was arguin rast come out and took a hand in the talk she laughed and flirted with him outrageous and said she was a stranger in these parts when id seen her many a time at miss squierss  what was her name then asked the man  i think it was rosieor lucy or something anyhow it wasnt eliza and that ill swear to but the girl laughed at me and made such silly smiles at rast that he told me to shut up cause he had a use for her in politics  well well repeated the visitor just see how stories get twisted i heard you gave the girl a letter to your cousin martha  well i did rast wanted to get her in at elmhurst to watch what forbes was doing to defeat him so he made me write the letter but howd you know so much about this girl she inquired with sudden suspicion  me i only know what mr hopkins told me im one of his confidential men but he never said how he happened to find the girl or what he knew about her  he didnt know nothing hed never seen her till that morning when she came here but he said she was clever and she is if pertness and a ready tongue counts for cleverness i suppose he pays her for what she tells him about forbes but hed better save his money and fight on the square i dont like this tricky politics an never did  i dont either declared the man but im in it and cant get out  thats what rast says but some day theyll put him out neck and crop if he aint careful  is the girl eliza much use to him  i cant say he drove her over to elmhurst that morning and he drives over two or three evenings a week to meet her on the sly and get her report that may be politics but it aint very respectable to my notion  well the campaign is nearly over mrs hopkins  thank goodness for that she replied  the visitor sat silent after this for he had learned all that the poor gossiping woman could tell him finally he said  i guess your husbands going to be late  yes if he aint more prompt than usual youll have a long spell of waiting  perhaps id better go over to the hotel and look him up i have to get back to fairview tonight you know  do as you please she answered carelessly  so mr burke for it was the detective bade her goodnight and took his leave and it was not until after he had gone that mary hopkins remembered she had forgotten to ask him his name  but it dont matter she decided hes just one o rasts politicians and i probably treated the fellow better than he deserved     chapter xviii  eliza parsons   on sunday morning mr burke again appeared at elmhurst and told kenneth he wanted an interview with eliza parsons  i dont want you to send for her or anything like that for it would make her suspicious he said id like to meet her in some way that would seem accidental and not startle her  that is rather a hard thing to arrange mr burke said the boy with a smile  why i think not declared louise it seems to me quite easy  thats the woman of it sir laughed kenneth if its a question of wits her sex has the advantage of us  what do you propose miss asked the detective turning to louise  ill have martha send the girl into the garden to gather flowers she replied and you can wander around there and engage her in conversation  excellent he exclaimed can this be arranged now  ill see sir  she found martha and asked her to send eliza parsons for some roses and chrysanthemums which were in a retired place shut in by evergreen hedges  one of the other maids will know the garden better suggested the housekeeper  but i wish eliza to go  very well miss louise  from an upper window the girl watched until she saw eliza parsons leave the house with a basket and go into the retired garden she had chosen then she returned to the library for mr burke and led him toward the same place  eliza is just beyond that gap in the hedge she said and turned away  wait a moment please he said detaining her on second thought i would like you to come with me for your tact may be of great assistance have you spoken much with eliza  not at all i think beth has talked with her but i have scarcely been near her since she came here  you are willing to come  i shall be glad to  the poet saxe said mr burke walking through the gap beside louise has never been properly appreciated by his countrymen although since his death his verses are in greater demand than while he lived do you care for them  i dont know saxe very well she answered observing that they were approaching a place where eliza was bending over a rosebush but one or two of his poems are so amusing that they linger in my memory  eliza turned at the sound of their voices and gave them a quick glance but the next moment she resumed her occupation of cutting roses  the mans greatest fault was his habit of punning remarked the detective watching the girls form as he drew nearer it is that which blinded his contemporaries to his real talents what exquisite roses miss merrick may i ask for one for my buttonhole  yes indeed she replied pausing with him just beside eliza will you cut that bud yonder for mr burke my dear  the maid silently obeyed and as the detective took the flower from her hand he said  why isnt this eliza parsons  yes sir she replied carelessly  dont you remember me eliza  she seemed a little surprised but answered promptly  no sir  im william burke your mothers cousin how did you leave your brother harry and have you heard from josephine lately  the girl gave him a startled look and shrank back  why how nice cried louise i did not know you knew elizas family mr burke  yes she is one of my relatives and came from roanoke virginia isnt that correct eliza  yes sirno ii dont remember she said in a low tone  dont remember eliza that is strange  the girl stared at him half frightened and drew her hand over her eyes with a gesture of bewilderment  i hope my dear you are not going to be like your mother said mr burke gently my poor cousin nora was subject to a strange lapse of memory at times he remarked to louise she always recovered in time but for days she could remember nothing of her former lifenot even her own name are you ever affected that way eliza  she looked up at him pleadingly and murmured in a low voice  let me go please let me go  in a moment eliza  her hands were clasped together nervously and she had dropped her basket and scissors on the path before her the man looked intently into her eyes in a shrewd yet kindly way and she seemed as if fascinated by his gaze  tell me my dear have you forgotten your old life he asked  yes she whispered  poor girl and you are trying to keep this a secret and not let anyone know of your trouble  suddenly she started and sprang away uttering a cry of terror  youre trying to trap me she panted you know my name is not eliza parsons youyou want to ruin me  from the position in which they stood in the corner of the garden with high hedges behind the maid and mr burke and louise blocking the path in front there was little chance of escape but she looked around wildly as if about to make the attempt when louise stepped forward and gently took elizas hand in her own  mr burke is a good man my dear and means well by you she said in her sweet sympathetic tones he shall not bother you if you are afraid of him  iim not afraid said eliza with a resumption of her old manner and a toss of her head  the detective gave louise a look which she thought she understood  will you finish cutting these roses mr burke she asked with a smile eliza and i are going to my room come my dear and without waiting for a reply she led the girl whose hand was still clasped in her own along the path  eliza came willingly her manner was a little defiant at first but when louise drew her unobserved to the side entrance and up the staircase she grew gentle and permitted the other girl to take her arm  once in her room with the strange maid louise locked the door quietly and said to her companion with a cheerful smile  now we are quite alone and can talk at our ease take that low chair dear and ill sit here  eliza obeyed looking wistfully into the fair face of her new friend  you are very pretty eliza and im sure you are as good as youre pretty announced louise so you must tell me about yourself and whether you are happy here or not from this time on im going to be your friend you know and keep all your secrets and ill help you all i can  this rambling speech seemed to impress eliza favorably she relaxed somewhat from the tense alertness that was habitual with her and looked at the other girl with a softened expression  im afraid you wont be much interested in me she replied but i need a friendindeed i need a friend miss louise  im sure you do  at first i thought i could do without one i felt i must stand alone and let no one suspect butim getting puzzled and bewildered and i dont know what to do next  of course not tell me about it dear  i cant for i dont know myself she leaned forward in her chair and added in a whisper i dont even know who i am but that man with a shudder tried to trap me he said he knew eliza parsons and there is no eliza parsons its a name ii invented  i think i understand said louise with a little nod you had to have a name so you took that one  yes i dont know why i am telling you this ive tried to hide it all so carefully and perhaps im wrong in letting this thing worry me in the main ive been very happy and content lately andi have a feeling i was not happy beforebefore  before what dear  the girl looked at her steadily and her face grew red  before i lost my memory  for a few moments they sat silently regarding one another the expressive features of louise showing a silent sympathy  have you really lost your memory she asked  absolutely think of it i wakened one morning lying by the roadside and shivering with cold i had on a simple gray dress with no hat the sun was just rising and no one was near i examined myself with wonder for i had no idea who i was or how i came there there was no money in my pocket and i had no jewels to keep warm i began walking along the road the scenery was all new to me so far as i knew i had never been in the place before  the birds were singing and the cows mooed in the meadow i tried to sing too for my heart was light and gay and i was happy by and bye i came to a town but no one seemed to be awakened because it was yet so early as i walked down the street i saw smoke coming from one of the chimneys and it suddenly occurred to me that i was hungry i entered the yard and went around to the back door a woman was working in the kitchen and i laughed joyfully and wished her a good morning she was not very pleasant but it did me good to talk with her i liked to hear my own voice and it pleased me to be able to talk easily and well she grudgingly gave me something to eat and then bade me begone calling me by some strange name and saying i was a thief it was then that i invented the name of eliza parsons i dont know why but it popped into my head and i claimed it for my name and have clung to it ever since  have you no idea what your real name is asked louise greatly interested in this terse relation  i have no idea of anything that dates beyond that morning replied eliza the first time i looked in the mirror i saw a strange face reflected there i had to make my own acquaintance she added with one of her bright laughs i suppose i am between seventeen and twenty years of age but what my life was during past years is to me a sealed book i cannot remember a person i knew or associated with yet things outside of my personal life seem to have clung to me i remembered books i must have read i can write sing and sewi sew remarkably well and must have once been trained to it i know all about my countrys history yet i cannot recollect where i lived and this part of the country is unknown to me when i came to elmhurst i knew all about it and about mr forbes but could not connect them with my former life  how did you happen to come here asked louise  i forgot to tell you that while i was arguing with the woman who was a mrs hopkins her husband heard us and came out into the kitchen he began to question me about myself and i gave any answer that came into my head for i could not tell him the truth it pleased me to hear my voice i seemed to have a keen sense of the humorous and if i said anything at all clever i laughed as heartily as anyone my heart was light and free from all care i had no worries or responsibilities at all i was like the birds who see the sunshine and feel the breeze and are content to sing and be happy  mr hopkins saw i was wholly irresponsible and reckless and he decided to use me to spy upon the people here at elmhurst and report to him what they said and did i agreed to this readily prompted by a spirit of mischief for i cared nothing for hopkins and had nothing against mr forbes also hopkins paid me money which i had sufficient knowledge to realize was necessary to me  oh how happy and gay i was in those first few days there was not a thought of the past not an ambition or desire of any sort to bother me just to live seemed pleasure enough i enjoyed eating and sleeping i loved to talk and laugh i was glad to have work to occupy meand that was all then things began to happen that puzzled me the man hopkins declared he could not trust me because i had once been a thief and i wondered if he could speak truly i resented the thought that i may once have been a thief although i wouldnt mind stealing even now if i wanted anything and could take it  oh eliza gasped louise  it sounds wicked doesnt it but it is true nothing seems to influence me so strongly as my own whims i know what is good and what is bad i must have been taught these things once but i am as likely to do evil as good and this recklessness has begun in the last few days to worry me  then i met a young man herehe says his name is tom gateswho called me his dear lucy and said i used to love him i laughed at him at first for it seemed very absurd and i do not want him to love me but then he proved to me there was some truth in his statement he said his lucy had a scar on her left arm and that made me afraid because i had discovered a scar on my own arm i dont know how it got there i dont know anything about this old lucy and im afraid to find out im afraid of lucy  why dear  i cannot tell i only know i have a horror of her a sudden shrinking whenever her name is mentioned who was she do you suppose  shall i tell you asked louise  nono dont i beg of you cried eliza starting up ii cant bear it i dont want to know her  the protest was passionate and sincere and louise marvelled at the workings of this evidently unbalanced intellect  what would you like to do dear she inquired  id like to remain eliza parsonsalways id like to get away from herfar away from anyone who ever heard of that dreadful lucy who frightens me so will you help me to get away to escape to some place where no one will ever be able to trace me  do you think you would be happy then  i am sure of it the only thing that makes me unhappy now is the horror that this past life will be thrust upon me i must have had a past of course or i shouldnt be a grown woman now but im afraid of it i dont want to know anything about it will you help me to escape  she looked eagerly at louise as she asked this pitiful question and the other girl replied softly i will be your friend eliza ill think all this over and we will see what can be done be patient a little while and as soon as i find a way to free you from all this trouble ill send for you and well talk it over together  will you keep my secret demanded eliza uneasily  louise glanced at the door that communicated with beths room it stood open but eliza had not noticed that as it was behind her just now a shadow cast from the other room wavered an instant over the rug and louises quick eyes caught it  i promise to keep your secret dear she said earnestly  the two girls rose and stood facing each other louise kissed the beautiful eliza and whispered  here is one thing for you to rememberthat we are always to be true friends from this time forward if anyone annoys you come to me and i will protect you  thank you miss louise said eliza and then she went away to her own room in a quieter and more thoughtful mood than usual  when she had gone louise ran to the door communicating with beths room and to her satisfaction found both her cousins with kenneth uncle john and mr burke seated in a group where they must have overheard all that had been said  well she cried eagerly did you hear and what do you think of it all  its lucy rogers sure enough said kenneth  louise looked at mr burke  it is the most singular case that has ever come under my observation stated that gentleman the girl is perfectly sane but she has suffered a strange lapse of memory i have two alternatives to advise one is to telegraph at once for a specialist the other is to permit the girl to go away as she suggests she will be happier to do so i am sure  oh no cried the girls  she owes a duty to her parents and friends as well as to herself said kenneth and i see no reason why she should be unhappy in the future as lucy rogers  mr burke merely shrugged his shoulders  please wire for the specialist at once said uncle john     chapter xix  patsy indulges in eavesdropping   miss patricia doyle awakened at daybreak next morning with a throbbing toothache she wasnt accustomed to such pains and found it hard to bear she tried the application of a hotwater bag and the tooth ached harder she tried a cold compress and it jumped with renewed activity so she dressed herself and walked the floor with the persistent ache as an intimate companion  she tried to find a cavity in the tooth but it seemed perfectly sound evidently she had caught cold and the wicked molar was signaling the fact  to be patient under the torture of a toothache was a virtue patsy did not possess louise and beth to whom she appealed were sorry for her but could not relieve the pain after breakfast uncle john ordered her to drive to town and see a dentist  have it pulled or filled or something he said the dentist will know what to do  so james drove patsy to town where they arrived about nine oclock this monday morning the only dentist at elmwood was dr squiers so the girl ran up the flight of stairs to his office which was located over the hardware store  the pain had eased on the journey and now the thought of having the offending tooth pulled was weighing heavily upon patsys mind the door of dr squierss office stood ajar and she hesitated whether to enter or not  the dentists reception room was divided from his operating room by a thin wooden partition and as patsy was deciding whether to employ dr squierss services or not she heard high words coming from behind the partition and the voice was that of the honorable erastus hopkins  softly she slid into the outer room and sank into a chair  but youre the clerk of the election squiers you cant deny that hopkins was saying in a blustering imperious voice  thats true enough answered the dentist more calmly  then youve got the registration books in your possession  i admit that was the reply but youre asking me to incriminate myself rast if the thing was discovered it would mean prison for both of us  fiddlesticks cried the irascible hopkins these things are done every day and no ones the wiser for it its merely a part of the political game  im afraid rast said dr squiers honest injun im afraid  what are you fraid of ive got the other clerks all fixed and theyll stand by us all you need do is to add these sixtysix names to the registration list and then well vote em without opposition and win out  patsy gave a gasp which she tried to stifle the toothache was all forgotten  where are these men inquired dr squiers thoughtfully  theyre over at the mill marshall got em from all over the country and theyll be set to work today so everything will seem reglar  where do they sleep and eat inquired the doctor  forty sleep in hayess barn and the other twentysix in the stock loft over the planing mill marshalls got a commissary department and feeds em regular rations like so many soldiers of course im paying for all this expense acknowledged mr hopkins somewhat regretfully  and do you suppose these sixtysix votes will turn the scale asked dr squiers  theyre sure to we finished the last canvass yesterday and according to our figures forbes has about eighteen votes the best of us thats getting it down pretty close but we may as well make up our minds were beaten if we dont vote the men over at the mill marshall could have got me a hundred if necessary but sixtysix is more than enough say forbes has twice eighteen for his plurality instead of eighteen these sixtysix for me would wipe that out and let us win in a walk  when hopkins ceased there was a brief silence perhaps dr squiers was thinking  i simply must have those votes doc resumed the representative its the only way i can win  youve made a bungle of the whole campaign said squiers bitterly  thats a lie ive done a lot of clever work but these infernal city girls came down here and stirred up all the trouble  you made a mistake pushing that sign issue the girls beat you on that  if it hadnt been signs it might have been something worse but i aint beaten yet doc squiers this deal is going to win its a trick the boardingschool misses wont understand until after theyve cut their eyeteeth in politics  theres a pretty heavy penalty against false registration observed the dentist gloomily  theres no penalty unless were found out and there aint the ghost of a chance of that the books are in your hands i got all the clerks fixed not a question will even be raised i know it do you suppose id risk states prison myself if i wasnt sure  look here rast said squiers doggedly youre making a tool of me in this campaign why should i be used and abused just to elect erastus hopkins id like to know you sacrificed me when i might have been sheriff  youre well paid for that doc  and now you want me to put my neck in a noose for your advantage i wont do it rast and thats a fact  mr hopkins coughed  how much doc he inquired  the dentist was silent  state the figure but for mercys sake dont bleed me any more than you can help this fight has cost me a pretty penny already  i dont want your money growled squiers  yes you do doc i know you better than you know yourself the trouble with you is youll want too much  squiers laughed bitterly  is marshall to be trusted he asked  of course if he said a word hed lose his job as manager marshalls all right theres nothing to worry about doc  patsys tooth wasnt aching a bit but her heart was throbbing as madly as the tooth ever did and fortunately there was no pain connected with the throbbingonly joy  it ought to be worth two thousand dollars rast said the dentist  what in addition to all other expenses  why man it means the election it means your whole future if youre defeated now youre a back number in this district and you know it  its too much doc on my word it is  its too little come to think of it ill make it three thousand  doc  if you dont close with me rast by the jumping jupiter ill make it four thousand cried the dentist with exasperation  say twentyfive hundred doc  right on the nail give me your check herethis minute  and youll enter the names in the books  before you leave the office have you got the list  yes in my pocket said mr hopkins  then make out your check and ill get the books  there was a stir behind the partition and a sound of chairs scraping the floor patsy slid out the door and flew down the stairs at the imminent danger of breaking her neck james was seated in the buggy outside engaged in rumination  patsy bounded in beside him and startled him  drive for your life she cried drive for home  he whipped up the spirited horse and they dashed away presently the man asked with a grin  did it hurt much miss patsy  did what hurt james  the tooth pullin miss patsy  the tooth wasnt pulled answered the girl sweetly it didnt need it james the only thing that was pulled was the honorable erastuss leg     chapter xx  pricking a bubble   when patsy arrived home she called a council of war and related the conversation she had overheard in the dentists office  it isnt a very nice thing to dolistening to a private conversation said the girl but when i discovered they were going to play such a trick on kenneth i couldnt help eavesdropping  i think you were justified declared mr watson with a grave face for this matter is very serious indeed tomorrow is election day and if a toothache hadnt carried you to the dentists office kenneth would surely have been defeated  and wed never have known how it happened declared uncle john  but can the plot be foiled at this late date inquired louise anxiously  i think so said mr watson dr squiers was correct in saying that such a crime was a states prison offense our discovery of it will send both erastus hopkins and dr squiers to prison probably mr marshall the manager of the mill will go with them  oh i dont like that exclaimed patsy  nor do i added kenneth it would be a sad beginning to my political career to send three such men to prison id like to avoid it if i can  perhaps it may be quietly arranged said the lawyer if they knew you had discovered the false registration of these men they would never dare vote them  how would it be to send mr burke the detective over to the mill to talk with mr marshall suggested beth  that is an excellent plan and would be very effective in determining the manager to abandon the plot  ill go and see hopkins myself announced uncle john i know how to manage men of his sort  very good approved the lawyer and ill see squiers  if you do said patsy just ask him to sign a paper saying that lucy rogers was falsely accused of stealing the ring and that his mother found it in a vase where she had forgotten she put it  ill do that replied mr watson and ill get the sixty dollars back that tom gates paid him ill make it a condition of our agreeing not to prosecute the man  it looks as if we were going to win the election said uncle john in a pleased voice if hopkins was driven to such methods as stuffing ballotboxes he must know very well hes defeated  he acknowledged it to dr squiers said patsy gaily we have eighteen sure majority and perhaps more  its likely to be more predicted uncle john  i suppose congratulations are in order ken said louise  not yet cousin he replied wait until tomorrow night and then dont congratulate me but the campaign managersthree of the nicest and cleverest girls in existence  youre right my boy declared uncle john if you pull through and take your seat in the legislature youll owe it all to these girls  that is true smiled the lawyer kenneth was badly beaten when you arrived  of course our girls were very happy at receiving this praise but more pleased to realize they had actually been of service to their boy friend they believed that kenneth would prove a good representative and carry out his promises to the voters and if he did that his political career was assured  mr burke appeared in the afternoon with a telegram from dr hoyt the specialist saying that he would be at elmwood on the noon train wednesday his engagements prevented him from coming any sooner and in the meantime mr burke advised keeping a close watch on eliza parsons to see that she did not run away  ill attend to that said louise quickly eliza and i are friends and ill take care of her  arent you going to the polls asked patsy  no dear why should i go our work is done now isnt it  well im going to the polls and work for every vote declared patsy i shant be happy unless kenneth gets more than eighteen majority  when the hopkins plot was explained to mr burke the detective readily agreed to go to fairview and see mr marshall as no time was to be lost he was sent over in an automobile and arrived at the mill just before the hour for closing  the next day being election day the mill was to be closed and the manager was very busy in his office when mr burke requested to see him  you will have to come around wednesday said marshall fussily i cant attend to you now  im sorry to disturb you sir replied the detective but my business wont wait until wednesday  what is it about sir  about the election  then i wont be bothered the election doesnt interest me said mr marshall turning away  very well ill call wednesday sir at the jail  marshall gave him a quick look  who are you sir he asked  john burke a detective  the manager hesitated a moment  come in mr burke he said  i represent the forbes interests said the detective seating himself in the private office and it has come to our notice that dr squiers has permitted sixtysix fraudulent registrations to be entered on the books these sixtysix men are supposed to have been imported by you and are now working at this mill  this is all nonsense protested the manager growing pale  forty men are sleeping in a nearby barn and twentysix in the stockroom of the mill added mr burke  that isnt criminal sir  no indeed the criminal act is their false registration so far said the detective blandly  but mark you sir if an attempt is made to vote those men tomorrow i shall arrest you as well as mr hopkins and dr squiers  this is preposterous sir blustered the manager there will be no attempt made to vote them  i am quite sure of it was the reply you may thank mr forbes for warning you in time he wished to save you and so sent me here  oh he did mr marshall was evidently surprised may i ask how you discovered all this he added  i am not at liberty to give you the details but i may say the exposure of the plot occurred through mr hopkinss own carelessness ive seen lots of crooked politicians mr marshall but this man is too reckless and foolish ever to be a success he deserves to be defeated and he will be  the manager was thoughtful  this is all news to me he declared i needed these extra men to help me fill a contract on time and so employed them i had no idea hopkins and squiers would try to vote them tomorrow  this was a palpable falsehood but mr burke accepted the lame excuse without question  you are a valuable man in this community mr marshall and mr forbes seemed to think the hopkins people were trying to get you into trouble of course it would have caused trouble had these men voted  of course mr burke im much obliged to mr forbes for warning me  youll find the next representative a very agreeable man to get along with mr marshall good day sir  good day mr burke  when the detective had gone mr marshall sat in a brown study for a few moments then he summoned his superintendent and said  please ask the men to assemble in the yard before they go home i want to have a word with them  the request came just in time for the men were already beginning to stream out of the mill they waited goodnaturedly however grouping themselves in the big yard  then marshall mounted a lumber pile and addressed them briefly  boys he said i told you all a week or so ago id like you to vote for hopkins for representative as i believed his election would result in more work for the mill and better wages for the employees but ive been watching matters pretty closely and ive changed my mind forbes is a coming man and hell do more for us all than hopkins could so every man who is entitled to vote will please me best by voting for kenneth forbes  there was a cheer at this and when it subsided the manager continued  of course none of the new men who were not properly registered have a right to vote at this election and i command them to keep away from the polls anyone who attempts to vote illegally will be promptly arrested  this caused more cheering for the workmen had suspected that the new hands would be voted illegally and they were relieved to find that it was a square deal all round as one of them remarked with satisfaction  meantime uncle john was having a barrel of fun with mr hopkins  the little millionaire although a man of simple and unobtrusive ways was a shrewd judge of human nature moreover he had acquired a fund of experience in dealing with all sorts of people and was delighted to meet mr hopkins under the present circumstances  so he drove over to elmwood and was fortunate to find mr hopkins in his office at home where he was busily engaged instructing his workers in their duties at the polls  at sight of mr merrick whom he knew by this time to be a friend of kenneth forbes staying at elmhurst the politician scented some pending difficulty or at least an argument and was sufficiently interested to dismiss his men without delay  ah this is mr merrick i believe began mr hopkins suavely what can i do for you sir  considerable if youre disposed answered the other for one thing id like to hire eliza parsons away from you  eliza parsons gasped the representative  yes your spy elections about over and you wont need her any longer will you  sir do you mean to insult me asked the honorable erastus indignantly  by no means i thought you were through with the girl said uncle john with a chuckle  mr hopkins was distinctly relieved with a full recollection of his wicked schemes in his mind he had feared some more important attack than this so he assumed a virtuous look and replied  sir you wrong me eliza parsons was no spy of mine i was merely trying to encourage her to a higher spiritual life she is rather flighty and irresponsible sir and i was sorry for the poor girl that is all if she has been telling tales they are untrue i have found her i regret to say inclined at times to beahinventive  perhaps thats so remarked uncle john carelessly youre said to be a good man mr hopkins a leetle too honest and straightforward for a politician but thats an excusable fault  i hope i deserve my reputation mr merrick said erastus straightening up at this praise i do indeed try to live an upright life  i guess so mr hopkins i guess so you wouldnt try for instance to encourage false registration  sir  anything wrong mr hopkins asked uncle john innocently  erastus looked at his visitor tremblingly although he tried to control his nerves of course mr merrick couldnt mean anything by this chance shot so he must be thrown off the scent  you have a disagreeable way of making remarks sir and i have no time to listen to foolish speeches tomorrow is election day and ive a good many details yet to arrange  no chance of youre getting in jail is there  what do you mean by that  i only thought that if youd done anything liable to make trouble youd have to arrange your affairs for a long spell in jail politicians sometimes make mistakes but youre such an honest man mr hopkins you couldnt possibly go crooked  mr hopkins felt shaky again and looked at his tormentor earnestly trying to discern whether there was any real knowledge beneath this innuendo but uncle john met his gaze with a cheerful smile and continued  i guess youve got a hard fight ahead of you my young friend forbes is trying to get elected himself and you cant both win  oh yes forbes said erastus trying to regain his accustomed ease a worthy young man sir but im afraid his chances are slim  are they now asked uncle john pretending a mild interest  pretty thin mr merrick our majority is too great to overcome  what do you think your majority will be about sixtysix  mr hopkins gave a start and turned red  about sixtysix he repeated vacantly trying to decide if this was another chance shot  yes about sixtysix mill hands  the cat was out of the bag now hopkins realized that merrick had some knowledge or at least suspicion of this plot he tried to think what to do and it occurred to him that if his visitor positively knew anything he would not act in this absurd manner but come straight to the point so he ignored the speech merely saying  anything else sir  no replied uncle john ill go home i guess folksll be expecting me sorry forbes hasnt got that sixtysix mill hands but doc squiers probably registered em all right and theyll probably vote for hopkins  wait a moment sir cried erastus as uncle john was turning away that speech demands an explanation and i mean to have it  oh you do well i dont object you may not know it but squiers has registered sixtysix nonvoters and i want to know whether youre prepared to give half of them to forbes or mean to keep them all for yourself  if squiers has made false registrations he must stand the consequences i want you to understand sir that i do not countenance any underhand dealing  then its all off you wont vote the mill hands  not a man shall vote who is not properly registered  im glad to hear it mr hopkins perhaps you can get that twentyfive hundred back i dont think squiers has cashed the check yet  the honorable erastus gave a roar like a wild bull but uncle john had walked quietly out and climbed into his buggy he looked back and seeing mr hopkinss scowling face at the window returned a pleasant smile as he drove away  mr watson had just finished his interview with the dentist when uncle john picked him up at the corner the lawyer had accomplished more than the other two for he had secured a paper exonerating lucy rogers and another incriminating the honorable erastus hopkins as well as the sixty dollars paid by tom gates the dentist was thoroughly frightened but determined now that the conspiracy was defeated that the man who had led him to the crime should not escape in case he was himself arrested so he made a plain statement of the whole matter and signed it and mr watson assured squiers immunity from arrest pending good behavior the man had already cashed hopkinss check and he knew the representative could not get the money away from him so after all the dentist lost nothing by the exposure  it was a jolly party that assembled at the dinnertable in elmhurst that evening  you see explained uncle john the thing looked as big as a balloon to us at first but it was only a bubble after all and as soon as we pricked itit disappeared     chapter xxi  the returns from fairview   election day dawned sunny and bright but there was a chill in the air that betokened the approach of winter  uncle john had suggested serving coffee to the voters at the different polling places and kenneth had therefore arranged for a booth at each place where excellent coffee was served free all day long these booths were decorated with forbes banners and attracted a great deal of comment as the idea was a distinct innovation in this district  you wouldnt catch hopkins giving anything away remarked one farmer to another rast is too closefisted  why as fer that was the reply the thing is done to catch votes you know that as well as i do  spose it is said the first speaker id ruther my vote was caught by a cup of hot coffee on a cold day than by nothin at all if weve got to bite anyhow why not take a hook thats baited  patsy and beth made the rounds of the polling places in an automobile covered with flags and bunting and wherever they appeared they were greeted with cordial cheers  mr hopkins was noticeable by his absence and this was due not so much to his cowardice as to an unfortunate accident  neither squiers nor hopkins knew just how their secret had leaked out for patsys presence in the dentists office had not been disclosed so each one suspected the other of culpable foolishness if not downright rascality after uncle johns visit erastus stormed over to squierss office and found his accomplice boiling with indignation at having been trapped in a criminal undertaking  as the two men angrily faced each other they could not think of any gentle words to say and dr squiers became so excited by the others reproaches that he indulged in careless gestures one of these gestures bumped against the honorable erastuss right eye with such force that the eye was badly injured  the candidate for reelection therefore wakened on election morning with the damaged optic swollen shut and sadly discolored realizing that this unfortunate condition would not win votes mr hopkins remained at home all day and nagged his longsuffering spouse whose tongue was her only defence  the representative had promptly telephoned to marshall at fairview telling him not to vote the men as arranged he was not especially charmed with the managers brief reply  dont be alarmed were not all fools  i guess rast remarked mary hopkins looking at her damaged and irritable husband with a blending of curiosity and contempt that youre bout at the end of your rope  you wait said erastus grimly this thing aint over yet  the day passed very quietly and without any especial incident a full vote was polled and by sundown the fate of the candidates had been decided but the counting seemed to progress slowly and the group assembled around the telephone in kenneths library thought the returns would never arrive  the republican committee had given mr forbes a table showing what the vote of each precinct should be according to their canvass  the first report was from elmwood and showed a gain of seventeen over the estimate patsy was delighted for she had worked hard in elmwood and this proved that her efforts had been successful then came a report from longville in jefferson county it showed a gain of fortythree votes for hopkins and a consequent loss for forbes this was a startling surprise and the next advice from a country precinct in washington county showed another gain of twelve for hopkins  the little group of workers looked at one another with inquiring eyes and patsy could hardly refrain from crying  the butler announced dinner but only louise and mr watson could eat anything the others were too intent on learning their fate and could not leave the telephone  it seemed queer that the precincts furthest away should be first to respond but so it was jefferson county returns began to come in rapidly and were received in dismal silence hopkins gained four here seven there and twentytwo in another precinct  it looks said kenneth quietly like a landslide for hopkins and i wonder how our committee was so badly informed  you see said uncle john voters wont usually tell the truth about how theyve decided to vote lots of them tell both sides theyre going to vote their way and people change their minds at the last minute too you cant do much more than average the thing by means of a canvass  by nine oclock complete returns from the part of jefferson county included in the eighth district showed a net gain of one hundred and eight for hopkinsa lead that it seemed impossible to overcome washington county was not so bad incomplete returns indicated a slight gain for hopkins but not more than a dozen votes altogether  everything now depends upon dupree and fairview announced kenneth but i cant get any connection with them yet we won in elmwood anyhow and hopkins isnt ahead more than a hundred and sixty as the thing stands now cheer up girls a defeat wont hurt us much for weve all made a good fight better get to bed and sleep for youre tired out well know all about everything in the morning  but they would not move disappointment unnerved them more than victory would have done they resolved to wait until the last returns were in  telephone sir said tom gates  kenneth picked up the receiver  heres dupree he said our majority over hopkins is two hundred and eleven lets see thats a gain of seventyfour votes my dears  hooray cried patsy delightedly i dont care a rap now what happens old hopkins wont have much to crow over if  wait a minute said kenneth heres fairview at last  they held their breaths and watched his face kenneth flushed red as he held the receiver to his ear and then grew white he turned around to the expectant group and beth knew from the sparkle in his eyes what had happened  fairviews six precincts give us six hundred and fortyone majority announced the boy in an awed tone thats a gain of nearly four hundred  they gazed at him in silent wonder then uncle john rose slowly and took the boys hand  that means weve wonand won in a walk said the little man kenneth we congratulate you  patsys face was buried in her handkerchief and beths great eyes were bright with unshed tears but louise laughed her soft musical laugh and remarked  why i knew all the time we would win we had the better candidate you see  and the best campaign managers added uncle john with a proud smile  that may be true admitted beth but the thing that really won the fight was patsys sore tooth     chapter xxii  the awakening   james and mr burke met the great specialist in brain diseases at the noon train on wednesday and drove him to elmhurst  dr hoyt was a handsome grayhaired man with kindly eyes and a distinguished manner when he was ushered into the library the young ladies were attracted by the physician at once and from the first glance were inspired by confidence in his powers yet dr hoyt spoke rather doubtfully of the case in hand  these cases are not so rare as you might suppose he said yet no two of them are exactly alike usually the recovery is slow and tedious but recovery is not always assured in some instances however the memory is absolutely restored and from what mr burke has explained to me of lucy rogerss history this is what we may expect now or else we must trust to time or an accident to awaken her dormant mental faculties the case is so interesting that i should like with your permission to make an experiment which can result in no harm if it does not succeed  we put the matter entirely in your hands sir said uncle john act as you think best  i thank you replied dr hoyt bowing then he turned to the girls which of you young ladies has won the friendship of lucy rogers he asked  louise answered that she and eliza parsons had become good friends  will you assist me asked the physician  willingly sir  i wish to send the girl into a deep sleep to render her unconscious without her suspecting my intention or realizing the fact can you suggest a way to do this  louise tried to think  what means will you employ sir she asked  there are many ways to accomplish this i prefer to administer a powerful sleeping potion have you any confectionery or bonbons at hand  yes indeed i have just received a fresh box of bonbons from new york but im not sure i can induce eliza to eat candy  then let us prepare the potion in various ways but you must be careful miss merrick not to make a mistake and take the dose yourself  louise laughed  ill be careful sir she promised  the two then retired to perfect their plan and in an hour every arrangement was complete  louise went to her room donned a wrapper and bandaged her head then she summoned martha and asked the housekeeper to send eliza parsons to sit with her in the darkened room as she was suffering from a headache  the maid came at once to all appearances as happy and careless as ever after expressing her sympathy she asked what she could do  just sit down and keep me company dear replied louise im not very bad but im restless and cant sleep and i want you to talk to me and amuse me  eliza laughed  that is easy as far as talking is concerned she said but to amuse you miss louise may be more difficult  but the girls found a topic of conversation in the election in which eliza was much interested and they chatted together for an hour or so before louise made any move to consummate her plot  i hope my foolish reports to mr hopkins did no harm to mr forbes eliza was saying i really had little to tell him of your conversation or movements  you did no harm at all for mr forbes was elected replied louise then she said carelessly  martha has sent me this pitcher of lemonade and i dont care for it wont you drink a glass eliza  no thank you she replied shaking her head i never drink lemonade  then have one of these sandwiches  im not hungry miss louise  louise sighed both the lemonade and the sandwiches had been dosed by dr hoyt then she picked up the box of bonbons that was beside her  but you will eat some candy dear every girl likes candy  i dont seem to care for it said eliza carelessly  just one piece to please me coaxed louise and selected a piece from the box with dainty care here my dear youll find this sort very nice  eliza hesitated but finally reached out her hand and took the bonbon louise lay back in her chair and closed her eyes fearing their eagerness might betray her when after a time she opened them again eliza was slowly rocking back and forth and chewing the confection  dr hoyts first suggestion had been best the potion had been prepared in several ways to tempt eliza but the candy had been the effectual bait  louise felt a glow of triumph but managed to continue the conversation relating in an amusing way the anxiety of the elmhurst folks when the first returns seemed to indicate the election of hopkins  eliza laughed once or twice her head resting upon the back of her chair then the words of louise began to sound dreamy and indistinct in her ears the chair rocked with less regularity soon it came to a stop and eliza was peacefully sleeping in its ample depths  louise now rose softly and rang her bell footsteps approached and a knock came upon the door she admitted dr hoyt mr burke and two servants  the physician approached the sleeping girl and gently lifted the lids of her eyes then he nodded with satisfaction  there was no suspicion on her part she made no struggleno attempt to evade unconsciousness he asked  none at all sir replied louise she ate the bonbon and was asleep before she realized it  excellent said the doctor we will now place her in her own room upon her bed while mr burke and i drive over to her former home to complete our arrangements  wont she waken asked louise  not until tomorrow morning and when she does i hope for a complete restoration of her memory  beth went with dr hoyt to the rogers farm because she knew mrs rogers it was necessary to break the news to the poor blind woman gently but beths natural tact stood her in good stead she related the story of the search for lucy the discovery that one of the maids at elmhurst resembled the missing girl and the detectives conclusion that eliza parsons was none other than lucy rogers who was suffering from a peculiar mental aberration and had forgotten every detail of her former life  mrs rogers followed the tale with intelligent understanding and her joy at the discovery of her wandering child was only tempered by the fear that lucy would never know her mother again or be content to remain in her humble home  then dr hoyt took up the conversation and related the many instances of complete recovery that had come under his observation  i am adopting heroic methods in this case said he but i have reasonable hopes of their success your child doubtless became mentally confused while under this roof how many hours she wandered we do not know but it could not have been long before she lay down by the roadside and fell asleep when she awakened her mind was a blank as regards her identity and former history now in order to effect a recovery i have reversed these experiences with her she is at present plunged into a deep sleep under the influence of narcotics that have rendered her brain absolutely inactive it is really a state of coma and i wish her to waken in this house amid the scenes with which she was formerly familiar by this means i hope to induce her mental faculties to resume their normal functions  mrs rogers accepted this proposal with calmness and a confidence in the physician that was admirable old will trembled with nervous excitement and was so flustered by the importance of the experiment that dr hoyt decided to give him a quieting potion  lucys room was prepared in the exact manner in which she had left it and presently the visitors drove back to elmhurst  in the evening the doctor made the journey a second time accompanying the unconscious form of lucy which was attended by a maid louise had sent with her  the girl was undressed and put to bed in her own room and then everyone except dr hoyt returned to elmhurst  the physician sat late in conversation with the blind woman and old will and when they retired for the night he lay down upon a lounge in the little livingroom the question of fees or of comfort was wholly ignored by the specialist at the moment his sole interest was in his remarkable case  mrs rogers rose at daylight and with old wills assistance prepared the breakfast the little table was set in the humble livingroom and the fragrant odor of coffee pervaded the house dr hoyt drank a cup and then stepped out upon the little porch taking a position of observation by the window  all right nell muttered old will his knees knocking together in spite of himself  mrs rogers rose quietly and walked to the foot of the stairs  lucy lucy she called  yes came a faint reply  breakfast is ready  then the two old people sat in suppressed excitement for what seemed to them an age but the physician calmly stationed at the window knew it was not very long  presently a light step sounded upon the stairs and lucy came into the room  good morning mother dear she said a new sweet tenderness in her voice and then she knelt and kissed the woman upon her brow  the doctor looked at his watch  i must be going he muttered turning away theres time for me to catch the early train   the end
