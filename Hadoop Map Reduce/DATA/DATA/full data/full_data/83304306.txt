83304306	the life of a ship from the launch to the wreck by rm ballantyne    a story for preteens in which a small boy davy is taken to a shipyard to watch the building of a new sailingvessel the fair nancy  eventually davy is allowed to sail on board of her as a boyseaman  he is seasick at first but soon recovers and learns how to climb the rigging to help with the sails  they encounter a hurricane which knocks the ship over and they lose the ships boats a raft is made but only a few people can get away on it including the captains wife  the ship drifts helpless until she is wrecked on a hostile shore  there is only one chance for the men and that would be if someone could swim ashore with a rope and fasten it so that each member of the crew can be brought ashore with a travelling block and harness  this works and no lives are lost  they walk out of the wilderness till they come to a village from which they make their way to quebec and thence back to england  i find it rather a depressing story but the intention of the book presumably is to interest young people in a life at sea    the life of a ship from the launch to the wreck by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the life of a ship from the launch to the wreck  song of the sailor boy    oh  i love the great blue ocean   i love the whistling breeze   when the gallant ship sweeps lightly   across the surging seas   i watched my first ship building   i saw her timbers rise   until her masts were towering   up in the bright blue skies    i heard the cheers ascending   i saw her kiss the foam   when first her hull went plunging   into her ocean home   her flags were gaily streaming   and her sails were full and round   when the shout from shore came ringing   hurrah for the outwardbound    but alas ere long a tempest   came down with awful roar   and dashed our ship in pieces   upon a foreign shore   but he who holds the waters   in his almighty hand   brought all the sailors safely   back to their native land  davy was a fisher boy and davy was a very active little boy and davy wanted to go to sea  his father was a fisherman his grandfather had been a fisherman and his greatgrandfather had been a fisherman so we need not wonder much that little davy took to the salt water like a fish  when he was very little he used to wade in it and catch crabs in it and gather shells on the shore or build castles on the sands sometimes too he fell into the water neck and heels and ran home to his mother who used to whip him and set him to dry before the fire but as he grew older he went with his father in the boat to fish and from that time forward he began to wish to go to sea in one of the large ships that were constantly sailing away from the harbour near his fathers cottage  one day davy sat on a rock beside the sea leaning on his fathers boathook and gazing with longing eyes out upon the clear calm ocean on which several ships and boats were floating idly for there was not a breath of wind to fill their sails  oh how i wish my father would let me go to sea said davy with a deep sigh  i wonder if i shall ever sail away beyond that line yonder far far away where the sky seems to sink into the sea  the line that he spoke of was the horizon  davy heaved another sigh and smiled for just at that moment his eyes fell on a small crab that stood before him with its claws up as if it were listening to what he said  oh crab crab cried the little boy youre a happy beast  at that moment he moved the boathook and the crab ran away in such a desperate hurry that davy opened his eyes wide and said humph maybe yere not a happy beast after all  while he sat thus a stout fisherman came up and asked him what he was thinking about  on being told he said will you come with me boy to the buildingyard and ill show you a ship on the stocks  im goin as one of her crew when shes ready for sea and perhaps by that time your father will let you go too  you may be sure that davy did not refuse such a good offer so the man and the boy went hand in hand to the yard where ships were built  davy had never been there before and great was his surprise when he saw a huge thing standing on dry land with great pieces of wood of all shapes sticking round it like the skeleton of a whale but greater still was his surprise when the fisherman said there lad thats the ship  well exclaimed davy opening his large eyes to their widest it dont look like one just now  the fisherman laughed  thats true lad but comeill explain and taking davy by the hand he led him nearer to the skeleton of the ship and began to explain the names and uses of the different parts  you see that long thick timber he said that runs from this end which is the stern to that end which is the bowwell that is the keel  this post or beam that rises out of it here is the sternpost and that one that rises up at the far end yonder is the stem or cutwater  these are the principal timbers of the vessel and upon their strength the safety of a ship chiefly depends  the sticks that you see branching out from the keel like deers horns are called ribs they are very strong and the timbers that fasten them together at the top are called beams  of course these pieces of wood are some of them far larger than any trees that you have ever seen but if you examine them you will find that each timber and rib is made up of two or three separate pieces of wood fastened very strongly together when all the beams are fixed they will begin to nail the planks on to the ribs iron bolts are used for this purpose but by far the greater number of the nails are made of wood  after this is done the seams between the planks will be filled with oakum and the whole ship covered over with pitch and tar just in the same way as your father does to his boat when she lets in water  then the bottom of the ship will be entirely covered with sheets of copper to prevent the wood worms from destroying it  these little rascals would eat through a ships bottom and very soon sink it but for the copper  next the deck is laid down and the ship will be ready for launching  a ships masts and rigging are always put in after she is launched  now lad what dye think of it said the fisherman as he walked home again with davy  the ships to be a threemaster fullrigged and is to go by the name o the fair nancy  as he said this he smiled patted the little boy on the head and left him  but davy replied not a word to his friends remarks  his curly head was stuffed quite full with the keel timbers ribs beams sternpost planks and cutwater of the fair nancy he could not speak he found it difficult even to think so he thrust his hands deep into his pockets sat down on the shank of an anchor and stared out to sea  in half an hour he heaved a very deep sigh indeed and said oh dear me i wonder if i shall ever go to sea in the fair nancy  time flew on and little davy fished with his father and worked for his mother and paid many a visit to the buildingyard to watch the progress of the shiphis ship as he called it  he begged very hard too to be allowed to go in her when she should be ready for sea  at first neither father nor mother would hear of it but at last they began to think that davy would make a very good sailor for certainly he was an active obedient boy so although they did not say yes they were not nearly so determined as they used to be in saying no  the day of the launch was a great day at the seaport where davy lived the launch of a large ship is always a very interesting and wonderful sight indeed so that thousands and thousands of people flock from all directions to see it  whichever way davy looked he saw crowds of people some on foot some on horses some on donkeys and some in carriages all streaming towards the one great pointthe shipbuilders yard  it seemed quite like a holiday or a fair and was such a bright warm sunny day that peoples hearts felt far lighter than usual  davy saw all this at a glance the moment he left home and throwing his red nightcap into the air he gave one long loud hurrah and ran away as fast as his heavy fishingboots would let him  the ship was very different now from what it had been when he first saw it  there were four little masts put up in it on which were hoisted gay and gaudy flags  her hull or body was now coppered and neatly painted while all the rubbish of the buildingyard was cleared away so that everything looked neat and clean  the stocks or framework on which she had been built sloped towards the water so that when the props were knocked away from the ship she would slide by her own weight into the sea  ships are always built on sloping stocks near to the waters edge for you can fancy how difficult it would be to drag such a great thing into the water by main force  in order to make her slip more easily the ways down which she slides are covered with grease  very soon the crowds of people stood in silence expecting the great event of the day and as the moment drew nigh the band which had been playing all morning suddenly stopped  davy became very anxious because he was so little that he could not see in the crowd but observing a post near at hand he struggled towards it and climbed to the top of it  here he saw famously  the workmen had begun to knock away the props there was just one remaining  at this moment a lady stepped forward with a bottle of wine in her hand to christen the ship this she did by breaking the bottle against the cutwater just at that instant she began to move  another second and the fair nancy rushed down the incline plunged heavily into the water like some awful seamonster and floated out upon her ocean home amid the deafening cheers of the people especially of little davy who sat on the top of the post waving his red cap and shouting with delight  after the launch davy and all the people returned home and the fair nancy was towed to the shearhulk to have her masts put in  the shearhulk is a large ship in which is placed machinery for lifting masts into other ships  every one who has looked at the thick masts of a large vessel must see at a glance that they could never be put there by any number of men  machinery is used to do it and the shearhulk contains that machinery so that when a ship has to get her masts put up she is dragged alongside of this vessel  in the meantime davy renewed his prayer to his father to let him go to sea and at last the old man consented  his mother cried a good deal at first and hoped that davy would not think of it but his father said that it would do him good and if he became tired of it after the first voyage he could give it up davy was overjoyed at this and went immediately to his friend the fisherman ben block who was very much delighted too and took him to a shop to buy clothes and a seachest for the voyage  you see lad said ben the ship is bound for quebec with a mixed cargo and is to come back loaded with timber and as the season is coming on youll need to get ready quick  that i shall replied davy as they entered a shop  ho shopman give me a straw hat and a blue jacket and a pair o duck trousers and  stop stop cried ben youre sailing too fast  take in a reef my lad  ben meant by this that he was to proceed a little slower youll want a souwester an oilskin hat and a dreadnought a thick heavy coat and things o that sort  after davy had bought all he wanted and ordered a seachest he went home to his mother who was very sad at the thought of parting with him when the day of departure came she gave him a great deal of good advice which davy promised with tears in his eyes to remember  then she gave him a little bible and a kiss and sent him away  his father took him to the beach where the ships boat was waiting for him and as the old man took off his cap and raising his eyes to heaven prayed for a blessing on his little son davy with watery eyes looked around at the big ships floating on the water and for the first time wished that he was not going to sea  in a few minutes he was on board the outwardbound ship  this is what we say of ships when they are going out to sea when they return from a voyage we say that they are homewardbound  the fair nancy was a noble ship and as she hoisted her snowwhite sails to a strong wind a stiff breeze as ben block called it she looked like a white cloud the cloud seemed to grow smaller and smaller as davys father and mother watched it from the shore then it became like a little white spot on the faraway sea then it passed over the line where the water meets the sky and they saw it no more  after davy had cried a great deal and wished very often that he had not been so determined to leave home he dried his eyes and began to take great interest in the curious things he saw around him  what surprised him most of all was that although he actually was at sea he could not see the sea at all  this was because the sides of the ship which are called bulwarks were so high that they quite prevented the little boy from seeing overboard  davy soon found an opening in the bulwarks however which his friend ben called the gangway through which he could see the water and the ships and boats that were sailing there and when he mounted the high part of the deck in front of the ship which is called the forecastle or when he went upon the high deck at the stern of the ship which is called the poop then he could see all round  and what a wonderful and new sight it was to davy  his cottage was gone  the beach and the pier where the nets used to hang were gone  the trees and fields were all gone and there was nothing but sea sea sea all round so that the fair nancy seemed the only solid thing in the whole wide world  but poor davy did not look or wonder long at this for the breeze freshened and the waves rose and the ship plunged and davy felt very queer about the stomach  there is a man in every ship called the steward and everybody loves that man because he goes about from morning till night trying to do people good and to make them happy  he looks after breakfasts dinners teas and suppers he answers every one who calls and gets for everybody anything that they want  he is never ill never in a hurry never in a bad temper in fact he is a very charming man  now when the steward saw davy with a pale face and red eyes and awfully seasick he went up to him with a smile and said sick my lad youll soon get used to it  always sick when you first go to sea come below and ill give you summat to do you good and tumble you into your hammock  by going below the good steward meant going below the deck into the cabin  a ship is just like a large house divided into a number of roomssome of which are sitting rooms some store and provision rooms some kitchens and pantries closets and cupboards and there are two or three flats in some ships so that you can go up or down stairs at your pleasure  when davy went down the ladder or stair which is called the companion and followed the steward through many rooms full of all kinds of things that seemed to be all in confusion and saw the sailors sitting and smoking and laughing and talking on chests and tables he almost believed that he was in a house on shore but then he remembered that houses on shore dont dance about and roll first on one side and then on the other and plunge forwards and then backwards so he sighed and put his hands to his breast which felt very uncomfortable  heres your hammock said the steward all the sailors sleep in these things and this one is yours  so saying he lifted davy from the ground and tossed him into bed  the hammock is a long piece of canvas drawn in round an iron ring at each end  to this ring a number of cords are attached and the hammock is slung by them to the beams of the ship in the bed thus formed the blankets are put and a very snug bed it is as it swings about with the ship  davy soon fell asleep but he was quickly wakened again by the horrible noises on deck  ropes were thrown about mens feet were stamping pieces of wood were falling doors were banging masts were creaking the wind was howling in short davy thought it must be a terrible storm and that they should all be lost but the steward said to him in passing its only a stiff breeze youngster so he turned round and went to sleep again  for two days and two nights did davy lie therevery sick  on the morning of the third day he awoke much refreshed and felt strongly inclined to eat his blankets  as he lay wondering how he was to get down out of his hammock without breaking his neck he heard his friend ben block conversing with a man in another hammock who had never been to sea before and was very very sick  oh dear me sighed the sick man where are we now  dont know answered ben weve been drove pretty far out of our course to the norard i guess  its a dead calm  a dead what said the sick man faintly  why a dead calm replied ben  when theres no wind its a calm and when theres no motion at all either in the air or in the water except the swell o the sea its a dead calm  dye understand  is it fine weather ben cried davy cheerfully  yes lad it is replied the sailor  on hearing this davy sprang or as the sailors call it tumbled out of bed  he tried to get out of it but not being used to hammocks he was awkward and fell plump on the floor  however he was not hurt and throwing on his jacket he ran up on deck  well might davys heart leap and his voice shout at the beautiful sight that met his gaze when he reached the forecastle  the sea was like one wide beautiful mirror in which all the clouds were clearly reflected the sun shone brightly and glittered on the swell on which the ship rolled slowly and the only sound that could be heard was the gentle flapping of the loose sails now and then against the masts  have you had breakfast youngster inquired the captain of the ship laying his hand on davys head  no sir not yet answered the boy  run below then and get it and after youve done come to me  we must put you to work now lad and make a sailor of you  the steward soon gave davy as much food as he could eat then he sprang up the companion ladder and running to the poop where the captain was touched his cap saying  im ready sir  very good my lad said the captain sitting down on the skylight or window on the deck which gives light to the cabin below  do you see that little thing on top of the mainmast like a button  do you mean the truck said davy  oh you know its name do you well do you think you could climb up to it  ill try cried davy springing towards the mast  stay shouted the captain not so fast boy  youd tumble down and break your neck if you tried to climb to the truck the first time you ever went up the mast  but you may go to the maintop  thats where you see the lower mast joined to the top mast  climb up by those rope laddersthe shrouds we call them  away went davy and was soon halfway up the shrouds but he went too fast and had to stop for breath  then he came to the mass of woodwork and ropes at the head of the lower mast  here he had great difficulty in getting on but being a fearless boy he soon succeeded  the captain then called to him to go out to the end of the yardarm  yards are the huge cross beams fastened to the masts to which the sails are fixed  the mainyard is the largest  the mainsail is attached to it  davy soon crept out nearly to the end but when he got there the yard became so small and the ropes upon it were so few and slack that the poor boys courage began to fail  he looked down at the water which seemed to be terribly far below him  at that moment the ship made a lurch or plunge davy lost his hold and with a loud cry fell headlong from the yard into the sea  in a moment ben block who had been watching him jumped overboard a boat was lowered and in less than ten minutes ben was picked up with davy clinging to him  not long after this they drew near the gulf of saint lawrence and were beginning to think of the end of their voyage  but one night while davy lay sound asleep in his warm hammock he was startled by a cry on deck which was followed by a loud order for all hands to tumble up and shorten sail  the sailors are usually called hands at sea  in a moment davy was on deck with only his trousers and shirt on  but he could not see anything the night was so dark and he could scarcely hear anything except the howling of the wind  take in all sail roared the captain  the men rushed to obey and davy was so well accustomed to the work that he too climbed to his usual place on the main topsail yard and began to haul in the sail  he could barely see the man next to him and it was with difficulty he kept his hold of the yard while the ship tossed and plunged in the waves  when nearly all sail was taken in the ship went easier and the men assembled on the deck to await further orders  the gale increased and suddenly the small bit of the foretopsail that was hoisted burst into shreds with a clap like thunder and carried away the foretopmast with all its yards and rigging part of the bowsprit and the top of the mainmast clear away the wreck shouted the captain  some of the men ran for axes and began to cut the ropes that fastened the broken masts to the ship for there was a danger of the ship striking against them and knocking a hole in her side while she plunged  still the gale increased and the mizzen topmast went overboard  the mizzen is the mast nearest to the stern  it is the smallest of the three  the lightning now began to flash and the thunder to roar while the crew of the fair nancy stood on her deck clinging to the bulwarks lest they should be washed overboard  little davy looked at the man next him and saw that it was ben block  oh ben said he what an awful night it is  do you think we shall be lost  ben shook his head  i dont know lad but the lord can save us if it be his will  pray to him boy  my poor mother murmured davy as the tears rose to his eyes while he prayed to god in his heart that he might be spared to see her again  at that moment there came a wave so big and black that davy thought the sea was going to turn upside down  it came on like a great dark mountain high above the ship  hold on for your lives cried some of the men as the wave fell with a fearful crash and turned the ship over on her sideor on her beamends as sailors call it  they were in awful danger now as the sea began to pour down into the cabins and the masts and sails being in the water the ship could not right or become straight again  cut away the masts roared the captain  the deck was now standing up like a wall so that the men could not walk on it but they managed with great difficulty to reach the mizzenmast which a few strokes of the axe sent overboard  still the ship lay on her beamends cut away the mainmast cried the captain  the order was obeyed and with a loud report like a cannon shot it went overboard too immediately after the fall of the mainmast there came another wave from which they never expected to rise again  it dashed down on the stern and drove in the cabin windows but the worst of it was that it swept away all the boats belonging to the ship  they had been securely fastened to the deck but this wave carried them all away so that now if the ship sank their only chance of escape was gone  the same wave snapped the foremast across near the deck  this was fortunate because it enabled the ship to right herself and once more the men were able to stand on the deck  the storm continued to rage still however and some of the men were sent to work the pumps for there was a great deal of water in the ship now so much indeed that she could hardly float another party were ordered to fit up a small mast which they tied to the stump of the foremast  this new one was called a jurymast and as they could not sail without a mast of some kind or other they were very glad when they saw it up and a sail hoisted on it  during the night however another heavy wave broke this mast away also so they were again left to toss like a log on the stormy waters  all this time the men were working hard at the pumps but although they worked for many hours without stopping the water continued to increase in the hold and they saw that the ship had sprung a leak that is to say some of the planks had started or the seams had opened and the water was pouring into it so fast that it was evident she would soon sink  this was very awful indeed  some of the men began to cry to god for mercy others tore their hair and ran about like madmen while some sat down and silently prepared to die  the morning light came at last  but what a sad sight it rose upon  the once noble ship now lay a wreck upon the water with the masts and sails gone and her shattered hull ready to sink  the captain who seemed to have lost all hope when the jurymast broke was standing on the poop looking anxiously round the horizon in hopes of seeing a sailbut in vain  davy stood beside him and looking up in his face said please sir could we not make a raft  right boy right replied the captain youre the best man amongst us  were no better than girls to be giving way to despair in this way hallo lads rouse up there get all the spare yards and spars you can and make a raft  look sharp now  the captain said this in such a quick commanding tone that all the sailors jumped to obey him and in five minutes they were busily at work on the raft  first they collected all the broken yards and bits of masts that were still floating alongside dragging by the ropes that fastened them to the sides of the ship  these they arranged side by side and tied them firmly together with ropes  then they collected all the spare timbers that were in the ship and putting these above the others fastened them with ropes too  after that they tore off some of the planks from the decks and bulwarks with which they made a kind of floor to the raft  all this although it takes a short time to tell took a long long time to do for it was hard work moving such heavy timbers and the poor men were very tired having been up in the storm all night  besides this although the wind had ceased the waves were still high and would not let them work quietly  however they finished it at last and after it was done they put a number of barrels of biscuit and some casks of water and wine on board  then they put a few blankets and a compassthat useful little machine that points always to the north and shows the sailor which way to go so that he sails in the dark night as surely as in the broad day  now said the captain i think that there is a chance of escape yet get on board lads as fast as you can  i fear the ship wont float long  all the men now hastened on board  the captains wife who was the only female in the ship was the first to step on the raft and it soon began to be crowded  when about half of the sailors had left the ship the captain suddenly cried out ho  ben block weve forgot a mast and sail  run below with a couple of hands and fetch one as fast as you can  just at that moment the ship gave a heavy plunge the ropes broke and the raft floated slowly away leaving the men who were yet in the ship in a state of despair  one or two of them jumped into the sea and tried to swim to the raft but the first man who did so was nearly drowned and the others got back to the ship with great difficulty  it was a terrible sight to witness the misery of the poor captain as he beheld his wife standing with her arms stretched out towards him and the raft drifting slowly away until at length it appeared like a small black spot far off upon the sea  oh my poor wife he cried i shall never see you more  the tears were rolling down ben blocks weatherbeaten face as he went up to the captain and took him by the hand  never fear sir said he the almighty can save her  thank you ben for saying that replied the captain but the ship wont float long  my wife may indeed be saved but we are sure to be lost  i dont know that cried ben trying to look cheerful  when you sent me down below sir to look for a mast and sail i observed that the water in the hold had ceased rising  if we can only keep her afloat a little longer we may manage to make another raft  the captain smiled sadly and shook his head and davy who had been standing beside him all the time felt his heart sink again  to add to the horror of the scene night came on and the water was so high in the cabin that the captain and men who had been left in the wreck had to try to sleep on the wet decks the best way they could next morning the wind was still blowing pretty hard and they now saw that they were drawing near to a wild shore where there seemed to be many large rocks in the water near the beach  the crew of the fair nancy looked anxiously towards the land hoping to see people there who might help them when the ship struck on the rocks but they saw no one in about an hour afterwards the ship struck and the shock was so great that davys heart seemed to leap into his throat  the shore was lined with great dark cliffs and precipices at the foot of which the waves roared furiously  while the men stood looking helplessly at the land another wave lifted the ship carried her forward a long way and dashed her down on the rocks where she stuck fast with a sharp rock quite through her hull and the water foaming round her  what made their situation more dreadful was that a great deal of snow had fallen during the night  it covered the decks of the ship and made the land look cold and dreary  we must swim for it now said the captain as he looked sorrowfully at the boiling surf and immense waves which swept over the rocks and bursting like thunder on the cliffs were flung back upon the ship in spray  no one can swim in such a surf as that said one of the sailors gloomily  surf is the name given to the white foam which is formed by the waves when they dash upon the shore  it is very difficult sometimes quite impossible to swim in the surf of the sea and many poor sailors have been hurled on the rocks by it and dashed in pieces while attempting to swim from their wrecked vessels to the land  every time a wave came it lifted the fair nancy and as it passed let her fall heavily on the sharp rocks so that she began to break up still the men were afraid to venture into the sea and they clung to the bulwarks quite uncertain what to do  at last ben block turned to the captain and said  im a good swimmer captain and i think i could swim to the shore well enough perhaps but there are some o the men who cant swim and poor davy there could never do it so ill just throw a rope round my shoulders and make for the shore  if i land ill fix the rope to the cliffs and youll all be able to get ashore easy enough  if i should be drowneditll only be a little sooner thats all and its well worth risking my life to save my shipmates  youre a brave fellow ben said the captain  go and do it if you can  ben block went down below and soon returned with a stout rope  on the end of this he made a loop which he passed round his shoulders and then raising his eyes to heaven with an imploring look he leapt into the sea  at first he swam vigorously and the sailors looked on in anxious hope  but a large wave came  it felland ben block disappeared while a cry of fear rose from the deck of the ship  in a few seconds however they saw him rise again and struggle manfully with the raging billows  the next wave that came lifted ben up and threw him on the beach to which he clung with all his power but as the wave retired it swept him back into the sea for he could not hold on to the loose sand  he now rolled over and over quite exhausted and the sailors thought he was dead  but a mans life is dear to him and he does not soon cease to struggle  another wave approached  it lifted ben up and threw him again on the beach  this time he made a desperate effort to hold on and fortunately he observed a large rock close to where he lay  with a sudden spring he caught hold of it and held on till the wave went back then he ran forward a few steps and caught hold of another rock a little higher up so that when the next wave broke over him it had not power to draw him back  another runand he was safe  the men gave a loud cheer when they saw him land  after he had rested a little ben fastened the end of the rope to a mass of rock  the sailors hauled it tight and fixed the other end in the ship and then one by one they slowly crept along the rope and reached the shore in safety here they all fell on their knees and thanked god for their deliverance  but now they found that the land was not inhabited and they walked along that dreary coast for several days almost starved to death with hunger and cold for they had only a few biscuits among them and their clothes were never dry  little davy was the best walker among them and helped to keep up their spirits greatly by his cheerful conversation as they toiled along  at last they arrived at a little village where the people were exceedingly kind to them gave them food and dry clothes and after they became stronger sent them to the great city of quebec here they were kindly treated and finding a ship bound for england they all returned home  you may imagine the delight of the poor captain when he arrived and found his wife safe and sound  she and all the people on the raft had been picked up by a homewardbound vessel the day after they lost sight of their ship and were brought safe back to england  and you may fancy the joy of little davys parents when their son opened the cottage door one day and rushed into his mothers arms  davy never went to sea again but continued for many years after to help his poor father to fish  and the fair nancythat beautiful ship which davy had watched so long which he had seen launched and which had sailed so gallantly from her native shores with her snowy sails glancing in the sun like the white wings of a seagullalas alas she lay a total wreck now on the rocky shores of a foreign land
