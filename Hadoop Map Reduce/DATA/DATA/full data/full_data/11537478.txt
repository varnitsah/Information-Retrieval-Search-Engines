11537478	illustration ambrose bierce  shapes of clay  by  ambrose bierce  author of in the midst of life can such things be black beetles in amber and fantastic fables  1903     dedication  with pride in their work faith in their future and affection for themselves an old writer dedicates this book to his young friends and pupils george sterling and herman scheffauer ab     preface   some small part of this book being personally censorious and in that part the names of real persons being used without their assent it seems fit that a few words be said of the matter in sober prose what it seems well to say i have already said with sufficient clarity in the preface of another book somewhat allied to this by that feature of its character i quote from black beetles in amber  many of the verses in this book are republished with considerable alterations from various newspapers of my motives in writing and in now republishing i do not care to make either defence or explanation except with reference to those who since my first censure of them have passed away to one having only a readers interest in the matter it may easily seem that the verses relating to those might properly have been omitted from this collection but if these pieces or indeed if any considerable part of my work in literature have the intrinsic worth which by this attempt to preserve some of it i have assumed their permanent suppression is impossible and it is only a question of when and by whom they will be republished some one will surely search them out and put them in circulation  i conceive it the right of an author to have his fugitive work collected in his lifetime and this seems to me especially true of one whose work necessarily engendering animosities is peculiarly exposed to challenge as unjust that is a charge that can best be examined before time has effaced the evidence for the death of a man of whom i have written what i may venture to think worthy to live i am no way responsible and however sincerely i may regret it i can hardly consent that it shall affect my literary fortunes if the satirist who does not accept the remarkable doctrine that while condemning the sin he should spare the sinner were bound to let the life of his work be coterminous with that of his subject his were a lot of peculiar hardship  persuaded of the validity of all this i have not hesitated to reprint even certain epitaphs which once of the living are now of the dead as all the others must eventually be the objection inheres in all forms of applied satiremy understanding of whose laws and liberties is at least derived from reverent study of the masters that in respect of matters herein mentioned i have but followed their practice can be shown by abundant instance and example  in arranging these verses for publication i have thought it needless to classify them according to character as serious comic sentimental satirical and so forth i do the reader the honor to think that he will readily discern the nature of what he is reading and i entertain the hope that his mood will accommodate itself without disappointment to that of his author  ambrose bierce        contents    the

clay       the passing show    i     i know not if it was a dream i viewed   a city where the restless multitude     between the eastern and the western deep   had roared gigantic fabrics strong and rude    colossal palaces crowned every height   towers from valleys climbed into the light     oer dwellings at their feet great golden domes   hung in the blue barbarically bright    but now newglimmering toeast the day   touched the black masses with a grace of gray     dim spires of temples to the nations god   studding high spaces of the wide survey    well did the roofs their solemn secret keep   of life and death stayed by the truce of sleep     yet whispered of an hourwhen sleepers wake   the fool to hope afresh the wise to weep    the gardens greened upon the builded hills   above the tethered thunders of the mills     with sleeping wheels unstirred to service yet   by the tamed torrents and the quickened rills    a hewn acclivity reprieved a space   looked on the builders blocks about his base     and bared his wounded breast in sign to say   strike t is my destiny to lodge your race    t was but a breath ago the mammoth browsed   upon my slopes and in my caves i housed     your shaggy fathers in their nakedness   while on their foemans offal they caroused    ships from afar afforested the bay   within their huge and chambered bodies lay     the wealth of continents and merrily sailed   the hardy argosies to far cathay    beside the city of the living spread   strange fellowshipthe city of the dead     and much i wondered what its humble folk   to see how bravely they were housed had said    noting how firm their habitations stood   broadbased and free of perishable wood     how deep in granite and how high in brass   the names were wrought of eminent and good    i said when gold or power is their aim   the smile of beauty or the wage of shame     men dwell in cities to this place they fare   when they would conquer an abiding fame    from the red east the suna solemn rite   crowned with a flame the cross upon a height     above the dead and then with all his strength   struck the great city all aroar with light     ii    i know not if it was a dream i came   unto a land where something seemed the same     that i had known as t were but yesterday   but what it was i could not rightly name    it was a strange and melancholy land   silent and desolate on either hand     lay waters of a sea that seemed as dead   and dead above it seemed the hills to stand    grayed all with age those lonely hillsah me   how worn and weary they appeared to be     between their feet long dusty fissures clove   the plain in aimless windings to the sea    one hill there was which parted from the rest   stood where the eastern water curved awest     silent and passionless it stood i thought   i saw a scar upon its giant breast    the sun with sullen and portentous gleam   hung like a menace on the seas extreme     nor the dead waters nor the far bleak bars   of cloud were conscious of his failing beam    it was a dismal and a dreadful sight   that desert in its cold uncanny light     no soul but i alone to mark the fear   and imminence of everlasting night    all presages and prophecies of doom   glimmered and babbled in the ghastly gloom     and in the midst of that accursèd scene   a wolf sat howling on a broken tomb       elixer vitae     of lifes elixir i had writ when sleep   pray heaven it spared him who the writing read   sealed upon my senses with so deep   a stupefaction that men thought me dead   the centuries stole by with noiseless tread   like spectres in the twilight of my dream   i saw mankind in dim procession sweep   through life oblivion at each extreme   meanwhile my beard like barbarossas growing   loaded my lap and oer my knees was flowing    the generations came with dance and song   and each observed me curiously there   some asked who was he others in the throng   replied a wicked monk who slept at prayer   some said i was a saint and some a bear   these all were women so the young and gay   visibly wrinkling as they fared along   doddered at last on failing limbs away   though some their footing in my beard entangled   fell into its abysses and were strangled    at last a generation came that walked   more slowly forward to the common tomb   then altogether stopped the women talked   excitedly the men with eyes agloom   looked darkly on them with a look of doom   and one cried out we are immortal now   how need we these and a dread figure stalked   silent with gleaming axe and shrouded brow   and all men cried decapitate the women   or soon therell be no room to stand or swim in    so in my dream each lovely head was chopped   from its fair shoulders and but men alone   were left in all the world birth being stopped   enough of room remained in every zone   and peace ascended womans vacant throne   thus lifes elixir being found the quacks   their breadandbutter in it gladly sopped   twas made worth having by the headsmans axe   seeing which i gave myself a hearty shaking   and crumbled all to powder in the waking       convalescent     what out of danger   can the slighted dame   or canting pharisee no more defame   will treachery caress my hand no more   nor hatred he alurk about my door   ingratitude with benefits dismissed   not close the loaded palm to make a fist   will envy henceforth not retaliate   for virtues it were vain to emulate   will ignorance my knowledge fail to scout   not understanding what tis all about   yet feeling in its light so mean and small   that all his little soul is turned to gall    what out of danger jealousy disarmed   greed from exaction magically charmed   ambition stayed from trampling whom it meets   like horses fugitive in crowded streets   the bigot with his candle book and bell   tonguetied unlunged and paralyzed as well   the critic righteously to justice haled   his own ear to the post securely nailed   what most he dreads unable to inflict   and powerless to hawk the faults hes picked   the liar choked upon his choicest lie   and impotent alike to villify   or flatter for the gold of thrifty men   who hate his person but employ his pen   who love and loathe respectively the dirt   belonging to his character and shirt    what out of dangernatures minions all   like hounds returning to the huntsmans call   obedient to the unwelcome note   that stays them from the quarrys bursting throat   famine and pestilence and earthquake dire   torrent and tempest lightning frost and fire   the soulless tiger and the mindless snake   the noxious insect from the stagnant lake   automaton malevolences wrought   out of the substance of creative thought   these from their immemorial prey restrained   their fury baffled and their power chained    im safe is that what the physician said   what out of danger then by heaven im dead       at the close of the canvass     twas a venerable person whom i met one sunday morning   all appareled as a prophet of a melancholy sect   and in a jeremaid of objurgatory warning   he lifted up his jodel to the following effect    o ye sanguinary statesmen intermit your verbal tussles   o ye editors and orators consent to hear my lay   and a little while the digital and maxillary muscles   and attend to what a venerable person has to say    cease your writing cease your shouting cease your wild unearthly lying   cease to bandy such expressions as are never never found   in the letter of a lover cease exposing and replying   let there be abated fury and a decrement of sound    for tomorrow will be monday and the fifth day of november   only day of opportunity before the final rush   carpe diem go conciliate each person whos a member     of the other partydo it while you can without a blush    lo the time is close upon you when the madness of the season     having howled itself to silence like a minnesota clone   will at last be superseded by the still small voice of reason     when the whelpage of your folly you would willingly disown    ah tis mournful to consider what remorses will be thronging     with a consciousness of having been so ghastly indiscreet   when by accident untoward two exgentlemen belonging     to the opposite political denominations meet    yes tis melancholy truly to forecast the fierce unruly     supersurging of their blushes like the flushes upon high   when aurora borealis lights her circumpolar palace     and in customary manner sets her banner in the sky    each will think this falsifier knows that i too am a liar   curse him for a son of satan all unholily compound   curse my leader for another curse that pelican my mother   would to god that i when little in my victual had been drowned    then that venerable person went away without returning   and the madness of the season having also taken flight   all the people soon were blushing like the skies to crimson burning   when aurora borealis fires her premises by night       novum organum     in bacon see the culminating prime   of anglosaxon intellect and crime   he dies and nature settling his affairs   parts his endowments among us his heirs   to every one a pinch of brain for seed   and to develop it a pinch of greed   each thrifty heir to make the gift suffice   buries the talent to manure the vice       geotheos     as sweet as the look of a lover    saluting the eyes of a maid    that blossom to blue as the maid   is ablush to the glances above her    the sunshine is gilding the glade    and lifting the lark out of shade    sing therefore high praises and therefore    sing songs that are ancient as gold    of earth in her garments of gold   nor ask of their meaning nor wherefore    they charm as of yore for behold    the earth is as fair as of old    sing songs of the pride of the mountains    and songs of the strength of the seas    and the fountains that fall to the seas   from the hands of the hills and the fountains    that shine in the temples of trees    in valleys of roses and bees    sing songs that are dreamy and tender     of slender arabian palms     and shadows that circle the palms   where caravans veiled from the splendor     are kneeling in blossoms and balms     in islands of infinite calms    barbaric o man was thy runing     when mountains were stained as with wine

the setting sun   was crimson with a curse and a portent   and scarce his angry ray lit up the land   that lay below whose lurid gloom appeared   freaked with a moving mist which reeking up   from dim tarns hateful with some horrid ban   took shapes forbidden and without a name   gigantic nightbirds rising from the reeds   with cries discordant startled all the air   and bodiless voices babbled in the gloom   the ghosts of blasphemies long ages stilled   and shrieks of women and mens curses all   these visible shapes and sounds no mortal ear   had ever heard some spiritual sense   interpreted though brokenly for i   was haunted by a consciousness of crime   some giant guilt but whose i knew not all   these things malign by sight and sound revealed   were sinbegotten that i knewno more   and that but dimly as in dreadful dreams   the sleepy senses babble to the brain   imperfect witness as i stood a voice   but whence it came i knew not cried aloud   some words to me in a forgotten tongue   yet straight i knew me for a ghost forlorn   returned from the illimited inane   again but in a language that i knew   as in reply to something which in me   had shaped itself a thought but found no words   it spake from the dread mystery about   immortal shadow of a mortal soul   that perished with eternity attend   what thou beholdest is as void as thou   the shadow of a poets dreamhimself   as thou his soul as thine long dead   but not like thine outlasted by its shade   his dreams alone survive eternity   as pictures in the unsubstantial void   excepting thee and me and we because   the poet wove us in his thought remains   of nature and the universe no part   or vestige but the poets dreams this dread   unspeakable land about thy feet with all   its desolation and its terrorslo   t is but a phantom world so long ago   that god and all the angels since have died   that poet livedyourself long deadhis mind   filled with the light of a prophetic fire   and standing by the western sea above   the youngest fairest city in the world   named in another tongue than his for one   ensainted saw its populous domain   plaguesmitten with a nameless shame for there   redhanded murder rioted and there   the people gathered gold nor cared to loose   the assassins fingers from the victims throat   but said each in his vile pursuit engrossed   am i my brothers keeper let the law   look to the matter but the law did not   and there o pitiful the babe was slain   within its mothers breast and the same grave   held babe and mother and the people smiled   still gathering gold and said the law the law   then the great poet touched upon the lips   with a live coal from truths high altar raised   his arms to heaven and sang a song of doom   sang of the time to be when god should lean   indignant from the throne and lift his hand   and that foul city be no morea tale   a dream a desolation and a curse   no vestige of its glory should survive   in fact or memory its people dead   its site forgotten and its very name   disputed    was the prophecy fulfilled   the sullen disc of the declining sun   was crimson with a curse and a portent   and scarce his angry ray lit up the land   that lay below whose lurid gloom appeared   freaked with a moving mist which reeking up   from dim tarns hateful with a horrid ban   took shapes forbidden and without a name   gigantic nightbirds rising from the reeds   with cries discordant startled all the air   and bodiless voices babbled in the gloom   but not to me came any voice again   and covering my face with thin dead hands   i wept and woke and cried aloud to god       politics     that land full surely hastens to its end   where public sycophants in homage bend   the populace to flatter and repeat   the doubled echoes of its loud conceit   lowly their attitude but high their aim   they creep to eminence through paths of shame   till fixed securely in the seats of powr   the dupes they flattered they at last devour       poesy     successive bards pursue ambitions fire   that shines oblivion above thy mire   the latest mounts his predecessors trunk   and sinks his brother ere himself is sunk

    today    i cried amen he rose and ran     like oil away   i said ive seen an honest man           today       an alibi     a famous journalist who long   had told the great unheaded throng   whateer they thought by day or night   was true as holy writ and right   was caught inwell on second thought   it is enough that he was caught   and being thrown in jail became   the fuel of a public flame    vox populi vox dei said   the jailer inxling bent his head   without remark that motto good   in boldfaced type had always stood   above the columns where his pen   had rioted in praise of men   and all they saidprovided he   was sure they mostly did agree   meanwhile a sharp and bitter strife   to take or save the culprits life   or liberty which i suppose   was much the same to him arose   outside the journal that his pen   adorned denounced his crimebut then   its editor in secret tried   to have the indictment set aside   the opposition papers swore   his father was a rogue before   and all his wifes relations were   like him and similar to her   they begged their readers to subscribe   a dollar each to make a bribe   that any judge would feel was large   enough to prove the gravest charge   unless it might be the defense   put up superior evidence   the laws traditional delay   was all too short the trial day   dawned red and menacing the judge   sat on the bench and wouldnt budge   and all the motions counsel made   could not move himand there he stayed   the case must now proceed he said   while i am just in heart and head   it happensas indeed it ought   both sides with equal sums have bought   my favor i can try the cause   impartially prolonged applause    the prisoner was now arraigned   and said that he was greatly pained   to be suspectedhe whose pen   had charged so many other men   with crimes and misdemeanors why   he said a tear in either eye   if men who live by crying out   stop thief are not themselves from doubt   of their integrity exempt   let all forego the vain attempt   to make a reputation sir   im innocent and i demur   whereat a thousand voices cried   amain he manifestly lied   vox populi as loudly roared   as bull by picadores gored   in his own coin receiving pay   to make a spanish holiday    the jurytwelve good men and true   were then sworn in to see it through   and each made solemn oath that he   as any babe unborn was free   from prejudice opinion thought   respectability brainsaught   that could disqualify and some   explained that they were deaf and dumb   a better twelve his honor said   was rare except among the dead   the witnesses were called and sworn   the tales they told made angels mourn   and the good book theyd kissed became   red with the consciousness of shame    whenever one of them approached   the truth that witness wasnt coached   your honor cried the lawyers both   strike out his testimony quoth   the learned judge this court denies   its ear to stories which surprise   i hold that witnesses exempt   from coaching all are in contempt   both prosecution and defense   applauded the judicial sense   and the spectators all averred   such wisdom they had never heard   twas plain the prisoner would be   found guilty in the first degree   meanwhile that wights pale cheek confessed   the nameless terrors in his breast   he felt remorseful too because   he wasnt half they said he was   if id been such a rogue he mused   on opportunities unused   i might have easily become   as wealthy as methusalum   this journalist adorned alas   the middle not the bible class    with equal skill the lawyers pleas   attested their divided fees   each gave the other one the lie   then helped him frame a sharp reply    good lord it was a bitter fight   and lasted all the day and night   when once or oftener the roar   had silenced the judicial snore   the speaker suffered for the sport   by fining for contempt of court   twelve jurors noses good and true   unceasing sang the trial through   and even vox populi was spent   in rattles through a nasal vent   clerk bailiff constables and all   heard morpheus sound the trumpet call   to armshis armsand all fell in   save counsel for the man of sin   that thaumaturgist stood and swayed   the wand their faculties obeyed   that magic wand which like a flame   leapt wavered quivered and became   a wonderworkerknown among   the ignoble vulgar as a tongue    how long o lord how long my verse   runs on for better or for worse   in meter which oermasters me   octosyllabically free   a meter which the poets say   no power of restraint can stay   a hardmouthed meter suited well   to him who having naught to tell   must hold attention as a trout   is held by paying out and out   the slender line which else would break   should one attempt the fish to take   thus tavern guides whove naught to show   but some adjacent curio   by devious trails their patrons lead   and make them think t is far indeed   where was i            while the lawyer talked   the rogue took up his feet and walked   while all about him roaring slept   into the street he calmly stepped   in very truth the man who thought   the peoples voice from heaven had caught   gods inspiration took a change   of venueit was passing strange   straight to his editor he went   and that ingenious person sent   a negro to impersonate   the fugitive in adequate   disguise he took his vacant place   and buried in his arms his face   when all was done the lawyer stopped   and silence like a bombshell dropped   upon the court judge jury all   within that venerable hall   except the deaf and dumb indeed   and one or two whom death had freed   awoke and tried to look as though   slumber was all they did not know    and now that tireless lawyerman   took breath and then again began   your honor if you did attend   to what ive urged my learned friend   nodded concurrence to support   the motion i have made this court   may soon adjourn with your assent   ive shown abundant precedent   for introducing now though late   new evidence to exculpate   my client so if youll allow   ill prove an alibi whathow   stammered the judge well yes i cant

get so truly drunk that men   stood by to marvel at him when   his slow advance along the street   was but a vain cycloidal feat    and when twas fated that he fall   with a wide geographical sprawl   they signified assent by sounds   heard faintly at its utmost bounds    and yet this mr shanahan   who was a most ingenious man   cast not on wine his thirsty eyes   when it was red or otherwise    all malt or spirituous tope   he loathed as cats dissent from soap   and cider if it touched his lip   evoked a groan at every sip    but still as heretofore explained   he not infrequently was

 the only kind he used was blood    alas that an immortal soul   addicted to the flowing bowl   the emptied flagon should again   replenish from a neighbors vein    but mr shanahan was so   constructed and his taste that low   nor more deplorable was he   in kind of thirst than in degree    for sometimes fifty souls would pay   the debt of nature in a day   to free him from the shame and pain   of dread sobrietys misreign    his native land proud of its sense   of his unique inabstinence   abated something of its pride   at thought of his unfilled inside    and some the boldness had to say   twere well if he were called away   to slake his thirst forevermore   in oceans of celestial gore    but hans pietro shanahan   who was a most ingenious man   knew that his thirst was mortal so   remained unsainted here below    unsainted and unsaintly for   he neither went to glory nor   to abdicate his power deigned   where under providence he reigned    but kept his bosss power accurst   to serve his wild uncommon thirst   which now had grown so truly great   it was a drain upon the state    soon soon there came a time alas   when he turned down an empty glass   all practicable means were vain   his special wassail to obtain    in vain poor decimation tried   to furnish forth the needful tide   and civil war as vainly shed   her niggard offering of red    poor shanahan his thirst increased   until he wished himself deceased   invoked the firearm and the knife   but could not die to save his life    he was so dry his own veins made   no answer to the seeking blade   so parched that when he would have passed   away he could not breathe his last    twas then when almost in despair   unlaced his shoon unkempt his hair   he saw as in a dream a way   to wet afresh his

been heard the word protection    t was my sole island there i dwelt alone     no customshouse collector nor collection   but a man came who in a pious tone   condoled with me that i had never known     the manifest advantage of protection    so when the tradingboat arrived one day     he threw a stinkpot into its midsection   the traders paddled for their lives away   nor came again into that

and a verdict found     the jury with great humanity   acquitted the prisoner on the ground     of extemporary insanity       mr finks debating donkey     of a person known as peters i will humbly crave your leave   an unusual adventure into narrative to weave   mr william perry peters of the town of muscatel   a public educator and an orator as well   mr peters had a weakness which tis painful to relate   was a strong predisposition to the pleasures of debate   he would foster disputation wheresoever he might be   in polygonal contention none so happy was as he   twas observable however that the exercises ran   into monologue by peters that rhetorical young man   and the muscatelian rustics who assisted at the show   by involuntary silence testified their overthrow   mr peters all unheedful of their silence and their grief   still effacing every vestige of erroneous belief   o he was a sore affliction to all heretics so bold   as to entertain opinions that he didnt care to hold    one dayt was in pursuance of a pedagogic plan   for the mental elevation of uncultivated man   mr peters to his pupils in dismissing them explained   that the friday evening following unless indeed it rained   would be signalized by holding in the schoolhouse a debate   free to all who their opinions might desire to ventilate   on the question which is better as a serviceable gift   speech or hearing from barbarity the human mind to lift   the pupils told their fathers who forehanded always met   at the barroom to discuss it every evening dry or wet   they argued it and argued it and spat upon the stove   and the noncommittal barkeep on their differences throve   and i state it as a maxim in a loosish kind of way   youll have the more to back your word the less you have to say   public interest was lively but one ebenezer fink   of the rancho del jackrabbit only seemed to sit and think    on the memorable evening all the men of muscatel   came to listen to the logic and the eloquence as well   all but william perry peters whose attendance there i fear   was to wreak his ready rhetoric upon the public ear   and prove whichever side he took that hearing wouldnt lift   the human mind as ably as the other greater gift   the judges being chosen and the disputants enrolled   the question he proceeded in extenso to unfold   resolvedthe sense of hearing lifts the mind up out of reach   of the fogs of error better than the faculty of speech   this simple proposition he expounded word by word   until they best understood it who least perfectly had heard   even the judges comprehended as he ventured to explain   the impact of a spitball admonishing in vain   beginning at a period before creations morn   he had reached the bounds of tolerance and adam yet unborn   as down the early centuries of prehistoric time   he tracked important principles and quoted striking rhyme   and whisky bill prosaic soul proclaiming him a jay   had risen and like an earthquake reeled unheededly away   and a late lamented cat when opportunity should serve   was preparing to embark upon her parabolic curve   a noise arose outsidethe door was opened with a bang   and old ebenezer fink was heard ejaculating glang   straight into that assembly gravely marched without a wink   an ancient assthe property it was of mr fink   its ears depressed and beating time to its infestive tread   silent through silence moved amain that stately quadruped   it stopped before the orator and in the lamplight thrown   upon its tail they saw that member weighted with a stone   then spake old ebenezer gents i heern o this debate   on wether vice or years is best the mind to elevate   now yers a bird ken throw some light uponto that tough theme   he has em both im free to say oncommonly extreme   he want invited for to speak but he will not refuse   if tother gentleman ken wait to exposay his views    ere merriment or anger oer amazement could prevail   he cut the string that held the stone on that canarys tail   freed from the weight that member made a gesture of delight   then rose until its rigid length was horizontal quite   with lifted head and level ears along his withers laid   jack sighed refilled his lungs and thento put it mildlybrayed   he brayed until the stones were stirred in circumjacent hills   and sleeping women rose and fled in divers kinds of frills   t is said that awful bugleblastto make the story brief   wafted william perry peters through the window like a leaf    such is the tale if anything additional occurred   tis not set down though truly i remember to have heard   that a gentleman named peters now residing at soquel   a considerable distance from the town of muscatel   is opposed to education and to rhetoric as well       to my laundress     saponacea wert thou not so fair     id curse thee for thy multitude of sins     for sending home my clothes all full of pins   a shirt occasionally thats a snare   and a delusion got the lord knows where   the lord knows whya sock whose outs and ins     none know nor where it ends nor where begins   and fewer cuffs than ought to be my share   but when i mark thy lilies how they grow     and the red roses of thy ripening charms       i bless the lovelight in thy dark eyes dreaming   ill never pay thee but id gladly go     into the magic circle of thine arms       supple and fragrant from repeated steaming       fame     one thousand years i slept beneath the sod     my sleep in 1901 beginning   then by the action of some scurvy god     who happened then to recollect my sinning     i was revived and given another inning   on breaking from my grave i saw a crowd     a formless multitude of men and women   gathered about a ruin clamors loud     i heard and curses deep enough to swim in     and pointing at me one said lets put him in   then each turned on me with an evil look   as in my ragged shroud i stood and shook    nay good posterity i cried forbear     if thats a jail i fain would be remaining   outside for truly i should little care     to catch my death of cold im just regaining     the life lost long ago by my disdaining   to take precautions against draughts like those     that haply penetrate that cracked and splitting   old structure then an aged wight arose     from a chair of state in which he had been sitting     and with preliminary coughing spitting   and wheezing said t is not a jail were sure   whateer it may have been when it was newer    t was found two centuries ago oergrown     with brush and ivy all undoored ungated   and in restoring it we found a stone     set here and there in the dilapidated     and crumbling frieze inscribed in antiquated   big characters with certain uncouth names     which we conclude were borne of old by awful   rapscallions guilty of all sinful games     vagrants engaged in purposes unlawful     and orators less sensible than jawful   so each ten years we add to the long row   a name the most unworthy that we know    but why i asked put me in he replied     you look itand the judgment pained me greatly   right gladly would i then and there have died     but that id risen from the grave so lately     but on examining that solemn stately   old ruin i remarked my friend you err     the truth of this is just what i expected   this building in its time made quite a stir     i lived was famous too when t was erected     the names here first inscribed were much respected   this is the hall of fame or im a stork   and this goat pasture once was called new york       omnes vanitas

jester     once on a time so ancient poets sing   there reigned in godknowswhere a certain king   so great a monarch neer before was seen   he was a hero even to his queen   in whose respect he held so high a place   that none was highernay not even the ace   he was so just his parliament declared   those subjects happy whom his laws had spared   so wise that none of the debating throng   had ever lived to prove him in the wrong   so good that crime his anger never feared   and beauty boldly plucked him by the beard   so brave that if his army got a beating   none dared to face him when he was retreating   this monarch kept a fool to make his mirth   and loved him tenderly despite his worth   prompted by what caprice i cannot say   he called the fool before the throne one day   and to that jester seriously said   ill abdicate and you shall reign instead   while i attired in motley will make sport   to entertain your majesty and court    t was done and the fool governed he decreed   the time of harvest and the time of seed   ordered the rains and made the weather clear   and had a famine every second year   altered the calendar to suit his freak   ordaining six whole holidays a week   religious creeds and sacred books prepared   made war when angry and made peace when scared   new taxes he inspired new laws he made   drowned those who broke them who observed them flayed   in short he ruled so well that all whod not   been starved decapitated hanged or shot   made the whole country with his praises ring   declaring he was every inch a king   and the high priest averred t was very odd   if one so competent were not a god    meantime his master now in motley clad   wore such a visage woeful wan and sad   that some condoled with him as with a brother   who having lost a wife had got another   others mistaking his profession often   approached him to be measured for a coffin   for years this highborn jester never broke   the silencehe was pondering a joke   at last one day in capandbells arrayed   he strode into the council and displayed   a long bright smile that glittered in the gloom   like a gilt epithet within a tomb   posing his bauble like a leaders staff   to give the signal when and why to laugh   he brought it down with peremptory stroke   and simultaneously cracked his joke    i cant repeat it friends i neer could school   myself to quote from any other fool   a jest if it were worse than mine would start   my tears if better it would break my heart   so if you please ill hold you but to state   that royal jesters melancholy fate    the insulted nation so the story goes   rose as one manthe very dead arose   springing indignant from the riven tomb   and babes unborn leapt swearing from the womb   all to the council chamber clamoring went   by rage distracted and on vengeance bent   in that vast hall in due disorder laid   the tools of legislation were displayed   and the wild populace its wrath to sate   seized them and heaved them at the jesters pate   mountains of writing paper pools and seas   of ink awaiting to become decrees   royal approvaland the same in stacks   lay ready for attachment backed with wax   pens to make laws erasers to amend them   with mucilage convenient to extend them   scissors for limiting their application   and acids to repeal all legislation   these flung as missiles till the air was dense   were most offensive weapons of offense   and by their aid the fool was nigh destroyed   they neer had been so harmlessly employed   whelmed underneath a load of legal cap   his mouth egurgitating ink on tap   his eyelids mucilaginously sealed   his fertile head by scissors made to yield   abundant harvestage of ears his pelt   in every wrinkle and on every welt   quickset with

in anothers arms     said a grecian swain with his blood aboil   and he kissed you fair as he held you there     a willing bird in a serpents coil    the maid looked up from the cinctured cup     wherein she was crushing the berries red   pain and surprise in her honest eyes     it was only one o those gods she said       presentiment     with saintly grace and reverent tread     she walked among the graves with me     her every footfall seemed to be   a benediction on the dead    the guardian spirit of the place     she seemed and i some ghost forlorn     surprised in the untimely morn   she made with her resplendent face    moved by some waywardness of will     three paces from the path apart     she stepped and stoodmy prescient heart   was stricken with a passing chill    the folklore of the years agone     remembering i smiled and thought     who shudders suddenly at naught   his grave is being trod upon    but now i know that it was more     than idle fancy o my sweet     i did not think such little feet   could make a buried heart so sore       a study in gray     i step from the door with a shiver     this fog is uncommonly cold   and ask myself what did i give her     the maiden a trifle goneold     with the head of gray hair that was gold    ah well i suppose twas a dollar     and doubtless the change is correct   though its odd that it seems so much smaller     than what id a right to expect     but you pay when you dine i reflect    so i walk up the streettwas a saunter     a score of years back when i strolled   from this door and our talk was all banter     those days when her hair was of gold     and the seafog less searching and cold    i button my coat for im shaken     and fevered a trifle and flushed   with the wine that i ought to have taken     time was at this coat id have blushed     though truly tis cleverly brushed    a score why that isnt so very     much time to have lost from a life   theres reason enough to be merry     ive not fallen down in the strife     but marched with the drum and the fife    if hope when she lured me and beckoned     had pushed at my shoulders instead   and fame on whose favors i reckoned     had laureled the worthiest head     i could garland the years that are dead    believe me ive held my own mostly     through all of this wild masquerade   but somehow the fog is more ghostly     tonight and the skies are more grayed     like the locks of the restaurant maid    if ever id fainted and faltered     id fancy this did but appear   but the climate im certain has altered     grown colder and more austere     than it was in that earlier year    the lights too are strangely unsteady     that lead from the street to the quay   i think theyll go outand im ready     to follow out there in

the land   and ive often heard it stated that her fingering was such   that professor schweinenhauer was enchanted with her touch   and that beasts were so affected when her apparatus rang   that they dropped upon their haunches and deliriously sang   this i know from testimony though a critic i opine   needs an ear that is dissimilar in some respects to mine   she could sing too like a jaybird and they say all eyes were wet   when sally and the ranchdog were performing a duet   which i take it is a song that has to be so loudly sung   as to overtax the strength of any single human lung   that at least would seem to follow from the tale i have to tell   which ive told you how she flourished is how sally larkin fell    one day there came to visit sallys dad as sleek and smart   a chap as ever wandered there from any foreign part   though his gentle birth and breeding he did not at all obtrude   it was somehow whispered round he was a simonpure dude   howsoeer that may have been it was conspicuous to see   that he was a real gent of an uncommon high degree   that sally cast her tender and affectionate regards   on this exquisite creation was of course upon the cards   but he didnt seem to notice and was variously blind   to her many charms of person and the merits of her mind   and preferred i grieve to say it to play poker with her dad   and acted in a manner that in general was bad    one eveningtwas in summershe was holding in her lap   her accordion and near her stood that melancholy chap   leaning up against a pillar with his lip in grog imbrued   thinking maybe of that ancient land in which he was a dude    then sally who was melancholy too began to hum   and elongate the accordion with a preluding thumb   then sighs of amorosity from sally l exhaled   and her music apparatus sympathetically wailed   in the gloaming o my darling rose that wild impassioned strain   and her eyes were fixed on his with an intensity of pain   till the ranchdog from his kennel at the postern gate came round   and going into session strove to magnify the sound   he lifted up his spirit till the gloaming rang and rang   with the song that to his darling he impetuously sang   then that musing youth recalling all his soul from other scenes   where his fathers all were dudes and his mothers all dudines   from his lips removed the beaker and politely oer the grog   said miss

translation of this famous medieval hymn together with some researches into its history which i happened to be making at the time induces me to undertake a translation myself it may seem presumption in me to attempt that which so many eminent scholars of so many generations have attempted before me but the conspicuous failure of others encourages me to hope that success being still unachieved is still achievable the fault of previous translations from lord macaulays to that of gen dix has been i venture to think a too strict literalness whereby the delicate irony and subtle humor of the immortal poemthough doubtless these admirable qualities were well appreciated by the translatorshave been utterly sacrificed in the result in none of the english versions that i have examined is more than a trace of the mocking spirit of insincerity pervading the whole prayerthe cool effrontery of the suppliant in enumerating his demerits his serenely illogical demands of salvation in spite or rather because of them his meek submission to the punishment of others and the many similarly pleasing characteristics of this amusing work being most imperfectly conveyed by permitting myself a reasonable freedom of renderingin many cases boldly supplying that missing link between the sublime and the ridiculous which the author writing for the acute monkish apprehension of the 13th century

church the verses have become inseparably wedded that inspired gen dix seeking rather to surmount the obstacles to success by honest effort than to avoid them by the adoption of an easier
