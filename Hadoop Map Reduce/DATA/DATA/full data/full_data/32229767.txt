lisle goes to england         343       the long portage  chapter i  the gladwyne expedition   vernon lisle was fishing with a determination that did not spring altogether from love of the sport the water of the british columbian river in which he stood kneedeep was icy cold his rubber boots were badly ripped and leaky and he was wet with the drizzle that drove down the lonely valley it was difficult to reach the slack behind a boulder some distance outshore and the arm he strained at every cast ached from hours of assiduous labor but there was another ache in his left side which was the result of insufficient food and though the fish were shy he persevered  a few hundred yards away the stream came roaring down a long declivity in a mad white rapid and then shot across the glassy green surface of the pool below in a raisedup wedge of foam wet boulders and outcropping fangs of rock hemmed in the water and among them lay stranded logs and streampacked masses of whitened branches farther back ragged cypresses and cedars half obscured by the drifting haze of spray climbed the sides of the gorge and beyond rose the dim rounded summits of treeless hills there were streaks of snow on some of them for winter threatened to close in unusually early  with a lowering sky overhead and the daylight beginning to fade it was a desolate picture one into which the lonely figure of the man in tattered deerskin jacket and shapeless hat somehow fitted his attire matched the graywhite coloring of rock and boulder his spare form and agile movements together with the intentness of his bronzed face and the steadiness of his eyes hinted at the quickness of observation the stubborn endurance and the tireless activity by which alone life can be maintained in the savage north he had the alertness of the wild creatures of the waste and it was needed  all round him stretched a forbidding wilderness part of the great desolation which runs north from the warmer and more hospitable thickforest belt of british columbia indeed this wilderness broken by the more level spaces between the rockies and lake winnipeg runs right across canada from labrador to the pacific on the northern edge of the heavytimber line it contains little human lifea few hudson bay furtraders and the halfbreed trappers who deal with themand it is frozen for eight months in the year there are only two practicable means of traversing itwith dog sledges on the snow or by canoe on the lakes and rivers in the brief summer  the water routes are difficult in british columbia but lisle and his two companions had chosen to go by canoe partly because the question of food is vitally important to men cut off from all source of supply except game and even that is scarce in places to transport upon ones back any weight of provisions besides tents blankets and other necessaries through a rugged country is an almost impossible task the men accordingly after relaying part of their stores had secured an indian craft and had paddled and poled her laboriously across lakes and up rivers now when their provisions were running short they were confronted with a difficult portage round a thundering rapid  at length lisle securing another trout waded ashore and glanced with a rueful smile at the dozen this one made they scarcely averaged half a pound and he had spent most of a day that could badly be spared in catching them plodding back along the shingle with his load he reached a little level strip beneath a scarp of rock where a fire blazed among the boulders a tent stood beneath two or three small windstunted spruces and a ragged man in long riverboots lay resting on one elbow near the blaze regardless of the drizzle he was a few years over thirty lisles age and he differed from lisle in that something in his appearance suggested that he was not at home in the wilds as a matter of fact nasmyth was an adventurous english sportsmanwhich describes him fairly in person and character  not many he commented glancing at the trout lisle laid down theyll hardly carry us over tomorrow and i only got a couple from the canoe with the troll weve gained nothing by stopping here and times precious  a sure thing lisle agreed beginning to clean the trout well tackle the portage as soon as its light tomorrow wheres jake  gone off to look for a deer was the answer said he wouldnt come back without one if he camped on the range all night  lisle made no comment but went on dexterously with his work while nasmyth watched him with halfamused admiration  youre handy at that and at everything else you do nasmyth remarked at length in fact you easily beat jake though hes a professional packer and so to speak to the manner born  so am i said lisle  it was growing dark but the coppery glow of the fire fell upon his face emphasizing the strong coloring of his weatherdarkened skin on the whole it was a prepossessing face clearly cutindeed it was a trifle thinwith a hint of quiet determination in the clear gray eyes and firm mouth he looked capable of resolute action and when it was needed of spartan selfdenial there was no suggestion of anything sensual or even of much regard for bodily comfort  if you dont mind my being a little personal id better own that i suspected the fact you mention and it puzzled me nasmyth replied you see when i first met you at the empress hotel in victoria you were dressed and talked like the usual prosperous business man trafford who introduced us said that you had a good deal of money in some of the yukon mines  trafford was quite right the point is that i took a part in locating two of the claims before that i followed a good many rough occupations mostly in the bush my prosperitys recent  nasmyth still looked curious and lisle smiled  i can guess your thoughtsi dont speak altogether like a bushman well my father was an englishman and my mother a lady of education from montreal that was why at the cost of some selfdenial on their part i was sent east to school  it was an incomplete explanation he had inherited the englishmans reticence which forbade him to point out that his father sprang from an old family of standing and had for some reason which his son had never learned quarreled bitterly with his english relatives coming to canada he had married and taken up the bush life on a small and unremunerative ranch where he had died and left his widow and his son badly provided for  thank you responded nasmyth and lisle supposed it was in recognition of the fact that he would hardly have furnished even those few particulars to one whom he regarded as a stranger to reciprocate a few words will make clear all there is to know about me english public school oxford afterwarddidnt take a degree spend most of my time in the country though i make a few sporting trips abroad when i can afford it and have nothing better to do that partly explains this journey but i havent tried to force your confidence nor offered you mine altogether casually  so i supposed returned lisle it strikes me that since we got near the gladwyne expeditions line of march we have both felt that some explanation is needed to go back a little when i met you in victoria and you offered to join me in the trip i agreed partly because i wanted an intelligent companion but i had another reason at first i supposed you wished to go because a journey through a rough and littleknown country seems to appeal to one kind of englishman but i changed my mind when you showed your anxiety to get upon the gladwyne partys trail  you were right i knew the gladwynes in england the one who died was an old and valued friend of mine i could give you the history of their march though i hardly think thats needful you seem remarkably well acquainted with it  lisles face hardened with the exception of one man he knew more than anybody else about the fatal journey a party of four had made a year earlier through the region he and nasmyth were approaching  i am he said theres a cause for it but ill ask you to tell me what you know  he threw more branches on the fire and a crackling blaze sprang aloft forcing up the ragged spruce boughs out of the surrounding gloom  this is the survivors narrative i heard it from his own lips more than once began nasmyth i dare say most of its a kind of story thats not unusual in the north  its one that has been repeated with local variations over and over again but go on  there were two gladwynescousins george the elder of the two was a man of means and position clarence the younger had practically nothingtwo or three hundred pounds a year they were both sportsmengeorge was a bit of a naturalistand they made the expedition with the idea of studying the scarcer game well their provisions were insufficient an indian packer deserted them they were delayed here and there and when they reached the river that we are making for they were badly worn out and winter was closing in knowing it was dangerous to go any farther they started downstream to strike their outgoing trail but not long afterward they wrecked their canoe in a rapid and lost everything except a few pounds of provisions to make things worse george had fallen from a slippery rock at the last portage and badly hurt his leg after making a few leagues with difficulty he found he could go no farther and they held a council they were already suffering from want of food but their guide estimated that by a forced march overland they might reach a place where some skinhunters were supposed to be camped there was a hudson bay post farther away on coming up they had cached some provisions in two places on opposite sides of the riverthey kept crossing to pole through the easiest slack george accordingly insisted that the others go on each was to follow a different bank and the first to find the provisions was to try to communicate with the other and hurry back with food if they were unable to locate the caches they were to leave the river and push on in search of help they agreed but deep snow had fallen and clarence gladwyne failed to find the cache he reached the hunters camp famishing and they went back with him he found his cousin dead  and the guide  its rather an ugly story you must have heard it  i havent heard the one gladwyne told in england  the guide reached the hudson bay posta longer journey than the one gladwyne madein the last stage of exhaustion he had taken very little food with himgladwyne knew exactly how muchand the hudson bay agent decided that it was impossible he could have covered the distance on the minute quantity there was only one inference  that he had found the cache lisles face grew very stern  nasmyth nodded  in a way there was some slight excuse for him think of ita wornout famishing man without blankets or means of making a fire who had struggled over icy rocks and through leagues of snow finding a few cans of provisions and a little moldy flour even when he had satisfied his hunger he was no doubt unequal to making the return journey to rejoin a man who was probably already dead  if that man had found a scrap of food he would have tried  lisles voice had a curious ring in it and nasmyth looked at him hard  you seem convinced  i am i knew him well  nasmyth was startled and he showed it but afterward he looked thoughtful  i believe i understand he said  for a minute or two there was silence which was broken only by the snapping of the branches on the fire and the hollow roar of the rapid the latter had a curious irritating effect on nasmyth who hitherto had scarcely noticed the insistent pulsatory clamor at length lisle spoke again laying a strong restraint upon himself  our mutual friend called me lisle at the empress hotel i dont think he mentioned my first name vernon and as that was the name of gladwynes guide i kept it in the background i was anxious to take you with me i wanted an englishman of some standing in the old country whose word would be believed what was more i wanted an honest man who would form an unbiased opinion i didnt know then that you were a friend of gladwynes  nasmyth made a slight gesture which suggested the acknowledgment of a compliment  ill try to be justits sometimes hard his voice had a throb of pain in it as he went on i was the friend of george gladwynethe one who perished i had a strong regard for him  something in his expression hinted that this regard had not been shared by the gladwyne who survived  when my father first came out to british columbia new to the bush ways lisle resumed a neighbor vernon was of great help to himlent him teams taught him how to chop and what cattle to raise he died before my father and i was named for him but he left a son older than i who grew up like himi believe he was the finest chopper and trailer i have ever come across he died as you have heard from exposure and exhaustion a few days after he reached the hudson bay postbefore he could clear himself  lisle broke off for a moment and seemed to have some difficulty in continuing  when my father died vernon took charge of the ranch at my mothers requesti was rather young and she meant to launch me in some profession vernon had no ambitionhe loved the bushand he tried to give me enough to finish my education while he ran both ranches with a hired man i think my mother never suspected that he handed her over more than she was entitled to but i found it out and ive been glad ever since that i firmly prevented his continuing the sacrifice for all that i owe him in many ways more than i could ever have repaid he clenched one hand tight as he concluded i can at least clear his memory  nasmyth nodded in sympathy  you called me an honest man you have my wordill see the right done  quietly as it was spoken lisle recognized that it was no light thing his companion promised him in the dominion caste stands by caste and lisle having seen and studied other englishmen of his friends description knew that the feeling was stronger in the older country to expose a man of ones own circle to the contempt and condemnation of outsiders is in any walk of life a strangely repugnant thing  well he said tomorrow well pull out and portage across the divide to strike the gladwynes trail and now ill fry the trout and well have supper  they let the subject drop by tacit agreement during the meal and soon after it was over a shout from the crest of the ridge above followed by a smashing of underbrush announced that their packer was making for the camp lisle answered and a cry came down  got a deer and there are duck on the lake ahead well try for some as we go up  nasmyths smile betokened deep satisfaction  thats a weight off my mind he declared ill smoke one pipe and then i think ill go to sleep well make a start with the first loads as soon as its light enough     chapter ii  the divide   dawn was late the next morning the light crept slowly through bitter rain and when lisle and his companions had breakfasted sumptuously for the first time during several days it was with reluctance that they broke camp indeed nasmyth would have suggested remaining under shelter only that he had come to accept lisles decision as final and the latter was eager to push on the blacktail deer would not last them long the trout were getting shyer every day with the increasing cold they were a long distance from the nearest settlement while winter was rapidly coming on  nasmyth shouldered his load with the others and they set out across a strip of gravel strewn with boulders here and there networks of stranded branches had to be floundered through and the ragged ends rasped their dilapidated boots and bruised their legs then where the bluff rose almost precipitously from the water they crept along slippery ledges or waded through the shallower pools with the white rapid roaring down a few yards outshore of them there were places where a slip would have meant destruction but that was nothing unusual and time was too precious to spend in an attempt to climb the ridge which hemmed them in  the packstraps hurt nasmyths shouldersone of them had been rubbed raw by previous loads and it smarted painfully until he grew warm with exertion he was soon wet through in places the spray drove into his face so that he could hardly see but he held on with dogged determination trying to keep up with the others with the exception of a few hunting trips his life had been smooth and now dressed mostly in rags and aching in every limb he smiled grimly as he remembered how he had hitherto taken his pleasure when he had shot partridges he had as a rule been driven to such stubble or turnip fields as lay at any distance from his residence and he had usually been provided with a pony when he ascended the high moors in search of grouse money smoothed out many small difficulties in the older land but it was powerless in the wilds of the new one where one must depend on such things as native courage brute strength and the capacity for dogged endurance which are common to all ranks of men it was fortunate for nasmyth that he possessed them but that as he was discovering is not quite enough they are great gifts in the raw but like most others they need exercise and assiduous cultivation for their full development  on reaching the head of the rapid they went back for another load and afterward jake got into the canoe while lisle fixed the end of the trackingline about his shoulders aided by the line the packer swung the canoe across madly whirling eddies and in and out among foamlapped rocks and now and then drove her half hidden by the leaping froth up some tumultuous rush at times lisle wading waistdeep and dragged almost off his feet barely held her stationarynasmyth could see his chest heave and his face grow darkly flushedbut in another instant they were going on again that a craft could be propelled up any part of the rapid would nasmyth thought have appeared absolutely incredible to any one who had not seen it done  at last however the task became too hard for them and after dragging her out they carried her upside down in turn it was difficult for them to see where they were going and the craft made from a hollowed log was by no means so well fitted for the work as the bark or canvas canoe of the more eastern wilds she was comparatively heavy and their heads and shoulders were inside of her once or twice the portager fell and the fall is an awkward one as it is impossible to break it with ones hands which are occupied in holding the canoe still they made progress and launching again above the rapid they reached a lake at noon by hard paddling here they landed and nasmyth dropped down upon a boulder to look about him  it was a cheerless prospect he saw through the haze of rain back into the distance ran a stretch of slategray water flecked and seamed by the white tops of little splashing waves for a nipping wind blew down the lake on either side rose low hills dotted here and there with somber and curiously rigid trees they were not large and though from a distance they looked much the same nasmyth recognized some as spruce and supposed the other ragged spires to be cedars in one spot there were some that resembled english larch and these were almost bare  then his companions began to discuss the best means of further progress with a fresh breeze ahead jake advocated poling through the shallows near the beach and lisle with a courtesy which nasmyth had already noticed turned toward him when he answered as if his opinion might be valuable  the trouble is that the beach sweeps back off the straight wed drive her right up the middle to headwater with the paddle before wed make twothirds of the way poling alongshore  it would be a good deal harder work wouldnt it nasmyth ventured and laughed when he saw lisles faint amusement i suppose that doesnt count its not worth mentioning he added since youre anxious to get on whats the use of stopping for dinner after the breakfast i had i can hold out some time  i want to get through as quickly as i can thats why im not going to rush you unless its necessary lisle answered try to get hold of the fact that a man needs food regularly to keep him in efficient going order  indisputable nasmyth agreed but he can do without it and work for a while weve proved it  not without paying lisle pointed out you can draw upon your reserves but it takes time and rest to make them good we may need all ours badly before were through  there was a grim hint in his last words which nasmyth found convincing and when he had rested he helped to prepare the meal it was a simple onecold doughy cakes baked in a fryingpan extraordinarily tough and stringy venison with a pintcan each of strong green tea their sugar had long ago melted and the condensed milk was exhausted  afterward they shoved the canoe out and paddled doggedly into the driving rain and the strong headwind the spray from the splashing bows blew into their faces and the broken water checked them badly nasmyths hands began to blister to make it worse there was a raw wound on one of them the result of a similar days toil and his knees chafed sore against the branches in the crafts bottom there was however no respitethe moment they slackened their exertions they would drift to leeand he held on keeping awkward stroke with jake while lisle swung the balancing paddle astern  they kept it up for several hours and then toward evening the rain ceased and the clouds rolled aside a wonderful yellow light shone behind the bordering hills and the twisted windbattered cedars on their crests stood out against it in hard fretted tracery the wind dropped the short white waves smoothed down the water heaving gently gleamed with a coppery glare and the paddle blades seemed to splash up liquid fire then the shores closed in ahead and landing on a shingle beach they made camp in the mouth of a gap among the hills supper was prepared and eaten and afterward jake took up his rifle  i saw some ducks in the next bay he explained  he strolled out of camp and nasmyth smiled at lisle  except when he advised you to pole thats about all he has said today  this was correct the packer was a taciturn inhabitant of the wilds who seldom indulged in an unnecessary remark there was however no moroseness about him the man was goodhumored in his quiet way and his usual ruminative calm was no deterrent from apparently tireless action for the most part he lived alone in the impressive stillness of the bush where he had a few acres of partly cleared land which failed to provide him with a living for that reason he periodically left his tiny log house and packed for some survey expedition or went down to work for a few months at a sawmill capable of most determined labor wonderfully proficient with his hands he asked no more from life than a little plain food and indifferent shelter no luxury that civilization could offer would have tempted him to desert the wilds  lisle filled his pipe with leisurely content he shared jakes love for the wilderness and he found it strangely pleasant to rest in camp after a days persistent toil besides he usually enjoyed his evening chat with nasmyth for widely different as their training and mode of life had been they had much in common then too there was something in the prospect spread out before them that impelled tranquillity the clump of wet cedars among which they had camped distilled a clean aromatic smell and there was a freshness in the cool evening air that reinvigorated their tired bodies above the low hilltops the sky glimmered with saffron and transcendental green and half the lake shone in ethereal splendor the other half was dim and bordered with the sharplycut shadows of the trees except for the lap of water upon the pebbles and the wild cry of a loon that rang like a peal of unearthly laughter out of a darkening bay there was nothing to break the deep stillness of the waste  lisle pointed to the gap in the hills which was filling with thin white mist  thats the last big portage the gladwynes made he remarked they came in by a creek to the west and they were badly played out when they struck this divide the struggle to get through broke them up he paused before he added what kind of men were they  george wasnt effusive he was the kind of man you like better the longer you know him if i were told that he ever did a mean thing i wouldnt believe it his last actionsending the others onwas characteristic  they didnt want to go lisle interposed quietly  his companion nodded  i believe thats true i like to think so  there was something curious in his tone which lisle noticed  from the beginning nasmyth went on george behaved very generously to clarence  it was clarence that i meant to ask about more particularly  nasmyth looked thoughtful and when he answered it struck lisle that he was making an effort to give an unbiased opinion  clarence he said is more likable when you first meet him than george used to be a handsome man who knows how to say the right thing makes friends readily but somehow he never keeps the best of them hes one of the people who seem able to get whatever they want without having to struggle for it and who rarely land in any difficulty  again a grudging note became apparent as though the speaker were trying to subdue faint suspicion or disapproval and lisle changed the subject  had george gladwyne any immediate relatives  one sister as like him as its possible for a woman to be he wasnt greatly given to society i dont think hed ever have married his death was a crushing blow to the girlthey were wonderfully attached to each otherbut ive never seen a finer display of courage than hers when clarence cabled the news  he broke off as if he felt that he had been talking with too much freedom and just then the report of a rifle came ringing across the water  thats a ducks head shot off jake doesnt miss he said  lisle nodded he could take a hint and he had no doubt that nasmyth was right regarding the shot though it is not easy to decapitate a swimming duck with a rifle he began to talk about the portage and soon after jake returned with a single duck they went to sleep  it was clear and bright the next morning and they spent the day carrying their loads a few miles up the hollow which pierced the height of the divide part of it was a morass fissured with little creeks running down from the hills whose tops rose at no great elevation above the opening this was bad to traverse but it was worse when they came to a muskeg where dwarf forest had once covered what was now a swamp most of the trees had fallen as the soil from some change in the lakes level had grown too wet they had partly rotted in the slough and willows had afterward grown up among them  now and then the men laid down their loads and hewed a few of the still standing trunks letting them fall to serve as rude bridges where the morass was almost impassable but the real struggle began when they went back for the canoe at first they managed to carry her on their shoulders wading in the bog but afterward she must be dragged through or over innumerable tangles of small fallen trunks and networks of rotten branches that had to be laboriously smashed it was heroic laborsometimes they spent an hour making sixty yardsand lisles face grew anxious as well as determined game had been very scarce the deer would not last them long and disastrous results might follow a continuance of their present slow progress when utterly worn out they made camp on slightly firmer ground toward four oclock in the afternoon lisle strode off heavily toward the bordering hills while jake pushed on to prospect ahead nasmyth who was quite unable to accompany either prepared the supper and awaited their reports with some anxiety  lisle came back first and shook his head when nasmyth asked if he had found a better route on higher ground  not a slope we could haul along he reported that ways impracticable  it was nearly dark when jake came in  its not too bad ahead he informed them  they were not greatly reassured because jakes idea of what was really bad was alarming nasmyth glanced at his companion with a smile  is it any better than this he asked  a little answered jake an old trail runs in  gladwynes trail exclaimed nasmyth the one were looking for  why yes drawled jake as if it were scarcely worth mentioning i guess it is  nasmyth turned to lisle  i was lucky when i lighted on you as a companion for this trip you have been right in your predictions all along and now youre only out in striking the trail a day before you expected  i know the bush returned lisle its been pretty easy so farbut for several reasons i wish the next week or two were over  nasmyth looked troubled one could have imagined that misgivings which did not concern his personal safety were creeping into his mind  so do i he confessed and turning toward the fire he busied himself with jakes supper  there was no change in the work the next morning but in the afternoon it became evident that another party had made that portage ahead of them the soil was a little drier and where the small trees grew more thickly they could see that a passage had been laboriously cleared in the swampy hollows which still occurred trunks had here and there been flung into the ooze this saved them some trouble and they made better progress but both lisle and nasmyth became silent and grave as the signs of their predecessors march grew plainer by nightfall they had reached the second campingplace which told an eloquent story of struggle with fatigue and exhaustion lisle stopping in the gathering dusk glanced around the old camp site  a good place to pitch the tent but i think id rather move on a little he said  nasmyth made a sign of comprehension  yes he agreed i couldnt sleep soundly here everything about us is too plain a reminder ive no doubt you feel it as i do a firm and trusted friend lay famishing beside that fire in what extremity of weakness and suffering i dare not let myself think its possible he cut those branches yonder  lisles face expressed emotion sternly held in check  that was vernons workno englishman new to the country could have slashed them off so cleanly but look at this small spruce stump he was the better chopper but its significant that he used three or four strokes where i would have taken one  even the laconic jake appeared relieved when they forced their way a little farther through the tangled undergrowth until finding a clear space they set up the tent     chapter iii  the cache   they spent the greater part of a week on the portage crossing here and there a little lake and then came out one evening on a river that flowed green and tranquil beneath a ridge of hills here they camped and on rising with a shiver in the raw and nipping dawn the next morning nasmyth found lisle busy at the fire jake was cutting wood some distance off for the thud of his ax rang sharply through the stillness  i was awakethinkinga good deal last night in fact ive been restless ever since we struck the gladwynes trail nasmyth began now i understand that an uninterrupted journey of about sixteen days would take us well on our way toward civilization you say you apprehend no difficulty after that  no lisle waited watching his companion in an intent fashion  nasmyth hesitated  then considering everything mightnt it be better to waste no time and push straight on  and leave the work that brought me herei believe that brought us both hereundone  youll forgive me if i dont express myself very fortunately what i feel is thisgladwynes story is a tragic one but its twelve months old in a way its forgotten the wounds it made have healed  is such a man as the one you have described forgotten in a year lisle asked with a hardening expression  nasmyth being a man of simple and for the most part wholesome ideas was in a quandary his feelings were generous but he shrank from putting them into words moreover he was just and was not wholly convinced that the course he wished to recommend was right  well he contended there are faithful hearts that never quite forgetwith them the scar remains but its fortunate that the first keen pain does not last is it decenti almost think thats the right wordto reopen the wound  he paused and spread out one hand as if in expostulation  your late comrade has gone beyond your help you told me he had left no relatives and you have only yourself to consider can you do any good by bringing this sorrowful tale of disaster up again  are you pleading for your english friends anxious to save them pain at my expense cant you understand my longing to clear my dead partners name  a trace of color crept into nasmyths face  i suppose i deserve that though it wasnt quite the only thing i meant ive an idea that you are somehow going to lay up trouble for yourself by persevering in this search  i dont want to be offensive but cant you see that by urging me to let the thing drop you are casting grave doubts upon the honor of a man of your own caste and kind one with whom you are closely acquainted are you afraid to investigate to look for proofs of clarence gladwynes story  nasmyth looked him steadily in the eyes  for the sake of one or two others i think i am your belief in the guide vernon has had its effect on me  then said lisle i have no fear of putting my belief to the test i came up here for that purpose and i mean to call upon you as my witness as you said of george gladwyne the man i owe so much to never did a shabby thing that he should have deserted a starving comrade is clean impossible  i suppose theres no help for it responded nasmyth with a gesture of acquiescence we have said enough since you insist ill stand by my promise  the thudding of the ax ceased and they heard jake returning with the wood lisle set out the simple breakfast and when they had eaten they launched the canoe and floated swiftly down the smooth green river all that day they had accomplished the worst half of the journey henceforward their way lay downstream and with moderate good fortune they need have no apprehension about safely reaching the settlements but they were both silent and ill at ease lisle was consumed with fierce impatience and nasmyth shrank from what might shortly be revealed to him scarcely a word was spoken when they lay in camp that night  the next day they came to the head of a long and furiouslyrunning rapid rocks encumbered its channel the stream boiled fiercely over sunken ledges dropping several feet here and there in angry falls and in one place where the banks narrowed in a white stretch of foaming waves ran straight down the middle here they unloaded and spent the day laboriously relaying their stores and campgear over the boulders and ragged ledges between a wall of rock and the water it was a remarkably difficult traverse in places they had to hoist the leader up to some slippery shelf he could not reach unassisted and to which he dragged his companions up in turn in others deep pools barred their way and in skirting them they were forced to cling to any indifferent handhold on the rocks fissured side as they toiled on badly hampered by their loads the same thought was in the minds of two of the mena wonder as to how gladwynes exhausted party had crossed that portage unless the water had been lower it was not difficult to understand how the famishing leader had fallen and lamed himself  when at last toward the end of the afternoon the stores had been deposited on the banks of the pool below lisle sat down and filled his pipe  it would take us most of two days to portage the canoe and we might damage her badly in doing so he said the head of the rapids impossible but with luck we might run her down the rest in about ten minutes the thing seems worth trying though i wouldnt have risked it with the stores on board  suppose you swamped or upset her nasmyth suggested  its less likely since shed go light with only two of us paddling  nasmyth considered the sight of the rapid was not encouraging but he shrank from the intense effort that would be needed to transport the craft by the way they had come eventually it was decided to leave jake below ready to swim out with the trackingline and seize the canoe if any mishap befell and lisle and nasmyth went back to the head of the rapid they dragged the canoe round the worst rush with infinite difficulty and then nasmyth set his lips and braced himself for the mad descent when his companion thrust her off  a few strokes of the paddle drove them out into the stream and then their task consisted in holding her straight and swinging her clear of the rocks that showed up through the leaping foam which was difficult enough seen from the water the prospect was almost appalling though it was blurred and momentarily changing nasmyths eyes could hardly grasp salient detailshe had only a confused impression of flying spray rushing green water that piled itself here and there in frothy ridges flitting rocks and trees that came furiously speeding up toward him he had an idea that lisle once or twice shouted sharp instructions and that he clumsily obeyed but he could not have told exactly what he did he only knew that now and then he paddled desperately but more often he knelt still gazing fascinated at the mad turmoil in front of him  at last there was an urgent cry from lisle and he backed his paddle the canoe swerved a foaming wave broke into her and in another moment nasmyth was in the water he was dragged down by the swirling stream and when he rose he dimly saw the canoe a few yards in front of him he failed to reach hershe was traveling faster than he wasand though he could swim well he grew horribly afraid it struck him that there was a strong probability of his being driven against a boulder with force enough to break his bones or of being drawn down and battered against the stony bottom still he struck out for a line of leaping froth between him and the bank and was nearing it when lisle grasped his shoulder and thrust him straight downstream scarcely able to see amid the turmoil confused and bewildered he nevertheless realized that it was not desirable to attempt a landing where he had intended yielding to the guiding impulse he floundered downstream until lisle again seized him and drove him shoreward and a few moments later he stood up breathless in a few feet of slacker water he waded to the bank and then turned to lisle who was close behind  thanks he gasped i owe you something for that  pshaw disclaimed the other i only pulled you back youd have got badly hammered if youd tried to cross that ledge id noticed the inshore swirl close below it when we were packing along the bank and remembered that we could land in it  but you had hold of the canoe i saw you close beside her  i only wanted her to take me past the ledge lisle explained id no notion of going right through with her now well make for camp  on arriving there as darkness closed down they found that jake had recovered the craft the paddles had gone but he could make another pair in an hour or two they had a few dry things to put on and as they lay beside the fire after supper they were sensible that the slight constraint both had felt for the last two days had vanished neither would have alluded to the feeling which had replaced it nor indeed could have clearly expressed his thoughts but mutual liking respect and confidence had suddenly changed to something stronger during the few minutes they spent in the water a bond indefinite indescribable but not to be broken had been forged between the two  the next morning it was clear and cold and they made good progress until they landed late in the afternoon then after scrambling some distance over loose gravel lisle and nasmyth stopped beside a slight hollow in a wall of rock a few large stones had been rudely placed on one another to form a shelter there were still some small spruce branches which had evidently been used for a roof scattered about and the remains of a torn and moldering blanket lay near by in another place was a holed fryingpan and a battered kettle  nasmyth gravely took off his shapeless hat and stood glancing about him with a fixed expression  this he said quietly is where my friend diedas you have heard they afterward took his body out there are few men who could compare with that one i cant forget him  there was nothing to be done and little that could be said and they turned away from the scene of the tragedy where a man who to the last had thought first of his companions had met his lonely end launching the canoe they sped on downriver making a few easier portages and four days later they landed on the bank of a turbulent reach shut in by steep stony slopes there was a little brushwood here and there but not a tree of any kind  it was on this beach that gladwyne made one cache said lisle if there had been a cypress or a cedar near hed have blazed a mark on it as it is wed better look for a heap of stones  they searched for some time without finding anything for straight beach and straight river presented no prominent feature which any one making a cache would fix upon as guide lisle directed nasmyths attention to this  there was deep snow when vernon came down the gorge on this side he pointed out it doesnt follow that he was with the others when they buried the storeshe might have been carrying up a loadand its possible they couldnt give him a very exact description if im right in this hed have a long stretch of beach to search and a mans senses arent as keen as usual when hes badly played out  nasmyth made no comment but his expression suggested that he would not be disappointed if they failed to strike the cache shortly afterward however jake called out and on joining him they saw a cross scratched on a slab of slightly projecting rock even with that to guide them it was some time before they came upon a few stones roughly piled together and almost hidden in a bank of shingle  first of all i want you to notice that this gravel has slipped down from the bluff after the cache was made lisle said to nasmyth with snow on the ground and the slab yonder covered it would be almost impossible to locate it he turned to jake how long would you say it was since the rain or frost brought that small stuff down  jake glanced at the young brushwood growing higher up the slope it was shorter than that surrounding it and evidently covered the spot which the mass of débris had laid bare in its descent  part of one summer and all the next he answered decidedly  tell us how you figured it out  jake climbed the bank and returned with two or three young branches which he handed to lisle  the things plain enough to you he turned toward nasmyth no growth except in the summertheyd had a few warm months to start them but they dont fork until the second year see these shoots  as winter was beginning when the gladwyne party came down that small landslide must have taken place some time before then declared lisle  they set to work and carefully moved aside the stones first they uncovered three cans of preserved meat and then a small flour bag which had rotted and now disclosed a hard and moldy mass inside there was also another bag which had evidently contained sugar and a few other things all examined them in silence and then sat down grave in face  its unfortunate that nobody could positively state whether this cache has been opened or not since it was made but there are a few points to guide us said lisle do you know what kind of food civilized men whove been compelled to work to exhaustion on insufficient rations helped out by a little fish or game generally long for most  no answered nasmyth with a feeble attempt at levity ive now and then remembered with regret the kind of dinner i used to get in england  you have scarcely felt the pinch lisle informed him the two things are farinaceous stuff and sugar no doubt it will occur to you that vernon might have taken a can or two of meat but thats not likely  if youre right about the longing for flour and sweetstuff its a strong point nasmyth declared where did you learn the fact  lisle looked at jake and the packer smiled in a significant manner  hes right he vouched we know  then continued lisle indicating the sugar bag which had been wrapped in a waterproof sheet can you imagine a starving man in desperate haste making up this package as it was when we found it  no admitted nasmyth its most improbable  somewhat to his astonishment the usually taciturn jake broke in  youre wasting time vernon never struck this cachehe told the folks at the post so worked with him once trailcuttingwhat that man said goes  you never told me you knew vernon exclaimed lisle  quite likely jake drawled it didnt seem any use till now  for the first time since they landed nasmyth laughedhe felt that something was needed to relieve the tension  if people never talked unless they had something useful to say there would be a marvelous change he declared  lisle disregarded this but he was a little less grave when he resumed  theres another point to bear in mind two of gladwynes party left him and of those two which would be the more likely to succumb to extreme exertion exposure and insufficient food  against the answer you expect theres the fact that vernon made the longer journey nasmyth objected  it doesnt count for much was clarence gladwyne accustomed to roughing it and going without his dinner would you expect him to survive where you would perish even if you had a little more to bear  no confessed nasmyth hes rather a selfindulgent person  then for example could you march through a rough snowcovered country on as little food as i could  no again answered nasmyth you would probably hold out two or three days longer than i could  vernon was a stronger and tougher man than i am lisle went on now without finding definite proof which i hardly expected there is i think strong presumptive evidence that vernons story is correct  yes agreed nasmyth and added gravely will you ever find the proof  i think theres a wayit may be difficult but im going right through with this  whats your next move  ive willingly laid my partners story open to the only tests we can impose now im going to do the same with clarence gladwynes  nothing more was said and turning away from the cache they went back to the canoe     chapter iv  a painful decision   two days passed uneventfully though nasmyth was conscious of a growing uneasiness during them and then one evening they landed to search another beach they had less difficulty here for small cedars and birches crept down to the waterside and jake found an axblaze on one after that it was easy to locate the cache and there were signs that it had been either very roughly made or afterward opened and reclosed in careless haste lisle had no hesitation in deciding upon the latter and jake was emphatic in his brief assurance on the point  on removing the covering stones they found very little beneath them but every object was taken out and lisle measuring quantities and guessing weights carefully enumerated each in his notebook neither he nor nasmyth said anything of import then both felt that the subject was too grave to be lightly discussed and walking back silently along the shingle they pitched the tent and prepared supper after the meal jake prompted by an innate tact sauntered away down the beach and the other two lounging beside the fire took out their pipes a full moon hung above the lonely gorge which was filled with the roar of the river and the shadows of the cedars lay black upon the stones  some minutes passed before a word was spoken and then nasmyth looked up  well he said briefly  lisle moved a little so that he could see his companions face  in the first place he explained clarence gladwyne came down this bank one could locate the cache by the blazed tree even with snow upon the groundand it has been opened apart from the signs of this no party of three men would have thought it worth while to make a cache of the few things we found  mightnt it have been opened by some indian  its most unlikely because he would have cleaned it out a white prospector would certainly have taken the tobacco  nasmyth knit his brows he was deeply troubled because there were respects in which the matter would hardly bear discussion though he recognized that it must now be thrashed out  well he admitted reluctantly what we have discovered has its significance but it isnt conclusive  his companion took out from a pocket the palm and wrist portion of a fur glove it was badly rotted and the rest had either fallen away or been gnawed by some animal but a button with a stamp on it remained  jake found that and gave it to me he said theres enough left to show that it had fingerstalls and there are none on the mittens we use in cold weather the things english and with a little rubbing i expect youll find the makers name on that button when the party went up it was warm weather but we know there was sharp frost when gladwyne came back a buttoned glove doesnt drop off ones hand and even if it had done so gladwyne would have noticed and picked it up it seems to me he took it off to open one of the provision bags and couldnt find it afterward because hed trodden it into the snow  nasmyth could doubt no longer and his face grew red  the hound he broke out he had a hand frostbittenone finger is different from the others yet  lisle said nothing he could understand and sympathize with what was going on in his companions mind and the latter was filled with bitterness and humiliation a man of his own kind and station in life one with whom he fished and shot had broken faith with his starving comrade and with incredible cowardice had left him to perish even this was not the worst though nasmyth had always taken the personal courage of his friends for granted he was not a clever man and he had his faults but he shaped his life in accordance with a few simple but inflexible rules it was difficult for him to understand how one could yield to a fit of craven fear but there was a fact which made gladwynes transgression still blacker  this thing hits hard he said at length the man should have gone back if he had known it meant certain death  lisle filled his pipe and smoked in silence for several minutes during which the eery cry of a loon rang about the camp it roused nasmyth to an outbreak of anger  i hate that unearthly noise he exclaimed vehemently the thing seems to be gloating its indecent when i think of that call it will bring back the long portage and this ghostly river i wish id never made the journey or that i could blot the whole thing out  it cant be done lisle replied its too late you have learned the truth of what has been done herebut the results will work themselves out neither you nor i can stop them they have to be faced  the pity of it is that the innocent must suffer theyve borne enough already  theres a point i dont quite understand declared lisle whatever the hudson bay agent thought hed have kept it to himself if hed been allowedive met him it was gladwyne who laid the whole blame on vernon he forced the agent to bear him out why should he have taken so much trouble his own tale would have cleared him  nasmyth looked irresolute and then he answered reluctantly  theres a fact i havent told you yetclarence came into the family property on georges death a fine old place a fairly large estate the sister doesnt count though she got her brothers personal propertythe land goes down in the male line  lisle dropped his pipe  now i understand gladwyne profits my dead partner bore the shame but do you believe the man meant to let his cousin die  no nasmyth answered sharply thats unthinkable but i blame him almost as much as if he had done so besides his duty to george he had a duty to himself and to the familythe honorable men and women who had kept the name clean before him knowing he would inherit on georges death there was only one way openhe should have gone back at any cost instead to clear himself of the faintest trace of ugly suspicion he lays the blame upon an innocent man  lisle did not reply to this he felt that had the grim choice been imposed upon his companion the man would have taken the course he had indicated  you said that george gladwyne was a naturalist he remarked was he a methodical man  eminently so replied nasmyth wondering where the question led he had already been astonished at lisles close reasoning and the correctness of his deductions  then he would have made notes on his journey and no doubt have kept some kind of diary did the rescue party recover it  they did it was given to georges sister  damaged by snow or water badly tattered  it was assented nasmyth ive had the book in my hands i suppose its natural that you should guess its condition but i dont see what it points to  lisle smiled grimly  one wouldnt be astonished to find some leaves missing from a tattered book  youre right again nasmyth started several had gone  i think i can tell which part of the journey they related to a methodical man would make a note of the stores cached and the lists would be conclusive evidence if anybody afterward opened the caches and enumerated their contents as we have done if everything put into the one on the bank vernon followed remained there it would prove that he couldnt have found it on the other hand if the one on gladwynes side of the river  of course nasmyth broke in you neednt labor the point its plain enough he stopped for a few moments before he went on again im convinced but without that list of gladwynes you still havent proof enough to place your account of the affair beyond dispute what are you going to do  im going to englandits my fathers country and i meant to visit it some day whether i shall find out anything more there or not i dont know  then you must stay with me thats a point i insist upon but i must make my situation clearthough ive been drawn into this matter against my will you have my promise and if ever the time for action comes ill stand by you but ill take no part in trapping clarence gladwyne into any admission nor will i countenance any charge against him unless some chance supplies you with indisputable evidence  thanks said lisle im agreeable you stand neutral until i call on you  there are two more questions and then well let the subject drop why didnt you make this search earlier why didnt gladwyne rearrange the caches afterward he went back you know  theyre easily answered it was some time before i heard of vernons death and met the hudson bay man in victoriaid been away in the north gladwyne had the rescue party with him when he went back he couldnt replace the provisions in the cache on this side without their knowing it and i dont suppose he could have crossed the river to the other cache now well talk of something else  they started again the next morning and instead of leaving the river for the hudson bay post which stood farther back into the wilderness they held on downstream though they afterward regretted this when their provisions once more grew scanty there was now sharp frost at nights fangs of ice stretched out behind the boulders and crackling sheets of it gathered in the slacker eddies along the bank what mattered more was that the portages were frequent and carrying the canoe over rock coated with frozen spray became dangerous as well as difficult and nasmyth working on short rations began to feel the strain it was only since he had entered that inhospitable region that he had ever been compelled to go without his dinner and now breakfast and supper were sternly curtailed when they were stopped for two days by a blinding snowstorm he grew anxious and his uneasiness had increased when some time afterward they made their evening meal of a single flapjack each he could readily have eaten a dozen of the thin flat cakes the duck they had shot every now and then since crossing the divide had gone they had not seen a trout since the cold set in and there did not appear to be any salmon in the river  after breakfast the next morning lisle concluded that it would be wise to risk a day looking for a deer so he invited nasmyth to take his rifle and the two set out it cost them some trouble to climb the low bluff above the river through a horrible tangle of fallen trunks the trees were getting larger and the branches of those the wind had brought down lay spread about them or were resting on the standing growth in networks which nasmyth would have thought it impossible to traverse had he been alone lisle scrambled through however and he had no choice except to follow where the timber was thinner the slope was covered with sharpedged stones which further damaged his already dilapidated boots and when at last they came out upon a comparatively bare rocky tableland a bitter wind met them in the teeth it drove a little fine snow before it but lisle plodded steadily on explaining that any deer which might be in the neighborhood would have gone down into the sheltered valleys he had no doubt they would find one of the valleys for they were generally numerous  it was an hour before they reached one and nasmyth was conscious of an unpleasant pain in his side and a headache which he supposed resulted from want of food for all that he scrambled after his companion down an almost impossible descent where trees of increasing size grew up among outcropping rock and banks of stones when he reached the bottom he found himself in a deep rift filled with denselymatted underbrush through which a swift stream flowed its banks promised a slightly easier road though now and then they had to wade through the water which was icy cold noon came and they had seen no sign of life except two or three willowgrouse which they failed to dislodge from cover but lisle held on his course running roughly in a line with the river  it was toward three oclock and a little snow was sifting down between the somber branches overhead when lisle stopping raised a warning hand and pointed to an opening in the trees the light was dim among the rows of trunks and for a few seconds nasmyth gazed down the long colonnade seeing nothing then lisle pointed again impatiently and he made out something between a gray trunk and a thicket sportsman as he was he had not the bushmans eye and he would never have supposed that formless object to be a deer it moved however a prong of horn appeared and waiting for nothing further he pitched up his rifle  it was a long shot standing he guessed the range in a deceptive light but he found himself strangely steady as he squeezed the trigger he was desperately hungry and weak from want of food the deer must not escape yet he was in no rash haste for two or three seconds the tiny foresight trembled slightly upon the mark while the pressure on the trigger increased then there was a flash he heard no report but the smoke blew into his eyes almost simultaneously a train of red sparks leaped out from somewhere close at his side and there was a sharp snapping in the bush ahead  you got your shot in cried lisle i think i missed him on the jump come on we must pick up the trail  it was easy to find the deer had been too badly hit to bound across each obstacle as cleanly as usual and broken twigs and scattering withered leaves showed which way it had gone besides there were red splashes here and there it was however a difficult matter to follow the trail fallen trees and dense thickets barred the way and they had to cross the creek every now and then nasmyth rapidly got breathless and before long he was badly distressed but he held on behind his companion once or twice he was held fast for a moment or two and breaking free found he had badly ripped his garments on the ragged branches still it was unthinkable that they should let the deer escape  as he struggled forward he remembered that the days were rapidly shortening and he shrank from the prospect of retracing his way to camp in the dark it occurred to him that it was a compliment and a mark of very fine courtesy that lisle had left the first shot to him in return for this he must endeavor to be present to assist when he was wanted  the deer was still invisible but it was not very far ahead for at times the snapping of a stick or a rustle of disturbed underbrush came sharply out of the woods the light was getting dimmer and the snow was falling more thickly  at last the hunted creature left the valley and after a desperate scramble the men reached the summit of the ridge above here the tableland between them and the river was covered with straggling bush and though the undergrowth was thin they could see nothing but the long rows of shadowy trunks lisle however picked up the trail and they followed it as rapidly as possible until when nasmyth was lagging some distance behind there was a shout in front of him and his companions rifle flashed making a last effort he broke into a run and presently came to the brink of a steep descent covered with thick brush and scattered trees with a wide reach of palely gleaming water at the foot of it it was the kind of place one would have preferred to climb down cautiously but there was a sharp snapping and crackling below and nasmyth knew that a hardpressed deer will frequently take to the water if it crossed the river it would escape and that could not be contemplated  holding his rifle up he plunged madly down the descent smashing through matted bushes stumbling over slippery stones once or twice he collided with a slender tree and struck his leg against some ridge of rock but he held on gasping and the water rapidly grew nearer he had almost reached it when a dim shape broke out from a thicket at the bottom of the slope there were still some cartridges in his rifle cylinder but he was slipping and sliding down an almost precipitous declivity at such a rate that it was impossible to stop and shoot indeed in another moment he fell violently into a brake and had some difficulty in smashing through it but when he struggled free he saw shingle and boulders in front of him and lisle bounding across them a few yards behind the deer he reached the stones wondering why lisle did not fire and then he saw man and deer plunge into the water together  a few seconds later he was waistdeep in the swift icy current savagely endeavoring to drag the animal toward the bank while lisle stood near him breathing hard with a red huntingknife in his hand  steady gasped lisle you cant do it that way help me throw the beast on his side now heave  they got the deer out and nasmyth sat down limply all the power seemed to have gone out of him he did not want to move though he was filled with exultation for they now had food it was a minute or two before he noticed that lisle had left him and then he saw him coming back with his rifle  i dropped the thing lisle explained couldnt snap a fresh shell in guess i bent the slide i took the knife to finish it  in another moment or two youd have been too late  lisle laughed  i dont know it wouldnt have been decided until wed reached the other side  you would have swum across nasmyth asked in astonishment  sure said lisle simply anyway id have tried  nasmyth glanced at the river it was broad icy cold and running fast and he could hardly imagine a wornout and halffed man safely swimming it lisle however called upon him to assist in an unpleasant operation which when nasmyth had killed a deer at home had been judiciously left to the keepers or gillies after that he was directed to light a fire on a neighboring point from which it could be seen some way up the river and by and by jake arrived in the canoe then they made camp and after a feast on flesh so tough that only hungry men could have eaten more than a few morsels of it they went to sleep     chapter v  millicent gladwyne   in a few more days they left the river abandoning the canoe and tent and a portion of their gear ascending to higher levels they crossed a rugged waste which fortunately for them was thinly timbered but there was keen frost and snow in places and nasmyth suffered a good deal during this portion of the journey at last however they descended to a sheltered valley in which the firs grew tall and jake agreed with lisle that it would form the best road to the settlements  nasmyth was longing for civilization when he lay awake late one night wrapped in a single blanket beside the sinking fire dark columnar trunks rose about him touched with the uncertain red radiance now and then cast upon them when little puffs of bitter wind stirred the blaze and he could see the filmy wreaths of smoke eddy among the branches he was cold and overtired the days march had been a long one his shoulders ached cruelly after carrying a heavy load and every joint was sore besides his bed was unpleasantly hard and he envied his companions who had long ago sunk into heavy slumber for the last hour he had been thinking over the discoveries he had made on the journey which he devoutly wished he had never undertaken the thought of them had troubled him on other bitter nights lisle was not the man to let the matter drop he was much more likely to follow it up with dogged persistence to the end and nasmyth who was to some extent pledged to assist him saw trouble ahead  in spite of this he was beginning to get drowsy when a faint and yet strangely melodious chiming broke through the whispering of the firs it seemed to come from above him falling through the air and he roused himself to listen wondering if he were quite awake the musical clash he had first heard had ceased but for a while he thought he could distinguish the tolling of a single bell then in varying notes the peal broke out again  there was something ethereal in the clear tones the last time he had heard anything like them he was sitting one sunday morning on a shady lawn while the call of the bells came softly up to him across the english woods he glanced at his comrades but they showed no sign of hearing and raising himself on one elbow he lay and listened until the music growing fainter and fainter died away then puzzled and half convinced that his imagination had played him some fantastic trick he went to sleep  he mentioned the occurrence diffidently at breakfast the next morning expecting incredulous laughter but lisle without making a comment glanced at jake questioningly  no responded jake nothing to bring them up so far  you couldnt have been mistaken lisle asked nasmyth  i thought i must be but the more i listened the clearer it got  go and see lisle said addressing jake and when they had finished breakfast the packer strode away  well wait a bit advised lisle im a little worried about provisions again its still a long march to the nearest wagon trail  nasmyth failed to understand how the delay would improve their position but believing that his companion was somewhat dubious about his tale he restrained his curiosity in half an hour jake came back and nodded to lisle  quite a bunch of them he reported i struck the fellows trail  what was it i heard nasmyth asked  cowbells lisle explained laughing in this country they generally put them on any cattle that run loose in the timber some adventurous rancher has located up here though i hadnt expected to find one so far north anyway its a relief hell no doubt be able to let us have something to eat  they reached the mans log house an hour later and spent the day with him enjoying a much needed rest the next morning he supplied them with provisions and told them how to find a trail down to a wagon road and setting out they safely reached a settlement in regular communication with the cities  it was the settlement lisle had expected to come to and he found a bundle of correspondence awaiting him there before he opened it however he and nasmyth supplied themselves with such clothing as they could obtain at the local store and then demanded a bath at the little wooden hotel they had some trouble in obtaining it but nasmyth was firm and eventually he sat down to supper clad in a blue shirt with scarlet trimmings extremely tightfitting clothes and daintilypointed shoes  i think id have done better if id stuck to my rags or else bought a pair of what that fellow called riverjacks boots he commented ruefully  lisle was similarly attired but he was too busy with his meal to sympathize with him and some time after it was over nasmyth strolling into the private room which they had obtained as a signal concession found him writing at a littered table sitting down he watched him for a while with some slight wonder for a number of weeks he had seen his companion handling heavy loads cooking and hauling canoes round rapids with the skill of a professional packer it was hard to disassociate him from the ranges and the bush but now with the pile of letters before him he had suddenly become a business man nasmyth saw him answer a couple in a swift decided manner which showed that he was at home in his present occupation it was one of the quick characterchanges which while common in the west are apt to bewilder the more stereotyped englishman  are you coming to england with me nasmyth asked at length  no im sorry i cant answered lisle pausing pen in hand this gladwyne matter will probably take time and i have none to spare now there have been some unexpected developments in my affairs i dont know when i can get away  nasmyth was conscious of some relief his companion would have to defer the prosecution of plans that threatened to cause trouble in england which was something to be thankful for though he had a strong sympathy for the man  has it ever struck you that you might have less difficulty if you could be content with proving half of what you claim he asked its the more important parti mean that your late comrade failed to find the cache  half a truth is not much usegladwyne realized that to declare you havent done the wrong is a good deal less effective than pointing to the guilty man  i suppose thats correct nasmyth agreed but after all unless you can get hold of a list of the provisions cachedand it has most likely been destroyedtheres only one way of substantiating your views  exactly gladwynes confession will place the matter beyond all doubt  do you think you will ever get it  lisles expression hardened  well he said im going to try  nasmyth abandoned all attempt to daunt or dissuade him  anyway he resumed when you come over you must stay with me im sorry well have to part company tomorrow i start east by the first train  he strolled out into the moonlight and the keen frosty air the little wooden town was soon left behind and sauntering down the rough wagon road beneath towering firs he saw the great hill summits glitter white against the sky it was a wonderful country the grandest he had ever traversed but it demanded a good deal from the man who ventured into its wilds and he was not sorry that he was turning his back on it  then as he thought of the land he was bound for and recalled the tragic story of gladwynes journey he once more grew troubled he realized the immutable sequence of cause and effecteach action had its result which must be faced however much one repented and regretted it the deed once done could not be altered and what was worse its consequences reached out to others then he wondered whether clarence had ever repented and admitted with a recurrence of his indignation against the man that it was far from probable clarence was one who took life lightly and although his means had been small until he came into his cousins possessions he had somehow succeeded in getting what is often considered the best out of it selfdenial in any shape was unknown to him  the next morning nasmyth took the train for montreal and about a fortnight later alighted at a little station in the north of england as the early dusk was closing in it was a quiet evening and the soft moistness of his native air struck him as something pleasantly familiar after the keener drier atmosphere of the dominion he was glad to be back again but when he looked around the trap waiting in the wet road outside the railings was not his own neither did it belong to clarence whom he had partly expected but on the whole nasmyth was glad of that he had not looked forward to the first meeting with clarence with any pleasure  in another moment a girl came along the platform through the groups of local passengers who respectfully made way for her she was tall and her long outer garment failed to conceal her grace of movement and fine poise though in the fading light her face was almost invisible beneath a large hat the sight of her sent a thrill of satisfaction through the man it was seldom that millicent gladwynes appearance was unwelcome to her friends she approached him with outstretched hand  i drove over for you clarence couldnt come he was suddenly called up to town she began it would have been rather lonely for you to spend the first evening by yourself at the lodge you will come to us  thoughtful as ever smiled nasmyth with a little bow which was respectful as well as friendly i neednt ask how you are the way you walked along the platform was a testimony to our border air  she laughed softly and musically  it is more needful to inquire how you have stood your adventures  i believe im thinner but that isnt astonishing everything considered i suppose clarence is getting on pretty satisfactorily  clarence oh yes there was a hint of uncertainty in her voice which nasmyth noticed he has been in town a good deal of late but come along the horsehes a new oneis rather restive theyll send on your things  the remnant of my outfits contained in one small bag laughed nasmyth the rests scattered about the hillsides of british columbia i was a picturesque scarecrow when i reached the settlements  they moved away along the platform and on reaching the trap he got up beside her and handed her the reins  i want to look about if you dont mind he explained  i really think the prospects worth it she replied besides rievers fresh and needs humoring  she shook the whip and as they clattered away down the steep twisting road nasmyth glanced with satisfaction to left and right he had seen wilder and grander lands but none of them appealed to him like this high english waste on one hand dim black hills rose out of fleecy mist on the other a leafless birch wood close by stood out in curiously fragile and delicate tracery against a paling saffron glow though overhead the sky was barred with motionless gray cloud a sharp smell of peatsmoke followed them as they clattered past a low white cottage with a yellow glow in one window and then the earthy scent of rotting leaves replaced it as they plunged into the gloom of an oak wood beneath the birches a stream splashing down a hollow made faint music in the midst of it when they had emerged from the shadow and climbed a steep rise wide moors stretched away in front rising and falling in long undulations streaked with belts of mist the crying of restless plovers came out of the gathering dimness  all this is remarkably nice though i dont think i should have appreciated it quite so much if id been alone nasmyth said at length  millicent laughed lightly she had known him since her childhood and was quite aware that he had not intended to pay her a labored compliment they were too good friends for that once indeed he had desired a closer bond but he had quietly acquiesced when with gentle firmness she had made it clear that she was not for him submission had not been easy but he had long admitted her right to more than he could offer in this however he was to some extent mistaken because the gifts he could bringa staunch honesty faithfulness and a genial natureare not to be despised  well she replied i love these moors and dales as of course you know and ive become more of a stayathome than ever during the past year there was a slight regretfulness in her voice which had its meaning for him im never satisfied with the drawings she went on though ive made so many of them  nasmyth made a sign of comprehension she had undertaken to finish and illustrate her brothers roughedout work a book on the fauna of the border and she had brought to it a fine artistic skill and patience as well as a love of the wild creatures of the waste it was perhaps a curious occupation for a young woman but she had devoted herself to it with characteristic thoroughness  he wanted it to be as complete and accurate as possible she added simply  her companion felt compassionate in some respects it was almost a pity that millicent could not forget  you got my letterthe one in which i said i meant to pick up and follow out his trail he asked  yes i knew it would be difficult indeed i was anxious about you the wilderness has claimed so much from me but did you  i succeeded nasmyth answered quietly  the nod she gave him was expressive it meant that she had expected him to succeed he was a man who did what he said  i think george should never have made that journey she resumed fond of the open as he was he hadnt the physical stamina he never spared himself he was apt to overestimate his powers  it was spoken with a grave regretfulness that troubled nasmyth and yet stirred him to strong appreciation of her character with all her love for her brother she could face the truth  ive learned that he bore everything with the fortitude one would expect from himdoing his share always with the rest nasmyth said we got through a little earlier and had better weather but i saw enough to convince me that the difficulties george had to contend with would have killed any ordinary man  they did not kill clarence  nasmyth once more burned with anger against the transgressor  no he replied in a strained tone clarence escaped  she flashed a sharp glance at him and he felt glad that it was too dark for her to see his face  you must tell me the whole story tonight she requested  her companion made no answer with the reserve that must be maintained on several points the story would be difficult to relate and it could not fail to be painful to her the horror she would feel if she ever learned that her brother might have been saved had his cousin shown more resolution was a thing he dare not contemplate and he wondered if the shock the knowledge must bring could be spared her this depended upon lisle whom he had promised to assist nasmyth could foresee nothing but trouble and he was silent for a while as they drove on across the lonely moor     chapter vi  nasmyth tells his story   dinner was over and millicents elderly companion had discreetly left them alone when the girl led nasmyth into her drawingroom it was brightly lighted and was tastefully decorated in delicate colors and a wood fire was burning on the hearth but for the first time that he could remember nasmyth felt ill at ease in it he was fresh from the snowcovered rocks and shadowy woods and the refinement and artistic luxury of his surroundings rather jarred on him the story he had to relate dealt with elemental thingshunger toil and deathit would sound harsher and more ugly amid the evidences of civilization  you have a good deal to tell me millicent suggested at length  he stood still a moment looking at her she had already seated herself and the sweeping lines of her pose suggested vigor and energy held in quiet control her face was warm in coloring bearing signs of exposure to wind and sun but it was chastely molded in a fine oval with the features firmly lined her hair was dark though there were bronzy gleams in it and her eyes which were deeply brown had a sparkle in them as a whole her appearance indicated a sanguine optimistic temperament but there was also an indefinite something which spoke of due balance and repose nasmyth was more convinced than ever that he had not met any other woman fit to compare with her her age as he knew having given her many birthday presents was twentyfour  yes he said in answer to her remark but its curious that i cant fix my mind upon the subject here the nights mild shall we go out on to the veranda  wait until i get a wrap i understand  you always do that nasmyth declared  she joined him outside in another minute and seated herself in the chair he drew out the house was small and irregularly built and a glass roof supported on light pillars stretched along part of the front a halfmoon hung above a ridge of dark fir wood a tarn gleamed below and here and there down a shadowy hollow there was a sparkle of running water on the other side of the dale the moors stretched away waste and empty toward the halfseen hills the loneliness of the prospect reminded nasmyth of canada and the resemblance grew more marked when the crying of plover rose from the dim heathit brought back the call of the loon still he did not wonder why millicent an orphan with ample means lived alone except for her elderly companion on the desolate border  you dont mind i know he said as he lighted a cigar  i can make that concession willingly she answered with a smile i suppose im oldfashioned because i go no farther  keep so advised nasmyth of course thats unnecessary but i never could make out why women should want to smoke from my point of view it isnt becoming  he was putting off a task from which he shrank and she indulged him  one retains ones prejudices in a place like this she said i felt sadly left behind when i was last in london and the few visits i made in the home counties a little while ago astonished me nobody seemed to stay at home the motors were continually whirling them up to town and back the guests kept coming and going there was so much restlessness and bustle that i was glad to be home again  it has struck me returned nasmyth with an air of sage reflection that we who live quietly in the country are the pick of the lot sounds egotistical doesnt it but if we dont do much goodand im afraid i dont anywayneither do we do any harm  im not sure that thats a great deal to be proud of  i didnt include you nasmyth assured her there have been wholesome changes in the village since you grew up and made your influence felt and that leads to a question how does clarence get on with his tenants and the rank and file george understood them but theyre difficult folks to handle  hes away a good dealim afraid there has been some friction now and then the girls manner suddenly changed but thats beside the point arent you wasting time  i am almost afraid to begin you will find the story trying  she turned toward him and the moonlight showed her face was reassuringly quiet  i expect that but your fears are groundless you neednt hesitate on my account  nasmyth knew that she was right millicent was not one to flinch from pain with an effort he began his story at the portage over the divide and possessed by vivid memories he made her see the desolate region they had laboriously traversed because her imagination was powerful she could picture the brother she had loved toiling with desperate purpose and failing strength through muskeg and morass then when she quietly insisted he described gladwynes last camp she saw that too the hollow beneath the dark rock with the straggling cedars on the ridge above next he outlined the journey down the first few rapids saying little about the caches and at last with considerable relief he came to a stop millicent sat silent for several minutes during which he did not look at her  thank you she said at length i have tried often to imagine it and failed but it is quite clear now clarence would never give me more than the barest detailsi think he hated to speak of it  in a way he was wise replied nasmyth he understood the mans reluctance now dont you think it would be better if you tried to drive the thing out of your mind it cant be alteredtheres a danger in dwelling too much upon ones grief  she looked up at him though her eyes were dim with tears  it cant be driven out there were only the two of us we had so much in commonthere was such trust between us  nasmyth nodded in comprehension and sympathy  now that ive told you he said quietly as he rose i think ill go i am sure youd rather be alone  no she answered motioning to him to sit down please stay she seemed to rouse herself with an effort of course there was only one thing george could do when he was lamedsend them on but clarence who was with him never made his fortitude and cheerfulness so clear as you have done you even mentioned the exact words he said now and thenhow did you hear of them  from my companion a young canadian he had the whole thing by heart got it from the hudson bay agent georges guide told the agent  did your companion also teach you how to tell the story  nasmyth smiled he saw that she was desirous of changing the subject and he was glad of it  anyway he made me see it at the time pointed out the full significance of thingsa broken branch a scratch on a rock a rather striking man in several ways but you shall see him hes coming over to stay with me by and by he paused a moment i understand that clarence has been having some trouble  it hardly amounts to that but things are not the same as they werein spite of her courage she falteredwhen george held control the tenants dont take to clarence i think he was not well advised in increasing rents here and there indeed that was a little puzzling because he was once so liberal  in small matters its his own money now nasmyth could not repress this show of bitterness  whose money was it in his extravagant days  thats a question ive thought over and failed to find an answer to ive no doubt most of what he gets is now being spent in town though in my opinion as much as possible ought to go back to the locality in which it was produced why dont you impress that on him  millicent as he knew could judiciously offer sound advice where it was needed she was young but having been left an orphan early she had long enjoyed her brothers close companionship and confidence and the mans wide knowledge and thoughtfulness had had its effect in molding her character still in this case she did not respond  it would be better for his tenants and the neighborhood generally if clarence married he can afford it now nasmyth went on  again the girl was silent and he wondered whether he had thoughtlessly made a serious blunder it had been supposed among their friends that she would marry clarence some day though so far as it was known there was no definite understanding between them and for a while the mans attitude had strengthened the idea indeed when he had succeeded to georges possessions every one had expected an announcement which had not been made what millicent thought or what she had looked for all along did not appear  i think you are right in one thing she said very calmly at length if he would stay here as george did and his neighbors do it would be better for everybody including himself  nasmyth made a sign of agreement their intimate friends remained for the greater portion of the year on their estates understanding the needs of their tenants and dependents and enjoying their good opinion which was naturally increased by the fact that their expenses were chiefly incurred in the neighborhood there were others who as the small farmer recognized returned as little as possible to the soil squandering revenues raised by the stubborn labor of others in doubtful pleasures elsewhere and when they brought their friends home on luxuries despatched from town these things made for bitterness  an unfortunate persistence in his hobby drove nasmyth into a second blunder  were in accord on that point he assured her its a pity the land passed out of your hands however as theres no male succession it might after all come back to you  she bore it very calmly  you wouldnt have me speculate on such a thing  then as if to find a safer topic she went on with a thrill of anger in her tone  ill tell you of an incident i witnessed two or three days ago which annoyed me seriously id just met old bellyou know how lame he isdriving some sheep along the road it has been a wet cold year bell lost his hay the oats are dreadfully poor and his buildings are in very bad repair  they were a disgrace to any estate when i last saw them nasmyth broke in besides the sour land near the river should have been tiledrained long ago  so bell has urged but he cant get marple to spend a pennyim glad that mans new to this part of the country and doesnt belong to us well just after i met bell marples big motor came along he had batley with him and the crestwicks who were down before i think you met them  i did assented nasmyth in canada theyd call them a mighty tough crowd theyre about the limit here  i turned round after the car had passed millicent went on marple was driving as fast as usual and he made no attempt to pull up bell who didnt hear tried to jump and fell into the ditch most of the sheep were scattered across the moor but two or three got right in front of the car and at the last moment marple had to stop one of the women laughed she had a very shrill voice and she explained that the old man looked so funny in the ditch marple shouted to bellsomething about the damage to his tiresand i could see the others smiling at what he said that was worse than the words he used then they went on leaving the old man to gather up his sheep he hadnt a dog with him that kind of thing leaves its mark  distinctly so nasmyth agreed still marple and his lot are exceptions wasnt clarence rather thick with them  yes she answered ive been rather disturbed about him  nasmyth did not know what this meant he thought she would hardly have made such an admission had she contemplated marrying the man and if not it was somewhat difficult to see why he should cause her serious concern he knew however that millicent could not look on unmoved when her friends left the right path he could think of two or three whom she had helped and gently checked from further straying this reflection was a relief to him because he was determined that she should not marry clarence if he could prevent it if necessary he would tell her the part the man had played in canada though he shrank from doing so  marple and his acquaintances are not the people one would have expected clarence to associate with he continued still in my opinion hes doing worse in making a friend of that fellow batley i could never understand the connectionthe man strikes me as an adventurer has he spent much time here since ive been away  a good deal off and on but its getting chilly and i half expect a reproving lecture from miss hume when i go in first though tell me a little more about the young canadian you had with you  i dont know much i met him by accidenthe has an interest in some mines i believe but he struck me as a remarkably fine type clever at woodcraft as handy with the ax and paddle as our professional guide but when he talked about other things he seemed to know a good deal more than i do he smiled after all thats not surprising but what i liked most was the earnestness of the fellow he had a downright way of grappling with things or explaining them to you sensible but direct not subtle  ive met men of that description and im rather prejudiced in their favor declared millicent smiling but what was he like in personslightly rugged  no thats where you and others sometimes go wrong theres nothing of the barbarian about these bushmen physically theyre as fine a type as we arei might go fartherstraight in the limb cleanlined every way square in the shoulder theyd make an impression at any london gathering  so long as they didnt speak  it wouldnt matter allowing for a few colloquialisms theyre worth listening to which is more than id care to say for a number of the people one meets in this country  millicent laughed  well ill be glad to see him when he comes her voice grew graver i feel grateful to him already for what he told you about george  they went in together and half an hour later nasmyth walked home across the moor he had never thought more highly of millicent but somehow he now felt sorry for her it scarcely seemed fitting that she should live in that lonely spot with only the company of an elderly and staid companion though he hardly thought she would be happier if she plunged into a round of purposeless amusements in the cities still she was young and very attractive he felt that she should have more than the thinlypeopled countryside had to offer     chapter vii  on the moors   nearly a year had passed since nasmyths return when lisle at length reached england soon after his arrival he was as nasmyths guest invited to join a shooting party and one bright afternoon he stood behind a bank of sods high on a grousemoor overlooking the wastes of the border the heath was stained with the bellheathers regal purple interspersed with the vivid red of the more fragile ling and where the uplands sloped away broad blotches of the same rich colors checkered the grass in the foreground a river gleamed athwart the picture and overhead there stretched an arch of cloudless blue there was no wind the day was still and hot  a young lad whose sunburned face already bore the stamp of selfindulgence was stationed behind the butt with lisle and the latter was not favorably impressed with his appearance or conversation  look out he cautioned by and by you were a little slow last time they travel pretty fast  lisle picked up his gun he had used one in the west though he was more accustomed to the rifle cutting clear against the dazzling sky a straggling line of dark specks was moving toward him and a series of sharp cracks broke out from the farther wing of the row of butts which stretched across the moor lisle watched the birds with fingers tightening on his gun one cluster was coming his way each flitting body growing in size and distinctness with marvelous rapidity then there was a flash beside him and another crash as he pitched up his gun something struck the heather with a thud not far away and swinging the muzzle a little he pulled again he was not surprised to hear a second thud and laying down his gun he turned to his youthful companion while a thin cloud of acrid vapor hung about him  get anything he asked  i didnt was the sullen answer couldnt expect it with the second barrel after youd filled the place with smoke wonder why gladwynes man gave you the old black powder  as nearly everybody else used smokeless this was a point that had aroused lisles curiosity though it was not a matter of much importance nasmyth had provided him with cartridges but they had somehow been left behind and on applying to gladwynes keeper he had been supplied with ammunition which it seemed was out of date  after all you have done well enough his companion resumed wed better get on to our next stationits right across the moor on the high ridge yonder dont bother about the birds  shall i leave them there  certainly do you want to carry them all the afternoon one of the keeper fellows will bring them along  the lads tone was half contemptuous he had already shown that he considered the canadian what he would have called an outsider but he was willing to make use of him  you might look after bella shes alone in the next buttand ive something else to do he said theres an awkward ghyll to cross and she wont carry anything lighter than a 14gun see she doesnt leave the cartridges in it  he strode away across the heather and lisle turned toward the turf shelter indicated as he approached it a girl appeared and glanced at him with very obvious curiosity but as he supposed that she was the sister of his late companion he did not expect any diffidence from her she was short in stature and slight in figure and dressed in grayish brown hat coat and remarkably short skirt all of the same material her hair was of a copper color her eyes which were rather narrow of a pale grayishgreen he would have called them hard and there was a hint of arrogance in her expression yet she was piquantly pretty  i suppose youre nasmyths canadian friend she began and went on without waiting for an answer as we occupy adjoining butts on the next drive you may take my gun teddy has deserted me  teddy queried lisle who wondered if she were referring to her brother i thought his name was jim  its marples stout friend with the dyed hair i mean i told him what would happen if he ate as he persisted in doing at lunch its too hot to gormandize i wasnt astonished when he collapsed at the steep place on the last walk reflecting that it was his own fault i left him  lisle was not charmed with the girls manners but he could not check a smile  are you tired you oughtnt to be she continued with another bold glance at him  no he replied if its any consolation to you im far from exhausted yet  thats reassuring she retorted you havent taken my gun  having forgotten it for the moment he flushed a little and she watched him with unconcealed amusement while he opened the weapon and took out the cartridges  whats that for she asked impertinently its hammerless theres nothing to catch  the pulloffs probably very light if its been made for a ladys use its sometimes possible to jar the strikers down when they set the springs to yield at a touch  then you know something about guns she said as if she had not expected this  not a great deal about the scatter kind though ive stripped a few  we never do that she informed him we send them to london still youre right the gun did go off when i knocked it jumping down from a wall  if youll let me have it tonight ill alter that i understand were going out again tomorrow  she considered a moment  well she consented with the air of one conferring a favor you may take it when weve finished  lisle wondered what had prompted him to make the offer the way she had addressed him was not ingratiating but he delighted in examining any fine mechanism and he had never handled such a beautifully made weapon  they plodded on side by side through the heather which was long and matted and presently seeing that she was breathless he stopped on the crest of a higher rise and once more looked about with keen appreciation  in front of him the crimson and purple heath was rent and fissured and in the deep gaps washed out by heavy rains the peat gleamed a warm chocolatebrown elsewhere patches of moss shone with an emerald brightness and there were outcrops of rock tinted lustrous gray and silver with lichens below near the foot of the moor ran a straight dark line of firs the one coldlysomber streak in the scene but beyond it the rolling sunlit plain ran back fading through ever varying and softening colors to the hazy blue heights of scotland  lisles companion noticed his intent expression  it is rather fine up here she conceded i sometimes feel its almost a pity one couldnt live among the heather certain things would be easier on these high levels  yes interrogated lisle slightly puzzled and astonished  youre obviously from the woods she smiled if you had spent a few years among my friends you would understand i was referring to the cultivation of ideas and manners which seem to be considered out of date now  lisle made no reply to this but he glanced too directly at a red stain on her hand  blood she explained i had a bet with alan that id get a brace more than flo thats why i went after a cripple running in the ling it wasnt dead when i picked it uprather horrid wasnt it  the man was conscious of some disgust she looked very young and slight as she was her figure was prettily rounded and she had a soft kittenish gracefulness but she spoke with the assurance of a dowager though he had killed and cut up many a deer he shrank from the small red stain on her delicate hand she saw it and laughed and then with a sudden change of mood she stooped and swiftly rubbed her fingers in the heather  now she said sharply if youre sufficiently rested well go on  lisle moved away but he asked a question  do many girls shoot in this country  no she answered with a mocking smile not so many after all thats comforting isnt it this kind of thing is hard work and damaging to the complexion  presently they came to a wall and lisle stopped in some uncertainty it was as high as his shoulders and built of loose rough stones  get over she ordered him then pull a lot of it down  he did so making though he endeavored to avoid this a rather wide hole  she scrambled through agilely and then regarded him with surprise as he proceeded to replace the stones  why are you doing that she asked  there are sheep up here  too many considering that its a grousemoor but what of it they dont belong to us  they belong to somebody who would rather they didnt stray lisle rejoined in the country i come from its considered a serious transgression to knock over another persons fence and not put it up again  he calmly went on with his task and sitting down she took out a silver cigarettecase after a minute or two she looked up at him  youre doing that very neatly she remarked  ive done something of the kind for a living lisle informed her  oh its curious that you seem proud of it in this case i dont mind your keeping me because they cant drive up the birds until we have crossed the higher moor it will annoy gladwyne and his keeper and im not pleased with either of them i wanted flo marples station at the first butts  lisle considered this he had wondered why she had favored him with her company when although her previous companion had deserted her she could by hurrying a little have joined the others the butts were not spaced very far apart their late occupants had however now vanished into a dip of the moor he asked himself why a girl with her assurance should have troubled to offer him an explanation  when he had finished the repairs to the wall they went on and a little later he heard a sharp cruckcruckcurruck to one side of him swinging around he saw a grouse skimming the heather  a pair of gloves to a sovereign that you miss cried his companion  the bird was flying fast lisle had to load and by the time he had snapped in a cartridge it was a long range this however was somewhat in his favor as he was better used to the rifle there was a flash and the bird struck the heath the girl glanced at him in unveiled appreciation  a clean kill she exclaimed you have won the gloves and youll deserve them before you have heard the last of this incident i suppose you dont know that you shouldnt have fired a shot except from behind the butts  she watched his expression with open amusement  you dont like to ask why i tempted you she went on it was to vex the keeper you may have turned back the birds the beaters are driving up  thanks for the information lisle said coolly do you mind my inquiring whether you would have taken the sovereign in case id missed as you suggested im lately from the wilds  of course she mocked i could have had it drilled and worn it on a chain  the man made no comment as they went on presently they came to a deep rift in the moor through which a stream leaped sparkling the girl scrambled down waistdeep in yellow fern but the other side was steep and stony and she was glad of help when he held out his hand they made the ascent with some difficulty and on reaching the summit she looked around breathless  this is a romantic spot if youre interested in the legends of the border she told him  i am lisle said and she sat down among the heather  its an excuse for a rest she confessed the old mosstroopers used to ride this way to ravage cumberland it was advisable for them to follow hidden paths among the moors and once an interesting little skirmish took place among those brakes down the hollow  she pointed toward a spot where the ravine widened into a level strip of quaggy grass and moss which glowed a brilliant emerald on either side of it a gnarled and stunted growth of alders and birches fringed the foot of the steep slopes and between them the stream spread out across a stretch of milkwhite stones the hollow was flooded with light and filled with the soft murmur of running water  it would be a strong place to hold if the defenders had time to choose their ground lisle remarked  so it proved replied his companion well once upon a time a bold scots reaver riding south saw a maid who pleased him near a cumberland pele his admiration was not reciprocated but he came again often though being an armed thief by profession there was a price upon his head it is stated that on each occasion he returned unaccompanied by any of the cattle belonging to his ladys relatives which was an unusual piece of forbearance in those days men must have been able to disassociate business from their lovemaking  dont they do so now lisle inquired lazily  she looked at him with a smile which had a hint of real bitterness in its light mockery  not often one would imagine perhaps they cant be blamedim afraid were all given to cultivating dreadfully expensive tastes no doubt when it was needful the border chieftain of the story could live on oatmeal and water and instead of buying pedigree hunters he probably stole his pony he haunted the neighborhood of the pele until the maid became afraid and urged her kinsmen to rid her of him several of them tried and failedwhich wasnt surprising  love made him invulnerable lisle suggested  no retorted his companion a man with a heart constant and stout enough to face the risks he ran would be hard to kill when you read between the lines its a moving tale think of the long perilous rides he made through an enemys land all for a glance at his disdainful lady they watched the fords in those days but neither brawling rivers nor wellmounted horsemen could stop him at last he came one night with a dozen spears broke in the barmkin gate and carried her off all her relatives rode hard after them and came up with them in this ghyll then there happened what was in one way a rather remarkable thingthe abducted maid firmly declined to be rescued there was a brisk encounter i believe two or three were killed but she rode off to scotland with her lover i suppose i neednt point the moral  i can see only the ancient onethat its unwise to take a ladys no as conclusive lisle ventured  she laughed at him in a daring manner  the pity is that we havent often a chance of saying it to any one worth while but ill express the moral in a prettier waysometimes disinterested steadfastness and real devotion count with us unfortunately theyre scarce  there was a challenge in her glance but the man not knowing what was expected of him made no answer at first he had been almost repelled by the girl but he was becoming mildly interested in her she could he thought be daring to the verge of coarseness and he did not admire her pessimism which was probably a pose but there was a vein of elfish mischief in her that appealed to him sitting among the heather small lithe and felinely graceful watching him with a provocative smile in her rather narrow eyes she compelled his attention  well she laughed youre not much of a courtier but doesnt that story bring you back into touch with elemental thingstreacherous mosses dark nights flooded rivers passion peril dauntlessness now were wrapped about with empty futilities  he understood part of what was in her mind and sympathized with it he had lived close to nature in stern grapple with her unbridled forces from women he demanded no more than beauty or gentleness but a man he thought should for a time at least be forced to learn the stress and joy of the tense struggle with cold and hunger heat and thirst on long marches or in some dogged attack on rock and flood he had only contempt for the wellfed idlers who lounged through life not always as he suspected even gracefully these however were ideas he had no intention of expressing  there are still people who have to face realities in the newer lands and i dare say you have some in this country on your railroads and in your mines for example he said but hadnt we better be getting on  they left the brink of the hollow and plodded through the heather toward where a row of butts stood beneath a lofty ridge of the moor a man appeared from behind one as they approached and glanced at them with unconcealed disapproval  couldnt you have got here earlier bella he asked in another few minutes youd have spoiled the drivethe birds cant be far off the dip of the ridge hardly fair to the keepers or the rest of us to take these risks is it  when i do wrong i never confess it clarence the girl replied you ought to know that by now  lisle heard the name and became suddenly intentthis was clarence gladwyne there was no doubt that he was a handsome man he was tall and held himself finely he had a light springy figure with dark eyes and hair besides there was a certain stamp of refinement or fastidiousness upon him which was only slightly spoiled by the veiled hint of languid insolence in his expression  i heard a shot he resumed  ive no doubt you did the girl agreed an old cock grouse got up in front of usit was irresistibly tempting  gladwyne turned to lisle with a slight movement of his shoulders which was somehow expressive of halfindulgent contempt  youre nasmyths friend from canada i guess you dont understand these things but you might have made the birds break back he said however we must get under cover nowtheres your butt ill see you later  he turned away and lisle took up his station behind the wall of turf pointed to he had once upon a time been forcibly rebuked for his clumsiness at some unaccustomed task in the canadian bush and had not resented it but the faint movement of gladwynes shoulders had brought a warmth to his face the girl noticed this  clarence can be unpleasant when he likes but there are excuses for him she said a days shooting is one of the things we take seriously and manners are not at a higher premium here than i suppose they are in the wilds  lisle made no response and there was silence on the sunsteeped moor until a row of small dark objects skimming the crest of the ridge above became silhouetted against the sky then a gun cracked away to the right and in another moment a dropping fusillade broke out     chapter viii  gladwyne receives a shock   it was about nine oclock in the evening and gladwynes somewhat noisy guests were scattered about his house and the terrace in front of it several of them had gathered in the hall and bella crestwick lisles companion on the moors stood cigarette in hand with one foot on the oldfashioned hearthirons frankly discussing him a few birch logs glowed behind the bars for on those high uplands the autumn nights were chilly but the wide door stood open revealing a pale green band of light behind the black hills and allowing the sweet cool air of the moors to flow in  the girl had gained something by the change from her outdoor attire to the clinging evening dress but it was with characteristic unconcern that she disregarded the fact that the thin skirt fell well away from one shapely ankle effectively displayed by a stocking of the finest texture  the man she said is a bit of a puritan they still live over there dont they his idea of english women is evidently derived from what his father told him or from earlyvictorian literature im inclined to believe i shocked him  its highly probable laughed a man lounging near still i believe the descendants of the folks you mention live three thousand miles from his country in the neighborhood of the atlantic shore one wouldnt fancy that youd like puritans  there was nothing offensive in the words but his glance was a little too bold and too familiar and bella looked at him with a gleam of malice in her eyes  extremes meet its the middlethe medium mediocritythats irreconcilable with either end she retorted for instance i led a life of severe asceticism all last lent there were incredulous smiles though the statement was perfectly correct its a course i could confidently recommend to you she proceeded unheeding of late you have been putting on flesh with an alarming rapidity  the man made no response and bella resumed  besides the puritans have their good points theyre so refreshingly sure of themselves and their views while the rest of us dont believe in anything you cant be a fanatic without being thorough and in renouncing the world and the flesh you may gain more than a passable figure among other things the ascetic life means straight shooting steady hands and an eye you can depend upon the overcivilized man who does nothing to counterbalance his luxuriousness is generally a rotter  but what has all this to do with nasmyths canadian somebody asked  bella waved her cigarette  try to walk a steep moor with him and youll see if thats not sufficient take the same butt with him when the grouse are coming over  suddenly she straightened herself dropping her foot from the iron and flinging the cigarette into the fire as a grayhaired lady entered the hall she had been a beauty years ago and now her fragility emphasized the fineness of her features and the clear pallor of her skin she was dressed in a thin black fabric and her beautifully shaped hands gleamed unusually white against its somber folds  wheres clarence she asked the group collectively in a voice that was singularly clear and penetrative i havent seen him for the last halfhour  one of the men immediately went in search of him and the lady crossed the hall to where millicent gladwyne was sitting for the time being alone millicent had noticed bellas sudden change of demeanor upon her hostesss entrance with something between amusement and faint disgust mrs gladwyne was what bella would have called earlyvictorian in her views and she would occasionally have been disturbed by the conversation of some of her sons guests had she not been a little deaf  sitting quiet she said to millicent who was a favorite of hers and her voice carried farther than she was aware of as she continued i heard the laughter and it brought me down though i want to tell clarence something i like to see bright faces but the times have changed since i was young we were a little more reserved and not so noisy then  a dear old thing its a pity shes quite so antediluvian bella remarked to a man at her side  isnt that the natural penalty of being a dear old thing laughed her companion theres no doubt we have progressed pretty rapidly of late  clarence appeared shortly after this and was gently chidden by his mother for going out without his hat because the autumn nights were getting chilly a few minutes later footsteps became audible outside the open door and nasmyth entered the hall with lisle it was spacious and indifferently lighted the others standing near the hostess concealed her and lisle stopped for a word with bella then nasmyth noticed mrs gladwyne and called to his companion  this way vernon  clarence swung round with a start and cast a swift glance at the stranger and millicent wondered why his face set hard but the next moment nasmyth led up the canadian and presented him mrs gladwyne had risen and lisle made a little respectful inclination over the delicate hand she held out age had but slightly spoiled her beauty she had still a striking presence and a manner in which a trace of stateliness was counterbalanced by gentle goodhumor lisle was strongly impressed but as millicent noticed he betrayed no awkwardness  i seem to have heard your name before in connection with canada said mrs gladwyne confusing it with his surname ah yes of course it was georges guide i was thinking of she turned to millicent adding in an audible aside ive a bad habit of forgetting forgive me my dear  everything considered it was perhaps the most awkward thing she could have said but lisles bronzed face was imperturbable and gladwyne had promptly recovered his composure as he realized the mistake still for a moment he had been badly startled nobody noticed nasmyth which was fortunate because his unnatural immobility would have betrayed him  id been expecting you both earlier told you to come to dinner said his host  then he addressed lisle  as my mother mentioned i had once something to do with a man called vernon in canada  knowing what he did lisle fancied that gladwynes indifferent tone had cost him an effort  its only my christian name as you have heard he explained  you were up in the bush with nasmyth were you not  yes answered lisle i met him quite by chance in a victoria hotel when i happened to have a few weeks at my disposal which i thought of spending in the wilds when he heard that i intended making a trip through the northern part of the country and suggested that we should go together i was glad to consent  then you belong to victoria  i was located there when i met nasmyth before that i was up in the yukon district for some time since leaving him ive lived in the city  he thought gladwyne was relieved at his answer for the latter smiled genially  well he said we must try to make your visit to this country pleasant  shortly after this the group broke up and gladwyne escaping from his guests slipped out on to the terrace and walked up and down nasmyth had merely mentioned that he had a canadian friend staying with him somehow a formal introduction had been omitted during the day on the moors and gladwyne had been badly disconcerted when he heard the man addressed as vernon the name vividly recalled a canadian episode that he greatly desired to forget and he had indeed to some extent succeeded in doing so that unfortunate affair was done with he had assured himself for two years it had scarcely been mentioned in his hearing but for a horrible moment which had taxed his courage to the utmost he had almost fancied that it was about to be brought to light again lisles answer and manner had however reassured him nasmyth had met the man accidentally and it was merely as the result of this that they had made the journey through the bush together it was evident that he had been needlessly alarmed  for all that he was troubled living for his own pleasure as he did he was nevertheless a man who valued other peoples good opinion and prided himself upon doing the correct and most graceful thing there was no doubt that he had once badly failed in this but it was in a moment of physical weakness when he was exhausted and famishing after all it was most probable that his cousin had died before he could have reached him and there were he thought few men who if similarly situated would have faced the risk of the return journey still the truth would have had an ugly sound had it come out this was why he had spread the story of the guides defection which he now regretted it might not have been strictly necessary but he had reached the trappers camp on the verge of a collapse too far gone to reason out the matter calmly a man in that condition could hardly be held accountable for his action besides it was incredible that the guides statement that he had made the journey without replenishing his provisions could be correct  his reflections were interrupted by mrs gladwyne who came out wrapped in a shawl  why are you here alone she asked you look disturbed has anything gone wrong  gladwyne was sorry that she had joined him where the light from a window fell on his face but he smiled  no he answered quietly for he was always gentle with her i only felt that id rather avoid the chatter of the others for a few minutes i suppose it was the mans name together with your reference to george that upset me  mrs gladwyne laid her hand on his arm she was inordinately fond and proud of the son whom she had spoiled  i sometimes think you are too sensitive on that point clarence she said of course it was very tragic and we both owe george a great deal but you did all that anybody could have done  the man winced and it was fortunate that they had now left the light behind and his mother could not see his face  i could have stayed and died with him he broke out with unaffected bitterness there were times at the beginning when i was sorry i let him send me away  mrs gladwyne shook her head reproachfully she was gracious and quietly dignified and refined in thought but for all that she was not one to appreciate such a sacrifice as he had indicated  im afraid that was an undue exaggeration of a natural feeling she remonstrated how could your staying have helped him when by going in search of help you increased his only chance of safety i have always been glad you were clearheaded enough to realize it instead of yielding to mistaken emotional inclinations  gladwyne felt hot with shame his mother had an unshaken confidence in his honor which was the less surprising because her perceptions had never been very keen and she had always shrunk from the contemplation of unpleasant things it was an amiable weakness of hers to idealize those she loved and by resolutely shutting her eyes on occasions she succeeded in accomplishing it more or less successfully clarence was of course aware of this and it hurt to remember that in deserting his cousin he had been prompted chiefly by craven fear his mother however quite unconscious of what she was doing further humiliated him  of course she continued if you had found the cache of provisions it would have been your duty to return to george at any hazard and i have no doubt whatever that you would have gone  the damp stood beaded on the mans forehead he realized that even his lenient and indulgent mother would shrink from him if she knew that he had abandoned his dying benefactor like a treacherous coward he said nothing and they had strolled to the end of the terrace before she spoke again  i think it would be better to go back to the others and drive away these morbid ideas she advised its a duty to look at the brightest side of everything  he made no answer but he strove with some degree of success to recover his usual tranquillity as they turned toward the entrance of the hall  in the meanwhile lisle had been talking to millicent she had already made a marked impression on him for in the wilds the man had acquired a swift and true insight into character one has time to think in the lonely places where since life itself often depends upon their accuracy a mans perceptions grow keen and though some of the minor complexities and subtleties of modern civilization might have puzzled him he was seldom mistaken in essentials  he liked her direct and calmly searching gaze he liked her voice which while soft and pleasant had a trace of gravity in it he knew that her fine carriage was a sign of physical vigor and he recognized how it had been gained by the clear warm tinting of her slightly sundarkened skin but apart from this and her comeliness which was marked there was that in her personality which spoke of evenness and depth of character she was steadfast not lightly to be swayed from a resolve he thought  nasmyth has often spoken about you she told him i understand it was chiefly by your help that he succeeded in reaching the scene of my brothers death i want to thank you for that  her voice was quiet but it did not betoken indifference he knew that she was not one to forget he could not think of any apposite answer but she saw the sympathy in his eyes and it pleased her more than words would have done  it was a relief to me that nasmyth made that journey she went on i wanted to learn everything that could be knowninstead of shrinking from it you see i had a great faith in my brother  he deserved it lisle declared warmly i have gathered enough to convince me of that  thank you clarence was not in a condition to notice anything very clearly during his journey and i think what he suffered blunted his recollection besides the subject is a distressing one to him and it is seldom he can be induced to speak about it perhaps that is a pity i find it does not always save one trouble in the end to avoid a little immediate pain  lisle was gratified she had spoken so unrestrainedly though he imagined that it was a somewhat unusual thing for her to take a stranger into her confidence  yes he replied i think thats very true its better to face it and get it over the wound sooner heals  she smiled rather wistfully and changed the subject  i told nasmyth that you taught him to see  i suppose i did acknowledged lisle still it was only as far as it concerned the things that im acquainted with im not sure that my meanings very clear  i understand you knew what to expect that carries one a long way were you disappointed in finding it  he was a little surprised at her keenness and rather confused this was a question that could not be directly answered  what i was more particularly referring to was the meaning of such things as a broken branch a gap in a thicket or a few displaced stones he explained i taught him what to infer from those  yes she said i understand that you discovered nothing newi mean nothing that could throw any further light upon what befell my brother after the others left him  he was glad that he could answer her candidly  no we can only suppose that the conclusions the rescue party came to were correct but all that we found relating to the week or two before the separation spoke of the courageous struggle that your brother made and his generosity in sending the others away  she bent her head  that she said quietly is only what one would have expected he left a diary you must come over and see it  i should like to if it wouldnt be painful to you  no she replied i shall be glad to show it to you  she left him shortly after this and strolled out on to the terrace thinking about him the little she had seen of him had pleased her he had earnest eyes and a resolute air and she liked the men who lived in the open he was direct and perhaps a little rudimentary without being awkward which was in his favor for subtlety of any kind was distasteful to her still in one respect she was disappointedhe had in no way amplified nasmyths story and she had expected to hear a little more of the expedition from him     chapter ix  lisle gathers information   nasmyths dinner was over and he lay pipe in hand in an easychair in his smokingroom with lisle lounging opposite him they had been walking up partridges among the higher turnip fields all day and now both were pleasantly tired and filled with languid goodhumor nasmyths house was oldit had been built out of the remains of a border peleand the room was paneled to the ceiling and very simply furnished it had an ancient look and an ancient smell and the few articles of plain oak furniture harmonized with it the window stood wide open and the fragrance of a grove of silver firs outside drifted in the surroundings had their effect on lisle who had not been accustomed to dwellings of that kind  you have been here a fortnight and must have formed a few opinions about us nasmyth remarked at length you neednt be shy about expressing them and ive no doubt there are things youd like to ask  as a whole my opinions highly favorable lisle announced with a smile id be uncommonly hard to please if it werent  thats flattering but im not sure that i meant as a whole i had a few particular instances in my mind bella crestwick for example im curious to hear what you think of her she seems quite favorably impressed with you  shes interesting lisle replied a type thats new to me the latest development isnt it anyway i like herwhatever the admissions worththough i must say that i found her rather startling at first shes honest i think and that counts for a good deal  i suppose youre not aware that shes desirably rich  i wasnt its not a fact of any moment to me besides ive a suspicion that its gladwynes scalp shes after  nasmyth nodded  youre pretty shrewd though ive had much greater opportunities for observation that idea has only lately occurred to me of course in a general way i shouldnt discuss my acquaintances in this casual fashion but as you are likely to see a good deal of us there are things youd better know  ill explain my point of view said lisle refilling his pipe you have seen something of the kind of life ive led half my time i suppose has been spent in primeval surroundings the rest in contact with the latest efforts of a rather unfinished civilization well what you have to show me here is vastly different these old houses your smootheddown ways are a revelation to me the polish on some of your furniture has taken several hundred years to put on that in my victoria quarters smells of the factory and the board walls of other hotels ive lived in rend into big cracks because theyre fresh from the mill im full of interest everythings new to me but so far my curiositys impersonal im taking no hand in anything  his companions face grew grave  the trouble is that you may not be able to avoid it later youre here and some part will probably be forced on you however as i said i think youre right about bella  but her money would be no great inducement to gladwyne  thats not certain clarence has a way of squandering money and you may as well understand that theres very little to be derived from agricultural property george had his mothers money but he left it to millicent clarence got only the land thats what made a match between them seem so desirable  desirable lisle broke out its impossible not to be contemplated  yes nasmyth agreed quietly if necessary it will have to be prevented i was only stating popular opinion  there was something curious in his tone and lisle looked hard at him their eyes met full for a moment and the thoughts of each were clear to the other  if anything must be done it will fall to you nasmyth went on in this case it would be particularly invidious for me to interfere but if there had been nobody else id have broken off the match  lisle made no comment but there was comprehension and sympathy in his expression and nasmyth nodded  yes he acknowledged its an open secret that i would have looked for nothing better than to marry millicent gladwyne he paused with a slight flush creeping into his bronzed face for all that i knew some years ago that i hadnt the faintest chance and never would have i have her confidence and friendship that has to be enough  i think its a good deal said lisle  there was silence for a minute or two and then lisle asked a question  how could a girl like millicent gladwyne ever contemplate the possibility of marrying clarence  its puzzling to me these things often are to outsiders still clarence is a handsome man and i think george was in favor of the match which would count with her then in a way she was always fond of clarence and now that she has the money and hes far from prospering on the land the idea that she could set him firmly on his feet by sharing her possessions with him may prove tempting its very much the sort of thing that would appeal to her  you suggest that she isnt strongly attached to the man  i really believe she isnt but for all that im sometimes afraid shell end by marrying him its very probable that she suspects some of his faults but im not sure theyd deter her it would make her more compassionate believing it was her duty to help himthat kind of things an old delusion still to do the fellow justice he hasnt of late shown much eagerness to profit by his opportunities  lisle mused for a few moments it struck him that nasmyth had described a very fine type of woman which was quite in accordance with his own ideas of miss gladwyne  what led gladwyne to cultivate marple and the crestwicks he asked theyre different from the rest of you  i cant say its a point ive wondered about though marple and his rather rowdy friends are prosperous i can better see why they got hold of clarence  i dont see it responded lisle remember im an unsophisticated stranger in search of information if theyve means enough cant they associate with whom they like  nasmyth smiled but there was a trace of diffidence in his manner  in a way youre right but there are limits more particularly in such a place as this the counties im sometimes thankful dont keep pace with london its a little difficult to explain but were oldfashioned and possibly prejudiced here anyhow we exercise a certain amount of caution in the choice of our friends  but mrs gladwyne seems cordial to the people you object to and one would imagine that shes the embodiment of your best traditions a worthy representative of the old régime  mrs gladwyne is a remarkably fine lady but its unfortunate that shes a little deaf andit must be ownednot particularly intelligent a good deal of what goes on escapes her besides she has always idolized clarence and that would account for her not seeing his friends failings  its curious that gladwyne makes so much of that young crestwick  ive wondered about it nasmyth confessed the lads viciousand ive an idea that the influence clarence has over him isnt beneficial in fact im sorry for his sister she has been given her head too young but in my opinion the girls the pick of a very indifferent bunch  but you havent accounted for these peoples desire to be on good terms with gladwyne  nasmyth hesitated  oh well since youre so persistent the crestwicks have evidently been left with ample means acquired by their parents not much education and big ambitions they can get into certain circles but that wont content them and other doors which gladwyne can open to them are shut after all hes a good sportsman a man of some culture with a manner thats likely to impress such people the lads holding on to him and taking his worst aspect for a copy while clarence seems willing to extend his patronage  for some consideration  nasmyth looked disturbed  its unpleasant but i cant help feeling that youre right one way or another young crestwick will have to pay his entrance fees he rose and stretched himself lazily ill spoil my temper if i say any more about it and as weve had a long day im off to bed  lisle followed him from the room but he was up early the next morning and strolled down to the river while the light was creeping across the moors and the dew lay thick upon the grass thinking over what he had heard on the previous night it was his nature to be interested in almost everything and he was curious to learn what he could of the people to whom his father had belonged in canada he had for the most part met only men of somewhat primitive habits and simple desires grappling with rock and forest or with single purpose toiling to acquire wealth in the new cities what was more to the purpose few of them were married now he was thrown among a people not more intelligentindeed he thought they were less endowed with practically useful knowledgebut in some respects more complex actuated by different and less obvious ambitions and desires he felt impelled to watch them though he recognized that as nasmyth had predicted this might not be all it was possible that sooner or later he would be drawn into action  he reached the stream at a spot where it flowed still and clear beneath a birch wood a few of the leaves were green but most of them gleamed a delicate saffron among the gray and silver stems and the ground beneath was flecked with yellow behind the trees rough lichened rock and stony slopes ran up to a bare ridge silhouetted against the roseate glow of the morning sky the sun had not risen the water lay in shadow it was very quiet and rather cold and lisle was surprised to see millicent gladwyne picking her way cautiously over a bank of stones it was only her movements that betrayed her for her neutraltinted attire harmonized with the background but when she caught sight of him she left the foot of the slope she was skirting and came directly toward him he thought she looked wonderfully fresh and wholesome and he noticed that she carried a small camera  im afraid you have spoiled my sport she laughed i was after an otterthough you mustnt tell nasmyth that there is one about here  certainly not acquiesced lisle but why  he would consider it his duty to bring up the hounds the next meet isnt it curious how slaughter appeals to a man but nasmyth isnt unreasonable there are reserves in which even the jays he longs to shoot have sanctuary  but you were looking for an otter  yes i wanted its picture not its life ive got several but im not satisfied though ive been lucky lately i got a dabchicktheyre growing scarcenot long ago  well try the next pool if youll let me come suggested lisle im pretty good at trailing but what do you want with their pictures  for my book she told him i have to make ever so many drawings in color before i get them right if youre fond of the wild creatures ill show them to you  lisle said that he would be delighted and they went on keeping back among tall brushwood where they skirted the swift stream at the head of the pool and then proceeding cautiously with the outline of their figures softened by the heathy slopes behind at length creeping up through a thin growth of alders they stopped near another still reach and the girl pointed to a few floating objects on its surface  youre good at trailing or theyd have taken fright she said still i think i will surprise you if you will wait here  mallard lisle commented young birdseven where we seldom disturb them theyre shy  she slipped away through the alders and he noticed how little noise she made though the lower branches here and there brushed against her gliding form she was wonderfully light and graceful in her movements as she came out into the open there was a startled quack or two from the birds lisle expected to see them rise from the water but she called softly and to his vast astonishment they ceased paddling away from her she called again and they turned and swam cautiously toward her and when she took a handful of something from a pocket and flung it upon the surface of the stream three or four heads were stretched forward to seize the morsels  while the birds drew nearer lisle looked on admiring she had roused his interest when he had first seen her in her rich evening dress but now he thought she made a far more striking picture and her sympathy with the timid wild creatures which evidently knew and trusted her awakened something responsive in him half the pool now glimmered in the rosy light with here and there an alder branch reflected upon its mirrorlike surface and millicent stood on a strip of gravel with her figure clearly outlined against it dressed in closelyfitting softcolored tweed tall and finely symmetrical she harmonized with rock and flood wonderfully well lisle had occasionally seen a bush ranchers daughter armed with gun or fishingrod look very much at home in similar surroundings but this english lady of culture and station reared in civilized luxury appeared equally in her right place  he afterward recollected each adjunct of the scenethe stillness the pale gleam of the water and the aromatic smell of fallen leaves but the alluring central figure formed the sharpest memory by and by she clapped her hands the ducks rose and flew away upstream with necks stretched out and she came back toward him laughing softly  sometimes they will come almost up to my feet but im afraid its hardly fair to inspire them with an undue confidence in human nature it might cost them dear  youre wonderful lisle exclaimed expressing what he felt for she seemed to him endowed with every gracious quality  oh she smiled theres nothing really remarkable in what i showed you i happened to find the nest and by slow degrees disarmed the mother birds suspicions mallard have been domesticated you know though theyre often hard to get very near but we may as well turn back its now too late to see an otter im inclined to think theyre the shyest of all the british wild creatures  they moved away downstream side by side and some time later she left him where a stilepath crossed a meadow  come and see my drawings whenever you like she said on parting  lisle determined to go as soon as possible quite apart from the drawings the idea of going had its attractions for him and he walked homeward determined that this girl should never marry clarence gladwyne it was unthinkablethat was the only word for it     chapter x  bellas champion   it was early in the afternoon when lisle arrived at millicents house and after a glance at its quaint exterior was ushered into her drawingroom there he sat down and looked about while he waited the salient tones of its decoration were white and aqueous blue and the effect struck him as pleasantly chaste and cool among the rather mixed ornaments were a couple of marble statuettes the figures airily poised and very finely wrought next he noticed some daintily carved objects in ivory and a picture in watercolor of a wide gray stretch of moor with distance and solitude skilfully conveyed he had risen to examine it when millicent entered  im glad you came though as youre used to the life of the woods and rivers im a little diffident about showing you my sketches she said im afraid ive kept you waiting  lisle smiled and she liked the candidly humorous gleam in his eyes  nasmyth warned me that i was earlyor rather he said that if i were going to visit anybody else i would have been too soon id better confess however that ive been making a good use of the time things of this kindhe indicated the statuettesare almost new to me they strike me as unusually fine  yes she answered realizing that he had an artistic eye they are beautifuland one sees so many that are not george brought them from italy for me thisshe moved toward a representation in ivory of a mogul gatewayis of course a different style but its remarkable in its patient elaboration of detail the mosques not so fine nasmyth sent me the pair from india he once made a trip to the fringe of the himalayas  lisle examined the object carefully and she waited with some interest for his comment  its wonderful he declared i suppose its a truthful copy  im inclined to think the man who carved that had not the gift of imagination he merely reproduced faithfully what he saw  different peoples have strikingly different ways havent they commented lisle while they were making that small eastern arch wed fling up a thriving wooden town or build a hotel of steel and cement to hold a thousand guests the biggest bridges that carry our great freighttrains across the roaring gorges in the rockies cost less labor  i should imagine it what then  he studied the carved ivory  in a dry climate the original of this would last for centuriesit has lasted since the days of the mogulsan object of beauty for generations to enjoy perhaps those old builders used their time as well as we do our works serve their purpose but one cant call them pretty  she was pleased with his answer  i think that gets the strongest hold on me he went on glancing toward the picture of the moor its real  there was a hint of diffidence in millicents expression  but you can hardly judge can you you have scarcely seen the english moors  ive spent a while on the high albertan plains and you have the same things yonder the vast sweep of sky the rolling waste running on forever its all in that picture how expressed i dont knowthere are only the grades of color scarcely a line to gage the distance by still the sense of space is vivid  millicent blushed  youre an indulgent critic that drawing is my own  he did not appear embarrassed though she saw that he had not suspected the fact she had already noticed that when he might perhaps have looked awkward he only looked serious  after what you have said she resumed ill show you the other things with greater confidence do you know i thought all you western people were grimly utilitarian  he sat down and considered this the man could laugh readily but he was also characterized by a certain gravity which she found refreshing by contrast with the light glibness to which she was more accustomed  well he reasoned in my opinion the white mans greatest superiority over all other peoples is his capacity for making useful thingseven if theyre only ugly sawmills or grimy locomotives philosophy never fed any one or lightened anybodys toil commerce is a convenience but the man who makes a big profit out of it is only levying a heavy toll on somebody else it seems to me that all our actual benefits come from the constructor  have you been building sawmills millicent asked mischievously  he laughed with open goodhumor oh no thats why im free to talk i happened to find a lode with some gold in it and gold is only a handy means of exchanging things ill own that i was probably doing more useful work when i stood up to my waist in icewater fitting sharp stones into a pulpmill dam  perhaps youre right millicent agreed but it sounds severe what of the people who never do anything directly useful at all  there are a few who by just going up and down in it keep the world sweet and clean some of the rest could very well be spared  then you believe that everybody must practically justify his existence  if he fails to do so with us his existence generally ceases the wilderness where i found the gold is full of the bones of the unfit  millicent spread out some drawings most were in color in some cases several of the same object done with patient care and she was strangely pleased when she saw the quick appreciation in his eyes  an otter its alive he remarked youve shown it working through a shallow looking much less like an animal than a fishthats right  i made half a dozen sketches and im not satisfied yet  thorough he commented you get there if you have to hammer the heart out of whatever youre up against  its my brothers book she answered im finishing it for him he did other thingsmost of them useful indirectly ive only thisand id like my part to be good  he nodded sympathetically looking troubled  i can understand he said i had a partneri owe him more than i could ever have repaid and he left a troublesome piece of work to me it will have to be put through but let me see some more theyre great  she showed him a red jay a tiny goldcrest perched on a thorn branch a kingfisher gleaming with turquoise hues poised ready for a dive upon a frothlapped stone he was no cultured critic but he knew the ways of the wild creatures and saw that she had talent for her representations of them were instinct with life  they were interrupted by a scratching at the door and when she opened it a white setter hobbled awkwardly in and curled itself at her feet  hes rather a big dog for the house but i cant keep him away from me she explained as you see he has lost a foot in a trap and he was marked for destruction when i asked for him sometimes i think he knows that i saved his life  the dog looked up and raising a paw scraped at her hand until she opened it when he thrust his chin into her palm it was a trivial incident but it somehow stirred the man  now i know where you got power to draw these lesser brethren he said study alone would never have given it to you  she let this pass he was almost embarrassing in his directness though she acquitted him of any crude intention of flattering her  i promised to let you read my brothers diary she reminded him if you will wait a few moments ill get it  the dog pattered after her as though unwilling to remain out of her sight and she came back presently with a small leather case and opening it took out a tattered notebook noticing how she handled it and that the case was beautifully made lisle fancied that it was precious to her in which he was correct indeed she was then wondering why she had volunteered to show it to this stranger when only two of her intimate friends had seen it  thank you he said when she gave it to him and drawing his chair nearer the window he began to read  though he was already acquainted with most of it the story gripped him on the surface it was merely a plain record of a hazardous and laborious journey but to one gifted with understanding it was more than thisa vivid narrative of a struggle waged against physical suffering weakness and hunger by optimistic human nature an odd word here a line or two in another place was eloquent of simple steadfast courage and endurance and even when the weakening man clearly knew that his end was near there was no outbreak of desperation or sign of faltering he had dragged himself onward to the last indomitable  then lisle proceeded to examine the book more closely it showed the effects of exposure to the weather to an unusual degree considering that the covers were thick and that the rescue party had recovered it shortly after its owners death moreover lisle did not think that george gladwyne would have left it in the snow several pages were missing and having been over the ground he knew that they recorded the part of the journey during which the two caches of provisions had been made and he had already decided that there would be a list of their contents this conclusion was confirmed by the fact that gladwyne had enumerated the stores they started with and had once or twice made a reduced list when they had afterward taken stock the abstraction of the records was clearly clarences work then he realized that he had spent some time in perusing the diary and he handed it back to millicent with something that implied a respect for it she noticed the sparkle in his eyes and her heart warmed toward him  its the greatest story ive ever read he declared  she made no answer but he knew that she was pleased and it filled him with a wish to tell her that she was very much like her dead brother more he could not have said but remembering that he had already gone as far as was permissible he had sense enough to repress the inclination he saw the girls lips close firmly as if she were conscious of some emotion but there was silence for a minute or two he broke it at length  i know that you have granted me a very great privilege and im grateful he told her and added because he thought a partial change of the subject might be considerate in a way its hard to realize that tale in this restful place its easier out yonder where what you could call the general tone is different  nasmyth once said something like that millicent replied i suppose the change is marked  lisle nodded  here you have order peace security in the wilds its all battle the survival of the strong frost and ice rending the solid hills rivers scoring out deep ravines beast destroying beast or struggling with starvation mans not exempt either a small blundera deer missed or a flour bag lostmay cost him his life for the difference you have to thank the constructor the maker of plows and spades and more complex machines  thats one of your pet hobbies isnt it  he once more changed the subject  i wish that i could show you the wilderness he said  millicent looked thoughtful  i should like to see it ive an idea that if this book is well received i might perhaps try something a little more ambitiousthe larger beasts and wilder birds of other countries in that case i should choose british columbia  then you will let me be your guide  she made a conditional promise and shortly afterward he left her meeting nasmyth he walked with him toward gladwynes house where they found the guests assembled on the lawn and mrs gladwyne sitting by a teatable one or two young women were standing near and several men had gathered about a mat laid upon the grass fifty yards from where a small target had been set up lisle joined bella crestwick who detached herself from the others  what is this he asked its a very short range  miniature rifle shooting she informed him its becoming popular gladwyne has been trying to form a club my brother jim is president of some league hes rather keen and there are reasons why im glad of it  she added the last words confidentially and lisle ventured to nod it struck him that a healthy interest in any organized work or amusement would be beneficial to young crestwick the girl looked at him as if considering something and then she seemed to make up her mind  theres one thing i dont like she complained they will shoot for high stakes jim isnt a bad shot but hes too eager im afraid hes inclined to be venturesome just now  lisle thought that she had a request to make there was something about him that inspired confidence and the girl had made a friend of him  what do you want me to do he asked  she made a sign of impatience he was too direct oh she pouted arent you taking a good deal for granted still you bushmen can shoot cant you  as a rule lisle answered i almost think i see  then she retorted you shouldnt have said so you should merely have smiled and acted  im from the wilds you mustnt expect too much well if youll excuse me  she flashed a grateful glance at him and he sauntered toward the group of men among whom gladwyne stood there was a sharp crack as he approached them a thin streak of smoke drifted across the figure lying on the mat and a man beside it lowered the glasses he held  high to the left he announced youre not in good form jim hadnt you better give up  lisle studied the speaker whom he had met once or twice already he was approaching middleage and was inclined to corpulence but there was something in his pose that suggested a military training his face was fleshy but the features were bold and he was coarsely handsome as a rule he affected an easy goodhumor but lisle had felt that there was something about him which he could best describe as predatory he occasionally spoke of business ties so he had an occupation but he had not in lisles hearing mentioned what it was  crestwicks face was hot as he answered his remark  not at all batley the trouble is that im used to the roberts target and the spots on the card are puzzling after the rings ill get into it presently  oh well acquiesced the other as you didnt fix a time limit well go on again though its getting tame and i want some tea  ill increase the interest again if you like the lad replied  lisle joined the group  whats it all about he asked  batleys a pretty good rifle shot but if he wont mind my saying so hes a little opinionated gladwyne explained crestwick questioned an idea of his and the end of it was that batley offered to prove his pointthat a stiff pulloff is as good as a light one in practised handsby backing himself to beat the field crestwick took him up and since the rest of us were obviously out of it the thing has resolved itself into a match between the two crestwick is using an easytriggered rifle batleys has an unusually hard spring  lisle considered remembering bellas remarks he thought it would be easy to lure the lad into a rash bet he was headstrong and his manners might have been more conciliatory but lisle learning the amount of the stakes decided that his host should not have let the thing go so far  crestwick doubled several times hes stubborn and doesnt like to be beaten gladwyne resumed i had the same ideas when i was as young as he is  ive offered to let him off batley broke in id do so now only hes kept me shooting for the last halfhour as gladwyne says hes obstinate and its a pity that hes wrong if hed trained his wristtendons by using a harder trigger hed have made a passably good shot  lisle was aware that while there was something to be said for batleys view crestwick was justified in contending that the lighter tension was more adapted to the case of the average person but he recognized that the indulgent manner of the older men was calculated he thought intentionally to exasperate the hotheaded lad  well he observed addressing batley you have the courage of your convictions if you have offered to maintain them against all comers which i understand is what you have done  the man nodded carelessly and lisle went on  after all since i dare say these gentlemen are more used to the shotgun your superiority doesnt prove very much  crestwick looked around at him quickly  most of you colonials can use the rifle do you feel inclined to take him on youre a dark horse but ill double the stakes if hell throw you in  this was what lisle wanted but he turned to the others  ive never had a small rifle in my handswe use the 4470 and i must leave you to decide whether my shooting would be fair to mr batley in that case ill put up half the stakes  the men said there was no reason why he should not join and batley made no protest though lisle fancied that he was not pleased lying down on the mat he took the lightspringed rifle and the six cartridges handed him and fixed his eyes on the target which was a playingcard pinned to a thick plank he got the first shot off before he was quite readythe light pull was new to himand somebody called that he had touched the left top corner the next shot was down at the bottom and the four following marks were scattered about the card when he got up batley looked reassured and proceeded to make a neat pattern around the center of another card there was no doubt that crestwick was anxious and when he took his turn he shot badly in the meanwhile the rest of the party on the lawn had gradually gathered round the eager attitude of the original spectators hinted that something out of the usual course was going on  lisle was very cool when he lay down again a swift encouraging glance from bella crestwick made him determined and during his previous six shots he had he thought learned the right tension on the trigger  wipe it out for me somebody he said holding up the rifle  bella seized it and deftly used the rod regardless of soiled fingers  may it bring you luck she wished with a defiant glance at batley who smiled at her as she returned the weapon  then there was a hush of expectancy lisle took his time a sharp crack a streak of smoke and gladwyne raising his glasses laughed  high he called top spot  it was a three of hearts and gladwynes smile lingered for a moment after lisle fired again  bottom now youre low he cried and then his expression slightly changed both spots were drilled outthis did not look altogether like an accident  center he announced after another shot and all the faces surrounding him became intent the three hearts were neatly punched  a fresh card exclaimed crestwick looking around at batley with an exultant sparkle in his eyes you offered to let me off shall i return the compliment  the man laughed carelessly though lisle thought it cost him an effort  no he retorted i cant show myself less of a sportsman than you are but i think ive the option of demanding a longer range move the mat back twentyfive yards and put up an ace of spades its the plainest three shots each should suffice at the distance  crestwick got down and thrice touched the outside of the card batley did better for two shots broke the edge of the black and one was close above them it was good shooting at so small a mark and lisle was a little anxious as he very deliberately stretched himself out on the mat having little of the gamblers instinct in his nature he was reluctant to lose the money at stake but he was more unwilling to let batley fleece the lad whom as he recognized now he had been asked to aid he meant to do so if the thing were possible and twice he paused and relaxed his grip when his sight grew slightly blurred  then there was a sharp crack and he smiled when he heard gladwynes report  i cant see it these are only operaglasses  dead silence followed the next shot which left no visible mark on the target and lisle did not look around as he thrust his last cartridge into the rifle he let it lie beside him for half a minute while he opened and shut his right hand and then taking it up quickly fired still there was no blur on the white surface of the card and gladwyne sharply shut his glasses while two of the onlookers ran toward the target they came back in silence and one significantly held up the ace there were three small holes in the black center  gladwyne had turned away when lisle got up but batley concealed his feelings very well  excellent he exclaimed as i cant beat that the only thing left me is to pay up  lisle turned to crestwick who looked hot and excited  you made the bet he said will you use my half in buying a competition cup for one of your clubs  he saw batleys smile and a somewhat curious look in gladwynes face but the group broke up and he strolled back across the lawn with bella  im grateful she said softly i was a little afraid at first that i was asking too much of you  lisle met her glance with a good assumption of surprise  grateful because i indulged in a rather enjoyable match  she laughed  you learn rapidly but id better say in excuse that i didnt think id involved you in a very serious risk he hasnt your eyes and handsone couldnt expect it you dont need pickmeups in the morning do you  lisle was slightly embarrassed this girls knowledge of life was too extensive and he would have preferred that she should exhibit it to somebody else  well she concluded as they approached the teatable my thanks are yours even if you dont value them  what do you expect me to say he asked regarding her with some amusement and appreciation she was alluringly pretty in her rather elaborate light dress  yes she smiled mockingly disregarding his question these things become me better than the tweeds dont they they make one look nice and soft and fluffy but thats deceptive you see i can scratch in fact i felt i could have scratched batley badly if id got the chance theres another hint for youmake what you like of it  then with a laugh she swung round and left him puzzled     chapter xi  crestwick gives trouble   the little room in marples house where the crestwicks were staying was hot and partly filled with cigar smoke which drifted in filmy streaks athwart the light of the greenshaded hanginglamp lisle sat beneath the lamp studying the cards in his hand until he leaned back in his chair and flung a glance about the table there were no counters on it but gladwyne had just noted something in a little book and was waiting with a languid smile upon his handsome face next to him sat batley looking thoughtful and crestwick sat opposite lisle eager and unhealthily flushed his forehead showed damp in the lamplight and there was an unpleasant glitter in his eyes it was close on to midnight and luck had gone hard against him during the past hour half of which lisle had spent in his company this had cost lisle more money than he was willing to part with  its getting late he said with a yawn after this hand ill drop out i dare say one of the other two will take my place crestwick i believe your sister and miss leslie will be waiting youre going with them arent you  the lad turning in his chair reached toward a nearby table on which there were bottles and siphons and took a glass from it he had been invited to join a shooting party at a house in the neighborhood and was to spend the night there  oh he exclaimed with some irritation bellas always in such an unreasonable hurry the others cant be going yet i think i hear flo marple singing  a voice from somewhere below reached them through the open door it was a good voice but the words were a silly jingle and the humor in them could not be considered delicate lisle glancing at gladwyne noticed his slight frown but one of the two young men lounging by the second table watching the game hummed the refrain with an appreciative smile upon his heavy and somewhat fatuous face  theyll take half an hour to get ready declared batley better play out this round anyhow  they laid down their cards in turn and then crestwick noisily thrust his chair back  another knockout he exclaimed savagely i dont like to get up so far behind shall we double on another deal  as you like returned batley youre plucky considering the cards youve had but if fortunes fickle shes supposed to favor a determined suitor  it was innocent enough but lisle fancied that there was sufficient flattery in the speech to incite the headstrong lad who had now emptied the glass at his hand he remembered that on another occasion when there had been a good deal at stake batley had played on crestwicks feelings though in a slightly different manner whether or not the young man lost more than he could afford was in one way no concern of lisles and he did not find him in the least attractive but half an hour previously bella had met him in the hall and had hinted with a troubled look that she would appreciate it if he could get her brother away it was this that accounted for the canadians presence in the cardroom  im going anyway he said taking out some notes and gold and laying them down there has been a smart shower and you had better remember that miss leslie walked overthe roads will be wet as you know i promised to take the girls back in nasmyths trap and he wont thank me if i keep his groom up  crestwick grumbled and hesitated and he grew rather red in face as he turned to batley  ive only these two notes he explained expected all along id pull up even will you arrange things see you about it when i come back  batley nodded carelessly and the lad stood up looking irresolutely at the table  fact is he went on id like to get straight before i go im in pretty heavy for one night another round might do something to set me straight  gladwyne and i are quite willing to give you your chance was batleys quick reply but lisle unceremoniously laid his hand on crestwicks shoulder  come along he urged laughing lucks against you youve had quite enough  he had the lad out of the door in another moment and looking back from the landing he saw a curious look in gladwynes face which he thought was one of disgust batley however was frowning openly and the two mens expressions had a meaning for him he was inclined to wonder whether he had used force too ostensibly in ejecting the lad but after all that did not very much matterhis excuse was good enough as they went down the stairs crestwick turned to him hot and angry  it strikes me youre pretty officious never saw you until two or three weeks ago he muttered not accustomed to being treated in that offhand manner its colonial i suppose  sorry lisle apologized with a smile ive an idea that youll be grateful when you cool off youve been going it pretty strong tonight  thats true agreed the other with a show of pride kept on raising them made things lively  found it expensive didnt you lisle suggested and as they reached the foot of the stairs he led his companion toward the door suppose we take a turn along the terrace before we look for your sister  crestwick went with him but presently he stopped and leaned on the low wall  do you ever feel inclined for a flutter on the stockmarket he inquired theres a thing batley put me on totherell be developments in a month or two its going to a big premium let you have a hundred shares at par rather in a hole temporarily  lisle had no intention of buying the stock but he asked a few questions it appeared that it had been issued by a new company formed to grow coffee and rubber in the tropics  no he said a deal of that kind is out of my line why not sell them through a broker and get your full profit  it would take some days answered the other besides they wont move up until the directors let things out at the next meeting something of that kind anyway i forgetbatley explained it he paused and added irritably believe i told you im in a hole  you must meet your losses and dont know how to manage it  lisle was curious and had no diffidence about putting the question though the lad was obviously off his guard  i can raise the money right enoughbatleyll see to that but id sooner do it another way the interests high enough to make one think and in this case im paying it on money hes putting into his pocket  there was a good deal to be inferred from this reply but lisle considered before he spoke again  youre twentyone arent you he asked  yes assented the lad but the trustees keep hold until im twentyfour  he turned with quick suspicion to the canadian  i dont see what that has to do with you  it isnt very obvious lisle agreed shall we go in  they found bella in the hall and when her brother went to gethis coat she walked out on to the terrace with lisle  thank you she said gratefully when they were out of sight from the hall it was a relief to see you had succeeded in getting him away  im sorry i was unable to do so sooner lisle replied  ah then he has been losing heavily again  im afraid so i couldnt make my interference too marked obeying some impulse he laid his hand on her arm rather a handful for you isnt he  bella nodded making no attempt to shake off his grasp  yes she acknowledged with some bitterness but i can hardly complain that i have no control over him it would be astonishing if i had she broke into a little harsh laugh anyway i manage to keep my head and do not deceive myself as he does i know what our welcomes worth and what the few people whose opinion counts for anything think of us  well offered lisle if i can be of service in any respect  thanks she interrupted and turned back toward the door  when they reached the hall she glanced at her companion as the light fell on his face  your offers genuine she said impulsively i cant see what you expect in return  lisle was puzzled by her expression she was variable in her moods generally somewhat daring and addicted to light mockery he could not tell whether she spoke in bitterness or in mischief  no he replied gravely nor do i  she left him with a laugh and a little later he drove her and her companions away and afterward returned to nasmyths house to find that his host had retired lisle followed his example and rising early the next morning they set off for the river up which the seatrout were running they were busy all morning and it was not until noon when they lay in the sunshine eating their lunch on a bank of gravel that either of them made any allusion to the previous evening  did you enjoy yourself last night nasmyth asked  fairly lisle responded smiling ive already confessed that you people interest me at the same time i had my difficultiesfirst of all to explain to the marples why you didnt come the reasons you gave didnt sound convincing  they were good enough its probable that marple understood them like most of my neighbors i go once or twice in a year his subscription to the otter hounds entitles him to that  we dont look at things in that way in the parts of canada im acquainted with laughed lisle  then ive no doubt youll come to it nasmyth replied with some dryness theyve done so already in the older cities nowsince youre fond of candoryou have been glad to earn a dollar or two a day by chopping and shoveling havent you have you felt left out in the cold at all during the little while you have spent among us  not in the least lisle owned  then you can infer what you like from that in this country we take a good deal for granted and avoid explanations but you havent said anything about the proceedings at marples i suppose you were invited to take a hand at cards  i invited myself result sixty dollars to the bad in half an hour i used to hold my own in our mining camps and i hadnt the worst cards  nasmyth laughed with unconcealed enjoyment  the only fault i have to find with you westerners is that youre rather apt to overrate yourselves i suppose they let young crestwick in a good deal deeper  that laughed lisle is what you have been leading up to from the beginning  ill admit it as ive hinted one of the differences between an american and an englishman is that the former usually expresses more or less forcibly what he thinks unless of course hes a financier or a politician while you have often to learn by experience what the latter means better use your own methods in telling me what took place  lisle did so omitting any reference to bella and nasmyth looked disturbed and disgusted  crestwicks as devoid of sense as he is of manners he deserves to lose what i cant get over is that fellow batleys staying in what was once george gladwynes house with clarence standing sponsor for him  lisle fancied he could understand nasmyth had his failings but he had also his simple drastic code and it was repugnant to him that a man of his own caste one of a family he had long known and respected should countenance an outsider of batleys kind and assist him in fleecing a silly vicious lad  you have no reason to think well of gladwyne lisle reminded him  i havent nasmyth owned still though the man has made one very bad break i hardly expected him to exceed every limit at present it looks as if he might do so hell probably be forced to  i dont quite understand  then ill have to explain its unpleasant but here the thing is as i see itbatleys not the kind of man clarence would willingly associate with and to give clarence his dues all his instinct must make him recoil from the fellows game with crestwick considering that hes apparently making no protest against it this is proof to me that batley has some pretty firm hold on him  whats batleys profession  i suspect hes something in the smart moneylending line one of the fellows who deal with minors and others on postobits  postobits  promises to pay after somebodys dead suppose there should be only an invalid or an old man between you and a valuable property you could borrow on the strength of your expectations now what crestwick told you shows that the person who left him his money very wisely handed it to trustees with instructions to pay him only an allowance until hes twentyfour its a somewhat similar case to the one ive instancedhes drawing on a capital he cant get possession of for two or three years and no doubt paying an extortionate interest so far as i know no respectable bank or finance broker would handle that kind of business  but if the boy died before he succeeded to the property  batley could cover the risk by making crestwick take out an insurance policy in his favor  lisles face grew stern and nasmyth lay smoking in silence for a while then he broke out again  its intolerable george gladwynes successor abetting that fellow in robbing the lad luring him into wagers and reckless play with the result that most of the borrowed money goes straight back into the hands of the man who lent it  have you any suspicion that gladwyne gets a share  no replied nasmyth with signs of strong uneasiness i cant believe he benefits in that mannerif he did id feel it my duty to denounce him still i expect he wins a little now and then incidentally  again there was silence for a while broken finally by lisle  when id been here a week or two i began to see that my task wasnt quite so simple as it had appearedyou cant attack a man situated as gladwyne is without hurting innocent people indeed ive spent hours wondering how when the time comes i can clear vernons memory with the least possible damagethat is my business not the punishing of gladwyne though he deserves no consideration as you say a man may make a bad break and pull up again but this one has had his chance and has gone in deeper what hes doing nowhelping to ruin that lad in coldbloodis almost worse than the other offense  nasmyth made an acquiescent gesture  its true let it go at that i dont see how the thing can be stopped theres a fish rising in the slack yonder  lisle saw a silvery gleam in a strip of lesstroubled water behind a boulder and taking up his rod he cast the gaudy fly across the ripple there was a jar a musical clinking of the reel and when nasmyth waded in with ready net all thought of gladwyne passed out of the canadians mind  after a few minutes keen excitement they landed the beautiful glistening trout and then they set off downstream in search of another scrambling over rock and gravel and wading amidst the froth in the pools overhead soft gray clouds drifted by casting long shadows across fernclad hillside and farreaching moor and the flood flashed into silver gleams and grew dim again  both of the men were well content with their surroundings and now and then nasmyth wondered why clarence could not be satisfied with the simple pleasures that were freely offered him he could have had the esteem of his neighbors and the good will of his tenants and there were healthful tasks that would have kept him occupiedthe care of his estate the improving of the homes and conditions of life of those who worked for him experiments in stockraising local public duties he had once slipped badly so badly that the offense could hardly be contemplated but that was when he was weak and famishing and under the influence of an overwhelming fear at least he could make some reparation by leaving the countryside better than he found it and in this he had friends who would loyally assist him  clarence however had chosen another way one that led downhill to further dishonor and nasmyth considered gloomily what the end of it all would be occasionally he glanced at the lithe figure of the canadian standing kneedeep amid the froth of the stream seriouseyed alert resolute he could be depended on to carry out any purpose he had determined on it was his firm hands that would hold clarences scourge     chapter xii  mrs gladwynes appeal   millicent was sitting in a windowseat with a paintbox beside her and a drawing of a waterouzel upon her knee it was a lifelike sketch but she had a great capacity for painstaking and she was not altogether pleased with the drawing the bird stood on a stone an inch or two above a stream its white breast harmonizing with the flecks of snowy froth and the rest of its rather somber plumage of the same hue as a neighboring patch of shadow this was as it should be except that as the central object of a picture it was too inconspicuous she was absorbed in contemplating it when mrs gladwyne was shown in clarences mother did not pay many visits and millicent fancied she had some particular object in coming  she sat down where the sunlight fell on her gentle face and silvery hair her delicate white hands spread out on her dark dress  busy as usual my dear she said glancing at the sketch thats very pretty  i think its correct returned millicent but im not sure its what it ought to be in other respects you see its purpose is to show people what a waterouzel is like and its hard to make the creature out of course i could have drawn it against a background that would have forced up every line but that wouldnt have been rightthese wild things were made to fade into their surroundings she laughed truth is rigid and uncompromisingits difficult to make it subservient to expediency  her visitor did not feel inclined to discuss the matter  youre too fastidious she smiled and added with a sigh george was like that little things keep cropping up every day to show iti mean in connection with his care of the property im sometimes afraid that clarence is different  millicent could not deny this but she did not see his mothers purpose in confessing it  of course she answered as she rang for tea he hasnt been in charge very long one can learn only by experience  mrs gladwyne looked grateful but although she was very tranquil there was something in her manner that hinted at uncertainty  you will finish the book and these pictures some day she said what will you do then  i really dont know perhaps i shall start another if not there is always something i can turn my hand to so many things seem to need doingvillage matters alone would find me some occupation  the elder lady considered this  yes she agreed with diffidence im now and then afraid everythings not quite so satisfactory as it used to be the cottages dont look so pretty or well cared for the people are not so contentsome of them are even inclined to be bitter and resentful of course things change our relations with our dependents among them but i feel that people like the marples living as they do have a bad effect they form a text for the dissatisfied  millicent contented herself with a nod she could not explain that in spite of the changing mode of thought it is still possible for an oldfashioned landlord to retain almost everybodys good will sympathy and tactful advice are appreciated though not effusively and even a bluff wellmeant reproof is seldom resented but when rents are rigorously exacted by a solicitors or bankers clerk and repairs are cut down when indifference takes the place of judicious interest it is hardly logical to look for the cordial relations that might exist nasmyths tenants stopped and exchanged a cheery greeting or a jest with him most of gladwynes looked grim when he or his friends the marples passed  then tea was brought in and millicent found pleasure in watching her guest mrs gladwyne made a picture she thought sitting with the dainty china in her beautiful hands she possessed the grace and something of the stateliness which is associated with the old régime  how quick your people are she commented you rang and the things were brought in our staff is large and expensive but as a rule they keep us waiting though you paint and go out so much you have the gift of making a home comfortable it really is a gift one that should not be wasted  millicent grew serious it looked as if her companion were coming to the point and this became plainer when mrs gladwyne proceeded  do you think the life you contemplatewriting books on birds and animalsis the best or most natural one for a woman  a little color crept into the girls face  i dont know perhaps it isnt it is the one that seems open to me  the only one my dear you must know what i mean  millicent turned and faced her she was disturbed but she seldom avoided a plain issue  i think she said it would be better if you told me  its difficult mrs gladwyne hesitated you must forgive me if i go wrong still you know it was always expected that you would marry clarence some day it would be so desirable  for which of us millicents tone was sharp she sympathized with mrs gladwyne but something was due to herself  it was clarence that i was thinking of admitted her visitor i suppose that i am selfish but i am his mother she laid down her cup and looked at the girl with pleading eyes i must go on though i dont think i could say what i wish to any one but you clarence has many good qualities but he needs guidance an affectionate son but it is my misfortune that i am not wise or firm enough to advise or restrain him i have dropped behind the new generation the standards are different from what they were when i was young  this was true but it was incomplete and millicent let her finish  i have been a little anxious perhaps foolishly so about him now and then i cannot approve of all his friendssometimes they jar on meand i do not like the views he seems to have acquired from them they are not the ones his father held of course this is only the result of wrong associations and of having a goodhumored careless nature it would be so different if he could be brought under some wholesome influence she smiled at millicent one could trust implicitly to yours  it was an old plea fallacious often but none the less effective millicent was devoid of officious selfrighteousness but she was endowed with a compassionate tenderness which prompted her to extend help to all who needed it she thought that clarence did so but in spite of that she did not feel so responsive as she could have wished  there is one difficulty she answered while the blood crept into her face ill own that i recognized what your ideas and georges were about clarence and myself i may go so far but of late there has been nothing to show that clarence desired to carry out those ideas  mrs gladwyne gathered her courage  my dear it is rather hard to say but the truth is that a declaration from a man is not usually quite spontaneous he looks for some tacit encouragement a sign that one is not altogether indifferent to him now it has struck me that during the past year you have rather stood aloof from my son  millicent started slightly there was some truth in this statement mrs gladwyne however was not wise enough to stop  i think that is why there is some risk of his falling into bad handsthat crestwick girl isnt diffident she went on i know the strong regard he has for you but the girl sees a good deal of him and a man is sometimes easily led where he does not mean to go  millicents cheeks burned  do you wish me to compete openly for clarences favor with bella crestwick  mrs gladwyne spread out her hands in protest  oh my dear she exclaimed i have said the wrong thing i warned you that you might have to forgive me  but the thought must have been in your mind  i only meant that you neednt repel or avoid him as you have done of late  millicent felt compassionate after all mrs gladwyne was pleading for what she believed would benefit her only son but the girl was very human and a trace of her resentment remained it was however obvious that mrs gladwyne expected some response  i can venture to promise that i wont be openly rude millicent agreed with a faint smile  cant you go a little beyond that my dear  the girl seeing the look in her eyes yielded to an impulse which prompted her to candor  what there is to be said had better be spoken now she replied i have confessed that i knew what was expectedclarence showed that he knew it tooand the idea was not altogether repugnant to me but since he came back from canada there has been a change in both of us how or why i cant explain but we have drifted apart i dont know whether this will go oni dont understand myselfi only know that i am as anxious for his welfare as i always have been it must be left to him there is nothing you must urge me to do  mrs gladwyne looked regretful but she made a sign of acquiescence and rising came toward the girl and took her hand  what i could do i have donebadly perhaps she said i cant blame you i am only sorry  she went out in a few minutes and left millicent in a thoughtful mood looking back on the past the girl recognized that she had been fond of clarencewhich was the best word for itand that she would have married him had he urged it he had however hardly been in a position to do so then and she remembered that she had in no way regretted the fact this was she thought significant then the change had gradually come about she saw his faults more clearly and it grew increasingly difficult to believe that she could eradicate them what was more during the past few weeks she had once or twice felt scornfully angry with him she had tried not to yield to the sensation and now she wondered how it had originated and why she was less tolerant  as she considered the question a shadow fell upon the sunlit lawn and looking up she saw lisle approaching with a creel upon his back she started at the sight of him and once more felt her cheeks grow hot then she smiled for the halfformed suspicion that had flashed into her mind was obviously absurd he saw her the next moment and strode toward the open window  we got a few good white trout fresh run he said it occurred to me that you might like one or two of them  he glanced at the long french window  may i come in this way  ive no doubt you could do so but out of deference to conventional prejudices it might be better if you went round by the usual entrance  charmed he smiled thats easy  would you rather have it hard  that wasnt the idea he answered i only felt that a much greater difficulty wouldnt stop my getting in  millicent laughed  if one of my neighbors made such speeches theyd sound cheap from you theyre amusing  he affected to consider this  i suppose the difference is that i mean them anyway ill walk around  she gave him some tea when he came in and afterward admired the fish  theyre well above the average weight she said  we had two or three that would beat them lisle declared miss crestwick came along and corralled the finest  was the explanation essential millicent inquired with a smile  that was a bad break of mine so bad that i wont try to explain it away  i think you are wise millicent retorted with a trace of dryness  on the face of it she was pleased with his answer but the fact he had mentioned caused her some irritation bella crestwick not content with monopolizing clarence must also seek to include the canadian in her train it was curious that for the moment that seemed the more serious offense the girl was insatiable and going too far millicent thought  lisle noticed her silence  remember that im from the wilds he said  she smiled at him reassuringly  after all that isnt a great drawback anyway im grateful for the trout then somewhat to his surprise she abruptly changed the subject i wonder what you think of a tacit promise  his face grew thoughtful she liked his quick change to seriousness  well i dont know that my opinions of much value but you may have it supposing two people allow each other to assume that theyre agreed upon the same thing its binding upon both of them  but if only one actually made his wishes clear  in that case the other had the option of showing that they couldnt be acceded to failing that in my view he cant go back on it then his eyes gleamed with amusement i dont often set up as a philosopher  millicent was a little vexed with herself for asking him and did not quite understand why she had done so unless it was because she had not altogether recovered her usual collectedness after mrs gladwynes visit why she should be interested in this mans opinion was not clear but she thought he was one who would act in accordance with it she was afterward even more astonished at her next remark which she made impulsively  you have seen a good deal of miss crestwick one way or another  he considered this gravely  yes he replied i like her for one thing shes genuinely concerned about that brother of hers  what do you think of him  not much lisle answered candidly ive no use for a man who needs a woman to keep him straight and look after him but one feels a strong respect for the woman even though its obvious that shes wasting her time  is it wasting time  it strikes me like that a man of that sort is bound to come down badly some day  millicent sat silent a while the conversation had taken an unusually serious turn but she wondered whether he were right she had she thought allowed clarence to assume that she would not repulse him when he formally claimed her and thatso this man from the wilds consideredconstituted a binding obligation she could not contest this view but clarence seemed more interested in bella crestwick than he was in her then she wondered why the girl had made so much of lisle unless it was to use him for the purpose of drawing clarence on if that were so it seemed a pity that the confiding canadian could not be warned though that of course was out of the question  im afraid im not very amusing today she acknowledged  he smiled  ill go the moment you want to get rid of me but even if you dont say anything i like sitting here this place rests me  i shouldnt have imagined you to be of a very restful nature  oh he declared theres a kind of quietness that braces you  he was less reserved than the average englishman but he felt the charm of his surroundings more keenly than the latter would probably have done everything in the room was artistic but its effect was deeper than mere prettiness it was cool though the autumn sunshine streamed in and the girl had somehow impressed her personality upon it soft colorings furniture even the rather incongruous mixture of statuettes and ivory carvings blended into a harmonious whole and the girl made a most satisfactory central figure as she sat opposite him in her unusually thoughtful mood he felt the charm of her presence though he could hardly have analyzed it as he said it was not even needful that she should talk to him  there are lakes in british columbia from which you can look straight up at the nevermelting snows he went on you feel that you could sit there for hours without wanting to move or speak though it must be owned that one very seldom gets the opportunity  why millicent inquired  as a rule the people who visit such places are kept too busy chopping big trees hauling canoes round rapids or handling heavy rocks besides you have your food to cook and your clothes to mend and wash  then after the days labor a man must do his own domestic work  of course answered lisle now and then one comes back to camp too wet or played out to worry and goes to sleep without getting supper im speaking of when youre working for your own hand in a big logging or construction camp you reach the fringe of cooperation this man sticks to the saw the other to the ax somebody else who gets his share of the proceeds chops the cordwood and does the cooking  and if you can neither chop nor saw nor cook  then lisle informed her dryly you have to pull out pretty quick  it sounds severe thats cooperation in its grimmest aspect though its quite logicaleverybody must do his part im afraid i shouldnt be justified if we adopted it here  cooperation implies a division of tasks lisle pointed out in a country like this theyre many and varied so long as you draw the wild things as you do youll discharge your debt  do you know that thats the kind of work the community generally pays one very little for  then it shows its wrongheadedness lisle answered as he glanced meaningly round the room but havent you got part of your fee already of course thats impertinent  i believe we would shrink from saying it but its quite correct millicent replied still since you have mentioned the drawings id like your opinion about this ouzel  she took up the sketch and explained the difficulty as she had done to mrs gladwyne  its right dont alter it advised lisle its your business to show people the real thing as it actually is so they can learn not to alter it to suit their untrained views  he laughed and rose somewhat reluctantly  after that id better get along i have to thank you for allowing me to come in  she let him go with a friendly smile and then sat down to think about him he was rather direct but the goodhumor with which he stated his opinions softened their positiveness besides she had invited them and she felt that they were correct he was such another as nasmyth simple in some respects but reliable one who could never be guilty of anything mean she liked the type in general and she admitted that she liked this representative of it in particular     chapter xiii  a futile protest   it was late at night but gladwyne sat cigar in hand in his library while batley lounged beside the hearth a wood fire diffused a faint aromatic fragrance into the great highceilinged room and the light of a single silver lamp flickered on the polished floor which ran back like a sheet of black ice into the shadow heavilycorniced bookcases rose above it on either band conveying an idea of space and distance by the way they grew dimmer as they receded from the light  the room had an air of stateliness in its severe simplicity and its owner sitting just inside the ring of brightness clad in conventional black and white looked in harmony with it something in his finelylined figure and cleanlymolded face stamped him as one at home in such a place a decanter stood near his elbow but it was almost full gladwyne in many ways was more of an ascetic than a sensualist though this was less the result of moral convictions than of a fastidious temperament the man had an instinctive aversion for anything that was ugly or unpleasant his companion dressed with an equal precision looked different more virile coarser he was fuller in figure and heavier in face  no declared gladwyne with a show of firmness the line must be drawn ive already gone farther than i should have done  im sorry for you gladwyneyou dont seem to realize that a man cant very well play two widely different parts at once batley rejoined smiling your interfering canadian friend would describe your attitude as sitting upon the fence its an uncomfortable position one thats not often tenable for any length of time hadnt you better make up your mind as to which side youll get down on  gladwyne looked uneasy the choice all his instinct prompted him to make was not open to him except at a cost which he was hardly prepared to face he was known as a bold rider he had the steady nerves that usually result from a life spent in the open air but as batley recognized he lacked stamina  you are going wide of the mark he answered what i have asked you to do is to let the lad alone the things exciting comment youhe hesitatedhave made enough out of him  i think replied the other coolly i was very much to the point if you dont recognize this ill ask suppose i dont fall in with your request what then  gladwyne examined his cigar it was not in his nature to face an issue boldly and his companion seemed determined to force one  ive asked it as a favor he finally said  no corrected batley i dont think you did so you intimated your wishes in a rather lordly style  this was true but gladwyne winced at the mans cold smile he had in a fit of indignation which was both honest and commendable expressed himself with some haughtiness but he knew that he would be beaten if it came to an open fight this was unfortunate because his intentions were good  besides batley continued im not in a position to grant expensive favors my acquaintance with young crestwick is of course profitable whats more ive very liberally offered you a share  gladwynes face grew hot he had acted most reluctantly as a decoy to the vicious lad but he had never benefited by it except when now and then some stake fell into his hands the suggestion that he should share in the plunder filled him with disgust and he knew that batley had made it to humiliate him  youre taking risks he continued theres legislation on the subject of minors debts crestwick began to deal with you before he was twentyone and hes still in his trustees hands if he made trouble im inclined to think some of your transactions would look very much like conspiracy  i know my man you people would suffer a good deal sooner than advertise yourselves through the law courts  crestwick isnt one of us gladwyne objected  then as he aspires to be considered one hell go even farther than you would none are so keen for the honor of the flock as those who dont strictly belong to the fold theres another point you overlooka person cant very well conspire alone and inquiries might be made about my confederates that however is not a matter of much importance because i imagine miss crestwick would not allow any one to point to you besides her moneys safe and shes a prepossessing young lady  gladwyne straightened himself sharply in his chair dont go too far there are things i wont stand  then well try to avoid them all i require is that you still give the lad the entry of this house and dont interfere with me you see im reasonable  as gladwyne had interfered to acquiesce was to own defeat which was galling and while he hesitated batley watched him with an air of indulgent amusement  its a pity you were not quite straight with me at the beginning gladwyne it would have saved you trouble he remarked at length i took a sporting risk at pretty long oddsi have to do so now and then and i pay up when i lose but if id known the money was to go to miss gladwyne and you would only get the land id never have kept you supplied and in particular i wouldnt have made the last big loan shortly before you and your cousin sailed for canada  you knew it was a blind speculationthat i ran the same risk as george did and that he might outlive me  youre wrong on one point batley objected dryly im acquainted with your temperamentits not one that would lead you into avoidable difficulties well you came through and your cousin died but you failed to pay me off when you came into possession  ive explained that i couldnt foresee the trouble i have in meeting expenses ive paid you an extortionate interest  thats in arrears retorted batley you should have pinched and denied yourself to the utmost until you had got rid of me you couldnt bring yourself to do sowell its rather a pity one cant have everything  approaching the table he quietly took up the lamp it was heavy standing on a massive silver pillar but he raised it above his head so that the light streamed far about the stately room then he laughed as he set it down  its something to be the owner of such a place and enjoy all that it implieswhich includes your acknowledged status and your neighbors respect there would be a risk of losing the latter if it came out that driven by financial strain you had been speculating on your cousins death  gladwyne made a little abrupt movement and batley saw that his shot had told  it would be enough to place you under a cloud he went on people might think that you had at least not been very reluctant to leave him to starve well ive had to wait for my money with the interest by no means regularly paid and unless you can square off the account i must ask you to leave me a free hand to deal with crestwick as i think fit in return if its needful ill see you through on reasonable terms until you marry miss crestwick or somebody else with money  on the whole gladwyne was conscious of relief he had been badly frightened for a moment or two if batley who had good reasons for distrusting him had accepted his account of his cousins death it was most unlikely that it had excited suspicion in the mind of anybody else crestwick however must be left to his fate it was though he failed to recognize this an eventful decision that gladwyne made  as you will he answered rising its late im going for my candle  he strode out of the room and batley smiled as he followed him  a day or two later lisle stood on gladwynes lawn gladwyne entertained freely and though his neighbors did not approve of all of his friends the man had the gift of pleasing and his mother unconsciously exerted a charm on every one she rarely said anything witty but she never said anything unkind and she would listen with a ready sympathy that sometimes concealed a lack of comprehension  lisle had a strong respect for the calm gracious lady though she had won it by no more than a smile or two and a few pleasant words and he went over to call upon her every now and then he was interested in the company he met at her house it struck him as worth studying and he had a curious feeling that he was looking on at the preliminary stages of a drama in which he might presently be called upon to play a leading part besides he had reasons for watching gladwyne  the stage was an attractive one to a man who had spent much of his time in the wildernessa wide sweep of sunlit sward with the tennis nets stretched across part of it on one side a dark fir wood and for a background a stretch of brown moor receding into the distance dimmed by an ethereal haze a group of young men and women picturesquely clad were busy about the nets others in flannels and light draperies strolled here and there across the grass and a few more had gathered about the teatable under a spreading cedar where mrs gladwyne sat in a low wickerchair over all there throbbed the low persistent murmur of a stream  lisle was talking to millicent near the table he looked up as a burst of laughter rose from beside the nets and saw bella crestwick walk away from them one or two of the others stood looking after her and mrs gladwyne glanced from her chair inquiringly  they seem amused she said  it was probably at one of miss crestwicks remarks shes undoubtedly original returned millicent still i think it was chiefly mr marples laugh you heard  his voice had been most in evidenceit usually carried farbut lisle was half amused at the disapproval in the girls tone  im afraid im now and then a little boisterous too he ventured  it depends a good deal upon what you laugh at millicent informed him  mrs gladwyne looked up again as if she had not heard and the girl smiled at her  what i said isnt worth repeating  she moved away a pace or two and lisle watched bella who glanced once or twice in his direction as she crossed the lawn somehow he felt that he was wanted and a little later he strolled after the girl millicent noticed it with a slight frown though she did not trouble to ask herself why she was vexed when lisle reached bella she regarded him with mischief in her eyes  as i once mentioned you learn rapidly she laughed youll be thankful for the instruction some day and i promise not to teach you anything very detrimental but im a little surprised that millicent gladwyne allowed you to come  i dare say she could spare me im not a very entertaining companion lisle said humbly  it wasnt that bella explained i dont think shed like you spoiledperhaps i should say contaminated she has ideas on the subject of education too she always calls me miss crestwick which is significant ive no doubt she did so when marple made himself conspicuous by his amusement just now  lisle had noticed the correctness of her assumptions on other occasions but he said nothing for he had noticed some bitterness in her voice he walked on with her and she led him into a path through a shrubbery bordering the lawn where she sat down on a wooden seat  now she said teasingly we have given the others something to think about but ive really no designs on you it wouldnt be much use anyway youre safe  she looked up at him with elfish mischief in her aggressively pretty face dressed in some clinging fabric of pale watery green that matched the greenish light in her eyes and the reddish gleam in her hair she was very alluring but it was borne in upon lisle that to take up her challenge too boldly would lower him in the girls regard  im human he laughed perhaps id better mention it but i think its more to the purpose to say that im altogether at your disposal  well she answered i wanted you as youre almost a stranger its curious isnt it but you see i havent a real friend in the world  i wonder if that can be quite correct  so far as the people here go havent you eyes  lisle had seen the men gather about her but it was those he thought least of who followed her most closely and the women stood aloof  there are miss marple and her mother anyway theyre friends of yours he pointed out  just so flo and i are in the same class making the same fight but that isnt always a reason for mutual appreciation or support mrs marple of course is her daughters partizan though in some ways it suits us to stand together but i didnt bring you here to listen to my grievances but because you happen to be the one man i can trust  lisle looked embarrassed but merely bent his head  its that silly brother of mine again she went on  what has he been doing now  its what hes thinking of doing thats the worst he has been led to believe its easy to acquire riches on the stock exchange and that he has the makings of a successful speculator in him cards and the turf ive had to tolerateafter all there were ways in which he got some return for what he spent on thembut this last craze may be disastrous  where did he get the idea that hes a financial genius it wouldnt be from you  no she said seriously im his sister and most unlikely to encourage him in such delusions i dont think batley had much trouble in putting the notion into his mind her expression suddenly changed how i hate that man  lisle looked down at her with grave sympathy  its quite easy to get into difficulties by speculating unless one has ample means but i understood  bella checked him with a gesture  jim comes into moneywe have a good allowance nowbut it will be nearly two years before he gets possession i want him to start fair when he may perhaps have learned a little sense and not to find himself burdened with debts and associates he cant get rid of at present batleys lending him money at exorbitant interest ive pleaded ive stormed and told him plain truths but it isnt the least use  i see why dont you take him away  he wont come it would be worse if i left him  do you know why gladwyne tolerates batley  i dont bella looked up sharply what has that to do with it  lisle thought it had a bearing on the matter as the lad would have seen less of batley without gladwynes connivance  well he countered what would you like me to do  its difficult to answer hes obstinate and resents advice you might however talk to him when you have a chance hes beginning to have a respect for your opinions  thats gratifying lisle commented dryly he was inclined to patronize me at first  she spread out her hands  youre too big to mind it tell him anything you can about disastrous mining ventures but dont begin as if you meant to warn himlead up to the subject casually  im afraid im not very tactful lisle confessed hell see what im after  its not very likely talk as if you considered him a man of experience its fortunate that you can be of help in this case because i think some canadian mining shares are to be the latest deal from what jim said it looks as if batley was to give him some information about them on wednesday when gladwyne and he are expected at marples cant you come i understand you have been asked  yes promised lisle if i have an opportunity ill see what can be done  bella rose and smiled at him  well go back im comforted already youre not profuse but one feels that you will keep a promise  they walked across the lawn bella now conversing in an animated strain about unimportant matters though it did not occur to lisle that this was for the benefit of the lookerson on approaching the teatable she adroitly secured possession of a chair which another lady who stood higher in her hostesss esteem was making for and sitting down chatted cheerfully with mrs gladwyne lisle was conscious of some amusement as he watched her she was clever and her courage appealed to him but presently he saw millicent and strolled toward where she was standing she spoke to him but he thought she was not quite so gracious as she had been before he went away     chapter xiv  lisle comes to the rescue   a few days after his interview with bella lisle overtook millicent as she was walking up a wooded dale she looked around with a smile when he joined her and they fell into friendly talk there were points on which they differed but a sense of mutual appreciation was steadily growing stronger between them presently lisle happened to mention the marples and millicent glanced at him thoughtfully she knew that he met bella at their house  you have seen a good deal of these people one way or another she remarked  these people arent you a little prejudiced against them  i suppose i am millicent confessed  then wont you give me the reason your point of view isnt always clear to an outsider  ill try to be lucid i dont so much object to marple as i do to what he stands for i mean to modern tendency  thats as involved as ever  the girl showed a little goodhumored impatience she did not care to supply the explanationit was against her instinctsand she was inclined to wonder why she should do so merely because the man had asked for it  well she said the feudal system isnt dead and i believe that what is best in it need never disappear altogether of course it had its drawbacks but i think it was better than the commercialism that is replacing it it recognized obligations on both sides and there is a danger of forgetting them the new people often fail to realize them at all marpleim using him as an examplebought the land for what he could get out of it  about three per cent he told me it isnt a great inducement  millicent made a halfdisdainful gesture  he gets a great deal moresport a status friends and standing and a means of suitably entertaining them that i suppose is one reason why the return in money from purely agricultural land is so small  then is it wrong for a business man to buy these things if he can pay for them  oh no but he must take up the duties attached to his purchase when you buy land human lives go with it theyre still largely in the landlords hands of course we have legislation which has curtailed the landowners former powers but its a soulless mechanical thing that can never really take the place of direct personal interest  she stopped and glanced back down the winding dale here and there smooth pastures climbed the slopes that shut it in but over part of them ranged mighty oaks still almost green beyond these beeches tinted with brown and crimson glowed against the dusky foliage of spruces and silverfirs  one needs wisdom love of the soil and all that lives on it and perhaps patience most of all she resumed these woods are an example they are not natural like your forestsevery tree has been carefully planted and as it grew the young sheltering wood about it carefully thinned out then as the trunks gained in size it was necessary to choose with care and cut with the oaks its a work of generations planting for ones greatgrandchildren and the point that is suggested most clearly is the continuity of interest that should exist between the men who use the spade and ax and the men who own and plan it is not a little thing that the third and fourth generations should complete the task when a mutual toleration and dependence is handed down  lisle was conscious of a curious stirring of his feelings as he listened to her she was tall and finely proportioned endowed with a calm and gracious dignity which was nevertheless he thought in keeping with a sanguine and virile nature this girl was one of the fairest and most precious products of the soil she loved  its a pity in many ways that the gladwyne property didnt come to you he observed  her expression changed and he spread out one hand deprecatingly  thats another blunder of mine i havent acquired your peoples unfailing caution yet but i only meant  perhaps it would be better if you didnt tell me what you did mean  lisle nodded he felt that he had deserved the rebuke as the truth of his assertion could not be admitted without disparaging gladwyne she would allow nothing to the latters discredit to be said by a stranger but it was unpleasant to think that she regarded him as one he changed the subject  you mentioned that landlord and laborer had a joint interest in the soil and thats undoubtedly right he said the point where trouble arises is of course over the division of the yield the formers share is obvious but nowadays plowman and forester want more than their fathers seem to have been satisfied with i dont think you can blame themin canada they get more  ill give you an instance to show why one cant treat them very liberally when my brother got possession he spent a great deal of moneyit was left him by his mother and didnt come out of the landin draining improvements and rebuilding homesteads and cottages besides freely giving his time and care for a number of years he got no return at all and part of the expenditure will always be unproductive it isnt a solitary case  they went on together through the shadowy crimsontinted dale until millicent stopped at the gate of a fieldroad  i am going to one of the cottages yonder she explained i expect nasmyth on wednesday evening are you coming with him  im sorry but im going to marples you see i promised  promised marple  he was learning to understand her for though she showed no marked sign of displeasure he knew that she was not gratified  no he answered miss crestwick  she did not speak but there was something in her manner that hinted at disdainful amusement  i think youre hardly fair to her he said  its possible millicent replied carelessly does it matter  well he broke out with some warmth the girl hasnt such an easy time among you and one can only respect her for the way she stands by her brother  have you anything to say in his favor  it would be pretty difficult admitted lisle but you cant blame his sister for that  i dont think ive shown any desire to do so she retorted  lisle knit his brows  you people are rather curious in your ideas now heres a lonely girl whos pluckily trying to look after that senseless lad and not a one of you can spare her a word of sympathy because she doesnt run on the same stereotyped lines as you do can you help only the people who will conform  millicent let this pass and after an indifferent word or two she turned away before she reached home however she met nasmyth  why dont you keep mr lisle out of those marples hands she asked him  in the first place im not sure that i could do so in the second i dont see why i should try nasmyth replied on the whole considering that hes a western miner i dont think hes running a serious risk perhaps i might hint that bella crestwicks hardly likely to consider him as big enough game  dont be coarse millicent paused but he spoke hotly in her defense  after all responded nasmyth i shouldnt wonder if she deserves it but it has no significance you see hes a rather chivalrous person  millicent flashed a quick glance at him but his face was expressionless  what did he say he asked  i dont remember exactly he hinted that we were narrowminded and uncharitable  nasmyth laughed  i almost think theres some truth in it ive seen you a little severe on those outside the fold  a mans charity is apt to be influenced by a pretty face millicent retorted  ill admit it replied nasmyth dryly but i cant undertake to determine how far that fact has any bearing on this particular instance  millicent talked about something else but she was annoyed with herself when the question nasmyth had raised once more obtruded itself on her attention during the evening  on wednesday lisle walked over to marples house because he had promised to go though he would much rather have spent an hour or two with nasmyth and millicent in the latters drawingroom he had no opportunity for any private speech with bella but she flung him a grateful glance as he came in he waited patiently and followed her brother here and there but he could not secure a word with him alone  some time had passed when escaping from a group engaged in what struck him as particularly stupid badinage he sauntered toward the billiardroom struggling with a feeling of irritation he was generally goodhumored and tolerant rather than hypercritical but the somewhat senseless hilarity of marples guests was beginning to jar on him a burst of laughter which he thought had been provoked by one of bellas sallies followed him down the corridor but when he quietly opened the door the billiardroom was empty except for a group of three in one corner he stopped just inside the threshold glancing at them and it was evident that they had not heard his approach  wreaths of cigar smoke drifted about the room the light of the shaded lamps fell upon the men seated on a lounge and their expressions and attitudes were significant gladwyne leaned back languidly graceful batley a burlier figure was talking his eyes fixed on crestwick and the lad sat upright looking eager batley appeared to be discussing the principles of operating on the stock exchange  its obvious he said that theres very little to be made by waiting until any particular stock becomes a popular favoritethe premium equalizes the profit and sometimes does away with it the essential thing is to take hold at the beginning when the shares are more or less in disfavor and can be picked up cheap  lisle stood stillhe was in the shadowwatching the lad who now showed signs of uncertainty  i dropped a good deal of money the last time i tried it he protested the trouble is that if you come in when the companys starting you cant form an accurate idea of how it ought to go  exactly replied batley you can rarely be quite sure what you need is sound judgment the sense to recognize a good thing when you see it pluck and the sporting instinctyou must be ready to back your opinion and take a risk its only the necessity for that kind of thing which makes it a fine game  he broke off looking up and as lisle strolled forward with a glance at crestwick he saw batleys genial expression change it was evident that the idea of being credited with the qualities mentioned appealed to the lad and lisle realized that batley was wishing him far away he had however no intention of withdrawing and taking out a cigar he chose a cue and awkwardly proceeded to practise a shot  this he said nonchalantly is an amusement i never had time to learn and i really came along for a quiet smoke dont let me disturb you  he saw crestwicks look and understood what was in the lads mind it was incomprehensible to the latter that a man should boldly confess his ignorance of a game of high repute batley however seeing that the intruder intended to remain returned to the attack and though he spoke in a lower voice lisle caught part of his remarks and decided that he was cleverly playing upon crestwicks raw belief in himself this roused the canadian to indignation though it was directed against gladwyne rather than his companion batley he thought was to some extent an adventurer one engaged in a hazardous business at which he could not always win and he had some desirable qualitiesgoodhumor liberality coolness and daring the wellbred gentleman who served as his decoy however possessed none of these redeeming characteristics his part was merely despicable there was only meanness beneath his polished exterior  it certainly looks promising lisle heard crestwick say you have pretty well convinced me that it cant go wrong  i cant see any serious risk declared batley that in the case of mining stock is as far as id care to go on the other hand theres every prospect of a surprising change in the value of the shares as soon as the results of the first reduction of ore come out i can only add that im a holder and i got you the offer of the shares as a favor from a friend whos behind the scenes dont take them unless you feel inclined  this was a slip as lisle recognized it is not in human nature to dispose of a commodity that will shortly increase in value crestwick however obviously failed to notice this lisle thought the idea of getting on to the inside track appealed to his vanity  its a curious name theyve given the mine commented the lad repeating it what does it mean  lisle started for he recognized the name and it offered him a lead strolling toward the group he leaned against the table  i can tell you that he said its an indian word for a river gorge i went up it not long ago  then exclaimed crestwick i suppose you know the mine  lisle glanced at the others their eyes were fixed upon him batleys steadily gladwynes with a hint of uneasiness it was he felt a remarkable piece of good fortune that had given him control of the situation  yes he answered carelessly i know the mine  im thinking of taking shares in it crestwick informed him  well said lisle that wouldnt be wise  gladwyne leaned farther back in his seat as if to disassociate himself from the discussion which was what the canadian had expected from him but batley who was of more resolute fiber showed fight his appearance became aggressive his face hardened and there was a snap in his eyes  you have made a serious allegation in a rather startling way mr lisle as ive an interest in the company in question i must ask you to explain  then id advise you to get rid of your interest as soon as possible that is so long as you dont sell out to crestwick whos a friend of mine  batleys face began to redden and lisle looking around at the sound of a footstep saw marple standing a pace or two away he was a fussy bustling man and he raised his hand in expostulation  was that last called for or quite the thing lisle he asked  batley turned to gladwyne as if for support and the latter assumed his finest air  i think there can be only one opinion on that point he declared  lisles eyes gleamed with an amusement that was stronger than his indignation that gladwyne should expect this gravely delivered decision to have any marked effect tickled him  well he replied im ready to stand by what i said and ill add that if i had any shares id give them away to anybody who would register as their owner before the next call is made  i understood there wouldnt be a call for a long while crestwick broke in  then whoever told you so must have been misinformed lisle rejoined  are you casting any doubt upon my honor batley demanded in a bellicose voice  i dont think so anyway so long as you dont rule out my suggestion still im willing to leave gladwyne to decide the point he seems to understand these delicate matters  marple looking distressed and irresolute broke in before gladwyne had a chance to reply  do you know much about mining lisle  lisle laughed  ive had opportunities for learning something as prospector locator of alluvial claims and holder of an interest in one or two comparatively prosperous companies  he leaned forward and touched crestwicks shoulder  come along jim and ill give you one or two particulars that should decide you  somewhat to his astonishment the lad rose and rather sheepishly followed him there was an awkward silence for a few moments after they left the room then marple turned to his guests  i cant undertake to say whether lisle was justified or not he began im sorry however that anything of this nature should have happened in my house  so am i said gladwyne with gracious condescension there is of course one obvious remedy  marple raised his hands in expostulation he liked lisle and gladwyne was a distinguished guest batley seemed to find his confusion amusing  i think the only thing we can do is to let the matter drop he suggested these fellows from the wilds are primitiveone cant expect too much the correct feeling or delicacy of expression wed look for among ourselves is hardly in their line  marple was mollified and he fell in with batleys suggestion that they should try a game  in the meanwhile crestwick looked around at his companion as they went down the corridor  i believe i owe you some thanks he admitted i like the way you headed off batleyi think he meant to turn savage at firstand i wouldnt have been willing to draw in gladwyne as you did he has a way of crushing you with a look  its merely a sign that you deserve it lisle laughed you take too many things for granted in this country test another mans assumption of superiority before you agree with it and youll sometimes be astonished to find out what its really founded on and now wed better join those people whore singing     chapter xv  bellas defeat   the afternoon was calm and hazy and lisle lounged with great content in a basketchair on millicents lawn his hostess sat near by looking listless a somewhat unusual thing for her and miss hume her elderly companion genial in spite of her precise formality was industriously embroidering something not far away there was not a breath of wind astir a soft gray sky streaked with long bars of stronger color hung motionless over the wide prospect wood and moorland ridge and distant hill had faded to dimness of contour and quiet neutral tones indeed the whole scene seemed steeped in a profound tranquillity intensified only by the murmur of the river  lisle enjoyed it all though he was conscious that millicents presence added to its charm he had grown to feel restful and curiously at ease in her company she was he thought so essentially natural one felt at home with her  i havent often seen you with the unoccupied appearance you have just now he remarked at length  i have sent the book off and after being at work on it so long i feel disinclined to do anything else she said ive just heard from the publishers they dont seem enthusiastic after all one couldnt expect thatthe style of the thing is rather out of the usual course  lisle looked angry and she was pleased with his indignation on her behalf  they show precious little sense he declared but youre right its one of your english customs to go on from precedent to precedent until you get an unmodifiable standard when you slavishly conform to it now your books neither a classification nor a catalogueits something far bigger never mind what the experts and scientists say wait until the people who love the wild things and want their story made real get it into their hands  his confidence was gratifying but she changed the subject  you canadians havent much respect for precedent  no we try to meet the varying need by constantly changing means theyre often crude but theyre successful as a rule  its a system that must have a wide effect she responded to lead him on she liked to hear him talk  it has you can see it in the difference between your country and mine this lands smooth and well trimmed everything in it has grown up little by little its mellow ripeness is its charm ours is grand or rugged or desolate but its never merely pretty the same applies to our people theyre bubbling over with raw optimistic vigor their corners are not rubbed off some of them would jar on overcivilized people but not i think on any one with understanding he spread out his hands you have an example im spouting at large again  go on she begged im interested but have you ever thought that instead of being younger than we are youre really older i mean that you have gone back a long way begun again at an earlier stage instead of going ahead  now you get at the bottom of things he exclaimed thats always been an idea of mine the people of the newer countries perhaps more particularly those to whom i belong are brought back to the grapple with elemental conditions were on the bedrock of nature  are you too modest to go any further  he showed faint signs of confusion and she laughed no doubt the situation makes for pristine vigor and we are drifting into artificiality she suggested perhaps you the toilers the subduers of the wilderness are to serve as an anchor for the supercivilized generations to hold on by she paused and quoted softly pioneers o pioneers  what can i say to that he asked with halfamused embarrassment were pretty egotistical but one cant go back on whitman  no she laughed mischievously i think youre loyal and there are situations from which its difficult to extricate oneself didnt you find it so for example when you declined to come here with nasmyth because miss crestwick had pressed you to go to marples  he could think of no neat reply to this and the obvious fact pleased her for she guessed that he would rather have spent the evening with her this was true for now sitting in the quiet garden in her company he looked back on the entertainment with something like disgust marples male friends were for the most part characterized by a certain grossness and sensuality in their amusements at games of chance one or two had displayed an open avarice these things jarred on the man who had toiled among the rocks and woods where he had practised a stringent selfdenial  i heard that you figured in a striking little scene millicent went on  i couldnt help it lisle appeared annoyed that man batley irritated me though after all i dont blame him the most  this was a slip  whom do you blame she asked sharply  oh he explained i wasnt the only person present and i hadnt arrived at the beginning somebody should have stopped the fellow the shares he tried to work off on crestwick were no good  then batley wanted to sell that silly lad some worthless sharesand there were other people looking on  he would not tell her that gladwyne had watched the proceedings to some extent acquiescing  i thought from what you said that you knew all about it he answered  no she replied suspecting the truth but seeing that it would be difficult to extract anything definite from him i only heard that you had an encounter of some kind with batley but why did you hint that he was not the worst  he was merely acting in accordance with his instincts one wouldnt expect anything else  the implication is that he was tacitly abetted by people of a different kind who ought to have known better  he was not to be drawn on this point and she respected him for it  was it only an animus against batley that prompted you she asked  no he admitted candidly i wanted to get young crestwick out of his clutches im not sure hes worth troubling about but im sorry for his sister as ive said before theres something fine in the way she sticks to him  the chivalrous feeling did him credit millicent admitted but she was dissatisfied with it and was curious to learn if it were the only one he cherished toward the girl  thats undoubtedly in her favor she commented indifferently  he did not respond and they talked about other matters but lisle was now sensible of a slight constraint in millicents manner and on the whole she was glad when he took his leave quickwitted as she was she guessed that he disapproved of the part clarence had played in the affair at marples and this chiming with her own suspicions troubled her she had a tenderness for clarence and she wondered how far her influence might restrain and protect him if as his mother had suggested she eventually married him another point caused her some uneasinessbella crestwick had boldly entered the field against her and was making use of the canadian to rouse clarence by showing him that he had a rival the thought of it stirred her to indignation she would not have lisle treated in that fashion after sitting still for half an hour she rose with a gesture of impatience and went into the house  on the same evening bella crestwick felt impelled to lecture her brother after dinner that was not a favorable time for the young mans good opinion of himself was generally strengthened by a glass or two of wine  i thought that matter of the shares would have taught you sense but you must listen to batley again this afternoon she scolded you were with him for half an hour ive no patience with you jim  hes not so easy to shake off particularly as im in his debt returned the lad besides hes an interesting fellow the kind you learn a good deal from its an education to mix with such men  the trouble is that its expensive come away with me before he ruins you theres mrs barnards invitation to their place in scotland it would be a good excuse  her brothers rather lofty manner changed  youre a dear bella you know you dont want to go  having a strong reason for wishing to stay she colored at this among his other unprepossessing characteristics jim had a trick of saying things he should suppress  never mind me she answered will you come  he had an incomplete recognition of the magnitude of the sacrifice she was ready to make though it was not this that decided him not to fall in with it  no he said with raw selfconfidence im not one to run away but ill promise to keep my eye on the fellow after this and be cautious all his schemes arent in the same class as those mining shares you know  bella lost her temper and told him some plain truths about himself and this did not improve matters for in the end she retired defeated leaving jim rather sore but on the whole satisfied with the firmness he had displayed the girl felt dejected and almost desperate she could not continually apply to lisle for assistance and she shrank from the only other course that seemed open to her but her affection for the misguided lad impelled her to make another attempt to rescue him and a few days later she found her opportunity it was a bold measure she had decided on one that might cost her a good deal but she was a young woman of courage and determination  mrs marple and her daughter drove over with her to call on mrs gladwyne they found several other people present and as usual there was no ceremony the day was fine and the hostess sat outside while the guests strolled about the terrace and gardens very much as they liked bella hearing that clarence was engaged in the library and would not be down for a little while slipped away in search of him her heart beat painfully fast as she went up the wide staircase but she was outwardly very collecteda slender attractive figurewhen she entered the room in her dress as well as in her manner bella was usually distinguished by something unconventional and picturesque she was not pleased to see batley standing beside the table at which gladwyne sat but the man gathered up some papers when he noticed her  ive explained the thing gladwyne and i expect miss crestwick will excuse me he said  his manner was goodhumored as he bowed to her and though she almost hated the man she was conscious of a faint respect for him he might have thwarted her by remaining for she had often made him a butt for her bitter wit now however when she had shown that his presence was not required he was gallantly withdrawing when he went out she sat down and gladwyne rose and stood with one hand on the mantel waiting for her to begin instead she glanced round the room which always impressed her it was lofty and spacious the few articles of massive furniture gave it a severe dignity and there was no doubt that gladwyne with his handsome person and highbred air appeared at home in it  while she looked around he was thinking about her she was provocatively pretty a fearless passionate creature addicted to occasional reckless outbreaks but nevertheless endowed with a vein of cold and calculating sense what was as much to the point she was wealthy and people were becoming more tolerant toward her but in the meanwhile he wondered what she wanted  i came about jim she said at length  well  the mans expression which suddenly changed was not encouraging and she hesitated  you know what hes doing ive come to ask a favor  he avoided the issue  its nothing alarming i dont suppose hes very different from most lads of his age perhaps it would be better to let him have his head  no she replied decidedly the pace is too hot i cant hold him hell come to grief badly if hes not pulled up you know that as well as i do  her anger became her bringing a fine glow to her cheeks and a hint of halfimperious dignity into her pose it had an effect on him but he felt somewhat ashamed of himself  well he asked in a quiet voice whats the favor  shouldnt a sportsman and a man of your kind grant it unconditionally beforehand must you be sure you wont get hurt when you make a venture  youd risk it he answered bowing youre admirable bella still you see im either more cautious or less courageous  she was badly disappointed she knew that a good deal depended on his answer to her request and shrank from making it because it would prove the strength or weakness of her hold on him the man attracted her and she had somewhat openly attempted to capture him she longed for the position he could give her she would have married him for that and his house but she was willing to risk her success for her brothers welfare  i want you to tell batley that he must keep his hands off of jim she said  he started at this  he cant do the lad much harm arent you attaching a little too much importance to the matter  no not in the least she answered vehemently ive told you so already but cant you keep to the point my brothers being ruined in several ways besides the debts hes heaping up and ive humbled myself to beg your help  was it so very hard he asked and his voice grew soft and caressing  she was shaken to the verge of yielding the man was handsome cultivated distinguished she thought whether she actually loved him she did not know but he could gratify her ambitions and she was strongly drawn to him he had given her a lead an opening for a few telling words that might go far toward the accomplishment of her wishes but tempted as she was she would not utter them she was loyal to the headstrong lad jim stood first with her  that is beside the point she said with a becoming air of pride i expected you would be willing to do whatever you could to be refused what i plead for is new to me  he considered for a moment or two watching her with keen appreciation bella in her present mood with her affectations cast aside appealed to him she was not altogether the woman he would have chosen but since he must secure a rich wife there were obvious benefits to be derived from a match with her he devoutly wished he could accede to her request  well she broke out impatiently  im sorry he said im unable to do as you desire of course i wish i could if only to please you though i really dont think the things necessary  you neednt tell me that again its a waste of time im not going to discuss it face the difficulty whatever it is do you mean that you cant warn off batley  gladwyne saw that she would insist on a definite answer and in desperation he told the truth  its out of the question  it was a shock to her in a sudden flash of illumination she saw him as he was weak and irresolute helpless in the grip of a stronger man it was significant that she felt no compassion for him but only disgust and contempt she was no coward and even jim who could so easily be deluded was ready enough to fight on due occasion  you are afraid of the fellow she exclaimed  gladwyne colored and moved abruptly he had imagined that she was his for the asking but there was no mistaking her cutting scorn  bella he pleaded dont be bitter you cant understand the difficulties im confronted with  i can understand too much her voice trembled but she rose rather white in face with an air of decision when i came i expectedbut after all that doesnt matteri never expected this  he made no answer the man had some little pride and there was nothing to be said he had fallen very low even in this girls estimation and the fact was almost intolerably galling but he could make no effective defense she went from him slowly but with a suggestive deliberation without looking back and there was a hint of finality in the way she closed the door  once outside she strove to brace herself for the interview had tried her hard she had had to choose between gladwyne and her brother but for that she was now almost thankful the man she had admired had changed and become contemptible it was as if he had suddenly collapsed and shriveled before her startled eyes but that was not all the troubleshe was as far from saving jim as ever  it cost her an effort to rejoin the others but she was equal to it and during the rest of her stay her conversation was a shade more audacious than usual     chapter xvi  gladwyne surrenders   evening was drawing on when bella strolled aimlessly down the ascending road that led to marples residence on one hand of the road there was a deep rift filled with shadow in which a beck murmured among the stones and the oaks that climbed to the ridge above flung their great branches against the saffron glow in the western sky fallen leaves glowing brown and red had gathered thick beneath one hedgerow and more came slowly sailing down but bella brushed through them unheeding oblivious to her surroundings she had suffered during the few days that had followed her interview with gladwyne and even the sharp encounter with miss marple in which she had recently indulged had not cheered her though it had left her friend smarting  presently she looked around with interest as a figure appeared farther up the road and recognizing the fine poise and vigorous stride she stopped and waited lisle was a bracing person to talk to and she wanted to see him he soon came up with her and she greeted him cordially unlike gladwyne he was a real man resolute and resourceful with a generous vein in him and she did not resent the fact that he looked rather hard at her  you dont seem as cheerful as usual he observed  im not she confessed in fact i think i was very nearly crying  whats the trouble he showed both interest and sympathy  oh you neednt ask its jim again ive tried every means and i cant do anything with him  he is pretty uncontrollable seems to have gone back to batley again i wonder if it would be any good if i looked for an opportunity for making a row with the fellow  no she answered with appreciation for this was very different from gladwynes attitude it would only separate jim from you and i dont want that to happen please keep hold of him though i know that cant be pleasant for you  he is trying now and then but ill do what i can gladwyne however has more influence than i have did you think of asking him  she colored and in her brief confusion he read his answer with strong indignationshe had pleaded with gladwyne and he had refused to help  do you know she said looking up at him youre the only real friend i have theres nobody else i can trust  i think youre wrong in that he declared and acting on impulse he laid a hand protectingly on her shoulder for she looked very dejected and forlorn anyway you mustnt worry ill do somethingin fact something will have to be done  what will you do  he knitted his brows there was a course which promised to be effective open to him but he was most averse to adopting it he could give gladwyne a plain hint that he had better restrain his confederate but he could enforce compliance only by stating what he knew about the formers desertion of his cousin he was not ready to do that yet it would precipitate the climax and once his knowledge of the matter was revealed his power to use it in case of a stronger need might be diminished the temptation to leave jim crestwick to his fate was strong but his pity for the anxious girl was stronger  ill have a talk with gladwyne he promised  that wouldnt be of the least use  i think hell do what i suggest lisle answered with a trace of grimness make your mind easy ill have batley stopped  she looked at him in surprise filled with relief and gratitude he was one who would not promise more than he could perform but how he could force his will on gladwyne she did not know  youre wonderful she exclaimed whatever one asks youre able to do  and youre very staunch  oh she said standing very close to him with his hand still on her shoulder we wont exchange complimentstheyre too empty and you deserve something better she glanced round swiftly shut your eyes tight  he obeyed her and for a moment light fingers rested on his breast then there was a faint warm touch upon his cheek when he looked up she was standing a yard away smiling mockingly  dont trust your imagination too muchit might have deceived you she warned but you have sense you wouldnt attach an undue value to anything  confidence and gratitude are precious he answered id better point out that i havent earned either of them yet  bella was satisfied with this but she grew graver wondering how far she might have delivered gladwyne into his hands she was angry with the man but she would not have him suffer  i dont know what power you havebut you wont make too much use of iti dont wish that she begged after all though jim must be got out of that fellows clutches  yes assented lisle theres no doubt of it  she left him presently and he went on down the dale not exactly repenting of his promise but regretting the necessity which had led to his making it the task with which he had saddled himself was an exceedingly unpleasant one and might afterward make it more difficult for him to accomplish the purpose that had brought him to england but he meant to carry it out  as it happened he met mrs gladwyne at millicents where he called and he spent an uncomfortable halfhour in her company she had shown in various ways that she liked him and calling him to her side soon after he came in she talked to him in an unusually genial manner he felt like a traitor in this gracious ladys presence and it was a relief when she took her departure  you look troubled millicent observed  thats how i feel he confessed after all it isnt a very uncommon sensation its sometimes difficult to see ahead  often she answered smiling what do you do thenstop a little and consider  not as a rule the longer you consider the difficulties the worse they look its generally better to go right on  millicent agreed with this and soon afterward lisle took his departure and walked back to nasmyths in an unusually serious mood they were sitting smoking when his host broached the subject that was occupying him  its some time since you said anything about the project that brought you over he remarked  thats so assented lisle im fixed much as i was when we last spoke of it when i was in canada i thought id only to find gladwyne and scare a confession out of him now i find that what ive undertaken isnt by any means so simple  i warned you that it wouldnt be  you were right theres his mother to considerits a privilege to know hershes devoted to the fellow then theres millicent in a way shes almost as devoted anyhow shes a staunch friend of his i dont know how either of them would stand the revelation  it would kill mrs gladwyne nasmyth declared  there was silence for a while and then lisle spoke again  im badly worried any move of mine would lead to endless troubleand yet theres the black blot on the memory of the man to whom i owe so much i cant bring myself to let it remain besides all this theres another complication  young crestwicks somehow connected with it nasmyth guessed  lisle did not deny it  that crackbrained lad seems to be the pivot on which the whole thing turns curious isnt it i wish the responsibility hadnt been laid on my shoulders just now i cant tell what i ought to doits harassing  dont force things wait for developments nasmyth advised him im not trying to extract information the only reason i mentioned the subject is that a man in the home counties has asked me to come up for a few weeks and bring you along hes a good sort theres fair sport and its a nice place but i dont mind in the least whether i go or not  then id rather stay ive a feeling that i may be wanted here  im quite satisfied for a reason ill explain you have ridden that young bay horse of mine he comes of good stock and hes showing signs of an excellent pace over the hurdles now i couldnt expect to enter him for any firstrate eventhes hardly fast enough and its too expensive in various waysbut theres a little semiprivate meeting to be held before long at a place about thirty miles off i might have a chance there if we put him into training immediately you know something about horses  not much responded lisle ive made one long journey in the saddle in alberta but youve seen our british columbian trails our cayuses have generally to climb and as a rule ive used horses only for packing still im fond of them id be interested in the thing  nasmyth nodded  one difficulty is that theres nothing in the neighborhood that i could try him for pace against except that horse of gladwynes  hed no doubt let you have the beast  its possible nasmyth agreed dryly but ive objections to being indebted to him and i dont want batley marple and crestwick to take a hand in and put their money on me however well think it over  they retired to sleep soon afterward and the next day lisle walked across to call on gladwyne in a quietly determined mood clarence was in his library and he looked up with some curiosity when lisle was shown in lisle came to the point at once  youve no doubt noticed that jim crestwick has been going pretty hard of late he said bets speculation and that sort of thing he cant keep it up on a minors allowance it will end in a bad smash if he isnt checked  gladwynes manner became supercilious  i fail to see how it concerns you or for that matter either of us  we wont go into the questionits beside the point what i want you to do is to pull him up  he spoke as if he meant to be obeyed and gladwyne looked at him in incredulous astonishment  do you suppose im able to restrain the lad  you ought to be lisle answered coolly its your friend batley whos leading him on to ruin im making no comments on your conduct in standing by and watching as if you approved of it  the man grew hot with anger  thank you for your consideration his tone changed to a sneer i suppose you couldnt be expected to realize that the attitude youre adopting is inexcusable  if you dont like it ill try another lisle returned curtly youll give batley his orders to leave the lad alone right now  gladwyne rose with his utmost dignity a fine gentleman whose feelings had been outraged by the coarse attack of a barbarian but lisle waved his hand in a contemptuous manner  stop where you are that kind of thing is thrown away on me youre going to listen for a few minutes and afterward youre going to do what i tell you to begin withwhy after youd opened it didnt you wipe out all trace of the cache on the reach below the last portage your cousin made  the shot obviously reached its mark for gladwyne clutched the table hard and then sank back limply into his seat he further betrayed himself by a swift instinctive glance toward the rows of books behind him and lisle had no doubt that the missing pages from george gladwynes diary were hidden among them he waited calmly sure of his position while gladwyne with difficulty pulled himself together  have you any proof that i found the cache he asked  i think so lisle informed him but well let that slide youd better take the thing for granted im not here to answer questions ive told you plainly what i want  there was silence for nearly a minute during which gladwyne sat very still in nerveless dismay all resistance had melted out of him his weakness was manifesthe could not face a crisis there was no courage in him  the miserable young idiot he broke out at length in impotent rage this is not the first trouble in which he has involved me  just so said lisle not long ago his sister came here begging you to save him and you wouldnt its not my part to point what she must think of you but im in a different position you wont refuse me  gladwyne leaned forward gripping the arms of his chair as if he needed support and his face grew haggard  the difficulty is that im helpless he declared  lisle regarded him with contempt  brace up he advised him the fellow youre afraid of is only flesh and blood he has his weak point somewhere face him and find it if you cant talk him round theres no other way open to you  a brief silence followed and then gladwyne broke it  ill try but suppose i can induce him to leave crestwick alone  so much the better for you lisle answered with a dry smile im not here to make a bargain i dont want anything for myself  he went out consoling himself with the last reflection for the part he had played had been singularly disagreeable passing down the wide staircase and through the great hall he turned along the terrace with a sense of wonder and disgust it was a stately house the wide sweep of lawn where two gardeners were carefully sweeping up the leaves the borders beyond it blazing with dahlias and ranks of choice chrysanthemums conveyed the same suggestion of order wealth and refinement one might he thought have expected to find some qualities that matched with thesedignity power a fine regard for honorin the owner of such a place but he had not even common courage an imposing figure to outward seeming the canadian regarded him as one who owed everything to a little surface polish and his london clothes  lisle paused to look back when he reached the end of the terrace from which a path that would save him a short walk led through a shrubbery one wing of the building was covered with virginia creeper that glowed with the gorgeous hues of a fading maple leaf the sunlight lay on the grass and the feeling of tranquillity that hung about the place grew stronger he thought that he could understand how the desire to possess it would stir an englishman reared in such surroundings and yet he was now convinced that this was not the impulse which had driven gladwyne into deserting his starving cousin the man had merely yielded to craven fear  he heard footsteps and looking around was a little surprised to see batley moving toward him  you have just called on gladwyne batley began  lisle stopped there was so far as he knew nothing to be said in favor of the man but his cool boldness was tempered by a certain geniality and an occasional candor that the canadian could not help appreciating he preferred batley to gladwyne  thats so he agreed  im inclined to think your visit concerned me ive noticed your interest in young crestwickits obviousi dont know whether one could say the same of the cause of it  we wont discuss that if you have anything to say to me you had better adopt a less offensive style  batley smiled goodhumoredly  youre quick at resenting things i dont see why you should expect a longer patience from me  i dont expect anything from you lisle informed him in proof of it ill mention that i called to tell gladwyne he must keep you off of jim crestwick  he made a slip in the last few words which the other quickly noticed  ordered him in fact he said  lisle made no answer and batley resumed  you have some kind of a hold on gladwyne so have i of course its no news to you im a little curious to learn what yours consists of  why  it struck me that we might work together  im not going in for cardsharping or anything of that kind  the man seemed roused by this but he mastered his anger  civility isnt expensive and sometimes its wise he observed i wont return the compliment in fact ill credit you with the most disinterested motives all i mean is that i might help you and you might help me im not quite what you seem to think i am and if i can get my money back out of gladwyne i wont harm him  i dont care in the least whether you harm him or not but ill try to arrange that you drop crestwick  batley considered this for a moment or two  well he said im sorry we cant agree but as regards crestwick you can only head me off by forcing gladwyne to interfere between ourselves do you think hes a man whos likely to take a bold course  i think soin the present case  you mean if the pressures sufficient now you have given me a glimpse at your hand and ill be candid gladwyne rather let me in and theres a risk in dealing with a lad whos to all intents and purposes a minor ive gone about as far with him as i consider judicious dont do anything that may damage gladwyne financially without giving me warning and in return ill let crestwick go to some extent i only got hold of him as an offset to the trouble ive had with gladwyne is it a bargain you can trust me  well let it go at that replied lisle but ill keep my eye on you  batleys gesture implied that he would not object to this and he turned away leaving the canadian to walk back to nasmyths thoughtfully lisle did not think he had done gladwyne much harm by his tacit admissions and he had some degree of confidence in batleys assurance     chapter xvii  a bad fall   gladwyne spent the first few days that followed lisles visit in a state of dread and indecision he had allowed the canadian to understand that he would endeavor to prevent crestwicks being further victimized but he had already failed to induce batley to abandon the exploitation of the lad and he had no cause for believing that a second attempt would be more successful moreover he shrank from making it the man had shown him clearly that he would brook no interference  on the other hand he was equally afraid of lisle this cool determined canadian was not to be trifled with and he knew or suspected enough about the tragedy in british columbia to make him dangerous it was certain that a revelation of batleys speculation would go a very long way toward establishing the truth of any damaging story lisle thought fit to tell supposing the two by any chance combined their knowledgethat he had raised money in anticipation of his cousins death and afterward left him to perishnothing that he could say would count against the inference george had been a healthy man not much older than clarence when the money was borrowed and his decease within a limited time had appeared improbable nobody would believe the actual truth that batley with characteristic boldness had in return for what he thought a sufficient consideration in the shape of an exorbitant interest taken a serious risk the thing would look like a conspiracy between the heir presumptive and the speculator who lent the money and in this for a bold man there might have been a loophole for escape but gladwyne knew that he had not the nerve to use the fact against his ally  nevertheless gladwyne was really guiltless in one respecthe had not desired his cousins death he would have gone back to the rescue had he not dreaded that he would share georges fate lack of courage had been his bane and it was so now for instead of speaking to batley he temporized the man had made no further attempt upon crestwick and gladwyne decided that until he did so there was no need for him to interfere still as the next few weeks passed he was conscious of a growing dread of the canadian which as sometimes happens became tinged with hatred lisle was the more serious menace and it was ominous that he now and then exchanged a word or two with batley if the two formed an offensive alliance he would be helpless at their hands  in the meanwhile nasmyth has been training his horse for the approaching meeting and after trying him against one belonging to a neighbor and not finding it fast enough he had reluctantly fallen back on a chestnut owned by gladwyne the animal possessed a fine speed and some jumping powers its chief fault was a vicious temper but gladwyne was seldom troubled by lack of nerve in the saddle it was in time of heavy moral strain that he failed and he was glad to arrange with nasmyth for a sharp gallop  somewhat to the latters regret news of his intentions had spread and on the morning of the trial a number of people including the marples and crestwicks and millicent had gathered about the course it was a dark day with a moist air and a low gray sky the grass was wet a strip of plowing which could not be avoided was soft and heavy and the ground in front of several of the jumps was in a far from satisfactory state nasmyth who kept a very small establishment and had hitherto generally ridden the horse walked round part of the course with lisle  it will be heavy going and theres a nasty greasy patch at the biggest fence he said id have waited for a better day only that its often wet where they have the meeting and i want to see what he can do over ground like this youll have to watch him at the jumps  hed do better with you in the saddle lisle suggested  id rather put you up im not going to ride at the meeting im over the weight they ought to give him and i want to get him used to a strangers hands as its an outside event of no importance i havent fixed on my man yet  they walked back toward the startingpoint where gladwyne was waiting with batley and crestwick in attendance as they approached it millicent joined them  are you going to ride today she asked lisle  nasmyth insists was the answer im afraid i wont do him much credit  gladwyne looked up with a slight frown  you wont mind nasmyth asked him id penalize the horse by nearly a stone  no replied gladwyne shortly theres no reason why i should object  this was true but he had an unreasoning aversion to facing this opponent of late the canadian had caused him trouble at almost every turn and it looked as if he could not even indulge in a mornings amusement without being plagued with him he was conscious of a most uncharitable wish that lisle would come to grief at one of the fences and break his neck in many ways this would be a vast relief  would anybody like to make it a sporting match crestwick asked the bays my fancy im ready to back it  bella tried to catch his eye but he disregarded this she however saw lisle glance at batley and noticed the latters smile  it isnt worth while betting on trials batley declared better wait until the meeting  the girl was less astonished than gratified gladwyne was surprised and disconcerted he had said nothing to batley about crestwick but he had noticed lisles warning glance and the others prompt acquiescence appeared significant it looked as if the two had joined hands and that was what he most dreaded an almost overpowering rage against the canadian possessed him when he attempted to mount the chestnut gave him trouble by backing and plunging but the bay was quiet and nasmyth stood for a few moments by lisles stirrup  save him a bit for the second round he advised another thing look out when you come to the bigbrushed hurdles particularly the second time  batley volunteered as starter and when he got them off satisfactorily the spectators scattered one or two to watch the pace across the plowed land the others moving toward the stiffest jumpsthe course was roughly circular  the trial was a new experience to lisle and he felt the exhilaration of it as remembering his instructions he strove to hold his mount gladwynes horse was a length ahead of him the wind lashed his face and the thrill of the race grew keener when he swept over the first fence hard upon the flying chestnuts heels he dropped another length behind as they crossed the next field and labored over the sticky plowing then there was a low fence and ditch a narrow meadow and then the hurdles nasmyth had mentioned filling a gap in a tall thorn hedge they were wattled with branches which projected a foot or so above them  it did not look an easy jump and the grass was slippery and soft but the chestnut accomplished it cleverly and the bay flew at the hurdles with every sign of confidence then though lisle felt the hoofs slide as the beast took off they were over and flying faster than ever across a long wet field as they approached the end of the first round the chestnut began to drop back lisle could let the bay go and he determined to bring him home the winner it was his first fast ride in england and he had indeed seldom urged a horse to its utmost pacethe british columbian trails for the most part led steeply up or down rugged hillsides where speed was out of the question it was very different on these level english meadows though the ground was softer than usual and the fences were troublesome he rode with a zest and ardor he had hardly expected to feel  he led at the next fence and some of the onlookers shouted encouragement when drawing a little farther ahead he once more reached the sticky plowed land here the bay slowed a little toiling across the clods but a glance over his shoulder showed his opponent still at least two lengths behind gladwyne however now roused himself to ride in earnest hitherto he had taken no great interest in the proceedings but he had just seen bella wave her hand to lisle and then millicents applauding smile he resented the fact that both should be pleased to see him beaten by this intrusive stranger it reawakened his rancor and the strain of the last week or two had shaken him rather badly he was nervous his selfcontrol was weak but he meant to pass his rival  he was still behind at the next fence but pressing his horse savagely he crept up a little as they approached the one really difficult jump and as they sped across the narrow meadow lisle fancied that the bay was making its last effort crestwick was standing near the hurdles with nasmyth moving rapidly toward them not far away and bella running across a neighboring field crestwick watched gladwyne intently the mans face was strangely eager considering that all he had been asked to do was to test the bays speed and there was a hardness in his expression that fixed crestwicks attention he wondered the cause of it  bella was close to him when lisle riding hard rushed at the hurdles and jim found it hard to repress a shout as the bays hoofs slipped and slid on the treacherous turf the horse rose however there was a heavy crash wattled branches and the top bar of the hurdle smashed lisle lurched in his saddle and then the bay came down in a heap with the man beneath him  it was impossible to doubt that gladwyne had seen the accident but the chestnut rushed straight at the shattered hurdle teeth bare nostrils dilated head stretched forward and crestwick thrilled with horror the fallen horse was struggling rolling upon its rider just beyond the fence but gladwyne did nothing except sit ready for the leap it was incomprehensible so was the look in the mans face which was grimly set as the big chestnut rose in a graceful bound  there was a sickening thud on the other side a flounder of slipping hoofs and the staccato pounding of the gallop broke out again the chestnut had come down upon the fallen horse or helpless man and was going on uncontrollable crestwick rushed madly at the hedge and scrambling through badly scratched and bareheaded found nasmyth trying to drag lisle clear of the bay the canadians eyes were half open but there was no expression in them one arm and shoulder looked distorted and his face was gray halfway across the field gladwyne was struggling savagely with the plunging chestnut  get hold ordered nasmyth hoarsely some bones broken by the look of him but hell have his brains knocked out in another moment  crestwick was cruelly kicked as the bay rolled in agony striking with its hoofs but he stuck to his task and with some difficulty they dragged lisle out of danger when they had accomplished it marple came running up with two or three others and nasmyth called to him  came in the car didnt you go off for irvine as hard as you can drive drop somebody at my place to run back with a gun  marple swung round and set off across the field and crestwick understood why the gun was wanted when he glanced at the fallen horse nasmyth informed him that nothing could be done until the doctor came and he turned away toward where his sister was waiting his forehead and hands were torn and he was conscious of a bad ache in his back where a hoof had struck but these things scarcely troubled him he was overwhelmed horrorstricken and the shock of seeing lisle crushed and senseless was not the only cause of it bella gasping after her run with hair shaken loose about her face seemed to be suffering from the same sensation that unnerved him  is he dead she asked falteringly  no badly hurt i think  ah she exclaimed with intense relief i was most horribly afraid she paused before she resumed you were close by the hurdles  jim knew she meant that he must have seen what happened but shaking as he was he looked hard at her wondering in a halfdazed fashion what reply he should make he thought her suspicions were aroused  you were some way back you couldnt have seen anything plainly he ventured  i was very nearlooking back toward themwhen they crossed the field before the jump youve gone all to pieces what did you see  i cant talk about it now jim broke out hes coming back  gladwyne had dismounted and was with some difficulty leading the chestnut toward the hedge his face was white he moved with a strong suggestion of reluctance and when he reached the spot where lisle lay he seemed to have trouble in speaking  is it dangerous he asked  i cant tell nasmyth answered sternly shoulders smashed dont know if thats the worst why didnt you pull up the brute or send him at the hedge to the right  hes hard in the mouthyou know his temper you couldnt have turned him  id have tried if id had to bring him down and break his neck  nasmyth checked himself for this was not the time for recriminations and millicent who had been running hard brushed past them she did not stop until she bent over lisle then she turned to nasmyth with fear in her strained expression  i think hell get over it nasmyth told her i wont take the responsibility of having him moved until the doctor arrives  quite right agreed batley walking up and casting a swift and searching glance at gladwyne  but you cant let him lie on the wet grass millicent expostulated  im afraid we must its safest said batley the shocks not so much to be dreaded with a man of his kind  he and nasmyth took charge of the situation sternly refusing to listen to all wellmeant suggestions until at last the doctor and marple came hurrying across the field the former hastily examined the injured man and then looked up at nasmyth  upper arm gone close to the shoulder joint he announced collarbone too ill give him some brandy shout to those fellows with the stretcher  he was busy for some time and in the meanwhile batley picked up the flask he had laid down and handed it to gladwyne  take a good drink and pull yourself together he said quietly  at length lisle was gently lifted on to the stretcher and as they carried him away the report of a gun ran out the onlookers dispersed and gladwyne was walking home alone when millicent overtook him she was puzzled by his limp appearance and the expression of his haggard face it was only natural that he should keenly feel his responsibility for the accident but this did not quite seem to account for the mans condition he looked absolutely unnerved like one who had barely escaped from some appalling catastrophe  you shouldnt take it quite so much to heart she comforted him i dont think irvine felt any great uneasiness and nobody could blame you  youre the only one who has said so he answered moodily  they couldnt you stole away of course its a great pityim distressedbut you must try to be sensible these accidents happen  he walked on a while in silence and then with an effort looked around at her  millicent he said youre wonderfully generousthe sight of anybody in trouble stirs youbut i dont feel able to bear your sympathy  then ill have to offer it to lisle she smiled but ill walk with you to the lodge and then you had better go in and keep quiet until you get back your nerve  when she left gladwyne she went on to nasmyths where she waited until the doctor on leaving told her that he was perfectly satisfied with the prospect for the canadians recovery it would he said be merely a question of lying still for a considerable time millicent was conscious of a relief which puzzled her by its intensity as she heard the news but she asked nasmyth to send somebody to inform gladwyne  i think hes desperately anxious and feeling the thing very badly she concluded  then he could have come over to inquire as you have done nasmyth answered in my opinion he deserves to be uncomfortable  why are you so hard on him  the mans face grew grim  ive had to help irvine with lisle for one thing we were satisfied that his injuries were not caused by the bay rolling on him he seems to have escaped from that with a few bad bruises the worst of the accident might have been avoided if clarence had had nerve enough  but you couldnt blame him very greatly for losing his headhe had no warning scarcely a moment to think it was so sudden  the results the same retorted nasmyth lisle has to pay but to please you ill send clarence word that irvines not anxious about him     chapter xviii  a prudent decision   it had been dark some time and the night was raw but jim crestwick strolled up and down the drive to marples house thinking unusually hard in the first place part at least of the folly of his conduct during the last year or two had been plainly brought home to him and the realization was bitter it was galling to discover that while he had regarded himself as a man of the world he had been systematically victimized by the men who had encouraged him in the delusion he felt very sore as he remembered how much he owed batley but this troubled him less than the downright abhorrence of gladwyne which had suddenly possessed him he had looked up to the latter as a model and had tried to copy his manners and it was chiefly because batley was a friend of gladwynes that he had paid toll to him for he had felt that whatever the man he admired was willing to countenance must be the correct thing now he saw gladwyne as he really wasa betrayer of those who trusted him a counterfeit of an honorable type one who had by the merest chance escaped from crime  in the second place he was concerned about bella she had obviously been attracted by gladwyne and it was his duty to warn her whether the warning was altogether necessary he could not tellhe had watched her face that morningand bella sometimes resented advice when she did so she had an exasperating trick of putting him in the wrong but he meant to speak to her as plainly as appeared desirable he had another dutyto lisle but he was inclined to think that on the whole he had better not saddle himself with it his selfconfidence had been rudely shaken and he recognized the possibility of his making things worse moreover he had cultivated the pride of caste and having with some difficulty obtained an entry to the circle in which gladwyne moved he felt it incumbent on him to guard the honor of all who belonged to it  presently bella came out as he had anticipated and joined him  you have been very quiet since this morning she began i saw that you meant to slip away as soon as you could  yes he admitted ive had something to think aboutive been a fool bella the commonest most easily gulled kind of imbecile  he had expected her to remind him that she had more than once tried to convince him of this but she failed to do so instead she answered with a touch of the candor that sometimes characterized her  youre not the only one  this was satisfactory for it suggested that she had been undeceived about gladwyne but she had not finished  what did you see this morning she asked and he felt that she was speaking with keen anxiety  ill tell you but it must never go any farther i hate to think of it but first of all what makes you ask  she had already mentioned that she had been near when gladwyne made his attempt to come up with lisle but she had not explained that she had seen hatred stamped in hideous plainness on his face  never mind she answered sharply go on  well said jim i was standing right against the hedge the only person on that side and i dont think gladwyne saw me lisles bay fouled the top bar of the hurdle but it held long enough to bring him down in a heap gladwyne was then a length or two behind he rode straight at the broken hurdle hands stilli cant get his look out of my mind  but perhaps he couldnt pull up bella defended him desperately as if she would not believe the truth she dreaded  there were other ways open he could have gone at the hedge a yard or two on one side he could have spoiled the chestnuts takeoff and made him jump short it might have brought him downthe hurdle was firm in the groundbut that would have been better than riding over a fallen man  are you sure he did nothing  i wish i were not the things horrible gladwyne must have seen that hed come down on lisle or the struggling bayhe could have prevented ithe didnt try  bella shivered her brother was right it was almost beyond contemplation but that was only half of the matter  he must have had a reason she argued harshly  yes one doesnt ride over a man in coldblood for nothing i think he had some cause for being afraid of lisle several things i remember now point to it his chance came suddenlynobody could have arranged ithe only remembered that lisle with his brains crushed out could do him no harm  the girl recognized that jim had guessed correctly when she had gone to lisle for help he had allowed her to understand that he could compel gladwynes compliance with his request which was significant still convinced as she was she would not openly acquiesce in her brothers theory  jim she protested if hed ridden at the hedge or made the chestnut jump short he might have broken his own neck he must have realized itit would make him hesitate  the lad laughed scornfully  its quite possible but is that any excuse would nasmyth or lisle or batley have shirked a risk that would mean the saving of the other fellow supposing your ideas rightthough it isntit only shows the man as a disgusting coward  there was no gainsaying this and bella was crushed and humiliated she had already seen gladwynes weakness and after the choice she had been compelled to make between him and her brother she had tried to drive all thought of him out of her mind it had been difficult he was fascinating in many ways and she had set her heart upon his capture now she had done with him after the mornings revelation she shrank from him with positive horror jim seemed to guess this  im sorry bella he said gently but the fellows impossible  she laid her hand upon his arm  jim she replied we have both been mad and i suppose we must pay for it ill help you to get clear of batley when the time comes but you must never have a deal of any kind with him again  thats promised ive had my lesson i think ill ask lisle to take me with him when he goes back to canada he and nasmyth are the only men worth speaking of ive met for a long while when lisle first came here i tried to patronize him  bella laughed rather feebly but she wanted to relieve the tension  it was like you but well go in this is our secret jim nobody would believe you if you let fall a hint as to what really happened and there are many reasons why you shouldnt i think you said nobody else could have suspected  nasmyth hadnt come up when the chestnut reached the hurdles he was the nearest lisle was down with the horse upon him he couldnt have seen anything  well she decided perhaps thats fortunate it isnt likely that gladwyne will get such an opportunity again and at the worst he acted on the spur of the moment  the lad nodded he had felt that silence would entail some responsibility but bella accepted it without uneasiness she seldom showed any hesitation when she had decided on a course  in the meanwhile gladwyne had spent a miserable day alternating between horror of himself and doubts about the future jim crestwicks description of the incident was correctgladwyne had ridden straight at the broken hurdle knowing what the consequences might be and disregarding them the next moment however the reaction had begun and he was thankful that he had not committed a hideous crime indeed the knowledge that he had come so near to killing his opponent had left him badly shaken he wondered at his insensate action until he recollected how he had once stood beside an opened cache in canada and then ignoring his manifest duty had hurried on through the frozen wilderness on that occasion he had been accountable for his cousins death and now lisle had very narrowly escaped  yet he could with justice acquit himself of any premeditated intention in either case fate had thrust him into a situation he was not strong enough to grapple with dreading lisle as he did his chief thought had been for his own safety when he saw the bay blunder at the leap to save the canadian he must take a serious personal risk which was foreign to his nature and though a recognition of the fact that the death of the fallen man would be a great relief to him had been clearly in his mind it was impossible to say how far it had actuated him  he had grown more collected when he sat in his library as dusk was closing in considering other aspects of the affair he had not seen crestwick and lisle he thought would remember nothing except his fall after trying to recall the positions of the others he felt comforted nobody could charge him with anything worse than reckless riding or a failure of nerve at a critical moment he would confess to the latterit was to some extent the truthand show concern about lisles injury awkward as it was the incident could be smothered over it was consoling to remember that the people he lived among were addicted to treating anything of an unpleasant nature as lightly as possible there was a good deal to be said for the sensible english custom of ignoring what it would be disconcerting to realize  after a while his mother came in and gently touched him  my dear she urged you mustnt brood over it lisles conditions satisfactory as its some hours since we got nasmyths message i sent a man over and he has just come back  im glad you sent gladwyne responded it was thoughtful i forgot but ive been badly troubled  she sat down near him with her hand laid caressingly on his arm  its natural i understand and feel for you i wouldnt have liked you to be indifferent but you mustnt make too much of it the man is strong he will soon be about again and you couldnt have saved him everybody ive seen so far has given me that impression of course i didnt need their assurances but i was glad to see they exonerated and sympathized with you  her confidence hurt him he had still a sense of shame and he found no great comfort in what she told him his mother was generally loved and he wondered how far his neighbors had been influenced by a desire to save her pain  it looks as if lisle deserves their commiseration more than i do he answered with a smile which cost him an effort  it is being shown i noticed nearly everybody in the neighborhood motoring or driving toward the house during the afternoon millicents with nasmyth now helping to arrange things its wonderful what a favorite lisle has become in so short a time but i own that i find something very likable about him  gladwyne moved impatiently his hatred of the man was as strong as ever and his mothers attempts at consolation irritated him lisle was too popular first bella and now millicent had taken him in hand  millicent mrs gladwyne went on is an exceptional woman in every desirable respect i think you have long been as convinced of that as i am  im afraid she cant have an equally favorable opinion of me he said with a short laugh  one does not look for perfection in a man his mother informed him seriously he is criticized much less severely than a woman it seems to be the universal rule though i have sometimes thought it wasnt absolutely just and that it had its drawbacks its one of the things the women who go out and speak are declaiming against and something one of them lately said sticks in my mind she sighed as she added the times are changing there was no need to consider such questions in your fathers case he was the soul of honoryou were very young when death parted us  she did not always express herself clearly but gladwyne saw that she did not place him in the same category as his father and he recognized her halfformulated thought that it would have been better had he grown up under the latters firmer guidance  wonders never cease mother he responded with an attempt at lightness its difficult to imagine your being influenced by the latest propaganda i thought you shuddered at it  well she said i was forgetting what i meant to talk about drifting away from the subject im afraid its a habit of mine what i have long felt is that it would be so desirable if you married suitably  the trouble is to define the suitability its a point upon which everybody has a different opinion  i would choose a girl of good family and education for you one with a wellbalanced will who could see what was right and cling to it still she must be wise and gentle a tactful considerate guide and though means are not of first importance they are not to be despised  gladwyne leaned back in his chair with a laugh that had in it a tinge of irritation  are such girls numerous but why do you insist on a will and the power of guiding it looks as if you thought i needed it sometimes youre the reverse of flattering  his mother looked troubled she would have wounded no living creature unnecessarily  my dear its not always easy to express what one feels and i dare say im injudicious in choosing my words but your welfare is very near to my heart  i know that he answered gently but you were not describing an imaginary paragon hadnt you millicent in your mind  i should be very happy if i could welcome her as my daughter i should feel that you were safe then  there was a thrill of regret in her voice that touched him it hinted that she blamed herself for omissions and lack of wisdom in his upbringing besides her confidence in any one who had won her respect as millicent had done was bestowed so generously  im afraid ive often given you trouble and i do you little credit now he said but as to the other matter one cant be sure that millicent would welcome the idea of late ive had a suspicion that she hasnt a very high opinion of me  you could hardly expect to gain it by devoting yourself to miss crestwick  the man smiled rather grimly  if its any consolation to you im inclined to think that miss crestwick has let me drop the truths not very flattering but i cant hide it  mrs gladwynes relief was obvious but she had more to say and she ventured upon it with some courage  if you would only get rid of batley too  i can hardly do that just now hes useful in several ways still of course if i married  he broke off abruptly for his mother had occasional flashes of discernment  millicent has means she said  he started at this wondering how much she had guessed but he veiled his embarrassment with a smile  well he acknowledged means as you most wisely remarked are not to be despised and mine are unfortunately small  she saw that she had said enough and she left him sitting in the darkening room thinking rather hard bella had thrown him over when he had refused to help her brother and there were many ways in which millicent appealed to him besides she could free him of his debt to batley which was a thing greatly to be desired she had shown that she did not blame him severely for the accident at the hurdles but he realized that in trying to comfort him she had been prompted by pity for his dejected mood and it was clear that the part he had played was scarcely likely to raise him in her esteem this was unfortunate but he would not dwell on it there were other points to consider and anything that served to divert his thoughts from the unfortunate affair was a vast relief  when at last he rose he had partly recovered his usual equanimity and had decided that he would watch for some sign of millicents feelings toward him he was aware that they had somewhat changed but this was to a large extent his fault and with caution and patience he thought it might be possible to reinstate himself in her favor     chapter xix  gladwyne gains a point   some weeks had passed since the accident and lisle was lying one afternoon on a couch near a window of nasmyths sittingroom two or three canadian newspapers lay on the floor and he held a few letters in one hand the prospect outside was cheerlessa stretch of leadencolored moor running back into a lowering sky with a sweep of fir wood that had lost all distinctive coloring in the foreground he was gazing at it moodily when millicent came in his face brightened at the sight of her and he raised himself awkwardly with his uninjured arm but she shook her head at him in reproof  you had orders to keep as quiet as possible for some time yet lie down again  keeping quiet is fast breaking me up he protested im quite able to move about  all the same youre not to try  he looked at her with a twinkle in his eyes  then i suppose ill have to give in youre a determined person people do what you ask them without resenting it you have an instance here though in a general way its a very undignified thing to be ordered about  he resumed his former position and she seated herself  i dont see why you should drag my character in she objected with a smile other people who occasionally obey me dont say such things  theyre english that accounts for a good deal im inclined to think my power of expressing my feelings on any point is a gift though its one thats not uncommon in the west  doesnt it presuppose an assurance that any one you address must be interested in your views  i deserve that he laughed but youre not quite right we say in effect these are my sentiments but i wont be downhearted if you havent the sense to agree with them the last however doesnt apply to you  thank you for the explanation she rejoined but why do you insist on a national difference youre really english arent you in canada  no he answered you and the others who talk in that strain are mistaken were a brand new nation still fusing and fuming in the meltingpot the elements are inharmonious in some respectsfrench from the laurentian littoral ontario scots americans scandinavians teutons magyars slavs the english elements barely strong enough to temper the mixture the lands too wide and the people too varied for british traditions to bind when the cooling amalgams run out it will be into a fresh mold  one made in pennsylvania or wherever the american foundries are  they run the one you have in mind at washington you understand things a good deal better than many people ive talked to here but youre not right yet if canadians deliberately chose the american mold because it was american a number of us would kick but the cause is a bigger one than that from texas to athabasca from florida to labrador pretty much the same elemental forces are fanning the melting fires we have the same human raw material weve much the same problems to tackle the conditions are or soon will be pretty similar its only natural that the result should be more or less identical ive said nothing yet about our commercial and social relations with our neighbors  but doesnt england count  morally yes its your part to keep our respect and show us a clean lead  after all she rejoined you in particular are essentially english by connection with the part of the country youre now staying in  he smiled curiously  so you or nasmyth have been tracing up the family  no she replied with a little sharpness why should i have done so of course we knew the name and you have relations living at no great distance i understand nasmyth got a hint that they would be glad to receive you  let it go at that he answered my father was cast out because he dared to think for himself and my mother was canadian born im a unit in the new nation one of the rank and file  she considered this for a moment or two it was hardly an english point of view butfor his family had long been one of stationthere was a hint of pride that struck her as rather fine about this renunciation it was a risky thing to insist on being taken at ones intrinsic value stripped of all accidental associations that might enhance it but she thought he need not shrink from the hazard now and then he spoke with slightly injudicious candor and sometimes too vehemently but in essential matters he displayed an admirable delicacy of feeling and she recognized in him a sterling sense of honor  ive broken loose again and youre feeling shocked he said humorously its your own fault you have a way of making one talk theres no use in discoursing to people who dont understand howeverand its much more importanthows the book getting on  more important than my wounded susceptibilities millicent laughed but we wont mind them im pleased to say ive heard from the publishers that its in strong request indeed they add rather superfluously that the demand is somewhat remarkable considering the nature of the work  lisle laughed at this  any more reviews  she handed him several and he noticed the guarded unenthusiastic tone of the first two  these are the people who prefer a thing like a catalogue this fellow says the first portion of the book shows most care in particulars and classificationits what one would expect from him that was your brothers work i think he was not an imaginative person  no replied millicent he was eminently practical and methodical  theres a great deal to be said in favor of that kind of man you can trust him when its a case of grappling with practical difficulties but i feel quite angry with the next reviewer the illustrations are rather impressionist drawings than a useful guide to identification the fellow would no doubt rather have those stiff colored plates which are about as like the real breathing creature as a stuffed specimen in a museum  millicent was pleased with his indignation but his disgusted expression changed as he read the next cutting  now he exclaimed were arriving at the sound sense of ordinary people lovers of nature whore not naturalists this mans enthusiastic the next reviews even better he took up the others and there was keen satisfaction in his eyes when he laid them down great he ejaculated i expected it youve made your mark  the girl thrilled with pleasure his delight at her success was so genuine  well she told him the publishers suggest that i undertake another and more ambitious work ive often thought that i should like to do so the lonely country between the rockies and the pacific has a peculiar interest to me and ive long had a desire to follow my brothers trail i dont think its a morbid wishsomehow i feel impelled to go  its a beautiful wild land and the creatures that inhabit it are among the finest in the world you promised to let me be your guide and you should take nasmyth too hes a man to be depended on you could start in the early summer next year  she smiled at his eagerness but he suddenly grew thoughtful  its curious how events seem to have started beside those lonely riverreaches among the rocks he remarked it was there that i got to know nasmyth and through him i met you it was there that i learned something about your brother and clarence gladwyne the drama began in those wilds and ive a feeling that it will end among them  the drama she queried and he was conscious that he had made a slip  well he answered before we crossed the big divide i wasnt aware of your existence and id only a hazy idea that i might come to england some day now if i may say it ive joined your group of friends and entered into their lives one feels it cant have sprung from nothing it isnt blind chance  she mused for a few moments  its strange she asserted but ive had something of the same feeling you seem to have become a part of things a connecting link between us allmrs gladwyne clarence nasmyth and even young crestwick one could almost fancy that some mysterious agency were working upon us through you  he did not wish her to pursue this train of thought too far  ive promised to take jim crestwick back with me he said im going as soon as im fit to get about  going back in a few weeks  yes in many ways im sorry but ive had some letters that show its needful business calls  she made no reply for some moments there was no doubt that she would miss him badly and she recalled the strange and tense anxiety of which she had been conscious when he had fallen at the hurdles  we have come to look upon you as one of us she told him simply somehow we never contemplated your going away and now it seems an almost unnatural thing  it would be if i broke off the connection with my english friends but i think that cant be done were to see more of each other im to be your guide when you come out next year  its very likely that i shall come  she left him shortly after this and walked home in a thoughtful mood regretting his approaching departure and pondering over what he had said with reflection it became clearer that she had entertained the same idea as his he and she and the others he mentioned were not acting and reacting upon one another casually it was all a part of a purpose leading up to something that still lay unrevealed on the knees of destiny perhaps he had been right in speaking of a drama it suggested a sequence of prearranged events springing from georges death reaching home she endeavored to banish these thoughts which were vaguely troublesome but miss hume found her preoccupied and absentminded during the evening  the following day she went over to see mrs gladwyne and was asked to wait until her return shortly afterward clarence entered the room where she was sitting and she alluded to her visit to lisle  he is going back as soon as he can stand the journey she said  gladwyne made an abrupt movement and she noticed with surprise and some indignation the relief in his expression though the men had not been on very cordial terms it puzzled her  you dont attempt to conceal your satisfaction she commented isnt it a little ungenerous  his effort to recover his composure was obvious but he answered her quietly  im afraid it is after the accidenti think i was partly blamed for thathe behaved very well told everybody about the slippery ground and said what he could to exonerate me  i didnt mean to refer to that matter explained millicent she knew that it was a painful one to him  still he resumed even if its ungrateful i am rather glad hes going  rather glad hardly seems to describe it you looked overjoyed  dont be severe millicent let me explain since lisle came over nothing has been quite the same he got hold of you and nasmyth and the others and in a way alienated you from me i dont mean he did it with deliberate intention but he took up your time and monopolized your interest ive seen much less of both of you  and of late of the crestwicks  oh he returned in his most casual manner i shouldnt have had much more of their company in any case jims going to canada and bella to sussex i understand from marple that it will be some time before she visits us again  millicent was glad to hear it but she made no comment  its unreasonable to blame lisle gladwyne went on though he did make some unpleasantness with batley but i have had so many annoyances and troubles since he arrived everything has been going wrong and i cant disassociate him from the unfortunate tendency  he sat where the light fell upon his face and millicent studying it was stirred to compassion which was always ready with her he looked harassed and nervous as if he had borne a heavy strain and she knew that the accident had preyed upon his mind that she thought was to his credit in addition to this she had suspected that he was threatened with financial difficulties the man had a dangerous gift of rousing womens interest and sympathy  im sorry she said with sincere feeling you should go away for a time you need a change  ive thought of it but im afraid ive been neglecting things lately and theres a good deal that needs straightening upfarm buildings to be looked to the stream to dyke in the low ground and that draining scheme  it was not all acting he had meant to give those matters some attention when he found it convenient and she was far from suspicious and was quick to take the most favorable view of any one that he recognized his duties and intended to discharge them gratified her  i think she told him that if you undertake these things in earnest youll be better for the occupation and they certainly need looking after  ive been slack he owned i seemed to lose interest and as i said ive had difficulties to distract me  he had struck the right note again anything of the nature of a confession or appeal for sympathy seldom failed to stir her  in fact he resumed im not clear of troubles now if i do half that im asked to do it will nearly ruin me and i dont know where to begin i havent any great confidence in griersons advice he doesnt seem to grip things readily  the trouble is that he has his favorites she said bluntly i dont think he suffers from any lack of understanding  what do you mean  it was unpleasant but she had courage and the man was doing clarence harm  well there are people who can get very much what they ask grierson for in the shape of repairs and improvements whether they need it or not  at my expense while the rest get less than they should have  a number of your tenants have got practically nothing for some years its false economy youll have to lay out twice as much as would keep them here satisfied when they leave you in disgust  she supplied him with several instances of neglect and a few clever suggestions and he looked at her in admiration which was only partly assumed  what an administrator you would have made he exclaimed the place would thrive in your hands and everybody be content its obvious quite apart from his good qualities why george was so popular  millicent did not suspect him of an intent to flatter her and she recognized that there was truth in what he said she knew everybody on the estate and knew their most pressing needs and she undoubtedly possessed the power of management she had a keen discernment and could arrive at a quick and just decision  clarence she said i shouldnt advise you to take the business altogether out of griersons hands hes honest so far as you are concerned and one or two of the hardest things he did were by your orders  you mean the milburn and grainger affair he showed a little embarrassment well perhaps i was hasty then but they would have exasperated a much more patient man i sometimes feel that i cant please these people whatever i do  she smiled at this  theyre not effusive but theyre loyal once you win their confidence but to go back to griersonlet him collect payments and handle the money but dont ask his advice as to how you will lay it out look around inquire into things and trust your own judgment  he turned to her beseechingly  i cant trust it in these mattersit hasnt been cultivated if im to keep out of further trouble and do any good you must help me  millicent hesitated it was not a little thing he asked to guide him aright would need thought and patient investigation still there was as she had said so much to be doneabuses to be abolished houses to be made habitable burdens to be lifted from shoulders unable to carry them there was also land the yield from which could be increased by a very moderate expenditure she would enjoy the power to do these things which the mans demand for help offered her but she was more stirred by his desire to redeem past neglect and set right his failures  well she promised you shall have my candid advice whenever you need it  he showed his gratitude but he was conscious of a satisfaction that had no connection with the welfare of his estate he would have a legitimate excuse for seeing her often the work jointly undertaken would lead to a closer confidence he had always cherished a certain tenderness for her he must marry somebody with money before long and though millicents means were not so large as bellas they were not contemptible he had not the honesty to let these thoughts obtrude themselves but they nevertheless hovered at the back of his mind it was more graceful to reflect that millicent possessed refinement a degree of beauty and many most desirable qualities     chapter xx  mrs gladwynes temptation   clarence had gone away with batley when lisle called on mrs gladwyne she was leaving home for a visit on the following day and he wished to say goodby and if an opportunity offered to ask her opinion upon a matter he had at heart she was not a clever woman but there were points on which he thought her judgment could be trusted he was told that she would be occupied for a few minutes and was shown into her drawingroom he sat down to wait and though he was familiar with the house he looked about him with an interest for which there was a reason the room had always impressed him by its size and loftiness and it did so more than ever that afternoon  the floor was of hardwood polished to a glossy luster by the hands of several generations and the rugs scattered here and there emphasized its extent most of the furniture was old and the few articles apparently bought in later times harmonized with it the faded ceiling had been painted with cupids trailing ribands he judged by some artist of the period shortly preceding the french revolution and two or three arcadian figures hinted at the same date there were other thingsa luster chandelier quaintlywrought hearthirons a carved wood mantelthat posited to bygone days  it all impressed him with a sense of the continuity of english traditions and mode of life as applied to such families as the gladwynes cradled in a degree of luxury which nevertheless differed from modern profusion and ostentation steeped in a slightly austere refinement he could understand their shrinking from sudden chance and clinging to the customs of the past they were all so far as he had seen characterized by the possession of high qualities with the exception of clarence whom he regarded as a reversion to a baser type but he thought that they would suffer if uprooted and transplanted in a less sheltered and less cultivated soil inherited instincts were difficult to subdue he was conscious of their influence he came from a new land where he had often toiled for a dollar or two daily but a love and veneration for the ancient english homes in which his people had lived was growing strong in him  mrs gladwyne did not appear but he had a good deal to think of and was content to wait he had grown fond of the stately lady and it was indeed largely for her sake that he had decided not to reveal for a while what he knew about the tragedy in british columbia he could not absolutely prove his version of the affair and it would bring distress upon the mother of the offender he had already waited two years and though he felt that his dead comrade had a strong claim on him he could wait a little longer fate might place conclusive evidence in his hands or remove some of his difficulties besides he must go back as soon as possible to the canadian north and in one respect he was very loath to do this  at last he heard a footstep and his hostess came in her dress was not of the latest fashion but it somehow struck him as out of place she ought to have been attired in the mode of a century ago with powder in her hair nevertheless fragile as she was with her fine carriage and her gracious smile she made an attractive picture in the ancient room  ive come on an unpleasant errandto say goodbyand to thank you for many favors shown to a stranger he said  i think you were never that from the beginning she told him by and by we learned the reasonyou really belong to us  he made a gesture of humorous expostulation  i like to believe that i belong here but not because of the explanation you give it doesnt seem to be much to my credit that my forefathers lived in this part of the country id rather be taken on my actual merits if that isnt too egotistical  they did live here she rejoined you cant get over thatit has its influence  it was the point of view he had expected her to take  we are very sorry you are going she continued somehow we hardly anticipated it have you ever thought of coming back for good  she was unconsciously giving him the lead he desired but he would not seize it precipitately he was half afraid  no he answered smiling my works out yonder i couldnt sit idle i think miss gladwyne hit it when she told me that i was one of the pioneers  his hostess showed more comprehension than he had looked for  yes i set you down as one of the men who prefer heat and cold want of food and toil to the comforts they could have at home i have met a few sons of my old friends and heard of others after all we have a good many of them in england  troublesome people arent they what do you do with them  let them go how do we rule india and hold so much of africa how did we open up canada for you  he nodded  thats right it doesnt matter that in respect to canada the sons of highland peasants did their share the hudson bay people and the laurentian frenchmen showed us the way we found out what kind of men they were when we went in after them  there was silence for a few moments and he glanced at her with admiration the honorable pride of caste she had shown strongly appealed to him she stood for all that was fine in the old regime and once more he wondered how such a woman could have borne such a son  im returning because business calls he explained my means wont keep me in idleness and that fact has a bearing on the question as to whether ill ever come back again its a very momentous one to me  she waited noticing with some surprise the sudden tenseness of his expression until he spoke again hesitatingly  you are the only person i can come to for advice id be grateful for your opinion  ill try to give it carefully she promised  well he said the life you people lead here has its attractions they must be strong to you it would be hard to break with all its associations to face one that was new and different i mean for a woman to do so  ah she exclaimed seeing the drift of his remarks at last you had better tell me whom you are thinking of  millicent  she started this was a painful surprise though she now wondered why she had never suspected it he had met the girl frequently before his accident and she had since gone over to nasmyths to talk with him now and then yet for some not very obvious reason nobody seemed to have contemplated the possibility of his falling in love with her mrs gladwyne had undoubtedly not done so and she was filled with alarm it was most desirable that millicent should marry clarence  how long have you had this in your mind she asked  that is more than i can tell you he answered thoughtfully i admired her greatly the first time i saw her i admired her more when we made friends but i dont think i went much farther for a while in tact i believe it was only when i knew i must go back soon that i realized how strong a hold she had on me and then i fought against yielding the difficulties to be got over looked so serious  has millicent any suspicion of your regard for her it was an important question and mrs gladwyne waited in suspense for his reply  not the slightest so far as i can tell i tried to hide my feelings until i could come to a decision as to what i ought to do  this was satisfactory provided that his supposition was correct and his companion could imagine his exercising a good deal of selfrepression  what is your fear she asked  well im rough and unpolished compared with nasmyth and the rest but with her large mind she might overlook that i couldnt live here as nasmyth and clarence do im not rich enough my wife if i marry must come out west with me and i might have to be away from her for months now and then i dont know that i could even establish myself in victoria where she would find something resembling your english society besides my small share of prosperity might come to an end im going back now sooner than i expected because there are business difficulties to be grappled with  mrs gladwyne nodded she could follow his thought but after a pause he continued  what troubles me most is that millicent seems so much in harmony with her surroundings we have nothing like them in canadaanyway not in the west whether ours are better or worse doesnt affect the case theyre widely different there is much she would have to give up what i could offer her in place of it would be new and strange less finished less refined could a woman of your station stand it would she suffer from being torn adrift from the associations that surround her here  his companion considered allowing for his generosity in thinking first of millicent he was a little too practical and dispassionate she did not think he was very greatly in love with the girl as yet and that was consoling what millicent thought she did not know but in many respects the man was eminently likable mrs gladwyne had grown fond of him but that must not be allowed to stand in her sons way clarence came before anybody else  i feel my responsibility she said slowly would you act on my advice  i think soit might be hard anyway id try  she hesitated the man had won her respect had she been wholly free from extraneous influences she might perhaps have counseled him to make the venture but halfconsciously she tried to see only the shadows in the picture he had drawn  well she answered him until two years ago millicent lived in this housethat must have had its effect on her  yes he agreed she shows it these old places set their stamp on peopleits very plain on you  mrs gladwyne saw that he understood but she felt half guilty as she proceeded  you admit that you could not give her anything of this kind in canada  he laughed rather grimly  no our homes were built yesterday and we move on rapidlytheyll be pulled down again tomorrow ill own that our ideas and manners are in the same unfinished transitory stage we havent been able to sit down and learn how to be graceful  she made a sign of comprehension though her reluctance to proceed grew stronger he was very honest and there was pain in his face  millicent she said is essentially one of us used to what we consider needful bred to our ways the endless small amenities which make life smooth here have always surrounded her can you imagine her for instance living with the marples  no he replied harshly i cant  then do you think it would be wise to take her to canada  i have thought she would not mind giving up many things she values if one could win her affection  that is very true but it doesnt get over the difficulty it isnt so very hard to nerve oneself to make a sacrifice its the facing of the inevitable results when the reaction sets in that tells she would continually miss something she had been used to and she would long for it  he sat silent for nearly a minute with his face set hard and then he looked up  if millicent were your daughter would you let her go  again mrs gladwyne hesitated his confidence hurt her she shrank from delivering what she thought would be the final blow but she strove to assure herself that she was acting in millicents best interest  no she answered not unless she was passionately attached to the man who wished to take her out and then i should do my utmost to dissuade her  he made no answer for a few moments then slowly he rose  thank you he said gravely im afraid youre right its generally hard to do what one ought wellhe took the hand she held outim grateful to you in many ways and id like you to remember me now and then  she let him go and crossing the room to a window she watched him stride down the drive with a swift determined gait he might be tried severely but there was little fear of this mans resolution deserting him she was however troubled by a recurrence of the unpleasant sense of guilt when he disappeared it was difficult to persuade herself that she had been quite honest and the difficulty was new to her  in the meanwhile lisle walked on rapidly disregarding the ache that the motion started in his injured arm and shoulder in his dejected mood the twinge at every step was something of a welcome distraction since a sacrifice must be made it should he resolved be made by him millicent should not suffer though he admitted that he had no reason for supposing that she would have been willing to do so she had never shown him more than confidence and friendliness and it was only during the past few weeks that he had ventured to think of the possibility of winning her even then the thought had roused no excess of ardent passion much as he desired her a strong respect and steadfast affection were more in keeping with his temperament nevertheless had he known that she loved him and he could confer benefits upon her in place of demanding a sacrifice he would have been strangely hard to deter  on his return nasmyth met him at the door  where have you been he asked with some indignation  to mrs gladwynes lisle informed him  you walked to the house after what irvine said when you insisted on his taking the bandages off  i took them off he only protested anyway i didnt break my leg  nasmyth noticed his gloomy expression  well he responded i suppose there was very little use in warning you to keep quiet but you look as if you had suffered for your rashness  thats true answered the canadian with a grim smile after all its what usually happens isnt it  they went in nasmyth a little puzzled by his companions manner but lisle offered no explanation of its cause     chapter xxi  the last afternoon   it was a bright day when lisle took his leave of the marples they gave him a friendly farewell and when he turned away bella crestwick walked with him down the drive  i dont care what they think i couldnt talk to you while they were all trying to say something nice she explained still to do them justice i believe they meant it we are sorry to part with you  its soothing to feel that lisle replied in many ways im sorry to go ive no doubt youll miss your brother after tomorrow  yes she said with unusual seriousness more than once during the last two years i felt that it would be a relief to let somebody else have the responsibility of looking after him but now that the time has come im sorry hes going i cant help remembering how often i lost my temper and the mistakes i made  you stuck to your task commended lisle i dare say it was a hard one almost beyond you now and then  he knew that he was not exaggerating she was only a year older than the wilful lad who must at times have driven her to despair yet she had never faltered in her efforts to restrain and control him and had made a greater sacrifice for his sake than lisle suspected though in the light of a subsequent revelation of gladwynes character she was thankful for this  well she replied i suppose that one misses a load one has grown used to and i feel very downcast its hardly fair to pass jim on to youbut i can trust you to take care of him  you can trust the work and the country lisle corrected her with a trace of grimness hes not going out to be idle as hell discover theres nothing like short commons and steady toil for taming any one youll see the effect of my prescription when i send him back again  he has physical pluck im glad to remember it and he has shown signs of steadying since he found gladwyne out  lisle looked at her searchingly  since he found gladwyne out  oh she answered seeing that she had been incautious he rather idolized the man and i suppose it was painful to discover by accident that he wasnt quite all he thought him now however he has transferred his homage to youim afraid jim must always have somebody to prop himbut ive no misgivings  lisle laughed  ive seldom had the time to get into mischief i suppose that accounts for a good deal  they were nearing the lodge and she stopped and held out her hand  its hard to say goodby you have helped me more than youll ever guess and you wont be forgotten then as he held her hand with signs of embarrassment she laughed with something of her usual mocking manner and suddenly drew away goodby she added i was rather daring once and i suppose you were shocked i cant repeat the rashnessit would mean more now  she walked back toward the house and he went on half an hour later he met millicent who stopped to greet him  i was on my way to call on you for the last time he told her  there was something in his voice that troubled her and though she had expected it she shrank from the intimation of his departure  then will you come back with me she asked  if youre not pressed for time id rather walk across the moor the way you once took me soon after i came id like to look round the countryside again before i leave though it will be a melancholy pleasure  for no very obvious reason she hesitated it was however hard to refuse his last request and she really wished to go  the views are unusually good she said as they started on wouldnt nasmyth have gone with you  it wouldnt have been the same he explained im storing up memories to take away with me and somehow nasmyth is most clearly associated with canada when i think of him it will be as sitting in camp beside a portage or holding the canoe paddle  and you cant picture my being occupied in that way  no he answered gravely i associate you with englandwith stately old houses with wellcaredfor woods and quiet valleys theres no doubt that your place is here  he spoke as if he were making an admission that was forced from him and she endeavored to answer in a lighter manner  its the only one ive had an opportunity for trying  but you love this place  yes she said i love it very well perhaps i am prejudiced and ive only had a glimpse at other countries but i feel that this is the most beautiful land in the world  he stopped and glanced round from where they stood he could look out upon leagues of lonely brown moors running back into the distance under a cloudless sky beyond them the scottish hills were softly penciled in delicate gray there was a sense of space and vastness in the picture but it was not that which spoke most plainly to him down on the farspread low ground lay such white homesteads built to stand for generations as he had never seen in canada parks sprinkled with noble trees amid which the gray walls of some ancient home peeped out plantations made with loving care field on field fenced in with welltrimmed trimmed hedges  it was all eloquent of order security and longestablished ease a strong contrast to the rugged wilderness where in the bush and on treeless prairie men never relaxed their battle with nature in many ways his was a stern country a land of unremitting toil from which one desisted only long enough to eat and sleep and he was one of the workers mrs gladwyne had been rightit was no place for this delicately nurtured girl with her sensitiveness and artistic faculties  for those who can live as you live it would be hard to find the equal of this part of england he said but im not sure you can keep it very much longer as it is  why she asked  it was a relief to talk of matters of minor interest for he dare not let his thoughts dwell too much on the subject that was nearest them  well he replied theres the economic pressure for one thing the growth of your cities the demand for food i see land lying almost idle that could be made productive at a very moderate outlay our people often give nearly as much as its worth here for no better soil  but how do they make it pay  he laughed  the secret is that they expect very littleenough to eat a shack they build with their own hands to sleep inand theyre willing to work sixteen hours out of the twentyfour  they cant do so in winter  the hours are shorter but where the winters hardeston the open middle prairiethe works more severe there the little man spends a good deal of his time hauling home stovewood or buildinglogs for new stables or barns he has often to drive several leagues with the thermometer well below zero before he can find a bluff with large enough trees in the pacific slope forests where its warmer work goes on much as usual the bush rancher spends his days chopping big trees in the rain and his nights making odd thingsfurniture wagonpoles new doors for his outbuildings what you would call necessary leisure is unknown  this was not exaggeration but he spoke of it from a desire to support his resolution by emphasizing the sternest aspects of western life it had others more alluring there were men who dwelt more or less at their ease but they were by no means numerous and the toilersin city office lonely bush or sawmillwere consumed by or driven into a feverish activity as one of them it was his manifest duty to leave this english girl in her sheltered surroundings there was however one remote but alluring possibility that made this a little easierhe might after all win enough to surround her with some luxury and cultured friends in one of the cities of the pacific coast though they differed from those in england they were beautiful with their vistas of snowcapped mountains and the sea  but you are not a farmer she objected  no minings my vocation and it keeps me busy in the city im at work long before they think of opening their london offices and its generally midnight before ive finished worrying engineers and contractors at their homes or hotels in the wilds were more or less continuously grappling with rock or treacherous gravel or out on the prospecting trail while the northern summer lasts its then light most of the night in the winter we sometimes sleep in the snow with the thermometer near the bottom of its register  millicent shivered a little wondering uneasily why he had taken the trouble to impress this upon her it was she thought certainly not to show what he was capable of  are you glad to go back or do you dread it she asked  i dont dread itits my life and things may be easier by and by still im very loath to go  millicent could believe that his troubled expression confirmed it and she was strangely pleased she had never had a companion in whom she could have so much confidence and she had already recognized that she was in one sense of the word growing fond of him indeed she had begun to be curious about the feeling and to wonder whether it stopped quite short at liking  well she told him im glad that you asked me to come with you i think i was one of your first friends and im pleased that you should wish to spend part of your last day in my company  you come first of all  thats flattering she smiled what about nasmyth  an unusually fine man but he has his limits you have none  im not sure i quite understand you  then he explained seriously what i think i mean is thisyoure one of the people who somehow contrive to meet any call that is made on them you would never sit down helpless in a trying situation youd find some way of getting over the difficulties its a gift more useful than genius  youre rating me too highly she answered with some embarrassment you admitted that you thought my place was herethe inference was that i shouldnt fit into a different one  no he corrected her youd adapt yourself to changed conditions but that wouldnt prevent your suffering in the process indeed i think people of your kind often suffer more than the others  he was to some extent correct in his estimate of her but she shrank from the direct personal application of his remarks  arent the virtues you have described fairly common she asked i think that must be so because theyre so necessary  in a degree i suppose they are you see them perhaps most clearly in such lands as mine the pioneer has a good deal against himfrost and floods hard rock and sliding snow he must face every discomfort hunger and stinging cold the prospector crawls through tangled forests and packs his stores across snowy divides shallow shafts cave in rude dams are swept away a man worked to exhaustion on the trail runs out of provisions and goes on starving he lames himself among the rocks sets his teeth and limps ahead ive thought the capacity to do so is humanitys greatest attribute but after all its not shown in its finest light battling with material things when the moral stress comes the man who would face the other often fails  yes she asserted there are barriers that cant be stormed merely to acquiesce is the hardest thing of all but in that lies the victory  its a bitter one he answered moodily  there was silence for a few minutes while they strolled on through the heather afterward millicent understood where his thoughts had led but now she was chiefly conscious of a slight but perplexing resentment against the fact that he should discourse rather crude philosophy indeed the feeling almost amounted to disappointmentit was their last walk and though she did not know what she had expected from him it was something different from this walking by her side with his fine poise his keen eyes that regarded her steadily when she spoke and his resolute brown face he appealed to her physically and in other ways she approved of him it was borne in upon her more clearly that she would miss him badly and she suspected that he would not find it easy to part from her in the meanwhile he recognized that she had no doubt unconsciously given him a hintwhen the moral difficulties were unsurmountable one must quietly submit  they stopped when they reached the highest strip of moor the sun was low the vast sweep of country beneath them was fading to neutral color woods low ridges and river valleys losing their sharpness of contour as the light left them a faint cold wind sighed among the heather emphasizing the desolation of the moorland  millicent shivered  well go down lisle said quietly the brightness has gone ive had a great time heresomething to think of as long as i livebut now its over  but youll come back some day she suggested  i may i cant tell he answered ive schemes in view to be worked out in the north that may make my return possible but even then it couldnt be quite the same things change one mustnt expect too much  his smile was a little forced his mood was infectious and an unusual melancholy seized upon millicent as they moved downhill across the long sadcolored slopes of heather then they reached a bare wood where dead leaves that rustled in the rising wind lay in drifts among the withered fern and the slender birch trunks rose about them somberly the light had almost gone the gathering gloom reacted upon both of them and there was in the girls mind a sense of something left unsaid once or twice she glanced at her companion his face was graver than usual and he did not look at her  it was quite dark when they walked down the dale beneath the leafless oaks talking now with an effort about indifferent matters until at last millicent stopped at the gate of the drive to her house  will you come in she asked  no nasmyths waiting im glad you came with me but i wont say goodby ill look forward to the journey were to make together through british columbia  she held out her hand in another moment he turned away and she walked on to the house with a strange sense of depression     chapter xxii  startling news   it was snowing in the northern wilderness and the bitter air was filled with small dry flakes which whirled in filmy clouds athwart the red glow of a fire a clump of boulders stood outlined beside a frozen river and behind the boulders a growth of willows rose crusted with snow while beyond them barely distinguishable were the stunted shapes of a few birches so far the uncertain radiance reached when the fire leaped up but outside it all was shut in by a dense curtain of falling snow  it had been dark for some time and lisle was getting anxious as he lay wrapped in a ragged skin coat in a hollow beside a boulder a straining tent stood near the fire but the big stone afforded better shelter and drawing hard upon his pipe he listened eagerly the effort to do so was unpleasant as well as somewhat risky for he had to turn back the old fur cap from his tingling ears and he shivered at every variation of the stinging blast there was nothing to be heard except the soft swish of the snow as it swirled among the stones and the hollow rumble of the river pouring down a rapid beneath a rent bridge of ice  the man had spent the early winter when the snow facilitates traveling in the auriferous regions of the north arranging for the further development of the mineral properties under his control that done he had returning some distance south struck out again into the wilds to examine some alluvial claims in which he had been asked to take an interest it was difficult to reach the first of them and then he had spent several weeks in determined toil cutting and hauling in wood to thaw out the frozen surface sufficiently to make investigations crestwick had accompanied him but during the last few days he had gone down to a hudson bay post with the owners of the claim who were returning satisfied with the arrangements made his object was to obtain any letters that might have arrived and lisle going on to look at another group of claims had arranged to meet him where he had camped  it would be difficult to miss the way for it consisted of the frozen river but crestwick should have arrived early in the afternoon and lisle felt uneasy on the whole the canadian was satisfied with the conduct of his companion deprived during most of the time of any opportunity for dissipation scantily fed and forced to take his share in continuous labor the lads better qualities had become manifest and he had responded pluckily to the demands on him abstinence and toil were already producing their refining effect still he had not come back and with the snow thickening it was possible that he might not be able to keep to the comparatively plain track of the river there was also the risk that by holding on too far when he saw the fire he might blunder in among the fissured ice at the foot of the rapid  rising at length lisle walked toward the dangerous spot guiding himself by sound for once he was out of the firelight there was nothing to be seen but a white driving cloud he knew when he had reached the neighborhood of the rapid by the increased clamor of the stream and he crept on until he decided that he was abreast of the pool below the rapid was partly frozen but the ice was fissured and piled up at the tail of it  lisle could not remember how long he waited beating his stiffened hands and stumbling to and fro to keep his feet from freezing but at last though he could see nothing he heard a crunching sound and he called out sharply  ive got here came the answer where shall i leave the ice seems to be an opening in front of me  it was difficult to hear through the clamor of the water and the crash of drifting ice but lisle caught the words and called again  turn your back on the wind and walk straight ahead  he supposed that crestwick was obeying him but a few moments later he heard a second shout  brought up by another big crack  the voice was hoarse and anxious and lisle deciding that the lad was worn out by his journey and probably confused bade him wait and hurrying downstream a little he moved out upon the frozen pool he proceeded along it for a few minutes calling to crestwick and guiding himself by the answers and then he stopped abruptly with a strip of black water close beneath his feet on the other side was a ridge of rugged ice but what lay beyond it he could not see  im in among a maze of cracks cant find any way out crestwick cried answering his hail  lisle reflected rapidly as he followed up the crevasse which showed no sign of narrowing the snow was thick the bitter wind increasing and a plunge into icy water might prove disastrous it was obvious that he must extricate his companion as soon as possible but the means of accomplishing it was not clear crestwick was somewhere on the wrong side of the crack which seemed to lead right across the stream toward the confusion of broken ridges and hummocks which as lisle remembered fringed the opposite bank he must endeavor to find the place where the lad had got across but this was difficult for fresh breaches and ridges drove him back from the edge presently the chasm ended in a wide opening filled with an inky flood and lisle turning back a yard or two braced himself and jumped  he made out a shapeless white object ahead and coming to another crack he scrambled to the top of an iceblock and leaped again there was a sharp crackle when he came down the piece he alighted on rocked and crestwick staggered  look out he cried its tilting under  lisle saw water lapping in upon the snow but it flowed back and the cake he had detached impinged upon the rest with a crash  come on he shouted the stream will jamb it fast  they reached the larger mass and moved across it but lisle clutching his companions arm bewildered and almost blinded by the snow doubted if he were retracing his steps he did not remember some of the ridges and ragged blocks over which they stumbled and the smaller rents seemed more numerous it was evident that crestwick was badly worn out and they must endeavor to reach the bank with as little delay as possible  at last they came to the broad crevasse farther up the stream and lisle turned to crestwick  better take off your skincoat youll have to jump  i cant said the other dejectedly its not nervethe things clean beyond me  his slack posefor he was dimly visible amid the haze of driving snowbore out his words the long march he had made had brought him to the verge of exhaustion his overtaxed muscles would respond to no further call on them for a moment or two lisle stood gazing at the dark water in the gap  then well look for a narrower place he decided where did you get across  i dont know dont remember this split but the ice was working under me perhaps the snow had covered it and now its fallen in  they scrambled forward following the crevasse but could find no means of passing it and now and then the ice trembled ominously at last when the opposite side projected a little lisle suddenly sprang out from the edge and alighted safely  its easy he called stripping off his long skin coat and flinging one end of it across the chasm to crestwick get hold and face the jump  it was not a time for hesitation the exhausted lad dare not contemplate the gap lest his courage fail him and nerving himself for an effort he leaped striking the edge on the other side he plunged forward as lisle dragged at the coat and then rolled over in the snow he was up in a moment gasping hard almost astonished to find himself in security and lisle led him back to the snowcovered shingle  it strikes me as fortunate that i came to look for you he observed youd probably have ended by walking into the river  thanks said crestwick simply it isnt the first hole youve pulled me out of  they reached the camp and the lad shaking the snow off his furs sat down wearily on a few branches laid close to the sheltering boulder while lisle took a fryingpan and kettle off the fire and afterward filled his pipe again and watched his companion while he ate crestwick had changed since he left england his face was thinner and the hint of sensuality and empty selfassurance had faded out of it his eyes were less bold but they were steadier and sitting in the firelight clad in dilapidated furs he looked somehow more refined than he had done in evening dress in marples billiardroom when he spoke as he did at intervals the confident tone which had once characterized him was no longer evident he had learned to place a juster estimate upon his value in the icy north  i was uncommonly glad to see the fire he said at length another mile or two would have beaten me though i spent nearly twice as long in coming up from the forks as the prospectors said it would take i was going light too  theyve been doing this kind of thing most of their lives you couldnt expect to equal them where did you sleep last night  in some withered stuff among a clump of willows i scraped the snow off it that is i lay down there but as the fire wouldnt burn well i dont think i got much rest part of the time i wondered what i was staying in this country for i didnt seem to find any sensible answer  you could get out of it when the freighters go down with the dogs and sledges lisle suggested it would be a good deal more comfortable at marples for instance  do you want to get rid of me i suppose im not much help  oh no lisle assured him it only struck me that you might find the novelty of the experience wearing off besides youre improving in a year or two youll make quite a reliable prospectors packer  thats something replied crestwick grinning not long ago i thought id make a sportsman one of gladwynes kind the ambition doesnt so much appeal to me now but i want to be rather more than a lookeron cant you let me put something into one of these claims  not a cent in the first place youd have some trouble in raising the money in the second i might be accused of playing batleys game  the lasts ridiculous but if im not to do anything it brings me back to the questionwhy am i staying here  i cant tell you that ill only suggest that if you hold out until you come into your property youll go back much more fit in several ways to look after it i should imagine youd find less occasion to emulate people like batley and gladwyne then of course i dont know if thats worth waiting for  it was the nearest approach to seriousness he considered advisable for precept was obnoxious to him and apt to be resented by his companion  now he added what about the mail  crestwick produced a packet of letters which he had not opened yet and lisle glanced at two business communications the boulder kept off most of the snow and the glare of the snapping branches rising and falling with the gusts supplied sufficient light  mines from bella theres news in it crestwick remarked she says carewi dont think youve seen himis anxious to marry her and if shes convinced that im getting on satisfactorily shell probably agree hesim quotingabout as good as shes likely to get thats bella all over  whats he like lisle asked with interest  to tell the truth in one way i think shes rightthe mans straight not the marple crowds style in fact i found him decidedly standoffish though ill own there might have been a reason for that anyhow im glad she might have done a good deal worse i suppose you wont mind giving me a testimonial that will set her doubts at rest  you shall have it since the mans a good one im nearly as glad as you are ive a strong respect for your sister she stood by you pluckily  thats true asserted crestwick i was a bit of an imbecile and shes really hard to beat she says if the life heres too tough for me im to come back and live with them thats considerate because in a way she cant want me though i havent the least doubt shed make carew put up with my company it decides the questionim not going  a little while ago youd have taken carews delight for granted wouldnt you  im beginning to see things crestwick answered with a wave of his hand then he paused and looked confused after all though she says im to give you the message bella really goes too far now and then  she doesnt always mean it you may as well obey her  its thisif its any consolation she has no intention of forgetting you and arthurthats the fellows nameis anxious to make your acquaintance she says there are men whore not so unresponsive as you are but arthur has never been into the north to get frozen  lisle laughedit was so characteristic of bella  heres something else crestwick proceeded about miss gladwyne bella thinks youd be interested to hear that theres a prospect of  go on cried lisle dropping his pipe  i cant see said crestwick you might stir the fire  lisle threw on some fresh wood and poked the fire savagely with a branch and the lad continued reading with difficulty while the pungent smoke obscured the light  it seems that she saw gladwyne and his mother and millicent together in town and she afterward spent a week with flo marple at somebodys house flo told her that it looks as if the longdeferred arrangement was to be brought about at last he laid down the letter if that means shes to marry gladwyne it ought to be prevented  they looked at each other curiously and lisle struggling to command himself noticed the lads strained expression  why he asked with significant shortness  crestwick seemed on the verge of some vehement outbreak and lisle saw that it was with an effort he refrained  oh well he answered the mans not half good enough hes a dangerous rotter  dangerous  yes returned crestwick dryly i think that describes it  there was an impressive silence while each wondered how far he might have betrayed himself then lisle spoke  read the rest of the letter see if bella says anything further  no announcement made crestwick informed him a little later all the same flos satisfied that the engagement will be made known before long he looked up at lisle with uncertainty and anger in his face it almost makes me forget bellas other news what can be done  what do you want to do  dont fence said crestwick im not smart at it dont you know a reason why miss gladwyne shouldnt marry the fellow  yes it has nothing to do with you  perhaps not replied crestwick i can only say that the match ought to be broken off it isnt to be contemplated  well lisle responded with forced quietness if its any relief to you ill write to nasmyth the first chance i get asking what hes heard now well drop the subject is there anything else of general interest in your letter  bella says her wedding wont be until the early summer and shes thinking of making carew bring her out to banff or glacierhe came out shooting or climbing once before then shell endeavor to look us up  he lighted his pipe and they sat in silence for a while then crestwick rose and bringing a blanket from the tent wrapped it about him and lay down in the lee of the boulder near the fire a few minutes later he was sound asleep but lisle sat long awake thinking hard while the snow drove by above him     chapter xxiii  a forced march   when crestwick awakened very cold and cramped a little before daylight the next morning it was still snowing but lisle was up and busy preparing breakfast  that looks like marching i thought we were going to lie off today observed the lad  how do you feel lisle inquired  horribly stiff but thats the worst why are you going on  because the freighters should leave the hudson bay post tomorrow with their dogteams its the only chance of sending out a letter i may get for a long while and i want to write to nasmyth  crestwick shivered glancing disconsolately at the snow he shrank from the prospect of a two days hurried march had lisle suggested this when he first came out the lad would have rebelled but by degrees the stern discipline of the wilds had had its effect on him he was learning that the weariness of the flesh must be disregarded when it is necessary that anything shall be done  oh well he acquiesced ill try to make it if i cant youll have to drop me where theres some shelter  he ate the best possible breakfast for as wood was scarce in parts of the country and making a fire difficult it was very uncertain when he would get another meal then he slipped the packstraps over his stiff shoulders and got ready to start with a burden he did not think he would have been capable of carrying for a couple of hours when he left england  now well pull out he said but wait a moment id better look for a dry place to put this paper currency  where did you get it you told me at the last settlement that you had hardly a dollar left  crestwick grinned  oh some of the boys offered to teach me a little game they were playing when we thawed out that claim i didnt find it difficult though i must own that i had very good luck it was three or four months since id touched a card and theres a risk of reaction in too drastic reform anyhow im glad i saw that game one fellow had a way of handling trumps that almost took me in if i can remember it should come in useful  lisle made no comment restraint he thought was likely to prove more effective if it were not continually exercised they started and for several hours plodded up the white highway of the river leaving it only for a while when the ice grew fissured where the current ran more swiftly white hills rose above them relieved here and there by a somber clump of cedars or leafless willows and birches in a ravine the snow crunched beneath their feet and scattered in a fine white powder when they broke the crust more of it fell at intervals but blew away again and they held on with a nipping wind in their faces and a low gray sky hanging over them  lisle however noticed little he pushed forward with a steady and apparently tireless stride thinking bitterly since his return to canada his mind had dwelt more or less continuously on millicent he recognized that in leaving her with his regard for her undeclared he had been sustained by the possibility that he might by determined effort achieve such a success as would enable him to return and in claiming her to offer most of the amenities of life to which she had been accustomed though it had not been easy he had to some extent accomplished this on reaching victoria he had found his business associates considering one or two bold and risky schemes for the extension of their mining interests which he had carried out in the face of many difficulties the new claims he had taken over promised a favorable yield upon development he had arranged for the more profitable working of others by the aid of costly plant and his affairs were generally prospering  then when he was satisfied with the result of his exertions crestwicks news had struck him a crushing blow he was wholly unprepared for it nasmyth had spoken of a match between millicent and gladwyne as probable but the latter had devoted himself to bella who had openly encouraged him the change in the girls demeanor had escaped lisles notice because he had been kept indoors by his injury now the success he had attained counted for almost nothing he had nobody to share it with  the subject however had another aspect he could have borne the shock better had millicent yielded to a worthy suitor but it was unthinkable that she should marry gladwyne she must be saved from that at any cost though he thought her restored liberty would promise nothing to him even if her attachment to gladwyne were free from passion as nasmyth had hinted she must cherish some degree of affection and regard for the man his desertion of her brother could not be forgiven but the revelation of his baseness would not incline her favorably toward the person who made it as it would seem to be merely for the purpose of separating her from him  lisle set his lips as he looked back on what he now considered his weakness in withholding the story of gladwynes treachery had he declared it at the beginning mrs gladwyne would have suffered no more than she must do and it would have saved millicent and himself from the pain that must fall upon them he bitterly regretted that he had for once departed from his usual habit of simply and resolutely carrying out an obvious task without counting the cost still he could write to nasmyth and to do that he must reach the hudson bay post on the morrow he trudged on over the snow at a pace that kept crestwick breathless  the bitter wind chilled them through in spite of their exertion and it had increased by noon when lisle halted for a minute or two to look about him  they were in the bottom of a valley walled in by barren hills the bank of the frozen river was marked out by snowcovered stones but none of them was large enough to rest behind and one could not face the wind motionless in the open while he stood a stinging icy powder lashed his cheeks and his hands grew stiff in their mittens  theres not even a gulch we could sit down in he said well have to go on and im not sorry for one reason theres not much time to spare  crestwicks eyes were smarting from the white glare having started when weary from a previous journey his legs and shoulders ached but he had no choice between freezing and keeping himself slightly warm by steady walking it would he knew be harder by and by when his strength began to fail and the heat died out of his exhausted body  well have to find a shelter for the tent by nightfall or dig a snowpit where theres some wood he declared ill try to hold out  they proceeded and the afternoons march tried him severely aching all over breathing hard when they stumbled among the stones to skirt some halffrozen rapid he labored on regretting the comforts he had abandoned in england and yet not wholly sorry that he had done so his moral fiber was toughening for after all his faults were largely the result of circumstances and environment of no great intelligence and imperfectly taught he had been neglected by his penurious father who had been engaged in building up his commercial prosperity his mother had died when he was young  one of his marked failings was an inability to estimate the true value of things he possessed something of the spirit of adventure and a desire to escape from the drab monotony of his early life but these found expression in betting on the exploits of others on the football field and the turf a haunting of the musichalls and the cultivation of acquaintances on the lowest rung of the dramatic profession all this offered him some glimpses of what he did not then perceive was merely sham romance later when on the death of his father wealth had opened a wider field deceived by surface appearances he had made the same mistake selecting wrong models and then chiefly copying their failings even his rather generous enthusiasm for those whom he admired had led him farther into error  now however his eyes had been partly opened thrown among men who pretended nothing in a land where pretense is generally useless he was learning to depreciate much that he had admired called upon to make the true adventure he had blindly sought for he found that little counted except the elemental qualities of courage and steadfastness dear life was the stake in this game and the prizes were greater things than a repute for cheap gallantry and pieces of money they were the subjugation of rock and river the conversion of the wilderness to the use of man crestwick was growing in the light he gained and in proof of it he stumbled forward scourged by driving snow throughout the bitter afternoon although before the end of it he could scarcely lift his weary feet  it was getting dark when they found a few cedars clustered in the shelter of a crag and lisle set to work hewing off the lower branches and cutting knots of the resinous wood crestwick could not rouse himself to assist and when the fire was kindled he lay beside it shivering miserably  theres the kettle to be filled suggested lisle you could break the ice where the streams faster among those stones wed boil water quicker than wed melt down snow  crestwick got up with an effort that cost him a good deal and stumbled away from the fire then a gust of wind met him enveloping him in snowdust and taking the power of motion momentarily away he shook beneath his furs in the biting cold still the river was near and he moved on another few yards when the kettle slipped from his stiffened hands and rolled down a steep slope he stopped wondering stupidly whether he could get down to recover it  never mind come back lisle called to him ill go for the thing  the lad turned at the summons and sank down again beside the fire  i think im done he said wearily i may feel a little more fit in the morning  lisle filled the kettle and prepared supper and after eating voraciously crestwick lay down in the tent it was in comparative shelter but the frost grew more severe and the icy wind eddying in behind the rock threatened to overturn the frail structure every now and then he tried to smoke but found no comfort in it after he had with difficulty lighted his pipe he did not feel inclined to talk and it was a relief to him when lisle sank into slumber  crestwick long remembered that night his feet and hands tingled painfully with the cold the branches he lay upon found out the sorest parts of his aching body and he would have risen and walked up and down in the lee of the rock had he felt capable of the exertion but he was doubtful whether he could even get upon his feet at times thick smoke crept into the tent and though it set him to coughing it was really a welcome change in his distressing sensations he was utterly exhausted but he shivered too much to sleep  at last a little while before daybreak lisle got up and strode away to the river after stirring the fire and then most cruel thing of all the lad became sensible of a soothing drowsiness when it was too late for him to indulge in it for a few moments he struggled hard and then blissfully yielded he was awakened by his companion who was shaking him as he laid a plate and pannikin at his feet  we must be off in a few minutes he announced  crestwick raised himself with one hand and blinked  i dont know whether i can manage it  then responded lisle hiding his compassion youll have to decide which of two things youll doyou can stay here until i come back or you can take the trail with me i must go on  crestwick shrank from the painful choice he did not think that he could walk but to prolong the experience of the previous night for another twentyfour hours or more seemed even worse he ate his breakfast and then with a tense effort he got upon his feet and slipped the straps of the pack over his shoulders moving unevenly he set off lest he should yield to his weariness and sink down again  come on he called back to lisle  he sometimes wondered afterward how he endured throughout the day he was half dazed he blundered forward numbed in body with his mind too dulled to be conscious of more than a despairing dejection as he scarcely expected to reach the post it did not matter how soon he fell yet by instinctive effort stronger than conscious volition the struggle for life continued and lisles keen anxiety concerning him diminished as the hours went by every step brought them nearer warmth and shelter and made it more possible that help could be obtained if the lad collapsed that was the only course that would be available because they were now crossing a lofty windswept elevation bare of timber  it was afternoon when they entered a long valley and lisle grasping crestwicks arm partly supported him as they stumbled down the steep descent stunted trees straggled up toward them as they pushed on down the hollow and lisle surmised that the journey was almost over that was fortunate for he had some trouble in keeping his companion upon his feet at length a faint howl rose from ahead and lisle stopped and listened intently the sound was repeated more plainly and was followed by a confused snarling the clamor of quarreling dogs  malamutes the freighters cant have started yet with their sledges he said to crestwick who was holding on to him i dont think they can be more than half a mile off  ill manage that somehow replied the lad  they went on through thickening timber until at last a log house came into sight in front of it stood two sledges and a pack of snapping snarling dogs were scuffling in the snow lisle was devoutly thankful when he opened the door and helped the lad into a logwalled room where four men two of whom wore furs were talking the air was dry and strongly heated besides being heavy with tobacco smoke and crestwick sank limply into a chair gasping hard he leaned forward as if unable to hold himself upright but lisle was not alarmed he had suffered at times when exhausted from the reaction that follows the change from the bitter cold outside to the stuffiness of a stoveheated room  played out id some trouble to get him along he explained to the men were going on to the claims at the gulch tomorrow then he addressed the two in furs i guess youll take me out a letter  why of course but youll have to hustle said one of them and lisle turned to a man in a deerskin jacket whom he took for the agent  can you give me some paper  sure sit down right here  it was not easy to write with stiffened fingers or to collect his thoughts with his head swimming from the change of temperature but he informed nasmyth briefly of what he had heard and asked how much truth there was in it he added that he would have started for england forthwith only that he could not be sure that this was necessary and to leave his work unfinished might jeopardize the interests of people who had staked a good deal of money on the success of his schemes nevertheless he would come at once if nasmyth considered the match likely to be brought about and would cable him at victoria from whence a message would reach him in the meanwhile nasmyth could make such use of their knowledge of gladwynes treachery as he thought judicious  shortly after he had written the letter the two men in furs set out and when the sound of their departure had died away the agent addressed his guests  ill fix you some supper you look as if you needed it rustle round larry and get the fryingpan on  they ate an excellent meal and shortly afterward crestwick crawled into a wooden bunk where he reveled in the unusual warmth and the softness of a mattress filled with swamphay he had never lain down to rest in england with the delicious sense of physical comfort that now crept over his wornout body     chapter xxiv  millicent summons her guide   lisle was living luxuriously in victoria when nasmyths answer reached him by mail though it was still winter among the ranges of the north the seaboard city had been bathed in clear sunshine and swept by mild west winds during the past few days and after the bitter frost and driving snow lisle rejoiced in the genial warmth and brightness there are few more finely situated cities than victoria with its views across the strait of the white heights of mount baker and the olympians on the american shore even in the pacific province where the environment of all is beautiful  lisle was sitting in the hotel lounge after dinner when three english letters were handed to him the sight of them affected him curiously and leaning back in his chair he glanced round the room like the rest of the great building in which he had his quarters it was sumptuously furnished but everything was aggressively new there was he felt little that suggested fixity of tenure and continuity in the west the times changed too rapidly people came and went alert feverishly bustling optimistic in the old land his friends among the favored few dwelt with marked english calm in homes that had apparently been built to stand forever yet he was western by deliberate choice as well as by birth while there was much to be said for the other life which had its seductive charm the strenuous eager one that he led was better  he opened the lettersone from bella announcing her engagement and inquiring about her brother a second from millicent stating that it was decided that she would visit british columbia in the early summer and a third from nasmyth which dreading its contents he kept to the last  he was however slightly reassured when he opened it nasmyths remarks were brief but clear enough there was no actual engagement between millicent and clarence though mrs gladwyne was doing her utmost to bring one about and millicent saw the man frequently in the meanwhile he did not think there was anything to be done lisle could not conclusively prove his story though he could make a disastrous sensation which was to be avoided and it would be wiser to defer the disclosure until the engagement should actually be announced millicents attachment to clarence was not likely to grow very much stronger in a month or two in conclusion he urged lisle to wait  on the whole lisle agreed with him somehow he felt that millicent would never marry gladwyne apart from his interference he thought that her instincts would even at the last moment cause her to recoil from the match furthermore turning to another aspect of the matter he could not clear his dead comrades memory by telling a tale that was founded merely on probabilities there was nothing for it but to await events though he was still determined to start for england the moment nasmyths letter made this seem advisable  shortly afterward one of his business associates came in a young man with a breezy restless manner who would not have been trusted in england with the responsibilities he most efficiently discharged in the west a staid and imposing air carries no great weight with it and eagerness and even rather unguided activity are seldom accounted drawbacks there dulness is dreaded more than rashness  ive seen walthew and slyde he announced it will be all right about the money well put the hydraulic plant proposition through at the next board meeting youll have to go back right away  ive only just come down the frosts not out of me yet lisle grumbled besides you seem to be going ahead rather fast here in the city walthews a little too much of a hustler id rather hed stop to think youre almost as bad garnet  the young man laughed  i guess you cant help it its the english streak in you but in a way youre right fact is walthew and i have hustled the rest of the crowd most off their feet and we mean to keep them on the jump last meeting old macalans eyes were bulging with horror he could hardly stammer out his indignationsaid our extravagance was sinful anyway youve got to go  lisle made an acquiescent grimace his face was strongly darkened by exposure to the frost and the glare of the snow his hands were scarred with several ugly recentlyhealed wounds on them  well he complied with some reluctance if its necessary  it is garnet explained think were going to have washing plant worth a good many thousand dollars left lying in the bush or dropped into rivers youll have to arrange for transport and break new trails you can do it best when the snows still on the ground and that plant must start working soon after the thaw comes weve got to justify our expenditure while the seasons open  you havent got your authority to buy the plant yet  garnet chuckled  it was ordered provisionally the day you came down the makers are only waiting for a wire from the board meeting in fact i shouldnt be astonished if some of the work isnt in progress now  lisle was quick of thought and prompt in action but he sometimes felt as if garnet took his breath away  if you have it all arranged i may as well agree he laughed ill take crestwick back  that reminds me he said something about taking an interestasked if i could get him shares at a moderate premium though he owned that his trustees might make trouble about letting him have the money  hes not to have them lisle replied emphatically whats more the trustees wont part with a dollar unless i guarantee the projective been in communication with them rest assured that the idea wont get my endorsement  i could never get at the workings of the english mind garnet declared now if my relatives had any money id rush them all in this is the safest and bestmanaged mining proposition on the pacific slope what kind of morality is it that gathers in the general investor and keeps your friends out  i dont know it doesnt concern the point im actuated by what you may call a prejudice you cant remove it  well garnet responded goodhumoredly its a pretty tough country up yonder and i suppose the lads of some service youre saving us a pile of money in experts fees and i dont see why you shouldnt put him on the companys payroll i mentioned the thing to walthew he was agreeable  they talked about other matters and presently crestwick came in smartly dressed and looking remarkably vigorous and clearskinned there were many points of difference between his appearance now and when lisle had first met him  mr garnet has a proposition to make lisle informed him and the canadian briefly stated it  crestwick did not seem surprised nor did he display much appreciation  to tell the truth i thought you might have mentioned the matter before he remarked still if you want my services youll have to go up twenty dollars  a week garnet asked ironically you promise well if you stay here a year or two youll make a useful and enterprising citizen we could get an experienced boss packer for what i offered you  down here yes when he got to where the claims are hed almost certainly drop you and turn miner and you couldnt blame him a man deserves a hundred dollars a day merely for living up yonder but its a month i was speaking of if you want me youll have to come up  garnet laughed  i guess i can fix it but well get our value out of you  thats a compliment if you look at it in one way crestwick grinned in reply  when garnet had left them he turned to lisle  thanks awfully of course it was your idea  garnet suggested the thing thats more flattering isnt it  crestwick looked at him smiling  im not to be played so easily as i was when i first met you he said of course in a sense the pays no great inducement to me its the idea of being offered it im going to advise old barnes my trustee he was fond of saying that i was fortunate in being left well off because id never earn sixpence as long as i lived until i stopped the thing by offering him ten to one id go out and make it in a couple of hours by carrying somebodys bag from the station anyhow this is the first move  then youre going farther  quite so was the cheerful answer ill be a director of this company before ive finished you cant stop my buying shares when i come into my property  lisle was conscious of some relief it was a laudable ambition and crestwick promised to be much less of a responsibility than he had once anticipated  ive a letter from bella lisle told him she still desires to be informed if youre getting along satisfactorily i think i can tell her theres no cause for uneasiness  bellas a good sort returned crestwick shell stop asking such questions by and by at least i think shell have some grounds for doing so  they went out into the city and a week afterward they sailed together for the north it was still winter in the wilds and though that made lisles work a little easier because rivers and lakes and muskegs were frozen he found it sufficiently arduous he had to survey and break new trails suitable for the conveyance of heavy machinery up rugged valleys and over high divides and to arrange for transportcanoes here a logbridge there relays of packers farther on no mans efforts could be wasted for time was precious and wages are high in the wilderness then when at last the frost relaxed its grip and rock and snow and loosened soil came thundering down the gullies in huge masses the work grew more difficult as he began to build a dam  some of the men sent up to him artizans from the cities sailor deserters dismayed by the toils of the journey and the nature of their tasks promptly mutinied on arrival others dispatched after them failed to turn up and lisle never discovered what became of them the campsite was a sea of puddled mire with big stones in it tents and shacks were almost continuously dripping and every hollow was filled with a raging torrent nobody had dry clothes even to sleep in the work was mostly carried on kneedeep in water and at first things got little better as the days grew warmer the hillbenches steamed and clammy mists wrapped the camp at night the downward rush of melting snow increased and several times wild floods swept away portions of the dam and halfbuilt flume  in spite of it all the work went on foot by foot the wall of pilebound rock rose and the long wooden conduit curved away down the valley and when at length the hydraulic plant began to arrive piecemeal lisle found crestwick eminently useful he superintended the transport patrolling the trails and keeping them repaired his skill with shovel and ax was negligible but he could send a man or two to mend the gap where the path had slipped away down some gully or to fling a couple of logs across a swollen creek that could not be forded he got thinner and harder from constant toil and from sleeping often scantily fed unsheltered in the rain  after a while however there was a pleasant change the days grew hot the nights were clear and cold and the short vivid summer broke suddenly upon the mountain land then it seldom rained as the high seaward barrier condensed most of the pacific moisture but at times the clouds which crossed the summits unbroken descended in a copious deluge and it was in the midst of such a downpour that crestwick returned to camp one evening after a weeks absence on the trail his dripping garments were ragged his boots gaped open and his soft felt hat had fallen shapeless about his head he found lisle in a similar guise sitting at his evening meal  have they got the pipes and those large castings across the big ravine lisle asked  yes that has been done crestwick answered by the way one of the packers told me that the man whos coming up to run the plantcarsley isnt ithas arrived there were some fittings or something wrong and he stopped behind to investigate but the packer seemed to think hed get through soon after i did that turns us loose doesnt it  i dare say i could hand things over to him in about a week replied lisle then well clear out i suppose you wont be sorry  crestwick stretched out his feet to display his broken boots and rent trousers  well he said since i left here ive spent a good deal of my time in an icy creek and its nearly a week since i had any sleep worth speaking of we had to make a bridge for the freighters to bring those castings over and wed no end of trouble to get the stringers fixedthe stream was strong and we had to build a pier in it not long ago id have considered anybody who did this kind of thing without compulsion mad but in some mysterious way it grows on you i dont pretend to explain it but it wont be with unmixed delight that ill go back to the city  he paused and fumbled in his pocket  i was forgetting your mail im afraid its rather pulpy but i couldnt help that by the way id a letter from bella written at the frontenac quebec shes brought carew out theyre going to glacier very soon and she still intends to look me up  lisle opened the letters handed him and managed to read them though their condition fully bore out crestwicks description two or three were on business matters but there was one from millicent and he started at the first few lines  miss gladwyne and miss hume have sailedthey must have landed a week ago he announced she wants to go over the ground her brother traversedyou have heard of that project nasmyth sailed a week earlier to arrange matters at this end but i dont know how miss hume will get along  its merely a question of transport asserted crestwick with the air of an authority on the subject so long as you provide sufficient packers with relays from supply bases you can travel in comparative comfort though its expensive then an idea occurred to him theyre pretty sure to run across bella miss gladwyne knows carew  lisle sat silent a few minutes conscious of a strong satisfaction millicent was in canada and there was no mention of gladwyne then it struck him as curious that bella should have come over at the same time as millicent knew carew it was very probable that bella would insist on joining the expedition which millicent might agree to if as seemed likely her rather elderly companion had to be left behind nasmyth had no doubt already reached british columbia and it looked as if those indirectly brought together by george gladwynes tragic death would be reunited at the scene of it this was lisle reflected merely the result of a natural sequence of events but there was for all that something strangely significant about it  well he said it has been arranged that im to act as guide and miss gladwyne says theyll wait for me as thats the case i dont see why i shouldnt start as soon as carsley gets through i shouldnt wonder if he brings a letter from nasmyth it will be a tough journey and ill have to break a new trail are you coming or will you head for vancouver to join bella  well stick together replied the lad bellas to stay over here some months and if she decides to join miss gladwyne shell leave glacier long before i could reach the place  lisle rose and shook out his pipe  then he responded ill take a look around and you had better start off the first thing tomorrow and hurry those castings on theres a good deal to be done if were to get away when carsley turns up     chapter xxv  a reliable man   the sun had just dipped behind a black ridge of hills and the lake lay still mirroring the tall cedars on its farther shore a faint chill was creeping into the mountain air which was scented with resinous smoke and somewhere across the water a loon was calling a cluster of tents stood upon the shingle and in front of the largest millicent reclined in a campchair near her miss hume sat industriously embroidering and nasmyth lay upon the stones bella occupied another campchair a young man with a pleasant brown face sitting at her feet and farther along the beach a group of packers in blue shirts and duck trousers lay smoking about a fire by and by one rose and when he began to hack at a driftlog the sharp thudding of his ax startled the loon which departed with a peal of shrieking laughter  the party had reached the fringe of the wilderness after a long stage journey from the railroad through a rugged country they had met with no mishaps beyond a delay in the transport of some of their baggage and everything had been made comparatively easy for them but they knew that henceforward there might be a difference man must depend largely upon his own natural resources in the wilds where after furnishing the traveler with the best equipment and packers to carry it the power of wealth is strictly limited a recognition of the fact hovered more or less darkly in all their minds but millicent was the first to hint at it  so far we have had absolutely nothing to complain of except a little jolting in the stage she said im beginning to understand why adventurous sightseers are coming out hereits a glorious country  its my duty to point out that it wont be quite the same as we go on nasmyth remarked what do you say carew  it doesnt matter hes said it all before bella broke in ive had to listen to appalling accounts of his previous adventures in canada which were no doubt meant to deter me but the reality is that the hotels at banff and glacier are remarkably comfortable and i havent the least fault to find with this camp we ought to be grateful to millicent for letting us come and though arthur hinted that it would be a rather sociable honeymoon i said that was a safeguard ones illusions might get sooner shattered in a more conventional one she stooped and ruffled her husbands hair still he hasnt deteriorated very much on closer acquaintance and perhaps im fortunate in this  millicent sat silent for a few moments she knew to her sorrow one man who did not improve the more one saw of him and that was the man she had tacitly agreed to marry she could not tell why she had done soshe had somehow drifted into it interest family associations a feeling that could best be described as liking even pity had played their part in influencing her and now she realized that she could not honorably draw back when he formally claimed her she laughed as one of the packers who had a good voice broke into a song  thats the climax it needs only the cockney accent to make the thing complete she said when i was last in london one heard that silly jingle everywhere i suppose its a triumph of the musichalls  or of modern civilizationa rendering of distance of no account suggested carew theres a good deal to be said for the latter achievement as we are discovering  distance declared bella still counts for something here ive been thinking about jim all day imagining him dragging his canoe through the timber beyond those hills and wondering whether hed find us when he got to the other side  she has been doing more her husband broke in though she hasnt confessed it she has been looking out for him ever since this morning in fact i discovered that our cook is keeping a supper ready that would satisfy four or five men  bella turned to millicent with a smile  do you think the meal will be wasted she asked  no i can hardly believe it  mark the assurance of that answer commented carew a man couldnt feel it its irrational miss gladwyne speaks with a certainty that our guide will come though she has nothing to base her calculations onshe doesnt know the distance or the difficulties of the way  what does that matter bella retorted she knows the man  carew made a grimace  a womans reasoning as weve nothing better to do ill try to show the absurdity of it a man so far as he concerns this discussion consists of a certain quantity of bones with muscles and tendons capable of setting them in motion  be careful bella warned him its safer to avoid these details besides youre leaving something out i dont mean the nervecells but the inner personality whatever it is that commands them  im trying to show that as a mechanical structure he is capable of moving his own weight and so much extra a limited distance in a given time so long as he can secure the necessary food and sleep neither the weight nor the distance can be increased except by an effort which if continued will soon reduce them below their former level  bella laughed  yes she said thats how you reasonmechanically were different  ill take quite another line nasmyth interposed lisles traversing a country new to him he cant tell what rapids ranges or thick timber may cause delay no amount of determination will enable one for instance to knock more than a few minutes off the time needed to carry a canoe round a portage nor by any effort can one cross a range as quickly as one can walk up a valley isnt that clear millicent  there was a smile in the girls eyes  yes she replied but all the same lisles suppers waiting  such confidence makes one jealous grumbled carew lisle whom i havent met is evidently a man who keeps his promise that means a good deal  a very great deal bella assured him since ones bound to meet with difficulties one cant foresee it proves that one man has resource resolution and many other eminently useful qualities but all this is getting too serious id better point out that lisle hasnt even promised to meet us here at any particular time she paused and laughed mischievously millicent merely sent for him mentioning tomorrow as the day she would like to start  a little color crept into millicents face but bella went on  she called and i havent the least doubt that our guide set out over ranges up rapids across wide lakes one cant imagine that man taking it easily and theres the obvious fact that jim will have to keep up with him he will find it hard but i dare say it will do him good  nasmyth laughed and strolled away with carew the sunset green grew dimmer behind the hills and a pale halfmoon appeared above the shadowy woods it was very still except for the lapping of the water upon the stones  bella leaned back lazily in her chair  this is delightful she exclaimed didnt clarence want to come  the unexpectedness of the question startled millicent into answering  he didnt know  ah then you didnt tell him why didnt you  it was difficult to reply but there was something in bellas voice that disarmed millicents resentment bella had grown gentler since her marriage and less often indulged in bitterness  i think said millicent i didnt want any one to distract me im going to make photographs and sketches for the book you know  but you let us come  yes assented millicent youre different  thats true we wont disturb you and nasmyth wouldnt count hes an unobtrusive person only to the front when he is wanted which is a good deal to say for him he doesnt expect anything no doubt the same applies to lisle  millicent made no answer and bella wondered whether she had gone too far  but didnt clarence hear that you were going she asked  he was in switzerland with his mother she had been recommended to try a change  bella asked no more questions and millicent sat wondering how far she had been influenced by the reason she had given for leaving clarence behind she had undoubtedly desired to be free to devote herself to the gathering of material for her book but that was not quite all she had also halfconsciously shrunk from the close contact with clarence which would have been one result of their life in camp but this she refused to admit it was clearer that she desired an extension of the liberty which she must sometime relinquish taking it all round she was rather troubled in mind  theres one thing remarked bella he cant write you any reproachful letters for stealing away at least if he does so you wont get them  this as millicent recognized was a relief but miss hume broke in upon her reflections with some trifling request and soon afterward the men strolled back toward the fire the packers had already gone to sleep the dew was heavy but nasmyth lay down on the shingle and carew took a place beside his wifes chair suddenly millicent leaned forward with her face turned toward the lake  listen she cried sharply cant you hear something  no sound reached the others for a moment and then nasmyth jumped up  yes he exclaimed canoe paddles  a measured beat stole out of the silence increasing until it broke sharply through the tranquil lapping of the water then far up the glittering lake a dim black bar crept out into the moonlight and by degrees grew plainer  of course they may be indians bella suggested mischievously  carew included millicent in his answering bow  no i believe im beaten you and miss gladwyne were right  the moonlight was on millicents face and bella watching her read something that roused her interest in its expressionit was stronger than satisfaction a deeper feeling not unmixed with pride she had called and the man she had summoned from the depths of the wilderness had responded  a few minutes later the canoe grounded noisily on the shingle and crestwick leaped out bella regardless of the others flung her arms about his neck and kissed him and then she held him off so that she might see him his garments were rent and tattered his face was very lean and one of his hands was bleeding from continuous labor with the paddle  oh she cried you disreputable scarecrow youre not fit for select society and how long is it since you had anything to eat  we had a rather rough time getting through there was thick scrub timber in some of the valleys crestwick explained we might have made things easier by spending another few days on the trail but lisle wouldnt listen when i suggested it  then you did suggest it said bella reproachfully of course im merely your sister  i dont want a better one crestwick rejoined grinning it strikes me youre looking prettier than you did but thats perhaps because you have taken to wearing more ladylike clothes as regards my appearance ill venture to say that yours will be very much the same before youve finished this journey  lisle had walked toward miss hume and had shaken hands with her before he turned to millicent that pleased the girl  we ran it rather close but the day isnt quite finished yet he laughed we had some little trouble once or twice which prevented our turning up earlier  millicent smiled in a manner that sent a thrill through him  i can only say that we kept your supper but thats significant isnt it then she called to nasmyth  will you see if the cooks awake  she had no opportunity for saying anything further for carew came up with bella who was voluble and some time later lisle and crestwick sat down to a bountiful meal while millicent and bella waited on them lisle was slightly embarrassed by their ministrations but crestwick openly enjoyed them  put the plate where i can reach it easily he bade his sister look how you have placed that cup if i move it will spill  you have more courage than i have jim carew remarked with a smile  ive needed it the lad declared ive borne enough from bella in my time shell no doubt say that i deserved it and there may be some ground for the notion  when the meal was finished they all gathered round the replenished fire lisle lying back in the shadow because of the state of his clothes with the exception of jim the others were dressed much as they had been at home their conversation was light and easy and their manner tranquil if he could have blotted out the background of tall straight trunks and shadowy rocks he could have imagined that they were lounging on a sheltered english lawn doubleskinned tents campchairs and other signs of a regard for physical comfort bore out the idea in his mind these english people with their quiet confidence that what they neededand that was a good dealwould as had always happened somehow be supplied were at once exasperating and admirable they were the same everywhere unmoved by change claiming all that was choicest as by right and very much at ease on the fringe of the wilderness they did not belong to it one could have imagined that it belonged to them their journey however had only begun and there were alterations that must obviously be made on the morrow  then lisle yielded to a strong sense of satisfaction for the next month or two he would be almost constantly in millicents company her companions were his friends and he thought that he would not be troubled by gladwynes presence desiring to assure himself on the latter point he turned to bella  nobody has mentioned clarence i was wondering if he would join us  no she answered smiling at him meaningly he wasnt invited then she moved away leaving lisle more deeply content  presently the party broke up and when they reached the tent they jointly occupied miss hume remarked to millicent  you look unusually pleased my dear  i dare say i do millicent smiled its something to feel that ones confidence has been justified and perhaps rather more to rest assured that everything will now go as smoothly as possible  i suppose you mean since mr lisle has come apart from his practical abilities im fond of that man no doubt you noticed that he came first to me as the eldest though he is aware that im only a dependent in a way of course he wasnt altogether right bella carew being married and you the actual hostess  i wonder if such points are of any importance in the bush millicent answered laughing but im glad mr lisles action won your good opinion i like my friends to be graceful  miss hume faded grayhaired and formal looked reflective  the word you used is not quite the one i should have chosen clarence gladwyne is graceful i think this canadian is something better tonight he was actuated by genuine chivalry my esteem may not be worth much but it is his  moved by some impulse millicent kissed her  ive no doubt hed value it but i cant have clarence depreciated and its getting very late  miss hume noticed a slight change in the girls voice as she mentioned gladwyne she put out the lamp but it was some time before she went to sleep she loved millicent and she believed there was trouble awaiting her     chapter xxvi  lisle turns autocrat   on the morning after his arrival lisle called the company together and first of all addressed millicent  its your wish that i should act as guide to this expedition  millicent answered in the affirmative and he went on  the guide must be commanderinchief with undisputed authority before we start i must ask if any one objects to that  they gave him full power with acclamation and he nodded  well he continued id better explain that the main difficulty attending any expedition into an almost uninhabited region is to keep it supplied with food and means of shelter its a question of transport there are two ways of getting over the difficultyby reducing the weight or by increasing the number of packers and the latter are useful only when each man can transport more than will satisfy his personal requirements i think thats clear  they assented with some curiosity mixed with a slight uneasiness  then he proceeded ill exercise my authority by asking you to lay out in front of each tent everything you have brought with you  including our clothes bella asked  assuredly said crestwick you can put them in a heap its the quantity and not the cut that counts  it was evident that the leaders first instructions were received with little favor millicent looked dubious and miss hume alarmed but the orders were carried out and lisle accompanied by crestwick made a tour of inspection stopping in front of bellas and carews tent he pointed to their rather imposing pile of baggage  twothirds of this will have to be left behind though well try to pick it up again you can make your selection he went on to millicents and miss humes collection we cant take more than half of this he informed them then he addressed the company in general the three ladies must occupy miss gladwynes tent and the men carews nasmyths must be abandoned each mans outfit must be cut down to one change of clothes and his blanket  the announcement was received with open murmurs they had all been accustomed to every comfort with which a high civilization could provide them they had already cut down their belongings to the lowest limit at which in their estimation life could be made endurable and many of the articles they were told must be left behind were costly and artistic it was a severe test of obedience and even nasmyth who knew the wilderness desiring to safeguard the women was not inclined to yield lisle had only crestwick to support him until bella touched his arm  stand fast she urged somewhat to his surprise if you give way an inch now youll be sorry  lisle smiled and then raised his voice  im afraid i must insist since you object carew are you willing to carry forty pounds upon your back while you break a trail through thick timber where we find it needful to leave the water  certainly not said carew decidedly  then lisle advised dryly you had better leave as much as possible of the weight behind theres no likelihood of our getting more packers you have to choose between a campchair or a suitcase for example and your daily dinner  for a moment or two they hesitated lisle had straining his new authority to the utmost asked them a very hard thing for in their regard some degree of luxury was less an accidental favor than a prescriptive right then bella took up a long garment and with a little resolute gesture flung it from her  that she laughed is the first sacrifice to the stern guardians of the wilds it ought to satisfy them considering who made it and what it cost she seized a small valise and hurled it after the dress theres the next im thankful my complexion will stand the weather  millicent looked up at lisle indicating a small easel a bulky sketchbook and a box of watercolors  are these to go she asked with indignant eyes  no he answered gravely theyre the reason for the whole expedition and their transport is provided for but youll have to jettison something else  the selections were made and lisle summoned one of the packers  roll these things up in mr nasmyths tent pete he bade him youll have to make a cache of them  like burying money isnt it remarked the man regarding the pile of sundries with a grin guess they wont be worth much when theyre dug up again  half an hour later three deeplyladen canoes left the beach and all day the party paddled up the gleaming lake and crept with poles going up a slow green river sunset was near when they landed and ate supper among a clump of cedars and after the meal most of them cramped with the canoe journey climbed the steep hillbench or strolled away along the shingle lisle was lying smoking beside the fire when millicent sauntered toward him and sat down upon a neighboring stone  you were right of course she apologized am i forgiven it was only a momentary revolt  he smiled though his bronzed coloring deepened for there was an unusual gentleness in her voice  it was very natural he replied i had expected more determined opposition but i didnt go farther than was necessary  no i think the others realize that now  theyll be more convinced of it later he responded with a trace of grimness  i dont think theyll give you any trouble but since you got rid of nasmyths tent where will you and crestwick sleep  jim and i can make a shelter of some kind were used to the bush  what have you done to the lad millicent asked i can hardly realize the change in him hes a different being  ive merely given him a chance he would hardly have had in england the country has done the rest you can ask him how much advice or admonishment he got  oh she explained i shouldnt expect you to give him advice its cheap  he made no reply and her eyes rested with quiet approval on his rather embarrassed face she had no doubt that close contact with this man had had more to do with the change in crestwick than the influence of the country and then she recollected that the lads degeneration had been marked and rapid while he had taken clarence for a model it was a troublesome thought and she banished it with an effort  you didnt get here without difficulty and our journey will keep you away from your business for some time she observed  as to that ive earned a little leisure and ive been looking forward to this trip ever since i left england now its almost like being back there again only that in some ways its even better  so far as their surroundings might explain his satisfaction millicent could frankly agree with him the black spires of the cedars towering far above them cut in rigid tracery against the splendors of the sunset sky one stretch of the river still shone with a saffron light the rest which had grown dim flowed through deepening shadow filmy mist trails streaked the rugged hills and the hoarse clamor of a rapid quivered in the cool air behind it all there was something that set the lonely scene apart from any other that the girl had looked uponone could realize that this was as yet an untamed and unsullied region but her companion was accustomed to the wilderness so there must be she thought another cause for his content  i am glad you do not grudge the time you may have to spend with us she said  grudge it he exclaimed and then restraining himself he broke into a soft laugh you may accuse me of that feeling when you hear me grumble  the ring in his voice had its meaning and it left her thoughtful the revelation was not altogether new she had guessed his regard for her but she imagined that she could hold him at arms length if it were necessary it was with him as it was with nasmyth and they were alike in their selfrestraint nasmyth had quietly accepted his dismissal when she had shown him that it was irrevocable and the canadian would not trouble her with futile complaints she wondered if out of three suitors she had not chosen the least desirable in some respects but this could not be admitted and she resolutely thrust the idea aside  theres a point id better mention lisle resumed in a matteroffact tone im not going to follow the route of the first expedition from the beginning ive thought of a shorter and easier one well strike the other by the big portage and then follow it down  are you afraid of wearing out your untried followers  well he admitted im taking no risks that can be avoided this journey  she smilingly commended his caution though she was conscious of a desire which must be held in check to see what he would do if he could be shaken out of his selfcontrol she approved of his restraint because only while it was exerted could she meet him on friendly terms but as had happened on his last afternoon in england it piqued her she wondered how much it cost him  after all she said with a forced laugh its better to keep carefully clear of danger  yes he agreed but theres now and then a temptation to face the hazard one feels that its worth while  never mind that i think id rather enjoy the wildness of this scene than to philosophize tell me about the bear and deer we are likely to come across  he discoursed at length and she sat listening while the light faded and the cedars grew blacker then the others approached and they went back to camp  breakfast will be at seven prompt he informed them the packers will strike tents while you eat so have everything ready there are two awkward portages to be tackled tomorrow  they started in a clammy mist which clung about them until they reached the foot of the first wild rapid where the green and white flood came roaring over ledges and between huge boulders with wisps of spray tossing over it this was millicents first sight of the river in anger and she watched at first almost appalled and then thrilled with strong excitement when lisle and one packer took the leading canoe up the lowest rush they stood upright in the unloaded unstable craft long pole in hand guiding her with what seemed wonderful skill across madlywhirling eddies and through tumbling foam while nasmyth and another man floundering deep in water assisted them at intervals with the trackingline once nasmyths companion lost his footing and disappeared but he rose and millicent saw that instead of clinging to the line for safety he loosed it and swimming down a wild white tumult came dripping ashore this she thought was bracing work that made for more than physical vigor but she could not imagine clarence indulging in it it was too elemental too barbarous for him he was fond of exertion in the form of sport but he required somebody to saddle and lead out his horse and to load his second gun there was a difference between him and those who delighted to grapple at first hand with nature  she was astonished to see crestwick get a heavy flour bag upon his back and move away with it over very rough stones and she joined in bellas laugh when carew attempted to shoulder another and dropped it  its the first time hes ever tried such a thing in his life bella remarked theres nothing like personal experience you dont realize that it isnt easy when you give a porter sixpence to lift your biggest trunk at a station  the difference is that the porters used to it carew who was redfaced and breathless pointed out  it looks as if that would apply to you before weve finished bella retorted if you cant do anything else why dont you help those men in the river  carew made a gesture of resignation and resolutely plunged in  that laughed bella to millicent and miss hume is excellent discipline after a little of it i believe hell do me credit i can think of a few overfed men that id like to put through a drastic course of it only in their case id go in the canoe and take my heaviest luggage with me  it wouldnt be wise asserted millicent when they reached broken water theyd probably let you go  she collected an armful of odds and ends and set off upstream over the portage the men spent several hours bringing the canoes and stores across and there followed some laborious poling before they reached the second rapid which was safely passed the party was quieter than usual after supper that night they had had their first glimpse of the strenuous life of the wilderness and it had impressed them the effect passed off however as they pushed on day after day without mishap millicent in particular delighted in all she sawthe fresh green of the birches among the somber cedars the lonely heights that ever surrounded them the gleaming lakes the broad green flood that here and there filled the gorges with its thunder  she suffered no discomfort she could not laugh at there was something that braced her in mind and body in the mountain air and clarence no longer held a leading place in her memory she realized now that the thought of him had hitherto occasioned her a vague uneasiness indeed she was almost glad that he was far away liberty was unexpectedly sweet and though she had a few misgivings she meant to enjoy it while it lasted  then one afternoon when they were stopped by a fall she slipped away from the others with her sketchbook and wandering back through straggling bush climbed a rocky ridge the ascent was steep but by clambering up a gully she reached the summit and after strolling along it she sat down to sketch the gorge below the work absorbed her attention and some time had passed when the lengthening shadows warned her that she would better retrace her steps to camp  it proved difficult she could not find the gully she had climbed up and the side of the ridge was almost precipitous and was clothed with brushwood at last however she reached a spot from which it seemed possible to make the descent but after scrambling and sliding for some distance she was suddenly stopped by a sheer drop of several yards to a ledge being agile she might have reached the ledge by lowering herself by her hands but it was narrow and slanted outwards so that she feared to slip off in alighting and fall over the crag below she attempted to climb back to the summit and found it impossible for the stones she seized were loose and came away when she disturbed them she could only stay where she was and call for assistance though the clamor of the fall ringing up the valley almost drowned her voice  by and by the sunlight faded off the rocks above the trees below grew shadowy and millicent began to feel anxious and to envy the others who would no doubt be sitting down to their evening meal they would miss her and set out in search but they might not reach her until it was dark when it would be difficult to extricate her and she had no desire to spend the night among the rocks she made another determined attempt to get up but slid back nearly slipping over the edge while her sketchbook went clattering far below then she sat still calling out at intervals  the light grew dimmer white mists began to trail about the heights above and millicent was getting cold she was also getting angryit looked as if the others were too busy eating or talking to care what had become of her some of them ought to have come in search she felt a grievance against lisle in particular why she should blame him more than nasmyth or carew was not very clear except that he was more used to the country but she felt that he ought to have come to her rescue then fearing that she would have to spend the night on the hillside she carefully crept toward a small level space near a jutting rock and sat down shivering while dusk slowly crept across the bush     chapter xxvii  an unpleasant surprise   millicent had no intention of going to sleep among the rocks but after a while she grew drowsy and when at length she raised her head with a start the moon hung over the hills across the river flooding the heights above her with a silvery light the trees below were sharper in form but everything was very still only the thunder of the fall seemed to have increased in depth of tone millicent shivered from the cold as she sent a sharp cry ringing across the woods  this time it was answered and she recognized the voice looking down she could see lisles black figure moving cautiously along the ledge for although the lower rocks were wrapped in shadow it is never altogether dark in the northern summer coming out into the moonlight he examined the slab of rock which had arrested her descent but when he spoke she was not quite pleased with his very matteroffact tone it left something to be desiredshe thought he might have displayed more satisfaction at finding her safe  is there anything you could catch hold of at the top he asked if so youd better lower yourself until i can reach you  anxious as she was to get down millicent hesitated if she did as he suggested she would descend into his arms she was not unduly prudish and indeed after being left alone in the impressive solitude of the wilds she would have been glad of the reassuring grasp of a human being but an obscure feeling springing perhaps from primitive instincts made her shrink from close contact with this particular man  no she answered coldly the rock is loose besides the ledge is narrow and if i came down heavily we might both fall over  he again examined the slab and then stood still considering  well he decided theres a crack some way up that should give me a hold and a bit of a projection you could rest a foot on yonder then if you gave me one hand i could lower you down  he came up thrusting his fingers into a fissure near the summit and finding a tiny support for his toes lowering herself cautiously she clutched the hand he extended  now he cautioned as gently as possible  loosing her hold above she hung for a moment or two half afraid to let go his hand while his arm and body grew tense with the strain and she could hear his labored breath summoning her courage she relaxed her grasp in another second she was safe upon the ledge and scrambling down he stood beside her with a set flushed face the veins protruding on his forehead  im glad thats over i was badly scared he acknowledged  she thrilled at the confession though she thought there had been no serious risk his concern for her safety was strangely pleasant and the strenuous grasp of his fingers had stirred her  oh she replied i believe i was quite safe after you got hold of me  he glanced at the steep face of broken rock that ran down into the shadow  if wed gone over we might not have brought up for a while he said but whats that resting on yonder jutting stone  im sorry its my sketchbook millicent answered unguardedly its nearly filled  then wait here a little  you cant get it millicent cried sharply you mustnt try  its quite easy  millicent could not resist the temptation to make a rather dangerous experiment  and yet you were afraid a minute or two ago  yes he answered looking at her steadily but that was different  she felt her heartbeats quicken and her face grow hot but she laid a restraining hand on his arm  i wont let you go  you must be reasonable he urged moving a pace away that book stands for a good deal of highgrade work if you lose it you will have wasted all the first part of your journey besides i should feel very mean if i left it lying there  he lowered himself over the edge and moving from cranny to cranny and stone to stone went cautiously down while she watched him with her hands closed tight what the actual peril was she could not estimate but it looked appallingly dangerous particularly when in one place he had to descend from a slightly overhanging stone he reached the book however and came up and when at length he stood beside her his expression was quite normal and he was only a little breathless again she felt a disconcerting thrill which was accompanied by a confused sense of pride what he had done was in her service and this time he had shown no sign of fear or strain  thank you she said but im a little angryyou shouldnt have gone i should never have forgiven myself if you had got hurt  there was light enough to show that the blood crept into his face but he turned and glanced at the descending ledge  you had better put your hand on my shoulder where its steep he suggested still were not going to have much trouble in getting down  they had reached level ground before anything more was said and then she turned to him with a smile  why didnt you come before you left me an unpleasantly long while among the rocks  we didnt miss you until supper he explained then i set off at once but i didnt know which way to look and the bush was pretty thick stopping in the moonlight he indicated his rent attire i think this speaks for itself he added humorously theres one consolationthe things belong to carew  millicent was glad that he was not going to be serious  i remember that you didnt bring much of an outfit she replied i suppose you had one what became of it  i left it behind in pieces on the thorns and rocks along a good many leagues of trail but it wasnt extensivewhen you travel in this country you have often to choose between food and clothes it was obviously impossible to buy any more but the day before we reached camp i made crestwick cut my hair after a look at myself in nasmyths pocketglass im inclined to think he was unwarrantably proud of his success  after that they chatted lightly until they walked into the glow of the campfire and while bella and miss hume plied millicent with questions and congratulations lisle took up nasmyths repeating rifle and fired it several times  that will bring the boys in he explained now ill get miss gladwynes supper  during the meal the others came back and when they had all assembled looking the worse for their scramble through the bush crestwick who had occasional lapses from good behavior addressed them collectively  wasnt i right he asked i offered anybody three to one that lisle would be the first to find her  then you ought to be ashamed of it after the expensive way in which your confidence in your opinions has often been shown to be mistaken declared bella besides you promised me you wouldnt waste your money that way again  this time i was backing a moral certainty crestwick rejoined that isnt gambling if youre not convinced you can ask the others on what grounds they were so unwilling to take me  receiving no encouragement he addressed millicent who was extremely vexed with him  i suppose you know that you have given us all a good deal of anxiety you ought to feel contrite  im not sorry if ive given you a good deal of trouble millicent retorted you were a long time in coming to my rescue  that he exclaimed is just the kind of thing bella used to delight in saying though ill own that shes been much more civil lately its possible that carews patience is not so long as mine  arent you getting rather personal carew hinted  crestwick subsided with an indulgent grimace but when they retired to their shelter lisle turned upon him  it struck me that those jokes of yours were in what you would call uncommonly bad form he said it would be better if you didnt make any more of them  bella doesnt mind shes used to me crestwick grinned  i wasnt referring to bellashe has somebody to take care of her  and miss gladwyne hasnt still thats her own fault isnt it in my opinion she has only to say the word he paused seeing his companions face in the moonlight for its expression was not encouraging oh well he added you neednt lose your temper there are people who can never see when a things humorous ill wind up  in the meanwhile millicent sat in the entrance of her tent looking out between the dark trunks of the cedars on the glittering river it sluiced by lapping noisily upon the shingle lined with streaks of froth and the roar of the neighboring fall filled the lonely gorge the wildness of her surroundings had its charm she had been happier among them than she had been at any time during the last twelve months in england and now she was uneasily conscious of the reason lisles constant watchfulness over her comfort his cheery conversation even the sight of him when he was too busy to talk were strangely pleasant she realized why she had made him take the harder way in helping her down from the rock and the knowledge was disconcerting she had been afraid to trust herself to the clasp of his arms but not because of any want of confidence in him  then she saw carew kiss bella among the cedars before she left him to walk toward the tent and the sight stirred her blood it was clear that she must be on her guard her guide must be kept firmly at a distance though this promised to be difficult she was to all intents and purposes pledged to clarence and until bella joined her she tried to fix her thoughts on him wondering where he was and what he was doing without being able to find much interest in the question  as it happened clarence was then sitting in a luxurious parlorcar as a big westbound train sped through the forests of ontario but his face was troubled and he felt ill at ease a little more than a fortnight earlier he had met marple at a swiss hotel and the man had informed him that miss gladwyne and miss hume had sailed for canada nasmyth he added had gone by a previous steamer to make arrangements for some journey they wished to undertake this was the first intimation clarence had received millicent had written to him on the day before she sailed but the letter following him to one of the italian valleys had not yet reached him and he was filled with consternation she had stolen away as if she did not wish to be burdened with his company she was going to visit the scene of her brothers death no doubt under the guidance of lisle who had strong suspicions concerning it he might communicate them to millicent perhaps he had done so already which would account for her silent departure with an effort gladwyne roused himself to action he made up his mind to follow her and if necessary attempt some defense perhaps he thought he could manage to destroy any evidence of his treachery which the canadian had discovered  still he was tormented by doubts as he lounged in the parlorcar and growing restless he went out on the rear platform and lighted a cigar there was faint moonlight and dim trees fled past him the rattle of wheels and the rush of the cool wind was soothing he could not think while he stood holding on by the brass rail to protect himself against the lurching and he found a relief in the roar as the great train swept across a foaming river they had been detained at a junction during the afternoon and the engineer was evidently bent on making up the wasted time  presently the door of the next car opened and gladwyne started violently as a dark figure came out on to the platform  batley he cried what in the name of wonder has brought you here  batley moving forward into the moonlight regarded him with a mocking smile  nothing very remarkable id several motives for one thing i felt id like the triphad a stroke of luck not long ago which justified the expense british columbias nowadays almost as accessible as parts of norway where ive generally gone to and i understand its wilder  but how is it i havent seen you on the train gladwyne asked in no way reassured by the mans careless explanation  i only got on at the last junction batleys tone was significant as he proceeded i was too late for your allan boat when i inquired about you in london i found that you had gone but i caught the next new york cunarder and came on by buffalo i suppose you stopped a day or two in montreal which explains how ive overtaken you  we were held up by ice off newfoundland  well suggested batley suppose we go into the smoking end of the car i dare say youd like a talk and its rather noisy here besides the cinders are a little too plentiful  they went in and batley lounging in a seat lighted a cigar and waited with an amused expression for the other to begin gladwyne was intensely uneasy it had been a vast relief to be free from his companion and the last thing he desired was that batley who was a remarkably keenwitted man should go over the track of georges expedition in company with lisle  now he said id be glad if you would tell me exactly why you followed me the reason you gave didnt seem sufficient  then my other object ought to be clear youre carrying a good deal of my money i felt it would be wiser to keep an eye on you as i said id had a stroke of luck that enabled me to get away  i suppose that means somebody has suffered gladwyne in his bitterness could not help the injudicious sneer  oh no returned batley goodhumoredly in this case id set a man on his feetits now and then as profitable as pulling one down and my methods arent always destructive the fellow was straight and im inclined to believe he was grateful i dont think he could have found anybody else to back him but im not afraid of a risk he paused and smiled at his companion sometimes i make mistakes i did so with you  gladwyne flushed but batley proceeded  i may remind you that when i financed you i was led to believe that you would succeed to a handsome property not one that was stripped of its working capital ill give you credit for misleading me rather cleverly all this is to the point because it explains my watchful attitude youre the kind of man i prefer to keep in sight  disgust humiliation and anger possessed gladwyne but he knew that he was in his companions hands and he did not think that batley had stated all of his reasons yet it was possible that he expected to discover something in british columbia that would strengthen his hold on his victim  well he replied with an attempt at calmness we neednt quarrel since it looks as if wed have to put up with each other for some time have you finished what you have to say  not quite theres one question yet when do you expect to marry miss gladwyne  what is that to you clarence broke out  just thisim anxious to form some idea as to when im likely to get my money back since miss crestwick dropped you theres only miss gladwyne available so far as i know and you have got to marry money and do so pretty soon im willing to do anything that may help on the match  gladwynes face burned he looked savage but batley continued to watch him with an ironical smile  i dont want to drive you too hard but im only stating an obvious fact he concluded now ill leave you to think it over while i interview the porter of the sleepingcar     chapter xxviii  clarence reaches camp   the evening was dull and gloomy a gray sky hung over the desolate hills and millicent sitting alone on a rocky slope felt troubled and depressed beneath her the long hollow that crossed the big divide stretched back colored in cheerless neutral tints into drifting mist it was sprinkled with little ponds and banded here and there with belts of stunted trees small birches and willows and ragged cedars that hid the oozy muskegs under them  the girl was worn with travel for lisle had abandoned the canoes some time ago and the party had followed by what he called easy stages the trail he and the packers had broken though the women had found the way hard enough this he had informed them would shorten the journey a good deal and he expected to fall in with some indians from whom canoes could be obtained once they had crossed the divide failing this they might be compelled to retrace their steps  it was up the forbidding hollow they had lately reached that george gladwyne had doggedly plodded faint with hunger on his last journey millicent had followed his trail for the past two days and she had found them filled with painful memories all that lisle had shown her had brought back her brother and once more she mourned for him but that was an old wound that had partly healed and she could face the sorrowful story of georges last struggles with a certain pride he had endured with unwavering courage and the manner of his death became him the girl had other troubles which clouded the present and filled her with misgivings for the future  during her first few weeks in the wilderness lying all day under clear sunshine and cloudless skies it had seemed to her an enchanted land snowpeaks and crystal lakes that mirrored ranks of climbing firs struck her as endowed with an almost unearthly beauty and as wonderful a tranquillity and when she pushed on through the savage portals of the mountains there was something that stirred her nature in the sight of the foaming rivers and the roar of the sprayveiled falls now however the glamour had gone it had been rudely banished on the night when lisle had helped her down the rocks she who had allowed clarence to believe that she would marry him had found a strange delight in the company of another man one whom she might have loved had she been free she tried to convince herself in a determined attempt to hide the fact that her heart cried out for him  lisle had pushed on with a single companion on the previous night to see if he could obtain canoes the packers were breaking a trail and the others were resting in camp millicent was glad of this for she wanted to be alone suddenly as she looked down the hollow two indistinct figures appeared out of the mist the packers had gone up the valley but there was no doubt that it was two men she saw and they were apparently making for the camp as the party had met nobody since entering the wilderness she felt curious about the strangers there was something in the carriage of one of them that seemed familiar and then the uneasiness of which she had already been conscious became intensified as she recognized that he walked like clarence  a few minutes later the men were hidden by a growth of willows and she sped back to camp scrambling among the rocks with a haste that was born of nervous tension she did not see the men againit was needful to pick a path down the steep descent very carefullyand when she came breathless upon the clump of birches among which the tents were pitched it was evident from the hum of voices that the strangers had already arrived pushing in among the trees she stopped with her heart beating unpleasantly fast face to face with clarence  ah he exclaimed moving forward to meet her now im rewarded for my journey how fit and brown you look millicent  she stood still a moment with an expressionless face finding no words to say then with an effort she roused herself and shook hands with him  you must have had a trying march if you followed our trail she said but how did you get herei mean why did you leave switzerland  crestwick chuckled  thats very much what we all asked him he broke in in one way its hardly civil if wed known he was coming wed have been better prepared to express our delight  the lad was not as a rule considerate and he suffered from want of tact but there was truth behind what he said it is given to only a few to be sure of a warm and sincere welcome when they take their friends by surprise nasmyth frowned at crestwick who had rashly hinted at the feeling of constraint that had seized upon the party millicent however was looking at gladwyne and her heart grew softer as she noticed his weariness and his strained expression  well she said when he had answered her you must sit down and rest nasmyth and crestwick will get you something to eat as soon as possible  it was not what she would have wished to sayit sounded dreadfully commonplacebut batley came forward with an easy laugh  im afraid our young friendhe indicated crestwickis not a diplomatist but on the whole his faults a good one hes more or less honest youll forgive us for surprising you it was quite impossible to send you a warning  millicent smiled the tension suddenly slackened and as the packer who cooked was away with his comrade they all set about preparing a meal which thanks to batley was eaten amid a flow of lively conversation the man was weary but he could rise to an occasion and summon to his aid a genial wit clarence was glad of this fatigue had reacted on him increasing his anxiety and he had been chilled by the coldness of his reception even the cordiality his companions now displayed was suspicious because it suggested that they wished to atone for something that had previously been lacking he ate however and talked when he found an opportunity and afterward acquiesced when millicent declined to be drawn away from the others  when the meal was finished they sat close together about the fire for coldness came with the dusk but by degrees the conversation languished the increasing chill the gloom and the desolation of their surroundings affected them all and nobody had been quite at ease since gladwynes arrival he was too tired to make more than spasmodic attempts to talk and though millicent was sorry for him she could not help contrasting him with lisle she had seen the latter almost worn out with severe labor but even then he had been cheerful ready to encourage his companions with lively badinage he seemed to take pleasure in forcing his body to the utmost strain it could bear  the light had died away into the partial obscurity which would last until sunrise when lisle walked into camp the fire had burned up and millicent saw his start and his face set hard at the sight of gladwyne  this is a surprise he said when did you get here  about two hours ago we found where you left the water and followed up your trail gladwyne answered  how many packers and what stores did you bring  two packers replied gladwyne there were no more available at the last settlement batley has a list of the provisionswe cut them down as much as possible as we were anxious to overtake you we traveled light  lisle took the list batley gave him and examined it by the glow of the fire  it looks as if you didnt mind endangering the safety of the whole party he broke out this expedition is already quite large enough and you add four people to it with less than half the necessary stores so that you could save yourself a little trouble on the journey whats more important we cant make up for the shortage by better speed only two of you can pack an average load though all four must be fed  millicent had listened hot with anger and a little surprised lisle had his faults including a shortness of temper but he was now showing a strain of what she considered primitive barbarism which he had hitherto concealed a cultured englishman would have led clarence aside or waited for an opportunity before remonstrating with him and then her face burned as she wondered whether lisle had been actuated by savage jealousy it was however insufferable that he should display it in this fashion  i must point out that i organized the expedition she said everybody here is my guest  did you invite gladwyne and batley  i did not millicent was compelled to own for all that they are now in the same position as the rest i must ask you to remember it  lisle had some trouble in controlling himself but he nodded well he responded ill have to alter several of our arrangements and ill go along and talk it over with the packers ive got the canoes required and well take the trail at seven tomorrow  he strode away toward the packers fire quite aware that he had not behaved in a very seemly way but still consumed with indignation against gladwyne when he had disappeared clarence looked up  im sorry if we have given you unnecessary trouble but does your guide often adopt that rather hectoring tone  his languid contempt roused crestwick  lisles responsible for the safety of all of us the lad broke out and you havent shown much regard for it in making your loads as light as you could  millicent raised her hand  well talk about something else for a few minutes and then break up its an early start tomorrow  they dispersed shortly afterward but batley sought lisle before retiring to rest  i regret that we have added to your anxiety he began of course transport is a serious difficultyive had some little experience of this kind of thing  in the field lisle asked bluntly ive had a suspicion of it then why didnt you remember he saw batleys smile for they were standing by the packers fire oh he added you neednt trouble to shield gladwyne i formed my opinion of him some time agohes a mighty poor specimen  im inclined to agree with you replied batley dryly  they set off early the next morning and after his forced march gladwyne found the load given him sufficiently heavy he was badly jaded aching all over and disturbed in mind when they camped near the summit of the divide late in the afternoon without his having been able to secure a word with millicent alone he felt that he must gain her consent to a formal engagement before lisle let fall any hint of his suspicions which he did not believe had been done so far afterward knowing millicent he thought she would staunchly refuse to listen to anything to his discredit and he could if it were needful ascribe lisles attack to jealousy he must however also contrive to push on ahead of the party on some excuse and obliterate any remaining trace of the former expeditions provision caches then he would be safe  millicent had strolled away from the others and was standing among the rocks when he overtook her the signs of fatigue and tension in his face softened her toward him still it was only compassion she felt no thrill but rather an involuntary shrinking and a sense of alarm she was to be called upon to fulfil a duty to which she had somehow pledged herself  millicent he began things cant go on as they have been doingpleasant as it was i have waited patiently but you cant expect too much now i have come a long way to claim my reward i want the right to look after you and to tell the others so  his abruptness and hoarseness were expressive but she felt that there was something lacking and she answered with a flippancy she seldom indulged in  you thought it needful to bring your privy counselor with you  no he came without even asking my permission  well she said sitting down with forced calmness it doesnt matter but are you quite sure now that you really want me  there was no doubt that he was desperately anxious for her formal word there was a feverish eagerness in his eyes it puzzled her but it left her unmoved and cold  want you he cried can you ask havent i constantly shown my devotion  for the last few monthsi mean after lisle went back to canada she replied with gathering color before then for a time i think one could reasonably have doubted it  he looked confused that bella had attracted him had been obvious and there was no way of getting over the fact gracefully  im afraid i have my weaknesseswant of balance impulsiveness and a capacity for being easily piqued he confessed well though perhaps i deserved it you were cold and aloof enough to madden a more patient man and i suppose i slackly yielded to wounded vanity all the time you were the one i had chosen the only woman who had ever really stirred or could influence me nearly as long as i can remember i have loved and respected you occasionally you unbent enough to show me that you recognized it  there was some truth in this and seeing the change in her expression he went on  you cant cast me off and fling me back upon myselfi couldnt face that during those last few months in england you helped me forward far more than you suspectedshowed me my duties enabled me to carry them out i cant go on alone im your responsibility having taken it up you cant deny it now  millicent smiled faintly  no she admitted i suppose that would be hardly fair  he would have thrown his arm about her but she laid a hand on his shoulder and with gentle firmness held him back  no she said with a deep color in her face not yet we have been associated as cousins i must get used to the new position  he had wit enough to yield but he kissed her hands exultantly  its a pledge i may tell the others  yes she consented quietly i think you may  for a while he sat at her feet with her hand on his shoulder talking about the future and she was sensible of a certain calm satisfaction which had in it more than a trace of resignation she had not shirked her duty she was safe from temptation and she had after all a sincere halfpitying tenderness for the man her liking for him would she thought grow stronger and the passion which lisle had once or twice half awakened in her was a thing to be subdued and dreaded though gladwyne saw that she was but lightly moved he was content and some time had passed when they went slowly back together to the camp  miss hume was the first to notice them and when millicent smiled she went hastily forward and kissed her then bella joined them and batley offered his good wishes in fitting terms when lisle and nasmyth came up a word from bella was sufficient for them for a moment the girl was startled by what she read in the canadians face it was however invisible to millicent turning suddenly round without speaking he strode away followed by nasmyth stopping when he was hidden from the camp among the rocks lisle turned savagely to his companion  you heard what bella said  i did replied nasmyth the hound it must be stopped  yes asserted lisle more coolly thats a sure thing still there are difficultiesshe may not believe my story now i almost think ill wait until we reach the two caches then with something to back my statements i might force the truth from him  in that case you had better watch him warned nasmyth looking deeply disturbed he may try to reach them first  the next moment crestwick joined them  whats to be done vernon he exclaimed miss gladwynes engagements formally announcedit cant go on  why lisles voice was stern what has it to do with you  well explained crestwick hesitating the mans not to be trusted hes dangerous he simply cant be allowed to make this match he paused and spread out his hands im horribly troubled about itid better tell you that i know  you know nothing that need be mentioned lisle interrupted him thats positive you have to remember it as to the rest youll leave the matter entirely in my hands  oh well agreed crestwick if you order it that relieves me of my responsibility im uncommonly glad to get rid of it  lisle abruptly strode away and crestwick saw that nasmyth was regarding him curiously  lisle was quite right nasmyth said he only forestalled me in instructions i meant to give you  then you understand what i was referring to exclaimed crestwick  ive a good idea nasmyth answered dryly in my opinion so has lisle  but you were on the far side of the hedge on the morning we tried the horse and lisle was down he wasnt conscious when i broke through the thorns  quite correct but its most unlikely he lost consciousness from the fall and he was lying with his face turned toward the jumpit wasnt until the chestnut came down on his shoulder that he was badly hurt the doctor agreed with me on that point  that might have struck me crestwick rejoined but you owned that you had an idea of what happened at the jump how did you get it did lisle tell you  nasmyth smiled grimly  im firmly convinced that hell never mention what he saw or suspects to anybody unless its to gladwyne as to the rest the hedge wasnt thick enough to prevent my seeing through it  hes an unusual man declared crestwick in an admiring tone i havent met his equal but ill keep my eye on gladwynetheres risk enough at some of the rapidsthe hound shant have another chance if i can help it  they turned and went back to camp but on reaching it they sat down among the packers avoiding gladwyne and millicent     chapter xxix  a bold scheme   the sense of security which millicent experienced on announcing her engagement was not permanent and in a few days the doubts that had troubled her crept back into her mind she had never entertained any marked illusions about clarence and although now that she was irrevocably pledged to him she endeavored to fix her thoughts on his most likable qualities even these appeared in a less favorable light than they had formerly done the growth of the warmer attachment she had expected to feel was strangely slow and though it was early to indulge in regrets her heart sometimes grew heavy as she looked forward to the future clarence was considerate attentive and deferential in a polished way but he lacked something one looked for in a lover besides she was anxious about him he looked worn his manner suggested that he was bearing a strain but this was in his favor for it roused her compassion she fancied that the cause of it was financial and this in a sense was encouraging because this was a trouble from which she could purchase him immunity  in the meanwhile she was stirred by mournful memories as she followed the last stages of her brothers journey and visited the lonely spot where he had met his end somehow the thought of him encouraged hergeorge had quietly done his duty regardless of the cost and even if her burden proved heavy which it was premature to admit she must bear it cheerfully  at length they stopped one evening at a portage and lisle examined the stores  the foods getting short he announced one or two of you had better take out your rifles the first thing tomorrow while the rest go fishing ill tackle the portage with two packers  he began his work at sunrise the next morning and it was toward evening when crestwick came back exultant with a blacktail buck nasmyth was fishing near the camp and lisle was busy with a canoe near by  where are the rest how have they got on lisle asked  i think batley went back to the last reach with carews rod crestwick answered i met gladwyne and one of the packers on the low range back yonder theyd only got a blue grouse  i could have done with the man here said lisle which way were they heading  back upriver the way we came  lisle made no comment but crestwick thought he found the information reassuring and thrusting out the canoe he was swept away down the easiest part of the rapid while crestwick assisted nasmyth to land a trout lisle had returned to the camp when the packer who had accompanied clarence came in alone bringing a couple of grouse  whats become of mr gladwyne lisle asked him  hasnt he got back replied the other glancing about i lost him on the far slope of the bluff about noon but as he could see the river most anywhere from the top i went right on there was a deer trail i was trying to follow  lisle said nothing more to the packer but walked rapidly toward where the cook was getting supper ready nasmyth followed him  did you give mr gladwyne any lunch to carry with him when he left camp lisle asked the man  i was busy when he came along and i told him to look around for himself i think he took some canned stuff and there was quite a big loaf missing  bring the box you keep the canned goods in  the cook produced it  theres two meat cans gone anyway he remarked looks as if mr gladwyne figured on getting mighty hungry  lisle nodded  put me up enough bread and fish for two of us for two days  he moved away with nasmyth and they had left the fire behind when he spoke his voice hoarse with anger  gladwynes gone to the cache hes got half a days clear start of us and he knows the country its pretty open and hell make quite a good pace on a straight trail while the river bends get the stuff i asked for while i give the others a few instructions  you mean to start after him at once  as soon as youre ready lisle said shortly  he turned back toward where the others were sitting waiting for supper  as gladwyne hasnt turned up nasmyth and i are going to look for him he announced theres nothing to be alarmed about but its quite likely we may not be back in the morning if we dont turn up by noon you had better start downriver and well pick you up farther on i dont want to waste another day  do you think he has got lost altogether millicent asked anxiously  no answered lisle in a reassuring manner still some of these ridges are bad to climb and quite a lot of things may happen to delay him  he called to a packer and gave him definite orders to take the party downriver and wait at a spot agreed upon and a few minutes later he and nasmyth left the camp  shortly afterward batley came in  where are the others he asked  they told him and he looked thoughtful  so lisle started at once which way did he and nasmyth go  up the ridge behind us but they turned downstream when they reached the top carew replied  batley scented a mystery  well he said i think ill go after them i might be useful of course youll start tomorrow as lisle told you and if im not back by then ill follow the river to the rendezvous he mentioned  he disappeared as did crestwick who came in for supper later on and as the packers had pitched their tent lower down there was now only carew left with the women in camp they were all a little uneasy as dusk grew near the haste with which the men had set out one after another struck them as ominous bellas mind was unusually active for she had promptly decided that there was something behind all this and when at last millicent strolled away from the others she followed her to the edge of the water a ridge of rock cut them off from view of the camp and though she fancied that millicent was not pleased to see her bella sat down upon a stone  in a way the anxiety that lisle and the rest have shown to find clarence is flattering she began expressing part of her thoughts i wonder if theyd all have gone off in such a hurry if jim had got lost  your brother knows the bush returned millicent hiding her fears  bella did not respond to this she had decided that millicent must not be allowed to marry gladwyne but she could not bring herself to denounce the man if that must be done somebody else would have to undertake the task at the same time she felt it incumbent on her to give the girl some warning or at least to find out how far her confidence in her lover went in order to determine how advice could best be offered  i wonder if you feel quite sure you will be happy with clarence she ventured  you have provoked the retortwere you convinced that you would be happy with arthur carew when you made up your mind to marry him so suddenly  bellas smile expressed forbearance it was getting dark but she could see the hot flush in her companions cheeks and the sparkle in her eyes neither was encouraging but bella was not easily daunted and she felt that her persistence was really meritorious considering that until lately millicent had never been cordial to her  perhaps id better answer she said sweetly i was sure of arthur and that means a good deal more than that i knew he was in love with mei dont suppose you heard that hed proposed to me once before  why didnt you take him then millicent asked coldly remember you have justified my being personal  bella grew rather hotwhen carew had made his first offer she had been in eager pursuit of gladwynebut she sternly suppressed a desire to retaliate  i dont think we need go into that she replied as i said i was sure of arthuri knew his character knew he was better than i am that he could be depended on hes the kind of man one is safe with i felt that the more i saw of him the more i could trust him perhaps the feelings a safer guide than passionit stands longer wearand now im getting to like him better every day  her voice dropped to a tender note and millicent felt a little astonished and ashamed of her harshness this was a new bella one in whose existence she could hardly have believed  i havent quite finished though i dont often talk like this bella went on i feel that without the confidence ive tried to describe marriage must be a terrible riskone might find such ugly qualities in the man even defects you could forgive beforehand would become so much worse when you had to suffer because of them of course one cant expect perfection but there ought to be somethinghonor a good heart a generous mindthat one can rely on as a sure foundation when you have that you can build and even then the building may be difficult she paused before she concluded my dear im happier than i deserve to be i have chosen wisely  nothing more was said for a few minutes but bella studying her companions face was more or less content millicents faith in clarence was weak she was forcing herself to believe in him it might be possible to make her see her lover in his true character though bella had not yet determined on the exact course she would adopt then carew called from the camp and she went back while millicent sat still with grave doubts in her heart bellas faith in her husband was warranted and millicent was enough of an optimist to believe that such men were not uncommonthere was lisle for example and nasmyth with them one would undoubtedly have something to build a happy and profitable life uponbut what could be done with one in whom there was no foundation only the shifting sands of impulses or perhaps unsounded depths of weakness into which the painfullyraised edifice might crumble she stove to convince herself that she was becoming wickedly hypercritical thinking treasonably of her lover particularly in contrasting him with her guide there must be no more of that and she rose and walked back to her tent with a resolution that cost her an effort  in the meanwhile lisle and nasmyth were pushing on as fast as possible along the stony summit of the ridge there was moonlight which made it a little easier but they stumbled every now and then here and there they were forced to scramble down the sides of a gully and on reaching the bottom to plunge into water and once they had to scramble some distance shut in by the rocks before they could find a means of ascending still they were hard and inured to fatigue and they never slackened the pace when striding along a stretch of smoother ground nasmyth gathered breath to speak  we were easily taken in he declared though the thing was cunningly planned gladwyne took the packer with him and headed back at first to divert suspicion it would be easy enough to lose the man and turn downstream again and that he intended something of the kind is proved by his taking so much food with him no doubt hed rather have avoided that in case it looked suspicious but hes had one hungry march over the same ground and i dare say it was quite enough besides he could defy us once hed emptied and obliterated the caches  you understand the way your peoples minds work better than i do lisle returned dryly  thats natural isnt it the idea that im most impressed with just now is that millicent might believe it her duty to stick to clarence more closely because of a tale that was merely damaging she would never allow herself or anybody else to credit it unless she had absolutely convincing proof  yes agreed lisle i guess youre right thats precisely why we have got to get there first  a thicket of thorny vines and canes barred his way but he went straight at the midst of it and struggled through savagely smashing and rending down the brush the clothes he had borrowed from carew looked considerably the worse for wear when he came out and then he recklessly leaped across a dark cleft the bottom of which he could not see presently they left the ridge and headed away from the river which flowed round a wide curve and toward dawn they were brought up by a ravine the roar of water rose hoarsely from its depths the moon was getting low and the silvery light did not reach far down the opposite side but they could see a sheer smooth wall of rock and the width of the chasm rendered any attempt to jump it out of the question  no way of getting across here decided lisle at the same time it looks as if gladwyne must be held up on the same side that we are well follow the cañon downstream i think  the moonlight was getting dimmer but at some risk of falling into the rift they pushed on along the brink looking down as they went they could see no means of descending but at length when rocks and trees were getting blacker and a little more distinct in the chilly dawn they made out a fallen trunk with broken white branches lying upon a tall mass of rock below  ive an idea that the top of that tree reached across to this side when it first came down lisle said have you got a match  nasmyth had brought a few carefullytreasured wax matches with him and he lighted one it was very still except for the roar of the hidden torrent and the pale flame burned steadily in the motionless cold air it showed a couple of hollows where something had rested close to the edge of the rift and one or two fresh scratches on a strip of rock lisle stooped down beside them  hold the thing lower he exclaimed sharply its as i suspectedthis is where gladwyne got across though he has better nerves than i thought he had the broken end of a branch or two rested right here and he was smart enough to heave the butt off the other bank after hed crawled over looks to me as if it had broken off yonder stump guess therell be light enough to look for a way across in half an hour  sitting down he filled his pipe and shortly afterward he raised one hand as if listening for a while nasmyth could hear nothing except the roar of water there was not a sound that he could catch in the thin straggling bush behind them where few trails of mist were stretched athwart the trees then he started as a faint crackling and snapping began in the distance  can it be a bear he asked  no its a man  nasmyth was somewhat astonished they had not seen a human being except those of their party for a long while and it seemed strange that they should come across one now in the early dawn in those remote wilds  hes wearing boots he said diffidently as the crackling drew nearer  yes lisle responded hes making a good deal more noise than a bushman would  the sound steadily approached them nasmyth found something mysterious and rather eerie in it and he was on the whole relieved when a dark figure materialized among the trees near by he could barely see it but lisle called out sharply  what has brought you on our trail batley  the man came toward them with a breathless laugh and sat down  it isnt your trail but gladwynes im interested in and i cant say that ive succeeded in following that i merely pushed on until i struck this cañon and as i couldnt get across i followed it up  youre not easily scared lisle commented you might have got lost guess you had some motive that made you take the risk  i felt pretty safe you see i knew i could strike the river if necessary at the same time you were right about the motivein fact theres no use in trying to hide it i may as well confess that id sooner keep gladwyne in sight  out of regard for his welfare nasmyth asked  batley laughed  not altogether the fact is hes carrying a good deal of my money  one should have imagined that youd have had him well insured  thats quite correct if he came to grief in england i shouldnt anticipate any trouble but it would be different out here and everything considered id rather avoid complications with the insurance companies now that ive been candid do you feel inclined to reciprocate  not in the least lisle replied shortly im not sure i even sympathize but since youve turned up youll have to stick to us i dont want to waste time in leading another search party as soon as theres a little more light well try to get across the cañon  thanks for the permission smiled batley lighting a cigar     chapter xxx  the end of the pursuit   by degrees the light got clearer the scattered black cedars grew into definite form and a strip of foaming water showed in the depths of the chasm lisle walked some distance along the edge searching for an easier place to cross but the rocks were smooth and almost perpendicular except where they overhung the torrent he went back to where the others were sitting and found that they had been joined by crestwick who briefly explained that having set out on their trail he had been stopped by the cañon and had followed it up until it led him to them  it looks worse farther along well have to try it here lisle announced can you get down nasmyth  nasmyth glanced into the rift it was he judged nearly sixty feet in depth but part of the bank on which he stood had slipped down into the stream leaving an uneven surface by means of which an agile man might descend a tall slab of rock evidently part of the fallen mass rose in a pinnacle from the water and on top of it rested the branches of the tree that gladwyne had used as a bridge and had afterward dislodged the rock behind it on the opposite bank was absolutely smooth but the thicker end of the log which had fallen against the face reached to within about nine feet of the summit  yes he said answering lisles question but im very doubtful whether i can get up the other side the last bit looks particularly awkward theres an outward bulge just beneath the top  we might manage it by giving the leader a lift if we got so far batley suggested pointing to the sharp slab that pike should help us i think it would go  you think it would go queried nasmyth meaningly arent you mixing idioms pikes what wed say round wasdale and your other expressions not uncommon in switzerland  batley laughed  ill own that ive done some rock work in both districts though i was thinner then but ive an idea that times precious to our leader  he lowered himself over the edge and finding foothold went down cautiously by crack and fissure while the others followed with some trouble alighting waistdeep in a frothing rush of water he was driven for a few yards downstream and it was only by seeking the support of the rock that he slowly made head against the torrent lisle joined him when he reached the foot of the pinnacle where they stopped to gather breath with a thin shower of spray whirling about them the light was still dim down in the bottom of the chasm and the mass of rock ran up above them shadowy black and almost smooth  wasting no time in examination lisle flung himself upon it seeking for a grip with elbows and knees he had ascended a yard or two when he lost hold and coming down with a run fell with a splash into the stream  i didnt think youd manage it that way batley remarked the edge appears a little more promising  he went up with lisle following finding hold for knees and fingers while nasmyth and crestwick panting heavily encouraged each other below on reaching the top of the pinnacle batley lay upon it and gave lisle his hand and when he had drawn him up he pointed to the tree  ill go first for reasons that will become apparent later he explained hold on to the log it doesnt seem firmly fixed  the tree was small and when lisle shook it the butt moved against the face of the rock which was separated by a broad gap from the top of the fallen mass batley was heavy but he ascended cautiously while lisle leaned upon the log to steady it then calling nasmyth to take his place lisle went up when he was near the top it looked as if their progress must abruptly cease the butt was narrow and the summit of the rock above it projected somewhat there was not the smallest knob or crevice one could grasp and below them in the shadowy rift the torrent boiled furiously among massy stones it was not a place to slip in  batley however rose very carefully with his feet upon the shattered butt and his hands pressed against the rock until he stood almost upright  youll have to climb up over me until you can get your fingers on the top he said take time when you get up and feel for a good hold  reaching his shoulders lisle stood on them while nasmyth and crestwick on the pinnacle beneath looked up at a somewhat impressive spectacle lisles head and shoulders were now above the edge but he was forced to bend backward and outward by the projecting bulge which pressed against his breast and his cautious movements suggested that he could find no hold it appeared impossible for him to descend unless he did so accidentally and in that event nothing could save him from a fall to the bottom of the ravine for a while they watched his tense figure moving futilely and then batley standing most precariously poised bent his arm and seized one of lisles feet he spoke in a breathless gasp as he thrust it upward lisles legs swung free and he disappeared beyond the edge the two below were conscious of a vast relief it was tempered however by the knowledge that they must shortly emulate their companions exploit  take off your pack batley called to lisle split the bag if its necessary and lower the end but be quick this isnt a comfortable position  the pack in which the small bush rancher conveys his provisions from the nearest store as a rule consists of a cotton flour bag with a pair of suspenders fastened to its corners and nasmyth had provided the party with a few receptacles of similar pattern but more strongly made before entering the wilds the straps when lisle let them down reached several feet from the top and batley bade nasmyth and crestwick ascend they managed it with assistance from lisle who seized them from above then batley called up to them  im going to test the tackle give me a hand up as soon as im over the bulge  it was difficult to hear him as he was still beneath the projecting edge and they watched the straining straps with keen anxiety until a hand that felt for a hold upon the rock appeared lisle seized it with nasmyth ready to assist and batley came up gasping with the perspiration streaming from his face  id have managed it easily at one time he said this is what comes of civilization and soft living  you brought us across we owe you a good deal for it declared lisle  batley smiled at him as they set off again  in this case i wont be an exacting creditor in fact its rather curious how weve hit it off considering that you wouldnt hear of a compromise and our interests are opposed  i dont know what your interests are lisle returned dryly  then in one way im ahead of you i know your wishes and nasmythsyou dont want clarence to marry miss gladwyne its your motive im not sure about do you want the girl yourself  they were some distance in front of the others who were too far behind to hear them lisle looked at his companion steadily the man was engaged in a business that was regarded with general disfavor but there was something he liked about him and he did not resent his bluntness  well he answered it isnt for the reason youve given that i mean to stop the match  can you do so  im going to try  batley smiled reflectively  and the present journey is somehow connected with the attempt now i believe i might have left you held up on the wrong side of the cañon the idea was in my mind and you can give me credit for not yielding to it i suppose there would be no use in my asking you for a hint as to the relation between my rather tricky companions expedition and his cousins death  none in the least said lisle decidedly  batley made a gesture of acquiescence  oh well we must try to be friends as long as possible  nothing more was said about the matter and they spent the day forcing a passage through scrub timber up precipitous hillsides and across long stony ridges  there was no sign of gladwynes trail but that did not trouble lisle for he knew where the man was heading for on the second day batley showed signs of distress and nasmyth and crestwick were walking very wearily but lisle held on at a merciless pace it was essential that he should reach the cache before gladwyne could interfere with it toward evening nasmyth made an effort and caught up with lisle  how would clarence get across to the second cache on the other side of the water he asked its a point ive been considering i suppose its occurred to you  i dont know lisle confessed the indians near the divide said there was another party with canoes somewhere lower down but as the packer who was with me didnt talk to them so far as i noticed i dont see how gladwyne could have heard of it but thats as far as i can go if he destroyed the first cache it would help to clear him unless you can vouch for the correctness of the list i made but he may have some further plan in his mind he paused and raised his hand listen isnt that the river we cant be far from the cache  the day like the two or three preceding it had been hot and bright and now that evening was drawing on the still air was heavy with the smell of the cedars in a neighboring hollow a high ridge stood out black against a vivid green glow and from beyond it there rose a faint hoarse murmur nasmyth welcomed it gladly as announcing the end of the march  the rest of the party can hardly be down until tomorrow theres a couple of portages he said it looks as if well have to go without our supper  i dont want to see them before morning lisle returned grimly  they pushed on the light growing dimmer as they went until at length the moon rose from behind the ridge and when they had skirted the ridge they saw the river glimmer beneath them in a flood of silvery radiance it filled the gorge with its deep murmur for the hot sunshine for three days had melted the snow which had poured down to swell the flood by every gully not far below the neck the broken surface was flecked with white where the river swept angrily over a sharper slope of its bed and a black boulder or two stood out in the midst of the rushing foam upstream of this there was a strip of shingle which nasmyth recognized as the one where the cache had been made he supposed that lisle had struck the spot by heading for the narrow rift of the neck which was conspicuous for some distance from both sides  from end to end the sweep of pebbles was clearly distinct but there was no dark figure moving about it and nasmyth wondered if they had come too late they had marched fast as his aching muscles testified but they had been delayed at the cañon and gladwyne had had a long start if he had arrived and had visited the cache their efforts might prove to have been thrown away there must be no shadow of doubt when lisle told his startling story  they descended with caution moving through shadow for the ridge above them cut off the moonlight though it was far from dark and they were near the bottom when crestwick dislodged a bank of stones which went rattling and crashing down to the beach a moment later a black form sprang out from among the rocks below and ran hurriedly along the shingle this surprised nasmyth because he could not doubt that the man was gladwyne and he failed to understand his object in making what would probably be a futile attempt to avoid them lisle was some distance in front and his voice rang out sharply  head him off from the canoe  nasmyth broke into a stumbling runit was now obvious that gladwyne meant to cross the river and perhaps destroy the second cache  gladwyne had reached the canoe when lisle gained the beach and nasmyth descending in reckless haste saw him hurriedly turn it over and raise the forward end of it lisle was running his hardest almost as if he were fresh up the long strip of shingle but it was evident that he would be too late and they would have no means of following gladwyne after the canoe was launched there was a sharp rattle of stones as he hauled it down lisle was still some way behind gladwyne sprang on board and thrust the light craft off and a few strokes of the paddle drove her well out into the stream  lisle stopped standing in the moonlight and his comrade could see his hands tightly clenched at his side then he suddenly tore off his jacket and flung it behind him noticing this nasmyth attempted to increase his pace the river was running fast swollen with melted snow and lisle must be badly worn out if he had to be restrained by force he should not attempt to swim across  then to nasmyths astonishment gladwyne leaned over the stern of the craft and began to paddle desperately with one hand this proceeding caused lisle to stop again close at the waters edge  come back he shouted  nasmyth ran up and lisle turned  hes dropped or broken his paddlecracked it when he shoved her out there are two or three ugly rocks in the rapid  they ran along the bank together keeping pace with the craft which was sliding away fast with the stream nasmyth could feel his heart thumping as he wondered what clarence would do though he could not cross the river it was possible that he might propel the light canoe back to the shingle with his hand before he reached the rapid as he could not guide her in the strong rush of water there would be danger in attempting to descend it he made no response however to their warning shouts  batley and crestwick overtook the others shortly before the canoe swept into the faster stream at the head of the rapid and they watched her eagerly there was a narrow pass between several boulders close ahead which was the chief danger and the current seemed to be carrying the craft down on one of them in a few moments she struck and jambed broadside on across the mass of stone white foam boiled about her they saw gladwyne rise and clutch the rock but whether to thrust her off or to climb out did not appear he suddenly sank down and so far as they could make out the canoe rolled over  the next moment lisle plunged into the river nasmyth ran to the waters edge but seeing that he was too late he sat down limply lisle was a good swimmer but it did not seem possible that any man could reach clarence before he was washed out at the tail of the rapid it became evident however that somebody else meant to try for batley running hard down the beach plunged in  its awful gasped jim crestwick behind nasmyth its not the risk of drowning theyll be smashed to bits anyway wed better make for the slack at the tail  nasmyth got up he could see nothing of gladwyne or either of the others there were only black rocks rushing water and outbreaks of foam and he had a sickening idea that long before they reached the quieter pool the need for any services he could render would be past fortunately the beach was fairly smooth and after a desperate run they reached a tongue of rock beneath which the eddy swung farther on in the shadow batley stood in the water calling to them and apparently clinging hard to a halfseen object in the stream  nasmyth leaped in kneedeep with crestwick behind him and gripping the looselyhanging arm of the body batley was supporting he asked hoarsely  who is it  lisle was the breathless answer help me to get him out  they dragged him up the beach and let him sink down he lay upon the shingle silent and inert  make a fire jim commanded batley lift his shoulder a bit nasmyth turn him partly over  he hurriedly examined lisle and then looked up  its not a case of drowning and his limbs look sound must have got the breath knocked out of him against a boulder he pointed to a broad red gash on lisles forehead as nasmyth eased him down again that explains his unconsciousness  wheres gladwyne nasmyth asked  batley made an expressive gesture  beyond our help anyway somewhere downriver he appeared to brace himself with an effort im pretty nearly finished but theres a good deal to be done well strip lisle and you and crestwick can share your dry things with him then one of you had better gather cedar twigs for him to lie on     chapter xxxi  lisle goes to england   lisle had with some difficulty been dressed in dry clothes and he lay with his eyes shut on a couch of cedar sprays beside a fire when batley rose and turned to nasmyth  i dont think we need be anxious he said the warmth is coming back to him and hes breathing regularly the knock on the head must have been a bad one and its very likely that he got another thump or two washing down the rapid and the water was icy cold but hell feel better after a few hours sleep  nasmyth was inclined to agree with this prediction and he stood up wearily  then you wont want me for a little while he replied walking away from the fire  having given most of his clothes to lisle he was very lightly clad and the night was cold he shivered as he plodded over the shingle aching in every limb but he looked about eagerly and after a while he found the cache it was uncovered but there were signs that gladwyne had only begun his task when he had been surprised by the arrival of the party which had followed him  nasmyth did not pause to think what lisles wishes might be or whether he would resent his action so far he had kept his promise but with physical weariness reacting on his mental faculties he was only conscious of a hazy idea that gladwynes death had released him from his pledge the traitor had expiated his offense the tragic story must never be raked up again  stooping over the receptacle he dragged out the different articles in it and avoiding a direct glance at them or any attempt to enumerate them he gathered them up and striding over the shingle hurled them as far as possible into the river it cost him several journeys but his heart grew lighter with every splash when at last the work was finished and he had refilled the hole and scattered the stones that had covered it he sat down with a great sense of relief a burden which had long weighed upon his mind was gone mrs gladwyne and millicent were safe at last from the grief and shame that a revelation would have brought them exhausted and confused as he was he could not tell whether he felt any sorrow for gladwynes tragic end the man had passed beyond the reach of human censure one could only let his memory sink into oblivion  growing very cold he went back to the fire but he offered no explanation of his absence lisle was still asleep or unconscious but the natural color in his face was reassuring  ive heard nothing about your part in the water nasmyth said to batley  theres not much to tell it isnt astonishing that my memorys by no means clear anyhow i wasnt far from gladwyne who was swimming well when he was swept away from me and in among the lower boulders by the swirl of an eddy i suppose it didnt quite reach me but the next moment i was sucked into a rush of broken water and went downstream below the surface part of the time because i was surprised when i found i could breathe and look about again by good luck id got into the smoothest deepest flow which swept me straight through after a little i saw somebody washing down in a slack and got hold of him i didnt know whether it was gladwyne or lisle but i held on and a sideswing of the current brought us both ashore gladwyne of course must have gone under after being badly damaged among the rocks  theres only one place where he could have landed and i searched it while you were away crestwick said gravely  why did you go in after him nasmyth asked batley you must have seen that you couldnt save him  that batley answered with a curious smile is more than i can clearly tell you and i might suggest that lisles venture is even harder to understand i dont honestly think i owe gladwyne anything but after all we passed for friends and i used to be fond of swimming of course theres a more obvious explanationid lent him a good deal of money and from what ive learned since i may have some difficulty in enforcing my claim on the estate it was natural that i should make an effort to recover the debt  nasmyth did not think that the man had been most strongly influenced by that desire but he addressed crestwick  hadnt you better gather some more branches or driftwood for the fire jim  crestwick disappeared and nasmyth filled his pipe before he turned to batley  now he said i dont want to be offensive but there are two people connected with this affair who must be spared any unnecessary suffering thats a fact you had better recognize  i hardly think you do me justice returned batley looking amused its perfectly plain that theres a mystery behind these recent events one that has some relation to george gladwynes death your idea is that an unscrupulous person of my description might find some profit in probing it  youll never learn the truth ive seen to that  the fact is i dont mean to try  nasmyth was a little astonished at finding himself ready to believe this  then he asked what do you mean to do about your claim on gladwyne  in the first place theres the insurance but i discovered by accident that the company gladwyne had his policy on was the one that had insured his cousin whether theyll be struck by the coincidence and the unusual nature of both accidents and make trouble or not i cant tell but if they pay up therell be an end of the thing failing that ill have to consider my demands might be contested by the gladwyne trusteesthe deal was a little irregular in some respectsbut i parted with the money and im going to make an effort to get it back  how much did clarence owe you  batley told him and nasmyth looked thoughtful  well he requested if you meet with strong opposition come to me before you decide on any course and ill see what can be arranged i dare say therell be some trouble but i know the trusteesand as i said there are people who must be saved all needless pain at any cost  its promised agreed batley ill make things as easy as possible but thats as far as i can go im not rich enough to be recklessly generous  lisle woke soon after this and asked one or two halfintelligible questions but they gave him no information and he went to sleep again then crestwick arrived with more fuel and nasmyth took the first watch while his companions rested he was very cold and now and then he saw batley who had discarded most of his wet clothes wake up for a few moments and shiver once or twice he glanced longingly at the garments spread out round the fire but when he felt them they were still too wet to put on after a while crestwick relieved him and when he awakened dawn was breaking across the black ridges and the rushing river batley had left his place and crestwick began to stride up and down the beach presumably to warm himself to nasmyths satisfaction and surprise lisle spoke to him  you slept pretty sound he said didnt hear me getting some information about what happened out of batley  then you know  yes was the grim answer the things finished theres nothing to be done  nasmyth made a sign of agreement  how do you feel he asked  horribly sore all over left side particularly struck a big boulder and then drove in among a nest of stones before my senses left me tried to get up a while ago but couldnt manage it whats as much to the purpose im feeling hungry  unfortunately theres nothing left for breakfast one of us had better go upstream and look out for the canoes  lisle nodded  thats your dutyi dont envy you make them camp a little higher up it would be better in several ways and id rather be on my feet again before they come here  nasmyth set off jaded and hungry and he was feeling very limp when as he plodded along a high ridge he saw the canoes sliding down the river he had hard work to reach the bank and he shrank from the task before him when the first canoe grounded upon the stones millicent and bella were in it and millicent gazed at the lonely man with fixed anxious eyes he was ragged and looked very weary his face was worn and haggard  where are the rest she asked in a strained voice something has happenedwhat is it  three of them are some miles down the river  three cried millicent in dismay havent you found clarence yet  nasmyth hesitated regarding her compassionately but she made a sign of protest  go on dont keep me in suspense  clarence said nasmyth quietly is dead lisle is rather badly damaged  millicent left the canoe and sat down very white in face upon a neighboring stone in the meanwhile the other canoes had grounded and her companions gathered about her she did not speak to them and some time passed before she turned to nasmyth  tell me all she begged  he briefly related what had happened and there was an impressive silence when he finished then millicent slowly rose  and lisles badly hurt she said we must go on  they relaunched the canoes and nasmyth had no further speech with her for as they floated downriver she sat still and silent in another canoe she was conscious chiefly of an unnerving horror and a sense of contrition clarence was dead and she had been coldly hypercritical hardly treating him as a lover thinking of his failings she blamed herself bitterly in a halfdazed fashion but it was only afterward she realized that she had not been troubled by any very poignant sense of loss  after a while nasmyth said they would land but millicent roused herself to countermand his instructions and eventually they reached batleys camp lisle had got up during the day and he now walked painfully down to the waters edge to meet her when she landed he gravely pressed her hand  im sorry he said simply we did what we could to save him  oh i know she responded nobody could doubt that  then nasmyth landed with provisions and while the men ate two indians strode into the camp and addressed lisle angrily they were curing salmon they said and had left a canoe on the shingle in order to avoid a portage when returning and they had gone in another craft to set some fishtraps in a lower rapid to their surprise they had afterward seen their canoe drifting downstream full of water and badly damaged and they had set off at once to discover who was responsible  lisle offered them some silver currency and after a little chaffering they departed satisfied  now we know how the canoe came to be lying where gladwyne found her he said to nasmyth  then he sought millicent  i think he told her gently we had better go onto stay here would be painful he hesitated ill leave crestwick and an experienced riverjack packer to investigate if you would rather ill stay with them though im afraid i cant get about much  thank you she replied in a voice which had a break in it you must come with us you dont look fit to stand  running the rapid they slid away downriver and once more millicent sat very still thinking confused thoughts until at last they made camp for the night and she crept away to the shelter of her tent a day or two later crestwick and the packer overtook them having discovered nothing and then the party was animated by a strong desire to escape from the river and reach the trail to the settlements as soon as possible further search for gladwyne was useless the flood had swept him away and no one would ever know where his bones lay he had set out on his longest and most mysterious journey leaving only two women to mourn him and of these one who had tried to love him out of duty would by and by forget  on the evening before they left the river lisle stood with millicent looking back up the long reach they had descended they had reached the taller timber and on one bank black firs climbing the hillside stood out against the fading light with a gauzy mistcurtain drawn across their higher ranks the flood slid by glimmering dimly smooth and green and from out of the distance came the throbbing clamor of a rapid  its your last look said lisle well be in the bush tomorrow and i expect to hire a wagon or at least a horse or two in a few days now im sorry i ever brought you here youll be glad to get away  you mustnt blame yourself she told him we have only gratitude for you you have no part in the painful memories  she glanced once more up the valley and then moved back into the shadow of the firs  its all wildly beautiful but its so pitilessi shall never think of it without a shiver  you have made plenty of notes and sketches for the book suggested lisle seeing her distress  the book i dont know that i shall ever finish it i feel cut adrift as if there were no use in working and i hadnt a purpose left first george went and then clarenceso far there was always some one to think ofand now im all alone  she broke out into open sobbing and lisle feeling very sympathetic and half dismayed awkwardly tried to soothe her  im better she said at last it was very foolish but i couldnt help it i think well go back to the others  he gave her his arm for the way was rough but as they approached the camp she stopped a moment amid the shadow and stillness of the great fir trunks  i have done with the riveri think i am afraid of it she confessed cant we get away early tomorrow  lisle said it should be arranged and she turned to him gratefully  one can always rely on you youre just like george was in many ways its curious that whenever im in trouble i think of him  she seemed on the verge of another breakdown and she laid her hand in his for a moment before she went from him hurriedly with a low good night  lisle strolled back to the river and lighted his pipe he had noticed and thought it significant that she spoke more of the brother whom she had lost several years ago than of the lover who had perished recently but from whatever cause it sprung her distress troubled him  his thoughts were presently interrupted by nasmyth  theres a thing id better tell you vernon he said sitting down near by the night you were half drowned i emptied the cache and without making any note of what was in it pitched everything into the river  so i discovered at least when i managed with some trouble to reach the place i knew it was either you or gladwyne and i blamed you  well  ive decided lisle said gravely that you did quite right its the end of that story  then you have abandoned the purpose you had in view  ive been thinking hard and it seems to me that if vernon were with me now the last thing that would please him would be to see the two women suffer he was a big man in every way theres another thinghe left no relations to consider  nasmyth laid a hand on his shoulder in a very expressive way  i felt all along that youd come to look at it like that  but theres batley he has some suspicions  i can silence him promised nasmyth the man has his good points after all  thats so lisle agreed still ill come straight across to england and tackle him if you fail if its a question of money you can count me inive been prospering lately he rose and knocked out his pipe thats the last word on the matter  they went back to camp and starting soon after sunrise the next morning they reached a settlement on the railroad after a comparatively easy journey and that evening lisle stood with a heavy heart beside the track while the big cars moved away his eyes fixed on a womans figure that leaned out from a vestibule platform waving a hand to him  after that he went back to his work with crestwick and nearly twelve months had passed when he sent a cable to england and started for that country a day after receiving the answer crestwick insisted on going with him  youll no doubt want my support again he grinned theres an office i mean to rob nasmyth of if i can  it was evening when they drove into sight of millicents house lisles heart throbbed painfully fast as he got down but he was not kept waiting millicent was standing in her drawingroom and as he came in she held out her hand to him  you answered my message he said seizing it you must have guessed what i meant when i asked if i might come across  yes she confessed softly i knew and i told you to come  he still held her a little away from him as he gave a quick glance at the refined and artistic appointments of the room  theres a good deal you will have to give up he told her youre not afraid of our new and rugged country but it has something to offerand we need such people as you  its going to be a great country before very long she answered gravely and i have no dread of it now buti gave my dearesti think it owes me something in return  he drew her masterfully into his arms  it discharges all its debts you must teach me how to pay you back in full measure thats my one big task youre giving so much freely but of course im gladi dont want duty  this isnt duty she smiled its love  the end
