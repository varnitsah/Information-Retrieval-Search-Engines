75730780	the shadow on the dial and other essays  by ambrose bierce  edited by s o howes  copyright 1909     a note by the author  it was expected that this book would be included in my collected works now in course of publication but unforeseen delay in the date of publication has made this impossible the selection of its contents was not made by me but the choice has my approval and the publication my authority  ambrose bierce  washington d c march 14 1909     preface  the note of prophecy it sounds sharp and clear in many a vibrant line in many a sonorous sentence of the essays herein collected for the first time written for various californian journals and periodicals and extending over a period of more than a quarter of a century these opinions and reflections express the refined judgment of one who has seen not as through a glass darkly the trend of events and having seen the portentous effigy that we are making of the liberty our fathers created he has written of it in english that is the despair of those who thinking less clearly escape not the pitfalls of diffuseness and obscurity for mr bierce as did flaubert holds that the right word is necessary for the conveyance of the right thought and his sense of word values rarely betrays him into error but with an oddi might almost say perverseindifference to his own reputation he has allowed these writings to lie fallow in the old files of papers while others possessing the knack of publicity years later tilled the soil with some degree of success president hadley of yale university before the candlelight club of denver january 8 1900 advanced as novel and original ostracism as an effective punishment of social highwaymen this address attracted widespread attention and though professor hadleys remedy has not been generally adopted it is regarded as his own mr bierce wrote in the examiner january 20 1895 as follows we are plundered because we have no particular aversion to plunderers  the predatory rich to use mr steads felicitous term put their hands into our pockets because they know that virtually none of us will refuse to take their hands in our own afterwards in friendly salutation if notorious rascality entailed social outlawry the only rascals would be those properlyand proudlybelonging to the criminal class  again edwin markham has attracted to himself no little attention by advocating the application of the golden rule in temporal affairs as a cure for evils arising from industrial discontent in this he too has been anticipated mr bierce writing in the examiner march 25 1894 said when a people would avert want and strife or having them would restore plenty and peace this noble commandment offers the only meansall other plans for safety and relief are as vain as dreams and as empty as the crooning of fools and behold here it is all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them  rev charles m sheldon created a nine days wonder or rather a seven by conducting for a week a newspaper as he conceived christ would have done some years previously june 28 1896 to be exact the author of these essays wrote that is my ultimate and determining test of rightwhat under the circumstances would christ have donethe christ of the new testament not the christ of the commentators theologians priests and parsons  i am sure that mr bierce does not begrudge any of these gentlemen the acclaim they have received by enunciating his ideas and i mention the instances here merely to forestall the filing of any other claim to priority  the essays cover a wide range of subjects embracing among other things government dreams writers of dialect and dogs and always the authors point of view is fresh original and nonphilistine whether one cares to agree with him or not one will find vast entertainment in his wit that illuminates with lightning flashes all he touches other qualities i forbear allusion to having already encroached too much upon the time of the reader  s o howes     the shadow on the dial     i  there is a deal of confusion and uncertainty in the use of the words socialist anarchist and nihilist even the 1st himself commonly knows with as little accuracy what he is as the rest of us know why he is the socialist believes that most human affairs should be regulated and managed by the statethe governmentthat is to say the majority our own system has many socialistic features and the trend of republican government is all that way the anarchist is the kind of lunatic who believes that all crime is the effect of laws forbidding itas the pig that breaks into the kitchen garden is created by the dog that chews its ear the anarchist favors abolition of all law and frequently belongs to an organization that secures his allegiance by solemn oaths and dreadful penalties nihilism is a name given by turgenieff to the general body of russian discontent which finds expression in antagonizing authority and killing authorities constructive politics would seem as yet to be a cut above the nihilists intelligence he is essentially a destructionary he is so diligently engaged in unweeding the soil that he has not given a thought to what he will grow there nihilism may be described as a policy of assassination tempered by reflections upon siberia american sympathy with it is the offspring of an unholy union between the tongue of a liar and the ear of a dupe  upon examination it will be seen that political dissent when it takes any form more coherent than the mere brute dissatisfaction of a mind that does not know what it wants to want finds expression in one of but two waysin socialism or in anarchism whatever methods one may think will best substitute for a system gradually evolved from our needs and our natures a system existing only in the minds of dreamers one is bound to choose between these two dreams yet such is the intellectual delinquency of many who most strenuously denounce the system that we have that we not infrequently find the same man advocating in one breath socialism in the next anarchism indeed few of these sons of darkness know that even as coherent dreams the two are incompatible with anarchy triumphant the socialist would be a thousand years further from realization of his hope than he is today set up socialism on a monday and on tuesday the country would be en fÃªte gaily hunting down anarchists there would be little difficulty in trailing them for they have not so much sense as a deer which running down the wind sends its telltale fragrance on before  socialism and anarchism are the two extremes of political thought they are parts of the same dung in the sense that the terminal points of a road are parts of the same road between them about midway lies the system that we have the happiness to endure it is a blend of socialism and anarchism in about equal parts all that is not one is the other everything serving the common interest or looking to the welfare of the whole people is socialistic in the strictest sense of the word as understood by the socialist whatever tends to private advantage or advances an individual or class interest at the expense of a public one is anarchistic cooperation is socialism competition is anarchism competition carried to its logical conclusion which only cooperation prevents or can prevent would leave no law in force no property possible no life secure  of course the words cooperation and competition are not here used in a merely industrial and commercial sense they are intended to cover the whole field of human activity two voices singing a duetthat is cooperationsocialism two voices singing each a different tune and trying to drown each otherthat is competitionanarchism each is a law unto itselfthat is to say it is lawless everything that ought to be done the socialist hopes to do by associated endeavor as an army wins battles anarchism is socialistic in its means only by cooperation it tries to render cooperation impossiblecombines to kill combination its method says to its purpose thou fool     ii  everything foretells the doom of authority the killing of kings is no new industry it is as ancient as the race always and everywhere persons in high place have been the assassins prey we have ourselves lost three presidents by murder and will doubtless lose many another before the book of american history is closed if anything is new in this activity of the regicide it is found in the choice of victims the contemporary avenger slays not the merely great but the good and the inoffensivean american president who had struck the chains from millions of slaves a russian czar who against the will and work of his own powerful nobles had freed their serfs a french president from whom the french people had received nothing but good a powerless austrian empress whose weight of sorrows touched the world to tears a blameless italian king beloved of his people such is a part of the recent record of the regicide whose every entry is a tale of infamy unrelieved by one circumstance of justice decency or good intention  and the great brazilian liberator died in exile  this recent uniformity of malevolence in the choice of victims is not without significance it points unmistakably to two facts first that the selections are made not by the assassins themselves but by some central control inaccessible to individual preference and unaffected by the fortunes of its instruments second that there is a constant purpose to manifest an antagonism not to any individual ruler but to rulers not to any system of government but to government it is a war not upon those in authority but upon authority the issue is defined the alignment made the battle set chaos against order anarchy against law  m vaillant the french gentleman who lacked a good opinion of the law but was singularly rich in the faith that by means of gunpowder and flying nails humanity could be brought into a nearer relation with reason righteousness and the will of god is said to have been nearly devoid of a nose of this affliction m vaillant made but slight account as was natural seeing that but for a brief season did he need even so much of nose as remained to him yet before its effacement by premature disruption of his own petard it must have had a certain value to himhe would not wantonly have renounced it and had he foreseen its extinction by the bomb the iron views of that controversial device would probably have been denied expression albeit so say the scientists doomed to eventual elimination from the scheme of being and to the anarchist even now something of an accusing conscience the nose is indubitably an excellent thing in man  this brings us to consideration of the human nose as a measure of human happinessnot the size of it but its numbers its frequent or infrequent occurrence upon the human face we have grown so accustomed to the presence of this feature that we take it as a matter of course its absence is one of the most notable phenomena of our observationan occasion long to be remembered as the society reporter hath it yet abundant testimony showeth that but two or three centuries ago noseless men and women were so common all over europe as to provoke but little comment when seen and in their disagreeable way heard they abounded in all the various walks of life there were honored burgomasters without noses wealthy merchants great scholars artists teachers amongst the humbler classes nasal destitution was almost as frequent as pecuniaryin the humblest of all the most common of all writing in the thirteenth century salsius mentions the retainers and servants of certain suabian noblemen as having hardly a whole ear among themfor until a comparatively recent period mans tenure of his ears was even more precarious than that of his nose in 1436 when a bavarian woman agnes bemaurian wife of duke albert the pious was dropped off the bridge at prague she persisted in rising to the surface and trying to escape so the executioner gave himself the trouble to put a long pole into her hair and hold her under a contemporary account of the matter hints that her disorderly behavior at so solemn a moment was due to the pain caused by removal of her nose but as her execution was by order of her own father it seems more probable that the extreme penalty of the law was not imposed without a doubt though possession of a nose was an uncommon and rather barren distinction in those days among persons designated to assist the executioner as the condemned were civilly called nor as already said was it any too common among persons not as yet consecrated to that service few says salsius have two noses and many have none  mans firmer grasp upon his nose in this our day and generation is not altogether due to invention of the handkerchief the genesis and development of his right to his own nose have been accompanied with a corresponding advance in the possessory rights all along the line of his belongingshis ears his fingers and toes his skin his bones his wife and her young his clothes and his laboreverything that is and that once was not his in europe and america today these things can not be taken away from even the humblest and poorest without somebody wanting to know the reason why in every decade the nation that is most powerful upon the seas incurs voluntarily a vast expense of blood and treasure in suppressing a slave trade which in no way is injurious to her interests nor to the interests of any but the slaves  so freedom broadens slowly down and today even the lowliest incapable of all natures aborted has a nose that he dares to call his own and bite off at his own sweet will unfortunately with an unthinkable fatuity we permit him to be told that but for the very agencies that have put him in possession he could successfully assert a godgiven and worldold right to the noses of others at present the honest fellow is mainly engaged in refreshing himself upon his own nose consuming that comestible with avidity and precision but the vaillants ravechols mosts and willeys are pointing his appetite to other snouts than his and inspiring him with rhinophagic ambition meantime the rest of us are using those imperiled organs to snore with  tis a fine resonant and melodious snore but it is not going to last there is to be a rude awakening we shall one day get our eyes open to the fact that scoundrels like vaillant are neither few nor distant we shall learn that our blind dependence upon the magic of words is a fatuous error that the fortuitous arrangement of consonants and vowels which we worship as liberty is of slight efficacy in disarming the lunatic brandishing a bomb liberty indeed the murderous wretch loves it a deal better than we and wants more of it liberty one almost sickens of the word so quick and glib it is on every lipso destitute of meaning  there is no such thing as abstract liberty it is not even thinkable if you ask me do you favor liberty i reply liberty for whom to do what just now i distinctly favor the liberty of the law to cut off the noses of anarchists caught redhanded or redtongued if they go in for mutilation let them feel what it is like if they are not satisfied with the way that things have been going on since the wife of duke albert the pious was held under water with a pole and since the servitors of the suabian nobleman cherished their vestigial ears it is to be presumed that they favor reversion to that happy state there is grave objection but if we must we will let us begin with moderation by reverting them  i favor mutilation for anarchists convicted of killing or inciting to killmutilation followed by death for those who merely deny the right and expediency of law plain mutilationwhich might advantageously take the form of removal of the tongue  why not where is the injustice surely he who denies mens right to make laws will not invoke the laws that they have wickedly made that were to say that they must not protect themselves yet are bound to protect him what if i beat him will he call the useless and mischievous constabulary if i draw out his tongue shall he in the signlanguage demand it back and failing of restitution for surely i should cut it clean away shall he have the law on methe naughty law instrument of the oppressor why that goes neare to be fonny  two human beings can not live together in peace without lawslaws innumerable everything that either in consideration of the others wish or welfare abstains from is inhibited by law tacit or expressed if there were in all the world none but theyif neither had come with any sense of obligation toward the other both clean from creation with nothing but brains to direct their conductevery hour would evolve an understanding that is to say a law every act would suggest one they would have to agree not to kill nor harm each other they must arrange their work and all their activities to secure the best advantage these arrangements agreements understandingswhat are they but laws to live without law is to live alone every family is a miniature state with a complicate system of laws a supreme authority and subordinate authorities down to the latest babe and as he who is loudest in demanding liberty for himself is sternest in denying it to others you may confidently go to the maison vaillant or the mosthaus for a flawless example of the iron hand  laws of the state are as faulty and as faultily administered as those of the family most of them have to be speedily and repeatedly amended many repealed and of those permitted to stand the greater number fall into disuse and are forgotten those who have to be entrusted with the duty of administering them have all the limitations of intelligence and defects of character by which the rest of us also are distinguished from the angels in the wise governor the just judge the honest sheriff or the patient constable we have as rare a phenomenon as the faultless father the good god has not given us a special kind of men upon whom to devolve the duty of seeing to the observance of the understandings that we call laws like all else that men do this work is badly done the best that we can hope for through all the failures the injustice the disheartening damage to individual rights and interests is a fairly good general result enabling us to walk abroad among our fellows unafraid to meet even the tribesmen from another valley without too imminent peril of braining and evisceration of that small security the anarchist would deprive us but without that nothing is of value and we shall be willing to renounce all let us begin by depriving ourselves of the anarchist  our system of civilization being the natural outgrowth of our wretched moral and intellectual natures is open to criticism and subject to revision our laws being of human origin are faulty and their application is disappointing dissent dissatisfaction deprecation proposals for a better system fortified with better laws more intelligently administeredthese are permissible and should be welcome the socialist when he is not carried away by zeal to pool issues with the anarchist has that in him which it does us good to hear he may be wrong b all else yet right in showing us wherein we ourselves are wrong anyhow his mission is amendment and so long as his paths are peace he has the right to walk therein exhorting as he goes the french communist who does not preach petroleum and it rectified is to be regarded with more than amusement more than compassion there is room for him and his fad there are hospitable ears for his boast that jesus christ would have been a communist if there had been communes they really did not know everything down in judee but for the anarchist whose aim is not amendment but destructionnot welfare to the race but mischief to a part of itnot happiness for the future but revenge for the pastfor that animal there should be no close season for that savage no reservation society has not the right to grant life to one who denies the right to live the protagonist of reversion to the regime of lacking noses should lack a nose  it is difficult to say if the bombthrower actual or potential is greater as scoundrel or fool suppose his aim is to compel concession by terror can not the brute observe at each of his exploits a tightening of the reins of power through the necessity of guarding against him the mildest governments are becoming despotic the most despotic more despotic does he suppose that the rulers of the earth are silly enough to make concessions that will not insure their safety can he give them security     iii  of all the wild asses that roam the plain the wildest wild ass that roams the plain is indubitably the one that lifts his voice and heel against that socialism known as public ownership of public utilities on the ground of principle there may be honest and in some degree intelligent opposition on the ground of expediency many persons whom it is a pleasure to respect believe that a government railway for example would be less efficiently managed than the same railway in private hands and that political dangers lurk in the proposal so enormously to increase the number of federal employes as government ownership of railways would entail they think in other words that the policy is inexpedient it is a duty to reason with them which as a rule one can do without being insulted but the chap who greets the proposal with a howl of derision as socialism is not a respectable opponent eyes he has but he sees not earsoh very abundant earsbut he hears not the still small voice of history nor the still smaller voice of common sense  obviously to those who having eyes do see public ownership of anything is a step in the direction of socialism for perfect socialism means public ownership of everything but principle has nothing to do with it the principle of public ownership is already accepted and established it has no visible opponents except in the camp of the anarchists and fewer of them are visible there than soap and water would reveal antagonists of the principle of socialism lost their fight when the first human government held the dedicatory exercises of a cave of legislation since then the only question about the matter has been how far the extension of socialism is expedient some would draw the limiting line at one place some at another but only a fool thinks there can be government without it or good government without a great deal of it the fact that we have always had a great deal of it yet never had good government affirms nothing that it is worth while to consider the wordworn example of our postal department is only one of a thousand instances of pure socialism if it did not exist how bitter an opposition a proposal to establish it would evoke from adversaries of the red rag the government builds and operates bridges with general assent but as the late general walker pointed out it might under some circumstances be more economical or better otherwise to build and operate a ferry boat which is a floating bridge but that would be opposed as rank socialism  the truth is that the men and women of principle are a pretty dangerous class generally speakingand they are generally speaking it is they that hamper us in every war it is they who preventing concentration and regulation of unabolishable evils promote their distribution and liberty moral principles are pretty good thingsfor the young and those not well grounded in goodness if one have an impediment in his thought or is otherwise unequal to emergencies as they arise it is safest to be provided beforehand with something to refer to in order that a right decision may be made without taking thought but spirits of a purer fire prefer to decide each question as it comes up and to act upon the merits of the case unbound and unpledged with a quick intelligence a capable conscience and a habit of doing right automatically one has little need to burden ones mind and memory with a set of solemn principles formulated by owlish philosophers who do not happen to know that what is right is merely what in the long run and with regard to the greater number of cases is expedient principle is not always an infallible guide for illustration it is not always expedientthat is for the good of all concernedto tell the truth to be entirely just or merciful to pay a debt i can conceive a case in which it would be right to assassinate ones neighbor suppose him to be a desperate scoundrel of a chemist who has devised a means of setting the atmosphere afire the man who should go through life on an inflexible line of principle would border his path with a havoc of human happiness  what one may think perfect one may not always think desirable by perfect one may mean merely complete and the word was so used in my reference to socialism i am not myself an advocate of perfect socialism but as to government ownership of railways there is doubtless a good deal to be said on both sides one argument in its favor appears decisive under a system subject to popular control the law of gravitation would be shorn of its preeminence as a means of removing personal property from the baggage car and so far as it is applicable to that work might even be repealed     iv  when m casimirperier resigned the french presidency there were those who regarded the act as weak cowardly undutiful and otherwise censurable it seems to me the act not of a feeble man but of a strong onenot that of a coward but that of a gentleman indeed i hardly know where to look in history for an act more entirely gratifying to my sense of the fitness of things than this dignified notification to mankind that in consenting to serve ones country one does not relinquish the right to decent treatmentto immunity from factious opposition and abuseto at least as much civil consideration as is due from the church to the devil  m casimirperier did not seek the presidency of the french republic it was thrust upon him against his protestations by an apparently almost unanimous mandate of the french people in an emergency which it was thought that he was the best man to meet that he met it with modesty and courage was testified without dissent that he afterward did anything to forfeit the confidence and respect that he then inspired is not true and nobody believes it true yet in his letter of resignation he said and said truly  for the last six months a campaign of slander and insult has been going on against the army magistrates parliament and hierarchical chief of state and this license to disseminate social hatred continues to be called the liberty of thought  and with a dignity to which it seems strange that any one could be insensible he added  the respect and ambition which i entertain for my country will not allow me to acknowledge that the servants of the country and he who represents it in the presence of foreign nations may be insulted every day  these are noble words have we any warrant for demanding or expecting that men of clean life and character will devote themselves to the good of ingrates who pay and ingrates who permit them to pay in flung mud it is hardly credible that among even those persons most infatuated by contemplation of their own merit as pointed out by their thrifty sycophants the liberty of thought has been carried to that extreme the right of the state to demand the sacrifice of the citizens life is a doctrine as old as the patriotism that concedes it but the right to require him to forego his good namethat is something new under the sun from nothing but the dunghill of modern democracy could so noxious a plant have sprung  perhaps in laying down my functions said m casimirperier i shall have marked out a path of duty to those who are solicitous for the dignity power and good name of france in the world  we may be permitted to hope that the lesson is wider than france and more lasting than the french republic it is time that not only france but all other countries with popular institutions should learn that if they wish to command the services of men of honor they must accord them honorable treatment the rule now is for the party to which they belong to give them a halfhearted support while suffering all other parties to slander and insult them the action of the president of the french republic in these disgusting circumstances is exceptional and unusual only in respect of his courage in expressly resenting his wrong everywhere the unreasonable complaint is heard that good men will not go into politics everywhere the ignorant and malignant masses and their no less malignant and hardly less ignorant leaders and spokesmen having sown the wind of reasonless obstruction and partisan vilification are reaping the whirlwind of misrule so far as concerns the public service gentlemen are mostly on a strike against introduction of the mudmachine this highminded political workman casimirperier never showed to so noble advantage as in gathering up his tools and walking out  it may be and a million times has been urged that abstention from activity in public affairs by men of brains and character leaves the business of government in the hands of the incapable and the vicious in whose hands pray in a republic does it logically belong what does the theory of representative government affirm what is the lesson of every netherward extension of the suffrage what do we mean by permitting it to broaden slowly down to lower and lower intelligences and moralitieswhat but that stupidity and vice equally with virtue and wisdom are entitled to a voice in political affairs a finger in the public pie  a person that is fit to vote is fit to be voted for he who is competent for the high and difficult function of choosing an officer of the state is competent to serve the state as an officer to deny him the right is illogical and unjust participation in government can not be at the same time a privilege and a duty and he who claims it as a privilege must not speak of anothers renunciation whereby himself is more highly privileged as shirking with every retirement from politics increased power passes to those who remain shall they protest shall they also who have retired who else is to protest the complaint of incivism would be more rational if there were some one by whom it could reasonably be made  my advice to slandered officials has ever been resign the public officials of this favored country heaven be thanked are infrequently slandered they are as a rule so bad that calumniation is a compliment our best men with here and there an exception have been driven out of public life or made afraid to enter it even our spasmodic efforts at reform fail ludicrously for lack of leaders unaffiliated with the thing to be reformed unless attracted by the salary why should a gentleman aspire to the presidency of the united states during his canvass and he is expected to run not merely to stand he will have from his own party a support that should make him blush and from all the others an opposition that will stick at nothing to accomplish his satisfactory defamation after his election his partition and allotment of the loaves and fishes will estrange an important and thenceforth implacable faction of his following without appeasing the animosity of any one else and during his entire service his sky will be dark with a flight of dead cats at the finish of his term the utmost that he can expect in the way of reward not expressible in terms of the national currency is that not much more than onehalf of his countrymen will believe him a scoundrel to the end of their days     v  the kind of government that we have seems to me one of the worst kinds extant a government that does not protect life is a flat failure no matter what else it may do life being almost universally regarded as the most precious possession its security is the first and highest essentialnot the life of him who takes life but the life which is exposed defenceless to his hateful hand in no country in the world civilized or savage is life so insecure as in this in no country in the world is murder held in so light reprobation in no battle of modern times have so many lives been taken as are lost annually in the united states through public indifference to the crime of homicidethrough disregard of law through bad government if american selfgovernment with its ten thousand homicides a year is good government there is no such thing as bad selfgovernment what monstrous nonsense who governs himself needs no government has no governor is not governed if government has any meaning it means the restraint of the many by the fewthe subordination of numbers to brains it means the determined denial to the masses of the right to cut their own throats it means the grasp and control of all the social forces and material enginerya vigilant censorship of the press a firm hand upon the church keen supervision of public meetings and public amusements command of the railroads telegraph and all means of communication it means in short the ability to make use of all the beneficent influences of enlightenment for the good of the people and to array all the powers of civilization against civilizations natural enemiesthe people government like this has a thousand defects but it has one merit it is government  despotism yes it is the despotisms of the world that have been the conservators of civilization it is the despot who most powerful for mischief is alone powerful for good it is conceded that government is necessaryeven by the fierce democracies that madly renounce it but in so far as government is not despotic it is not government in europe for the last one hundred years the tendency of all government has been liberalization the history of european politics during that period is a history of renunciation by the rulers and assumption by the ruled sovereign after sovereign has surrendered prerogative after prerogative the nobility privilege after privilege mark the result society honeycombed with treason property menaced with partition assassination studied as a science and practiced as an art everywhere powerful secret organizations sworn to demolish the social fabric that the slow centuries have but just erected and unmindful that themselves will perish in the wreck no heart in europe can beat tranquilly under clean linen such is the gratitude such is the wisdom such the virtue of the masses in 1863 alexander ii of russia freed 25000000 serfs in 1879 they had killed him and all joined the conspirators  that ancient and various device a republican form of government appears to be too good for all the peoples of the earth excepting one it is partly successful in switzerland in france and america where the majority is composed of persons having dark understandings and criminal instincts it has broken down in our case as in every case the momentum of successful revolution carried us too far we rebelled against tyranny and having overthrown it overthrew also the governmental form in which it had happened to be manifest in their anger and their triumph our good old granthers acted somewhat in the spirit of the irishman who cudgeled the dead snake until nothing was left of it in order to make it sinsible of its desthroction they meant it all too the honest souls for a long time after the setting up of the republic the republic meant active hatred to kings nobles aristocracies it was held and rightly held that a nobleman could not breathe in americathat he left his title and his privileges on the ship that brought him over do we observe anything of that in this generation on the landing of a foreign king prince or noblemaneven a miserable knightdo we not execute sycophantic genuflexions are not our newspapers full of flamboyant descriptions and qualming adulation nay does not our president himselfsuccessor to washington and jeffersongreet and entertain the nations guest is not every american young woman crazy to mate with a male of title does all this represent no retrogressionis it not the backward movement of the shadow on the dial doubtless the republican idea has struck strong roots into the soil of the two americas but he who rightly considers the tendencies of events the causes that bring them about and the consequences that flow from them will not be hot to affirm the perpetuity of republican institutions in the western hemisphere between their inception and their present stage of development there is scarcely the beat of a pendulum and already by corruption and lawlessness the people of both continents with all their diversities of race and character have shown themselves about equally unfit to become a nation of scoundrels all that any people needs is opportunity and what we are pleased to call by the impossible name of selfgovernment supplies it  the capital defect of republican government is inability to repress internal forces tending to disintegration it does not take long for a selfgoverned people to learn that it is not really governedthat an agreement enforcible by nobody but the parties to it is not binding we are learning this very rapidly we set aside our laws whenever we please the sovereign powerthe tribunal of ultimate jurisdictionis a mob if the mob is large enough it need not be very large even if composed of vicious tramps it may do as it will it may destroy property and life it may without proof of guilt inflict upon individuals torments unthinkable by fire and flaying mutilations that are nameless it may call men women and children from their beds and beat them to death with cudgels in the light of day it may assail the very strongholds of law in the heart of a populous city and assassinate prisoners of whose guilt it knows nothing and these thingsobserve o victims of kingsare habitually done one would as well be at the mercy of ones sovereign as of ones neighbor  for generations we have been charming ourselves with the magic of words when menaced by some exceptionally monstrous form of the tyranny of numbers we have closed our eyes and murmured liberty when armed anarchists threaten to quench the fires of civilization in a sea of blood we prate of the protective power of free speech if       girt about by friends or foes      a man may speak the thing he will  we fondly fancy that the thing he will speak is harmlessthat immunity disarms his tongue of its poison his thought of its infection with a fatuity that would be incredible without the testimony of observation we hold that an anarchist free to go about making proselytes free to purchase arms free to drill and parade and encourage his dupes with a demonstration of their numbers and power is less mischievous than an anarchist with a shut mouth a weaponless hand and under surveillance of the police the anarchist himself is persuaded of the superiority of our plan of dealing with him he likes it and comes over in quantity inpesting the political atmosphere with the sweltered venom engendered by centuries of oppressioncomes over here where he is not oppressed and sets up as oppressor his preferred field of malefaction is the country that is most nearly anarchical he comes here partly to better himself under our milder institutions partly to secure immunity while conspiring to destroy them there is thunder in europe but if the storm ever break it is in america that the lightning will fall for here is a great vortex into which the decivilizing agencies are pouring without obstruction here gather the eagles to the feast for the quarry is defenceless here is no power in government no government here an enemy of order is thought to be least dangerous when suffered to preach and arm in peace and here is nothing between him and his task of supervisionno pampered soldiery to repress his rising no iron authority to lay him by the heels the militia is fraternal the magistracy elective europe may hold out a little longer the great powers may make what stageplay they will but they are not maintaining their incalculable armaments for aggression upon one another for protection from one another nor for fun these vast forces are purely constabularcreatures and creators of discontentphenomena of decivilization eventually they will fraternize with disorder or become themselves praetorian guards more dangerous than the perils that have called them into existence  it is easy to forecast the first stages of the ends approach rioting disaffection of constabulary and troops subversion of the government a policy of decapitation upthrust of the serviceable anarchist his prompt effacement by his victorious ally and natural enemy the socialist free minting and printing of moneyto every citizen a shoulderload of the latter to the printers a ton each divided counsels pandemonium the man on horseback gusts of grape   formerly the bearer of evil tidings was only slain he is now ignored the gods kept their secrets by telling them to cassandra whom no one would believe i do not expect to be heeded the crust of a volcano is electric the fumes are narcotic the combined sensation is delightful no end i have looked at the dial of civilization i tell you the shadow is going back that is of small importance to men of leisure with winedipped wreaths upon their heads they do not care to know     civilization     i  the question does civilization civilize is a fine example of petitio principii and decides itself in the affirmative for civilization must needs do that from the doing of which it has its name but it is not necessary to suppose that he who propounds is either unconscious of his lapse in logic or desirous of digging a pitfall for the feet of those who discuss i take it he simply wishes to put the matter in an impressive way and relies upon a certain degree of intelligence in the interpretation  concerning uncivilized peoples we know but little except what we are told by travelerswho speaking generally can know very little but the fact of uncivilization as shown in externals and irrelevances and are moreover greatly given to lying from the savages we hear very little judging them in all things by our own standards in default of a knowledge of theirs we necessarily condemn disparage and belittle one thing that civilization certainly has not done is to make us intelligent enough to understand that the opposite of a virtue is not necessarily a vice because we do not like the taste of one another it does not follow that the cannibal is a person of depraved appetite because as a rule we have but one wife and several mistresses each it is not certain that polygamy is everywherenor for that matter anywhereeither wrong or inexpedient our habit of wearing clothes does not prove that conscience of the body the sense of shame is charged with a divine mandate for like the conscience of the spirit it is the creature of what it seems to create it comes to the habit of wearing clothes and for those who hold that the purpose of civilization is morality it may be said that peoples which are the most nearly naked are in our sense the most nearly moral because the brutality of the civilized slave owners and dealers created a conquering sentiment against slavery it is not intelligent to assume that slavery is a maleficent thing amongst oriental peoples for example where the slave is not oppressed  some of these same orientals whom we are pleased to term halfcivilized have no regard for truth takest thou me for a christian dog said one of them that i should be the slave of my word so far as i can perceive the christian dog is no more the slave of his word than the true believer and i think the savageallowing for the fact that his inveracity has dominion over fewer thingsas great a liar as either of them for my part i do not know what in all circumstances is right or wrong but i know if right it is at least stupid to judge an uncivilized people by the standards of morality and intelligence set up by civilized ones an infinitesimal proportion of civilized men do not and there is much to be said for civilization if they are the product of it  life in civilized countries is so complex that men there have more ways to be good than savages have and more to be bad more to be happy and more to be miserable and in each way to be good or bad their generally superior knowledgetheir knowledge of more thingsenables them to commit greater excesses than the savage could widi the same opportunity the civilized philanthropist wreaks upon his fellow creatures a ranker philanthropy the civilized scoundrel a sturdier rascality andsplendid triumph of enlightenmentthe two characters are in civilisation commonly combined in one person  i know of no savage custom or habit of thought which has not its mate in civilized countries for every mischievous or absurd practice of the natural man i can name you a dozen of the unnatural which are essentially the same and nearly every custom of our barbarian ancestors in historic times survives in some form today we make ourselves look formidable in battlefor that matter we fight our women paint their faces we feel it obligatory to dress more or less alike inventing the most ingenious reasons for it and actually despising and persecuting those who do not care to conform within the memory of living persons bearded men were stoned in the streets and a clergyman in new york who wore his beard as christ wore his was put into jail and variously persecuted till he died we bury our dead instead of burning them yet every cemetery is set thick with urns as there are no ashes for the urns we do not trouble ourselves to make them hollow and we say their use is emblematic when following the bent of our ancestral instincts we go on age after age in the performance of some senseless act which once had a use and meaning we excuse ourselves by calling it symbolism our symbols are merely survivals we have theology and patriotism we have all the savages superstition we propitiate and ingratiate by means of gifts we shake hands all these and hundreds of others of our practices are distinctly in their nature and by their origin savage  civilization does not i think make the race any better it makes men know more and if knowledge makes them happy it is useful and desirable the one purpose of every sane human being is to be happy no one can have any other motive than that there is no such thing as unselfishness we perform the most generous and selfsacrificing acts because we should be unhappy if we did not we move on lines of least reluctance whatever tends to increase the beggarly sum of human happiness is worth having nothing else has any value  the cant of civilization fatigues civilization is a fine and beautiful structure it is as picturesque as a gothic cathedral but it is built upon the bones and cemented with the blood of those whose part in all its pomp is that and nothing more it cannot be reared in the generous tropics for there the people will not contribute their blood and bones the proposition that the average american workingman or european peasant is better off than the south sea islander lolling under a palm and drunk with overeating will not bear a moments examination  it is we scholars and gentlemen that are better off  it is admitted that the south sea islander in a state of nature is overmuch addicted to the practice of eating human flesh but concerning that i submit first that he likes it second that those who supply it are mostly dead it is upon his enemies that he feeds and these he would kill anyhow as we do ours in civilized enlightened and christian countries where cannibalism has not yet established itself wars are as frequent and destructive as among the maneaters the untitled savage knows at least why he goes killing whereas the private soldier is commonly in black ignorance of the apparent cause of quarrelof the actual cause always their shares in the fruits of victory are about equal the chief takes all the dead the general all the glory moreover it costs more human life to supply a christian gentleman with food than it does a cannibalwith food alone board if you could figure out the number of lives that his lodging clothing amusements and accomplishment cost the sum would startle happily he does not pay it considering human lives as having value cannibalism is undoubtedly the more economical system     ii  transplanted institutions grow but slowly and civilization can not be put into a ship and carried across an ocean the history of this country is a sequence of illustrations of these truths it was settled by civilized men and women from civilized countries yet after two and a half centuries with unbroken communication with the mother systems it is still imperfectly civilized in learning and letters in art and the science of government america is but a faint and stammering echo of england  for nearly all that is good in our american civilization we are indebted to england the errors and mischiefs are of our own creation we have originated little because there is little to originate but we have unconsciously reproduced many of the discredited and abandoned systems of former ages and other countriesreceiving them at second hand but making them ours by the sheer strength and immobility of the national belief in their newness newness why it is not possible to make an experiment in government in art in literature in sociology or in morals that has not been made over and over and over again fools talk of clear and simple remedies for this and that evil afflicting the commonwealth if a proposed remedy is obvious and easily intelligible it is condemned in the naming for it is morally certain to have been tried a thousand times in the history of the world and had it been effective men ere now would have forgotten from mere disuse how to produce the evil it cured  there are clear and simple remedies for nothing in medicine there has been discovered but a single specific in politics not one the interests moral and natural of a community in our highly differentiated civilization are so complex intricate delicate and interdependent that you can not touch one without affecting all it is a familiar truth that no law was ever passed that did not have unforeseen results but of these results by far the greater number are never recognized as of its creation the best that can be said of any measure is that the sum of its perceptible benefits seems so to exceed the sum of its perceptible evils as to constitute a balance of advantage yet the magnificent innocence of the statesman or philosopher to whose understanding the whole matter lies in a nutshellwho thinks he can formulate a practical political or social policy within the four corners of an epigramwho fears nothing because he knows nothingis constantly to the fore with a simple specific for ills whose causes are complex constant and inscrutable to the understanding of this creature a difficulty well ignored is half overcome so he buttons up his eyes and assails the problems of life with the divine confidence of a blind pig traversing a labyrinth  the glories of england are our glories she can achieve nothing that our fathers did not help to make possible to her the learning the power the refinement of a great nation are not the growth of a century but of many centuries each generation builds upon the work of the preceding for untold ages our ancestors wrought to rear that revered pile the civilization of england and shall we now try to belittle the mighty structure because other though kindred hands are laying the top courses while we have elected to found a new tower in another land the american eulogist of civilization who is not proud of his heritage in englands glory is unworthy to enjoy his lesser heritage in the lesser glory of his own country  the english are undoubtedly our intellectual superiors and as the virtues are solely the product of educationa rogue being only a dunce considered from another point of viewthey are our moral superiors likewise why should they not be it is a land not of log and pineboard schoolhouses grudgingly erected and containing schools supported by such niggardly tax levies as a sparse and hardhanded population will consent to pay but of ancient institutions splendidly endowed by the state and by centuries of private benefaction as a means of dispensing formulated ignorance our boasted public school system is not without merit it spreads it out sufficiently thin to give everyone enough to make him a more competent fool than he would have been without it but to compare it with that which is not the creature of legislation acting with malice aforethought but the unnoted outgrowth of ages is to be ridiculous it is like comparing the laidout town of a western prairie its rightangled streets prim cottages built on the installment plan and its wooden abc shops with the grand old town of oxford topped with the clustered domes and towers of its twentyodd great colleges the very names of many of whose founders have perished from human record as have all the chronicles of the times in which they lived  it is not alone that we have had to subdue the wilderness our educational conditions are otherwise adverse our political system is unfavorable our fortunes accumulated in one generation are dispersed in the next if it takes three generations to make a gentleman one will not make a thinker instruction is acquired but capacity for instruction is transmitted the brain that is to contain a trained intellect is not the result of a haphazard marriage between a clown and a wench nor does it get its tractable tissues from a hardheaded farmer and a softheaded milliner if you confess the importance of race and pedigree in a race horse and a bird dog how dare you deny it in a man  i do not claim that the political and social system that creates an aristocracy of leisure and consequently of intellect is the best possible kind of human organization i perceive its disadvantages clearly enough but i do not hold that a system under which all important public trusts political and professional civil and military ecclesiastical and secular are held by educated menthat is men of trained faculties and disciplined judgmentis not an altogether faulty system  it is only in our own country that an exacting literary taste is believed to disqualify a man for purveying to the literary needs of a taste less exactinga proposition obviously absurd for an exacting taste is nothing but the intelligent discrimination of a judgment instructed by comparison and observation there is in fact no pursuit or occupation from that of a man who blows up a balloon to that of the man who bores out the stove pipes in which he that has talent and education is not a better worker than he that has either and he than he that has neither it is a universal human weakness to disparage the knowledge that we do not ourselves possess but it is only my own beloved country that can justly boast herself the last refuge and asylum of the impotents and incapables who deny the advantage of all knowledge whatsoever it was an american senator logan who declared that he had devoted a couple of weeks to the study of finance and found the accepted authorities all wrong it was another american senator morton who confronted with certain ugly facts in the history of another country proposed to brush away all facts and argue the question on considerations of plain common sense  republican institutions have this disadvantage by incessant changes in the personnel of governmentto say nothing of the manner of men that ignorant constituencies elect and all constituencies are ignorantwe attain to no fixed principles and standards there is no such thing here as a science of politics because it is not to any ones interest to make politics the study of his life nothing is settled no truth finds general acceptance what we do one year we undo the next and do over again the year following our energy is wasted in and our prosperity suffers from experiments endlessly repeated  one of the disadvantages of our social system which is the child of our political is the tyranny of public opinion forbidding the utterance of wholesome but unpalatable truth in a republic we are so accustomed to the rule of majorities that it seldom occurs to us to examine their title to dominion and as the ideas of might and right are by our innate sense of justice linked together we come to consider public opinion infallible and almost sacred now majorities rule not because they are right but because they are able to rule in event of collision they would conquer so it is expedient for minorities to submit beforehand to save trouble in fact majorities embracing as they do the most ignorant seldom think rightly public opinion being the opinion of mediocrity is commonly a mistake and a mischief but it is to nobodys interestit is against the interest of mostto dispute with it public writer and public speaker alike find their account in confirming the plain people in their brainless errors and brutish prejudicesin glutting their omnivorous vanity and inflaming their implacable racial and national hatreds  i have long held the opinion that patriotism is one of the most abominable vices affecting the human understanding every patriot in this world believes his country better than any other country now they cannot all be the best indeed only one can be the best and it follows that the patriots of all the others have suffered themselves to be misled by a mere sentiment into blind unreason in its active manifestationit is fond of shootingpatriotism would be well enough if it were simply defensive but it is also aggressive and the same feeling that prompts us to strike for our altars and our fires impels us likewise to go over the border to quench the fires and overturn the altars of our neighbors it is all very pretty and spirited what the poets tell us about thermopylae but there was as much patriotism at one end of that pass as there was at the other patriotism deliberately and with folly aforethought subordinates the interests of a whole to the interests of a part worse still the fraction so favored is determined by an accident of birth or residence patriotism is like a dog which having entered at random one of a row of kennels suffers more in combats with the dogs in the other kennels than it would have done by sleeping in the open air the hoodlum who cuts the tail from a chinamens nowl and would cut the nowl from the body if he dared is simply a patriot with a logical mind having the courage of his opinions patriotism is fierce as a fever pitiless as the grave blind as a stone and irrational as a headless hen  there are two ways of clarifying liquidsebullition and precipitation one forces the impurities to the surface as scum the other sends them to the bottom as dregs the former is the more offensive and that seems to be our way but neither is useful if the impurities are merely separated but not removed we are told with tiresome iteration that our social and political systems are clarifying but when is the skimmer to appear if the purpose of free institutions is good government where is the good governmentwhen may it be expected to beginhow is it to come about systems of government have no sanctity they are practical means to a simple endthe public welfare worthy of no respect if they fail of its accomplishment the tree is known by its fruit ours is bearing crabapples  if the body politic is constitutionally diseased as i verily believe if the disorder inheres in the system there is no remedy the fever must burn itself out and then nature will do the rest one does not prescribe what time alone can administer we have put our criminal class in power do we suppose they will efface themselves will they restore to us the power of governing them they must have their way and go their length the natural and immemorial sequence is tyranny insurrection combat in combat everything that wears a sword has a chanceeven the right history does not forbid us to hope but it forbids us to rely upon numbers they will be against us if history teaches anything worth learning it teaches that the majority of mankind is neither good nor wise where government is founded upon the public conscience and the public intelligence the stability of states is a dream nor have we any warrant for the tennysonian faith that       freedom broadens slowly down      from precedent to precedent  in that moment of time that is covered by historical records we have abundant evidence that each generation has believed itself wiser and better than any of its predecessors that each people has believed itself to have the secret of national perpetuity in support of this universal delusion there is nothing to be said the desolate places of the earth cry out against it vestiges of obliterated civilizations cover the earth no savage but has camped upon the sites of proud and populous cities no desert but has heard the statesmans boast of national stability our nation our laws our historyall shall go down to everlasting oblivion with the others and by the same road but i submit that we are traveling it with needless haste  but it is all right and righteous it can be sparedthis jonahs gourd civilization of ours we have hardly the rudiments of a true civilization compared with the splendors of which we catch dim glimpses in the fading past ours are as an illumination of tallow candles we know no more than the ancients we only know other things but nothing in which is an assurance of perpetuity and little that is truly wisdom our vaunted elixir vito is the art of printing with moveable types what good will those do when posterity struck by the inevitable intellectual blight shall have ceased to read what is printed our libraries will become its stables our books its fuel  ours is a civilization that might be heard from afar in space as a scolding and a riot a civilization in which the race has so differentiated as to have no longer a community of interest and feeling which shows as a ripe result of the principles underlying it a reasonless and rascally feud between rich and poor in which one is offered a choice if one have the means to take it between american plutocracy and european militocracy with an imminent chance of renouncing either for a stultocratic republic with a headsman in the presidential chair and every laundress in exile  i have not a solution to the labor problem i have only a story many and many years ago lived a man who was so good and wise that none in all the world was so good and wise as he he was one of those few whose goodness and wisdom are such that after some time has passed their fellowmen begin to think them gods and treasure their words as divine law and by millions they are worshiped through centuries of time amongst the utterances of this man was one commandnot a new nor perfect onewhich has seemed to his adorers so preeminently wise that they have given it a name by which it is known over half the world one of the sovereign virtues of this famous law is its simplicity which is such that all hearing must understand and obedience is so easy that any nation refusing is unfit to exist except in the turbulence and adversity that will surely come to it when a people would avert want and strife or having them would restore plenty and peace this noble commandment offers the only meansall other plans for safety or relief are as vain as dreams and as empty as the crooning of fools and behold here it is all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them  what you unappeasable rich coining the sweat and blood of your workmen into drachmas understanding the law of supply and demand as mandatory and justifying your cruel greed by the senseless dictum that business is business you lazy workman railing at the capitalist by whose desertion when you have frightened away his capital you starverioting and shedding blood and torturing and poisoning by way of answer to exaction and by way of exaction you foul anarchists applauding with indelicate palms when one of your coward kind hurls a bomb amongst powerless and helpless women and children you imbecile politicians with a plague of remedial legislation for the irremediable you writers and thinkers unread in history with as many solutions to the labor problem as there are dunces among you who can not coherently define itdo you really think yourself wiser than jesus of nazareth do you seriously suppose yourselves competent to amend his plan for dealing with all the evils besetting states and souls have you the effrontery to believe that those who spurn his golden rule you can bind to obedience of an act entitled an act to amend an act bah you fatigue the spirit go get ye to your scoundrel lockouts your villain strikes your blacklisting your boycotting your speeching marching and maundering but if ye do not to others as ye would that they do to you it shall occur and that right soon that ye be drowned in your own blood and your pickpocket civilization quenched as a star that falls into the sea     the game of politics     i  if one were to declare himself a democrat or a republican and the claim should be contested he would find it a difficult one to prove the missing link in his chain of evidence would be the major premise in the syllogism necessary to the establishment of his political statusa definition of democrat or republican most of the statesmen in public and private life who are pollparroting these words do so with entire unconsciousness of their meaning or rather without knowledge that they have lost whatever of meaning they once had the words are mere survivals marking dead issues and covering allegiances of the loosest and most shallow character on any question of importance each party is divided against itself and dares not formulate a preference there is no question before the country upon which one may not think and vote as he likes without affecting his standing in the political communion of saints of which he professes himself a member party lines are as terribly confused as the parallels of latitude and longitude after a twisting earthquake or those aimless lines representing the competing railroad on a map published by a company operating the only direct route it is not probable that this state of things can last if there is to be government by partyand we should be sad to think that so inestimable a boon were soon to return to him who gave itmen must begin to let their angry passions rise and take rides ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey where the people are too wise to dispute and too good to fight let us have the good old political currency of bloody noses and cracked crowns let the yawp of the demagogue be heard in the land let ears be pestered with the spargent cheers of the masses give us a whoopup that shall rouse us like a rattling peal of thunder will nobody be our mosesthere should be two mosesesto lead us through this detestable wilderness of political stagnation     ii  nowhere on gods green earthit is fitting that this paper contain a bit of boshnowhere is so much insufferable stuff talked in a given period of time as in an american political convention it is there that all those objectionable elements of the national character which evoke the laughter of europe and are the despair of our friends find freest expression unhampered by fear of any censorship more exacting than that of the opposing partywhich takes no account of intellectual delinquencies but only of moral the organs of the opposing party will not take the trouble to point outeven to observethat the debasing sentiments and criminal views uttered in speech and platform are expressed in sickening syntax and offensive rhetoric doubtless an american politician statesman what you will could go into a political convention and signify his views with simple unpretentious common sense but doubtless he never does  every community is cursed with a number of oratorsmen regarded as eloquentsilver tongued menfellows who to the common american knack at brandishing the tongue add an exceptional felicity of platitude a captivating mastery of dogseared sentiment a copious and obedient vocabulary of eulogium an iron insensibility to the ridiculous and an infinite affinity to fools these afflicting chrysostoms are always lying in wait for an occasion it matters not what it is a reception to some great man from abroad a popular ceremony like the laying of a cornerstone the opening of a fair the dedication of a public building an anniversary banquet of an ancient and honorable order they all belong to ancient and honorable orders or a club dinnerthey all belong to clubs and pay dues but it is in the political convention that they come out particularly strong by some imperious tradition having the force of written law it is decreed that in these absurd bodies of our fellow citizens no word of sense shall be uttered from the platform whatever is uttered in set speeches shall be addressed to the meanest capacity present as a chain can be no stronger than its weakest link so nothing said by the speakers at a political convention must be above the intellectual reach of the most pernicious idiot having a seat and a vote i dont know why it is so it seems to be thought that if he is not suitably entertained he will not attend as a delegate the next convention  here are the opening sentences of the speech in which a man was once nominated for governor  two years ago the republican party in state and nation marched to imperial triumph on every hilltop and mountain peak our beacons blazed and we awakened the echoes of every valley with songs of our rejoicings  and so forth now if i were asked to recast those sentences so that they should conform to the simple truth and be inoffensive to good taste i should say something like this  two years ago the republican party won a general election  if there is any thing in this inflated rigmarole that is not adequately expressed in my amended statement what is it as to eloquence it will hardly be argued that nonsense falsehood and metaphors which were old when rome was young are essential to that the first man in early greece who spoke of awakening an echo did a felicitous thing was it felicitous in the second is it felicitous now as to that military metaphorthe marching and so forthits inventor was as great an ass as any one of the incalculable multitude of his plagiarists on this matter hear the late richard grant white  is it not time that we had done with the nauseous talk about campaigns and standardbearers and glorious victories imperial triumphs and all the bloated armybumming bombast which is so rife for the six months preceding an election to read almost any one of our political papers during a canvass is enough to make one sick and sorry an election has no manner of likeness to a campaign or a battle it is not even a contest in which the stronger or more dexterous party is the winner it is a mere counting in which the bare fact that one party is the more numerous puts it in power if it will only come up and be counted to insure which a certain time is spent by each party in reviling and belittling the candidates of its opponents and lauding its own and this is the canvass at the likening of which to a campaign every honest soldier might reasonably take offense  but after all white was only one o them dam litery fellers and i dare say the original proponent of the military metaphor away off there in the dark backward and abysm of time knew a lot more about practical politics than white ever did and it is practical politics to be an ass  in withdrawing his own name from before a convention a california politician once made a purely military speech of which a single sample passage is all that i shall allow myself the happiness to quote  i come before you today as a republican of the republican banner county of this great state of ours from snowy shasta on the north to sunny diego on the south from the west where the waves of the pacific look upon our shores to where the barriers of the great sierras stand clad in eternal snow there is no more loyal county to the republican party in this state than the county from which i hail applause naturally its loyalty to the party has been tested on many fields of battle anglice in many elections and it has never wavered in the contest wherever the fate of battle was trembling in the balance homer and since homer tom dick and harry alameda county stepped into the breach and rescued the republican party from defeat  translated into english this military mouthing would read somewhat like this  i live in alameda county where the republicans have uniformly outvoted the democrats  the orators at the democratic convention a week earlier were no better and no different their rhetorical stockintrade was the same old shopworn figures of speech in which their predecessors have dealt for ages and in which their successors will traffic to the end ofwell to the end of that imitative quality in the national character which by its superior intensity serves to distinguish us from the apes that perish     iii  what we most need to secure honest elections says a wellmeaning reformer is the clifford or the myers voting machine why truly here is a hopeful spirita rare and radiant intelligence suffused with the conviction that men can be made honest by machinerythat human character is a matter of gearing ratchets and dials one would give something to know how it feels to be like that a mind so constituted must be as happy in its hope as a hen incubating a nestful of porcelain doorknobs it lives in rapturous contemplation of a world of its own creationa world where public morality and political good order are to be had by purchase at the machineshop in that delectable world religion is superfluous the true high priest is the mechanical engineer the minor clergy are the village blacksmiths it is rather a pity that so fine and fair a sphere should prosper only in the attenuated ether of an idiots understanding  votingmachines are doubtless well enough they save labor and enable the statesmen of the street to know the result within a few minutes of the closing of the pollswhereby many are spared to their country who would otherwise incur fatal disorders by exposure to the night air while assisting in awaiting the returns but a votingmachine that human ingenuity can not pervert human ingenuity can not invent  that is true too of laws your statesman of a mental stature somewhat overtopping that of the machineperson puts his faith in law providence has designed to permit him to be persuaded of the efficacy of statutesgood stringent carefully drawn statutes definitively repealing all the laws of nature in conflict with any of their provisions so the poor devil i am writing of mr legion turns for relief from law to law ever on the stool of repentance yet ever unfouling the anchor of hope by no power cm earth can his indurated understanding be penetrated by the truth that his woful state is due not to any laws of his own nor to any lack of them but to his rascally refusal to obey the golden rule how long is it since we were all clamoring for the australian ballot law which was to make a new heaven and a new earth we have the australian ballot law and the same old earth smelling to the same old heaven writhe upon the triangle as we may groan out what new laws we will the pitiless thong will fall upon our bleeding backs as long as we deserve it if our sins which are scarlet are to be washed as white as wool it must be in the tears of a genuine contrition our crocodile deliverances will profit us nothing we must stop chasing dollars stop lying stop cheating stop ignoring art literature and all the refining agencies and instrumentalities of civilization we must subdue our detestable habit of shaking hands with prosperous rascals and fawning upon the merely rich it is not permitted to our employers to plead in justification of low wages the law of supply and demand that is giving them high profits it is not permitted to discontented employees to break the bones of contented ones and destroy the foundations of social order it is infamous to look upon public office with the lust of possession it is disgraceful to solicit political preferment to strive and compete for honors that are sullied and tarnished by the touch of the reaching hand until we amend our personal characters we shall amend our laws in vain though paul plant and apollos water the field of reform will grow nothing but the figless thistle and the grapeless thorn the state is an aggregation of individuals its public character is the expression of their personal ones by no political prestidigitation can it be made better and wiser than the sum of their goodness and wisdom to expect that men who do not honorably and intelligently conduct their private affairs will honorably and intelligently conduct the affairs of the community is to be a fool we are told that out of nothing god made the heavens and the earth but out of nothing god never did and man never can make a public sense of honor and a public conscience miracles are now performed but one day of the yearthe twentyninth of february and on leap year god is forbidden to perform them     iv  ye who hold that the power of eloquence is a thing of the past and the orator an anachronism who believe that the trend of political events and the results of parliamentary action are determined by committees in cold consultation and the machinations of programmes in holes and corners consider the ascension of bryan and be wise a week before the convention of 1896 william j bryan had never heard of himself upon his natural obscurity was superposed the opacity of a congressional service that effaced him from the memory of even his faithful dog and made him immune to dunning today he is pinnacled upon the summit of the tallest political distinction gasping in the thin atmosphere of his unfamiliar environment and fitly astonished at the mischance to the dizzy elevation of his candidacy he was hoisted out of the shadow by his own tongue the longest and liveliest in christendom had he held itwhich he could not have done with both handsthere had been no bryan his creation was the unstudied act of his own larynx it said let there be bryan and there was bryan even in these degenerate days there is a hope for the orators when one can make himself a presidential peril by merely waving the red flag in the cave of the winds and tormenting the circumjacence with a brandish of abundant hands  to be quite honest i do not entirely believe that orator bryans tongue had anything to do with it i have long been convinced that personal persuasion is a matter of animal magnetismwhat in its more obvious manifestation we now call hypnotism at the back of the words and the postures and independent of them is that secret mysterious power addressing not the ear not the eye nor through them the understanding but through its matching quality in the auditor captivating the will and enslaving it that is how persuasion is effected the spoken words merely supply a pretext for surrender they enable us to yield without loss of our selfesteem in the delusion that we are conceding to reason what is really extorted by charm the words are necessary too to point out what the orator wishes us to think if we are not already apprised of it when the nature of his power is better understood and frankly recognized he can spare himself the toil of talking the parliamentary debate of the future will probably be conducted in silence and with only such gestures as go by the name of passes the chairman will state the question before the house and the side affirmative or negative to be taken by the honorable member entitled to the floor that gentleman will rise train his compelling orbs upon the miscreants in opposition execute a few passes and exhaust his alloted time in looking at them he will then yield to an honorable member of dissenting views the preponderance in magnetic power and hypnotic skill will be manifest in the voting the advantages of the method are as plain as the nose on an elephants face the arena will no longer ring with anybodys rousing speech to the irritating abridgment of the inalienable right to pursuit of sleep honorable members will lack provocation to hurl allegations and cuspidors pitchforking statesmen and tosspot reformers will be unable to play at pitchandtoss with reputations not submitted for the performance in short the congenial asperities of debate will be so mitigated that the honorable member from hades will retire permanently from the hauls of legislation     v  public opinion says buckle being the voice of the average man is the voice of mediocrity is it therefore so very wise and infallible a guide as to be accepted without other credentials than its name and fame ought we to follow its light and leading with no better assurance of the character of its authority than a count of noses of those following it already and with no inquiry as to whether it has not on many former occasions let them and their several sets of predecessors into bogs of error and over precipices to eternal mock surely the average man as every one knows him is not very wise not very learned not very good how is it that his views of so intricate and difficult matters as those of which public opinion makes pronouncement through him are entitled to such respect it seems to me that the average man as i know him is very much a fool and something of a rogue as well he has only a smattering of education knows virtually nothing of political history nor history of any kind is incapable of logical that is to say clear thinking is subject to the suasion of base and silly prejudices and selfish beyond expression that such a persons opinions should be so obviously better than my own that i should accept them instead and assist in enacting them into laws appears to me most improbable i may bow to the will of the people as gracefully as a defeated candidate and for the same reason namely that i can not help myself but to admit that i was wrong in my belief and flatter the power that subdues meno that i will not do and if nobody would do so the average man would not be so very cocksure of his infallibility and might sometimes consent to be counseled by his betters  in any matter of which the public has imperfect knowledge public opinion is as likely to be erroneous as is the opinion of an individual equally uninformed to hold otherwise is to hold that wisdom can be got by combining many ignorances a man who knows nothing of algebra can not be assisted in the solution of an algebraic problem by calling in a neighbor who knows no more than himself and the solution approved by the unanimous vote of ten million such men would count for nothing against that of a competent mathematician to be entirely consistent gentlemen enamored of public opinion should insist that the text books of our common schools should be the creation of a mass meeting and all disagreements arising in the course of the work settled by a majority vote that is how all difficulties incident to the popular translation of the hebrew scriptures were composed it should be admitted however that most of those voting knew a little hebrew though not much a problem in mathematics is a very simple thing compared with many of those upon which the people are called to pronounce by resolution and ballotfor example a question of finance  the voice of the people is the voice of godthe saying is so respectably old that it comes to us in the latin he is a strange an unearthly politician who has not a score of times publicly and solemnly signified his faith in it but does anyone really believe it let us see in the period between 1859 and 1885 the democratic party was defeated six times in succession the voice of the people pronounced it in error and unfit to govern yet after each overthrow it came back into the field gravely reaffirming its faith in the principles that god had condemned then god twice reversed himself and the republicans never turned a hair but set about beating him with as firm a confidence of success justified by the event as they had known in the years of their prosperity doubtless in every instance of a political partys defeat there are defections but doubtless not all are due to the voice that spoke out of the great white light that fell about saul of tarsus by the way it is worth observing that that clever gentleman was under no illusion regarding the origin of the voice that wrought his celebrated flop he did not confound it with the vox populi the people of his time and place had no objection to the persecution that he was conducting and could persecute a trifle themselves upon occasion  majorities rule when they do rule not because they ought but because they can we vote in order to learn without fighting which party is the stronger it is less disagreeable to learn it that way than the other way sometimes the party that is numerically the weaker is by possession of the government actually the stronger and could maintain itself in power by an appeal to arms but the habit of submitting when outvoted is hard to break moreover we all recognize in a subconscious way the reasonableness of the habit as a practical method of getting on and there is always the confident hope of success in the next canvass that ones cause will succeed because it ought to succeed is perhaps the most general and invincible folly affecting the human judgment observation can not shake it nor experience destroy though you bray a partisan in the mortar of adversity till he numbers the strokes of the pestle by the hairs of his head yet will not this fool notion depart from him he is always going to win the next time however frequently and disastrously he has lost before and he can always give you the most cogent reasons for the faith that is in him his chief reliance is on the fatal mistakes made since the last election by the other party there never was a year in which the party in power and the party out of power did not make bad mistakesmistakes which unlike eggs and fish seem always worst when freshest if idiotic errors of policy were always fatal no party would ever win an election and there would be a hope of better government under the benign sway of the domestic cow     vi  each political party accuses the opposing candidate of refusing to answer certain questions which somebody has chosen to ask him i think myself it is discreditable for a candidate to answer any questions at all to make speeches declare his policy or to do anything whatever to get himself elected if a political party choose to nominate a man so obscure that his character and his views on all public questions are not known or inferable he ought to have the dignity to refuse to expound them as to the strife for office being a pursuit worthy of a noble ambition i do not think so nor shall i believe that many do think so until the term office seeker carries a less opprobrious meaning and the dictum that the office should seek the man not the man the office has a narrower currency among all manner of persons that by acts and words generally felt to be discreditable a man may evoke great popular enthusiasm is not at all surprising the late mr barnum was not the first nor the last to observe that the people love to be humbugged they love an impostor and a scamp and the best service that you can do for a candidate for high political preferment is to prove him a little better than a thief but not quite so good as a thug     vii  the view is often taken that a representative is the same thing as a delegate that he is to have and can honestly entertain no opinion that is at variance with the whims and the caprices of his constituents this is the very reductio ad absurdum of representative government that it is the dominant theory of the future there can be little doubt for it is of a piece with the progress downward which is the invariable and unbroken tendency of republican institutions it fits in well with manhood suffrage rotation in office unrestricted patronage assessment of subordinates an elective judiciary and the rest of it this theory of representative institutions is the last and lowest stage in our pleasant performance of shooting niagara when it shall have universal recognition and assent we shall have been fairly engulfed in the whirlpool and the buzzard of anarchy may hopefully whet his beak for the national carcass my view of the matterwhich has the further merit of being the view held by those who founded this governmentis that a man holding office from and for the people is in conscience and honor bound to do what seems to his judgment best for the general welfare respectfully regardless of any and all other considerations this is especially true of legislators to whom such specific instructions as constituents sometimes send are an impertinence and an insult pushed to its logical conclusion the delegate idea would remove all necessity of electing men of brains and judgment one man properly connected with his constituents by telegraph would make as good a legislator as another indeed as a matter of economy one representative should act for many constituencies receiving his instructions how to vote from mass meetings in each this besides being logical would have the added advantage of widening and hardening the power of the local bosses who by properly managing the showing of hands could have the same beneficent influence in national affairs that they now enjoy in municipal the plan would be a pretty good one if there were not so many other ways for the nation to go to the devil that it appears needless     viii  with a wiser wisdom than was given to them our forefathers in making the constitution would not have provided that each house of congress shall be the judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members they would have foreseen that a ruling majority of congress could not safely be trusted to exercise this power justly in the public interest but would abuse it in the interest of party a mans right to sit in a legislative body should be determined not by that body which has neither the impartiality the knowledge of evidence nor the time to determine it rightly but by the courts of law that is how it is done in england where parliament voluntarily surrendered the right to say by whom the constituencies shall be represented and there is no disposition to resume it as the vices hunt in packs so too virtues are gregarious if our congress had the righteousness to decide contested elections justly it would have also the selfdenial not to wish to decide them at all     ix  the purpose of the legislative custom of eulogizing dead members of congress is not apparent unless it is to add a terror to death and make honorable and selfrespecting members rather bear the ills they have than escape through the gates of death to others that they know a good deal about if a member of that kind who has had the bad luck to go before could be consulted he would indubitably say that he was sorry to be dead and that is not a natural frame of mind in one who is exempt from the necessity of himself delivering a eulogy  it may be urged that the congressional eulogy expresses in a general way the eulogists notion of what he would like to have somebody say of himself when he is by death elected to the lower house if so then heaven help him to a better taste meanwhile it is a patriotic duty to prevent him from indulging at the public expense the taste that he has there have been a few men in congress who could speak of the character and services of a departed member with truth and even eloquence one such was senator vest of many others the most charitable thing that one can conscientiously say is that one would a little rather hear a eulogy by them than on them considering that there are many kinds of brains and only one kind of no brains their diversity of gifts is remarkable but one characteristic they have in common they are all poets their efforts in the way of eulogium illustrate and illuminate pascals obscure saying that poetry is a particular sadness if not sad themselves they are at least the cause of sadness in others for no sooner do they take to their legs to remind us that life is fleeting and to make us glad that it is than they burst into bloom as poets all some one has said that in the contemplation of death there is something that belittles perhaps that explains the transformation anyhow the congressional eulogist takes to verse as naturally as a moth to a candle and with about the same result to his reputation for sense  the poetry is commonly not his own what it violates every law of sense fitness metre rhyme and taste it is but nine times in ten it is some dogseared shopworn quotation from one of the standard bards usually shakspere there are familiar passages from that poet which have been so often heard in the halls of legislation that they have acquired an infamy which unfits them for publication in a decent family newspaper and shakspere himself reposing in elysium on his bed of asphodel and moly omits them when reading his complete works to the shades of kit marlowe and ben jonson for their sins  this whole business ought to be cut out it is not only a waste of time and a sore trial to the patience of the country it is absolutely immoral it is not true that a member of congress who while living was a most ordinary mortal becomes by the accident of death a hero a saint an example to american youth nobody believes these abominable eulogies and nobody should be permitted to utter them in the time and place designated for another purpose a tribute that is exacted by custom and has not the fire and light of spontaneity is without sincerity or sense a simple resolution of regret and respect is all that the occasion requires and would not inhibit any further utterance that friends and admirers of the deceased might be moved to make elsewhere if any bereaved gentlemen feeling his heart getting into his head wishes to tickle his ear with his tongue by way of standardizing his emotion let him hire a hall and do so but he should not make the capitol a place of wailing and the congressional record a book of bathos     some features of the law     i  there is a difference between religion and the amazing circumstructure which under the name of theology the priesthoods have builded round about it which for centuries they made the world believe was the true temple and which after incalculable mischiefs wrought immeasurable blood spilled in its extension and consolidation is only now beginning to crumble at the touch of reason there is the same difference between the laws and the lawthe naked statutes bad enough god knows and the incomputable additions made to them by lawyers this immense body of superingenious writings it is that we all are responsible to in person and property it is unquestionable authority for setting aside any statute that any legislative body ever passed or can pass in it are dictates of recognized validity for turning topsyturvy every principle of justice and reversing every decree of reason there is no fallacy so monstrous no deduction so hideously unrelated to common sense as not to receive somewhere in the myriad pages of this awful compilation a support that any judge in the land would be proud to recognize with a decision if ably persuaded i do not say that the lawyers are altogether responsible for the existence of this mass of disastrous rubbish nor for its domination of the laws they only create and thrust it down our throats we are guilty of contributory negligence in not biting the spoon  as long as there exists the right of appeal there is a chance of acquittal otherwise the right of appeal would be a sham and an insult more intolerable even than that of the man convicted of murder to say why he should not receive the sentence which nothing he may say will avert so long as acquittal may ensue guilt is not established why than are men sentenced before they are proved guilty why are they punished in the middle of proceedings against them a lawyer can reply to these questions in a thousand ingenious ways there is but one answer it is because we are a barbarous race submitting to laws made by lawyers for lawyers let the legal fraternity reflect that a lawyer is one whose profession it is to circumvent the law that it is a part of his business to mislead and befog the court of which he is an officer that it is considered right and reasonable for him to live by a division of the spoils of crime and misdemeanor that the utmost atonement he ever makes for acquitting a man whom he knows to be guilty is to convict a man whom he knows to be innocent i have looked into this thing a bit and it is my judgment that all the methods of our courts and the traditions of bench and bar exist and are perpetuated altered and improved for the one purpose of enabling the lawyers as a class to exact the greatest amount of money from the rest of mankind the laws are mostly made by lawyers and so made as to encourage and compel litigation by lawyers they are interpreted and by lawyers enforced for their own profit and advantage the whole intricate and interminable machinery of precedent rulings decisions objections writs of error motions for new trials appeals reversals affirmations and the rest of it is a transparent and iniquitous systems of cinching what remedy would i propose none there is none to propose the lawyers have got us and they mean to keep us but if thoughtless children of the frontier sometimes rise to tar and feather the legal pelt may gods grace go with them and amen i do not believe there is a lawyer in heaven but by a bath of tar and a coating of hensdown they can be made to resemble angels more nearly than by any other process  the matchless villainy of making men suffer for crimes of which they may eventually be acquitted is consistent with our entire system of lawsa system so complicated and contradictory that a judge simply does as he pleases subject only to the custom of giving for his action reasons that at his option may or may not be derived from the statute he may sternly affirm that he sits there to interpret the law as he finds it not to make it accord with his personal notions of right and justice or he may declare that it could never have been the legislatures intention to do wrong and so shielded by the useful phrase contra bonos mores pronounce that illegal which he chooses to consider inexpedient or he may be guided by either of any two inconsistent precedents as best suits his purpose or he may throw aside both statute and precedent disregard good morals and justify the judgment that he wishes to deliver by what other lawyers have written in books and still others without anybodys authority have chosen to accept as a part of the law i have in mind judges whom i have observed to do all these things in a single term of court and could mention one who has done them all in a single decision and that not a very long one the amazing feature of the matter is that all these methods are lawfulmade so not by legislative enactment but by the judges language can not be used with sufficient lucidity and positiveness to land them  the legal purpose of a preliminary examination is not the discovery of a criminal it is the ascertaining of the probable guilt or innocence of the person already charged to permit that persons counsel to insult and madden the various assisting witnesses in the hope of making them seem to incriminate themselves instead of him by statements that may afterward be used to confuse a jurythat is perversion of law to defeat justice the outrageous character of the practice is seen to better advantage what contrasted with the tender consideration enjoyed by the person actually accused and presumably guiltythe presumption of his innocence being as futile a fiction as that a sheeps tail is a leg when called so actually the prisoner in a criminal trial is the only person supposed to have a knowledge of the facts who is not compelled to testify and this amazing exemption is given him by way of immunity from the snares and pitfalls with which the paths of all witnesses are wantonly beset to a visiting lunarian it would seem strange indeed that in a terrestrial court of justice it is not deemed desirable for an accused person to incriminate himself and that it is deemed desirable for a subpoena to be more dreaded than a warrant  when a child a wife a servant a studentany one under personal authority or bound by obligation of honoris accused or suspected an explanation is demanded and refusal to testify is held and rightly held a confession of guilt to question the accusedrigorously and sharply to examine him on all matters relating to the offense and even trap him if he seem to be lyingthat is natures method of criminal procedure why in our public trials do we forego its advantages it may annoy a person arrested for crime must expect annoyance it can not make an innocent man incriminate himself not even a witness but it can make a rogue do so and therein lies its value any pressure short of physical torture or the threat of it that can be put upon a rogue to make him assist in his own undoing is just and therefore expedient  this ancient and efficient safeguard to rascality the right of a witness to refuse to testify when his testimony would tend to convict him of crime has been strengthened by a decision of the united states supreme court that will probably add another century or two to its mischievous existence and possibly prove the first act in such an extension of it that eventually a witness can not be compelled to testify at all in fact it is difficult to see how he can be compelled to now if he has the hardihood to exercise his constitutional right without shame and with an intelligent consciousness of its limitless application  the case in which the supreme court made the decision was one in which a witness refused to say whether he had received from a defendant railway company a rate on grain shipments lower than the rate open to all shippers the trial was in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois and judge gresham chucked the scoundrel into jail he naturally applied to the supreme court for relief and that high tribunal gave joy to every known or secret malefactor in the country by decidingaccording to law no doubtthat witnesses in a criminal case can not be compelled to testify to anything that might tend to criminate them in any way or subject them to possible prosecution the italics are my own and seem to me to indicate about as clearly as extended comment could the absolutely boundless nature of the immunity that the decision confirms or confers it is to be hoped that some publicspirited gentleman called to the stand in some celebrated case may point the countrys attention to the state of the law by refusing to tell his name age or occupation or answer any question whatever and it would be a fitting finale to the farce if he would threaten the too curious attorney with an action for damages for compelling a disclosure of character  most lawyers have made so profound a study of human nature as to think that if they have shown a man to be of loose life with regard to women they have shown him to be one that would tell needless lies to a jurya conviction unsupported by the familiar facts of life and character different men have different vices and addiction to one kind of upsetting sin does not imply addiction to an unrelated kind doubtless a rake is a liar in so far as is needful to concealment but it does not follow that he will commit perjury to save a horsethief from the penitentiary or send a good man to the gallows as to lying generally he is not conspicuously worse than the mere lover male or female for lovers have been liars from the beginning of time they deceive when it is necessary and when it is not schopenhauer says that it is because of a sense of guiltthey contemplate the commission of a crime and like other criminals cover their tracks i am not prepared to say if that is the true explanation but to the fact to be explained i am ready to testify with lifted arms yet no crossexamining attorney tries to break the credibility of a witness by showing that he is in love  an habitual liar if disinterested makes about as good a witness as anybody there is really no such thing as the lust of lying falsehoods are told for advantagecommonly a shadowy and illusory advantage but one distinctly enough had in mind discerning no opportunity to promote his interest tickle his vanity or feed a grudge the habitual liar will tell the truth if lawyers would study human nature with half the assiduity that they give to resolution of hairs into their longitudinal elements they would be better fitted for service of the devil than they have now the usefulness to be  i have always asserted the right and expediency of crossexamining attorneys in court with a view to testing their credibility an attorneys relation to the trial is closer and more important than that of a witness he has more to say and more opportunities to deceive the jury not only by naked lying but by both suppressio veri and suggestio falsi why is it not important to ascertain his credibility and if an inquiry into his private life and public reputation will assist as himself avers why should he not be put upon the grill and compelled to sweat out the desired incrimination i should think it might give good results for example to compel him to answer a few questions touching not his private life but his professional somewhat like this  did you ever defend a client knowing him to be guilty  what was your motive in doing so  but in addition to your love of fair play had you not also the hope and assurance of a fee  in defending your guilty client did you declare your belief in his innocence  yes i understand but necessary as it may have been in that it helped to defeat justice and earn your fee was not your declaration a lie  do you believe it right to lie for the purpose of circumventing justiceyes or no  do you believe it right to lie for personal gainyes or no  then why did you do both  a man who lies to beat the laws and fill his purse iswhat  in defending a murderer did you ever misrepresent the character acts motives and intentions of the man that he murderednever mind the purpose and effect of such misrepresentationyes or no  that is what we call slander of the dead is it not  what is the most accurate name you can think of for one who slanders the dead to defeat justice and promote his own fortune  yes i knowsuch practices are allowed by the ethics of your profession but can you point to any evidence that they are allowed by jesus christ  if in former trials you have obstructed justice by slander of the dead by falsely affirming the innocence of the guilty by cheating in argument by deceiving the court whom you are sworn to serve and assist and have done all this for personal gain do you expect and is it reasonable for you to expect the jury in this case to believe you  one moment more please did you ever accept an annual or other fee conditioned on your not taking any action against a corporation  while in receipt of such refraineri beg you pardon retainerdid you ever prosecute a blackmailer  it will be seen that in testing the credibility of a lawyer it is needless to go into his private life and his character as a man and a citizen his professional practices are an ample field in which to search for offenses against man and god indeed it is sufficient simply to ask him what is your view of the ethics of your profession as a suitable standard of conduct for a pirate of the spanish main  the moral sense of the laymen is dimly conscious of something wrong in the ethics of the noble profession the lawyers affirming rightly enough a public necessity for them and their mercenary services permit their thrift to construe it vaguely as personal justification but nobody has blown away from the matter its brumous encompassment and let in the light upon it it is very simple  is it honorable for a lawyer to try to clear a man that he knows deserves conviction that is not the entire question by much is it honorable to pretend to believe what you do not believe is it honorable to lie i submit that these questions are not answered affirmatively by showing the disadvantage to the public and to civilization of a lawyer refusing to serve a known offender the popular interest like any other good cause can be and commonly is served by foul means justice itself may be promoted by acts essentially unjust in serving a sordid ambition a powerful scoundrel may by acts in themselves wicked augment the prosperity of a whole nation i have not the right to deceive and lie in order to advantage my fellowmen any more than i have the right to steal or murder to advantage them nor have my fellowmen the power to grant me that indulgence  the question of a lawyers right to clear a known criminal with the several questions involved is not answered affirmatively by showing that the law forbids him to decline a case for reasons personal to himselfnot even if we admit the statutes moral authority preservation of conscience and character is a civic duty as well as a personal ones fellowmen have a distinct interest in it that i admit is an argument rather in the manner of an attorney clearly enough the intent of this statute is to compel an attorney to cheat and lie for any rascal that wants him to in that sense it may be regarded as a law softening the rigor of all laws it does not mitigate punishments but mitigates the chance of incurring them the infamy of it lies in forbidding an attorney to be a gentleman like all laws it falls something short of its intent many attorneys even some who defend that law are as honorable as is consistent with the practice of deceit to serve crime  it will not do to say that an attorney in defending a client is not compelled to cheat and lie what kind of defense could be made by any one who did not profess belief in the innocence of his clientdid not affirm it in the most serious and impressive waydid not lie how would it profit the defense to be conducted by one who would not meet the prosecutions grave asseverations of belief in the prisoners guilt by equally grave assurances of faith in his innocence and in point of fact when was counsel for the defense ever known to forego the advantage of that solemn falsehood if i am asked what would become of accused persons if they had to prove their innocence to the lawyers before making a defense in court i reply that i do not know and in my turn i ask what would become of humpty dumpty if all the kings horses and all the kings men were an isosceles triangle  it all amounts to this that lawyers want clients and are not particular about the kind of clients that they get all this is very ugly work and a public interest that can not be served without it would better be unserved       i grant in short tis better all around      that ambidextrous consciences abound      in courts of law to do the dirty work      that selfrespecting scavengers would shirk      what then who serves however clean a plan      by doing dirty work he is a dirty man  but in point of fact i do not grant any such thing it is not for the public interest that a rogue have the same freedom of defense as an honest man it should be a good deal harder for him his troubles should begin not when he seeks acquital but when he seeks counsel it would be better for the community if he could not obtain the services of a reputable attorney or any attorney at all a defense that can not be made without his attorneys actual knowledge of his guilt should be impossible to him nor should he be permitted to remain off the witness stand lest he incriminate himself it ought to be the aim of the court to let him incriminate himselfto make him do so if his testimony will in our courts that natural method would serve the ends of justice greatly better than the one that we have testimony of the guilty would assist in conviction that of the innocent would not  as to the general question of a judges right to inflict arbitrary punishment for words that he may be pleased to hold disrespectful to himself or another judge i do not myself believe that any such right exists the practice seems to be merely a survivala heritage from the dark days of irresponsible power when the scope of judicial authority had no other bounds than fear of the royal gout or indigestion if in these modern days the same right is to exist it may be necessary to revive the old checks upon it by restoring the throne in freeing us from the monarchial chain the coalition of european powers commonly known in american history as the valor of our forefathers stripped us starker than they knew  suppose an attorney should find his clients interests imperiled by a prejudiced or corrupt judgewhat is he to do if he may not make representations to that effect supporting them with evidence where evidence is possible and by inference where it is not what means of protection shall he venture to adopt if it be urged in objection that judges are never prejudiced nor corrupt i confess that i shall have no answer the proposition will deprive me of breath  if contempt is not a crime it should not be punished if a crime it should be punished as other crimes are punishedby indictment or information trial by jury if a jury is demanded with all the safeguards that secure an accused person against judicial blunders and judicial bias the necessity for these safeguards is even greater in cases of contempt than in othersparticularly if the prosecuting witness is to sit in judgment on his own grievance that should of course not be permitted the trial should take place before another judge  why should twelve ablebodied jurymen with their oaths to guide them and the law to back submit to the dictation of one small judge armed with nothing better than an insolent assumption of authority a judge has not the moral right to order a jury to acquit the utmost that he can rightly do is to point out what state of the law or facts may seem to him unfavorable to conviction if the jurors holding a different view persist in conviction the accused will have grounds doubtless for a new trial but under no circumstances is a judge justified in requiring a responsible human being to disregard the solemn obligation of an oath  the public ear is dowered with rather more than just enough of clotted nonsense about attacks upon the dignity of the bench bringing the judiciary into disrepute and the rueful rest of it i crave leave to remind the solicitudinarians sounding these loud alarums on their several larynges that by persons of understanding men are respected not for what they do but for what they are and that one public functionary will stand as high in their esteem as another if as high in character the dignity of a wise and righteous judge needs not the artificial safeguarding which is a heritage of the old days when if dissent found a tongue the public executioner cut it out the bench will be sufficiently respected when it is no longer a place where dullards dream and rogues robwhen its personnel is no longer chosen in the backrooms of tippleshops forced upon yawning conventions and confirmed by the votes of men who neither know what the candidates are nor what they should be with the gang that we have and under our system must continue to have respect is out of the question and ought to be they are entitled to just as much of its forms and observances as are needful to maintenance of order in their courts and fortification of their lawful powerno more as to their silence under criticism that is as they please no body but themselves is holding their tongues     ii  a law under which the unsuccessful respondent in a divorce proceeding may be forbidden to marry again during the life of the successful complainant the latter being subject to no such disability is infamous infinitely if the disability is intended as a punishment it is exceptional among legal punishments in that it is inflicted without conviction trial or arraignment the divorce proceedings being quite another and different matter it is exceptional in that the period of its continuance and therefore the degree of its severity are indeterminate they are dependent on no limiting statute and on neither the will of the power inflicting nor the conduct of the person suffering  to sentence a person to a punishment that is to be mild or severe according to chance orwhich is even worsecircumstance which but one person and that person not officially connected with administration of justice can but partly control is a monstrous perversion of the main principles that are supposed to underlie the laws  in the case at bar it can be nothing to the womanpossibly herself remarriedwhether the man remarries or not that is can affect only her feelings and only such of them as are least creditable to her yet her selfinterest is enlisted against him to do him incessant disservice by merely caring for her health she increases the sharpness of his punishmentfor punishment it is if he feels it such every hour that she wrests from death is added to his term the expediency of preventing a man from marrying without having the power to prevent him from making his marriage desirable in the interest of the public and vital to that of some woman is not discussable here if a man is ever justified in poisoning a woman who is no longer his wife it is when by way of making him miserable the state has given him or he supposes it to have given him a direct and distinct interest in her death     iii  with a view possibly to promoting respect for law by making the statutes so conform to public sentiment that none will fall into disesteem and disuse it has been advocated that there be a formal recognition of sex in the penal code by making a difference in the punishment of men and of women for the same crimes and misdemeanors the argument is that if women were provided with milder punishment juries would sometimes convict them whereas they now commonly get off altogether  the plan is not so new as might be thought many of the nations of antiquity of whose laws we have knowledge and nearly all the european nations until within a comparatively recent time punished women differently from men for the same offenses and as recently as the period of the early puritan in new england women were punished for some offenses which men might commit without fear if not without reproach the duckingstool for example was an appliance for softening the female temper only in england women used to be burned at the stake for crimes for which men were hanged roasting being regarded as the milder punishment in point of fact it was not punishment at all the victim being carefully strangled before the fire touched her burning was simply a method of disposing of the body so expeditiously as to give no occasion and opportunity for the unseemly social rites commonly performed about the scaffold of the erring male by the jocular populace as lately as 1763 a woman named margaret biddingfield was burned in suffolk as an accomplice in the crime of petty treason she had assisted in the murder of her husband the actual killing being done by a man and he was hanged as no doubt he richly deserved for coining too which was treason men were hanged and women burned this distinction between the sexes was maintained until the year of grace 1790 after which female offenders ceased to have a stake in the country and like hoods martial hero enlisted in the line  in still earlier days before the advantages of fire were understood our good grandmothers who sinned were admonished by waterthey were drowned but in the reign of henry iii a woman was hangedwithout strangulation apparently for after a whole day of it she was cut down and pardoned sorceresses and unfaithful wives were smothered in mud as also were unfaithful wives among the ancient burgundians the punishment of unfaithful husbands is not of record we only know that there were no austerely virtuous editors to direct the finger of public scorn their way  among the anglosaxons women who had the bad luck to be detected in theft were drowned while men meeting with the same mischance died a dry death by hanging by the early danish laws female thieves were buried alive whether or not from motives of humanity is not now known this seems to have been the fashion in france also for in 1331 a woman named duplas was scourged and buried alive at abbeville and in 1460 perotte mauger a receiver of stolen goods was inhumed by order of the provost of paris in front of the public gibbet in germany in the good old days certain kinds of female criminals were impaled a punishment too grotesquely horrible for description but likely enough considered by the simple german of the period conspicuously merciful  it is in short only recently that the civilized nations have placed the sexes on an equality in the matter of the death penalty for crime and the new system is not yet by any means universal that it is a better system than the old or would be if enforced is a natural presumption from human progress out of which it is evolved but coincidently with its evolution has evolved also a sentiment adverse to punishment of women at all but this sentiment appears to be of independent growth and in no way a reaction against that which caused the change to mitigate the severity of the death penalty for women to some pleasant form of euthanasia such as drowning in rosewater or in their case to abolish the death penalty altogether and make their capital punishment consist in a brief interment in a jail with a softened name would probably do no good for whatever form it might take it would be so far as woman is concerned the extreme penalty and crowning disgrace and jurors would be as reluctant to inflict it as they now are to inflict hanging     iv  testators should not from the snug security of the grave utter a perpetual threat of disinheritance or any other uncomfortable fate to deter an american citizen even one of his own legatees from applying to the courts of his country for redress of any wrong from which he might consider himself as suffering the courts of law ought to be open to any one conceiving himself a victim of injustice and it should be unlawful to abridge the right of complaint by making its exercise more hazardous than it naturally is doubtless the contesting of wills is a nuisance generally speaking the contestant conspicuously devoid of moral worth and the verdict singularly unrighteous but as long as some testators really are daft or subject to interested suasion or wantonly sinful they should be denied the power to stifle dissent by fining the luckless dissenter the dead have too much to say in this world at the best and it is monstrous and intolerable tyranny for them to stand at the door of the temple of justice to drive away the suitors that themselves have made  obedience to the commands of the dead should be conditional upon their good behavior and it is not good behavior to set up a censure of actions at law among the living if our courts are not competent to say what actions are proper to be brought and what are unfit to be entertained let us improve them until they are competent or abolish them altogether and resort to the mild and humane arbitrament of the dice but while courts have the civility to exist they should refuse to surrender any part of their duties and responsibilities to such exceedingly private persons as those under six feet of earth or sealed up in habitations of hewn stone persons no longer affectible by human events should be denied a voice in determining the character and trend of them respect for the wishes of the dead is a tender and beautiful sentiment certainly unfortunately it can not be ascertained that they have any wishes what commonly go by that name are wishes once entertained by living persons who are now dead and who in dying renounced them along with everything else like those who entertained them the wishes are no longer in existence the wishes of the dead therefore are not wishes and are not of the dead why they should have anything more than a sentimental influence upon those still in the flesh and be a factor to be reckoned with in the practical affairs of the supergraminous world is a question to which the merely human understanding can find no answer and it must be referred to the lawyers when from the tombs a doleful sound is vented and thine ear is invited to attend the cry an intelligent forethought will suggest that you inquire if it is anything about property if so pass onthat is no sacred spot     v  much of the testimony in french courts civil and martial appears to consist of personal impressions and opinions of the witnesses all very improper and mischievous no doubt ifif what why obviously if the judges are unfit to sit in judgment by designating them to sit the designating power assumes their fitnessassumes that they know enough to take such things for what they are worth to make the necessary allowances if needful to disregard a witnesss opinion altogether i do not know if they are fit i do not know that they do make the needful allowances it is by no means clear to me that any judge or juror french american or patagonian is competent to ascertain the truth when lying witnesses are trying to conceal it under the direction of skilled and conscientiousless attorneys licensed to deceive but his competence is a basic assumption of the law vesting him with the duty of deciding having chosen him for that duty the french law very logically lets him alone to decide for himself what is evidence and what is not it does not trust him a little but altogether it puts him under conditions familiar to himmakes him accessible to just such influences and suasions as he is accustomed to when making conscious and unconscious decisions in his personal affairs  there may be a distinct gain to justice in permitting a witness to say whatever he wants to say if he is telling the truth he will not contradict himself if he is lying the more rope he is given the more surely he will entangle himself to the service of that end defendants and prisoners should i think be compelled to testify and denied the advantage of declining to answer for silence is the refuge of guilt in endeavoring by austere means to make an accused person incriminate himself the french judge logically applies the same principle that a parent uses with a suspected child when the grandfather of his country arraigned the wee george washington for arboricide the accused was not carefully instructed that he need not answer if a truthful answer would tend to convict him if he had refused to answer he would indubitably have been lambasted until he did answer as right richly he would have deserved to be  the custom of permitting a witness to wander at will over the entire field of knowledge hearsay surmise and opinion has several distinct advantages over our practice in giving hearsay evidence for example he may suggest a new and important witness of whom the counsel for the other side would not otherwise have heard and who can then be brought into court on some unguarded and apparently irrelevant statement he may open an entirely new line of inquiry or throw upon the case a flood of light everyone knows what revelations are sometimes evoked by apparently the most insignificant remarks why should justice be denied a chance to profit that way  there is a still greater advantage in the french method by giving a witness free rein in expression of his personal opinions and feelings we should be able to calculate his frame of mind his good or ill will to the prosecution or defense and therefore to a certain extent his credibility in our courts he is able by a little solemn perjury to conceal all this even from himself and pose as an impartial witness when in truth with regard to the accused he is full of rancor or reeking with compassion  in theory our system is perfect the accused is prosecuted by a public officer who having no interest in his conviction will serve the state without mischievous zeal and perform his disagreeable task with fairness and consideration he is permitted to entrust his defense to another officer whose duty it is to make a rigidly truthful and candid presentation of his case in order to assist the court to a just decision the jurors if there are jurors are neither friendly nor hostile are openminded intelligent and conscientious as to the witnesses are they not sworn to tell the truth the whole truth in so far as they are permitted and nothing but the truth what could be finer and better than all thiswhat could more certainly assure justice how close the resemblance is between this ideal picture and what actually occurs all know or should know the judge is commonly an ignoramus incapable of logical thought and with little sense of the dread and awful nature of his responsibility the prosecuting attorney thinks it due to his reputation to make a record and tries to convict by hook or crook even when he is himself persuaded of the defendants innocence counsel for the defense is equally unscrupulous for acquittal and both having industriously coached their witnesses contend against each other in deceiving the court by every artifice of which they are masters witnesses on both sides perjure themselves freely and with almost perfect immunity if detected at the close of it all the poor weary jurors hopelessly bewildered and dumbly resentful of their duping render a random or compromise verdict or one which best expresses their secret animosity to the lawyer they like least or their faith in the newspapers which they have diligently and disobediently read every night commenting upon rabelais old judge who when impeached for an outrageous decision pleaded his defective eyesight which made him miscount the spots on the dice the most distinguished lawyer of my acquaintance seriously assured me that if all the cases with which he had been connected had been decided with the dice substantial justice would have been done more frequently than it was done if that is true or nearly true and i believe it the americans right to sneer at the frenchmans judicial methods is still an open question  it is urged that the corrupt practices in our courts of law be uncovered to public view whenever that is possible by dial impeccable censor the press exposure of rascality is very goodbetter apparently for rascals than for anybody else for it usually suggests something rascally which they had overlooked and so familiarizes the public with crime that crime no longer begets loathing if the newspapers of the country are really concerned about corrupter practices than their own and willing to bring our courts up to the english standard there is something better than exposurewhich fatigues let the newspapers set about creating a public opinion favorable to nonelective judges well paid powerful to command respect and holding office for life or good behavior that is the only way to get good men and great lawyers on the bench as matters are we stand and cry for what the english have and rail at the way they get it our bossmade pressridden and mobfearing paupers and ignoramuses of the bench give us as good a quality of justice as we merit a better quality awaits us whenever the will to have it is attended by the sense to take it     arbitration  the universal cry for arbitration is either dishonest or unwise for every evil there are quack remedies galoreespecially for every evil that is irremediable of this order of remedies is arbitration for of this order of evils is the inadequate wage of manual labor since the beginning of authentic history everything has been tried in the hope of divorcing poverty and labor but nothing has parted them it is not conceivable that anything ever will success of arbitration antecedently improbable is demonstrably impossible most of the work of the world is hard disagreeable work requiring little intelligence most of the people of the world are unintelligentunfit to do any other work if it were not done by them it would not be done and it is the basic work withdraw them from it and the whole superstructure would topple and fall yet there is too little of the work and there are so many incapable of doing anything else that adequate return is out of the question for the laboring class there is no hope of an existence that is comfortable in comparison with that of the other class the hope of an individual laborer lies in the possibility of fitting himself for higher employmentemployment of the head not manual but cerebral labor while selfishness remains the main ingredient of human nature and a survey of the centuries accessible to examination shows but a slow and intermittent decrease the cerebral workers being the wiser and no better will manage to take the greater profit in justice it must be said of them that they extend a warm and sincere invitation to their ranks and take apprentices every chance of education that the other class enjoys is proof of that  all this is perhaps a trifle abstruse let us then look at arbitration more nearly in our time it is in form at least something new it began as international arbitration which already in settling a few disputes of no great importance has shown itself a dangerous remedy in the necessary negotiation to determine exactly what points to submit to whom and how and where and when to submit them and how to carry out the arbitrators decision scores of questions are raised upon each of which it is as easy to disagree and fight as upon the original issue international arbitration may be defined as the substitution of many burning questions for a smouldering one for disputes that have reached a really acute stage are not submitted the animosities that it has kindled have been hotter than those it has quenched  industrial arbitration is no better it is manifestly worse and any law enforcing it and enforcing compliance with its decisions is absurd and mischievous compulsory arbitration is not arbitration the essence whereof is voluntary submission of differences and voluntary submission to judgment if either reference or obedience is enforced the arbitrators are simply a court with no powers to do anything but apply the law proponents of the fad would do well to consider this if a party to a labor dispute is compelled to invoke and obey a decision of arbitrators that decision must follow strictly the line of law the smallest invasion of any constitutional statutory or commonlaw right will enable him to upset the whole judgment no legislative body can establish a tribunal empowered to make and enforce illegal or extra legal decisions for making and enforcing legal ones the tribunals that we already have are sufficient this talk of compulsory arbitration is the maddest nonsense that the industrial situation has yet evolved doubtless it is sent upon us for our sins but had we not already a plague of inveracity  arbitration of labor disputes means compromise with the unions it can in this country mean nothing else for the law would not survive a halfdozen failures to concede some part of their demands however reasonless by repeated strikes they would eventually get all their original demand and as much more as on second thought they might choose to ask for each concession would be as it is now followed by a new demand and the first arbitrators might as well allow them all that they demand and all that they mean to demand hereafter  would not employers be equally unscrupulous they would not they could not afford the disturbance the stoppage of the business the risk of unfair decisions in a country where it is popular to favor and encourage not the just but the poor the labor leaders have nothing to lose not even their jobs for their work is labor leading their dupes by the way would be dupes no longer for with enforced arbitration the game of follow my leader would pay until there should be nothing to follow him to but empty treasuries of dead industries in an extinct civilization if there must be enforced arbitration it should at least not apply to that sum of all impudent rascalities the sympathetic strike  as to the men who have set up the monstrous claim asserted by the sympathetic strike i shall refer to the affair of 1904 if it was creditable in them to feel so much concern about a few hundred aliens in illinois how about the grievances of the whole body of their countrymen in california when their employers who they confess were good to them were plundering the californians they did not strike sympathetically nor otherwise year after year the railway companies picked the pockets of the californians corrupted their courts and legislatures laid its briarean hands in exaction upon every industry and interest filled the land with lies and false reasoning threw honest men into prisons and locked the gates of them against thieves and assassins by open defiance of the tax collector denied to children of the poor the advantages of educationdid all this and more and these honest working men stood loyally by it sharing in wages its dishonest gains receivers in one sense of stolen goods the groans of their neighbors were nothing to them even the wrongs of themselves their wives and their children did not stir them to revolt on every breeze that blew this great chorus of cries and curses was borne past their ears unheeded why did they not strike then where then were their fiery altruists and stormpetrels of industrial disorder nothe ingenious gods who have invented the debses and gomperses and humorously branded them with names that would make a cat laugh have never put it into their cold selfish hearts to order out their misguided followers to redress a public wrong but only to inflict oneto avenge a personal humiliation gratify an appetite for notoriety slake a thirst for the intoxicating cup of power or punish the crime of prosperity  it is a practical an illogical a turbulent time yes it always is the age of jesus christ was a practical age yet jesus christ was sweetly impractical in an illogical period socrates reasoned clearly and logically died for it neros time was a time of turbulence yet senecas mind was not disturbed nor his conscience perverted compare their fame with the everlasting infamy that time has fixed upon the names of the jack cades the robespierres the tomaso nielosguides and gods of the fierce democracies which rise with a sickening periodicity to defile the page of history with a quickly fading mark of blood and fire their own awful example their sole contribution to the good of mankind to be a child of your time imbued with its spirit and endowed with its aimsthat is to petition posterity for a niche in the temple of shame  no strike of any prominence ever takes place in this country without the concomitants of violence and destruction of property and usually murder these cheerful incidents one who does not personally suffer them can endure with considerable fortitude but the sniveling hypocritical condemnation of them by the press that has instigated them and the strikers who have planned and executed them and who invariably ascribe them to those whom they most injure the solemn offers of the leaders to assist in protecting the imperiled property and avenging the dead while openly employing counsel for every incendiary and assassin arrested in spite of themthese are pretty hard to bear a strike means for it includes as its main method violence lawlessness destruction of the property of others than the strikers riot and if necessary bloodshed even when the strikers themselves have no hand in these crimes they are morally liable for the foreknown consequences of their act nay they are morally liable for all the consequencesall the inconveniences and losses to the community all the sufferings of the poor entailed by interruptions of trade all the privations of other workingmen whom a selfish attention to their own supposed advantage throws out of the closed industries they are liable in morals and should be made so in lawonly that strikes are needless it is not worth while to create a multitude of complex criminal responsibilities for acts which can easily be prevented by a single and simple one how  first i should like to point out that we are hearing a deal too much about a mans inalienable right to work or play at his own sovereign will in so far as that meansand it is always used to meanhis right to quit any kind of work at any moment without notice and regardless of consequences to others it is false there is no such moral right and the law should have at least a speaking acquaintance with morality what is mischievous should be illegal the various interests of civilization are so complex delicate intertangled and interdependent that no man and no set of men should have power to throw the entire scheme into confusion and disorder for promotion of a trumpery principle or a class advantage in dealing with corporations we recognize that if for any selfish purpose the trade union of railway managers had done what their sacred brakemen and divine firemen didhad decreed that no wheel should turn until mr pullmans men should return to workthey would have found themselves all in jail the second day their right to quit work was not conceded they lacked that authenticating credential of moral and legal irresponsibility an indurated palm in a small lockout affecting a mill or two the offender finds a halfhearted support in the law if he is willing to pay enough deputy sheriffs but even then he is mounted by the hobnailed populace at its back the daily newspapers clamoring and spitting like cats but let the manager of a great railway discharge all its men without warning and kill its own engines then see what you will see to commit a wrong so gigantic with impunity a man must wear overalls  how prevent anybody from committing it how break up this rÃ©gime of strikes and boycotts and lockouts more disastrous to others than to those at whom the blows are aimedthan to those even who deliver them how make all those concerned in the management and operation of great industries about which have grown up tangles of related and dependent interests conduct them with some regard to the welfare of others before committing ourselves to the dubious and irretraceable course of government ownership or to the infectious expedient of a pension system is there anything of promise yet untriedanything of superior simplicity and easier application i think so make a breach of labor contract by either parly to it a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment fine or imprisonment will not dothe employee unable to pay the fine would commonly go to jail the employer seldom that would not be fair  the purpose of such a law is apparent labor contracts would then be drawn for a certain time securing both employer and employee and which is more important helpless persons in related and dependent industriesthe whole public in factagainst sudden and disastrous action by either capital or labor for accomplishment of a purely selfish or frankly impudent end a strike or lockout compelled to announce itself thirty days in advance would be innocuous to the public whilst securing to the party of initiation all the advantages that anybody professes to wantall but the advantage of ruining others and of successfully defying the laws  under the present rÃ©gime labor contracts are useless either party can violate them with impunity they offer redress only through a civil suit for damages and the employee commonly has nothing with which to conduct an action or satisfy a judgment the consequence is seen in the incessant and increasing industrial disturbances with their everattendant crimes against property life and libertydisturbances which by driving capital to investments in which it needs employ no labor do more than all the other causes so glibly enumerated by every newspaper and politician though by no two alike to bring about the hard timeswhich in their turn cause further and worse disturbances     industrial discontent     i  the time seems to have come when the two antagonistic elements of american society should and could afford to throw off their disguise and frankly declare their principles and purposes but what it may be asked are the two antagonistic elements dividing lines parting the population into two camps more or less hostile may be drawn variously for example one may be run between the lawabiding and the criminal class but the elements to which reference is here made are those immemorable and implacable foes which the slang of modern economics roughly and loosely distinguishes as capital and labor a more accurate classificationas accurate a one as it is possible to makewould designate them as those who do muscular labor and those who do not the distinction between rich and poor does not serve to the laborer the rich man who works with his hands is not objectionable the poor man who does not is consciously or unconsciously and alike by those whose necessities compel them to perform it and those whose better fortune enables them to avoid it manual labor is considered the most insufferable of human pursuits it is a pill that the tolstois the communities and the knights of labor can not sugarcoat we may prate of the dignity of labor emblazon its praise upon banners set apart a day on which to stop work and celebrate it shout our teeth loose in its glorificationand god help our fool souls to better sense we think we mean it all  if labor is so good and great a thing let all be thankful for all can have as much of it as may be desired the eighthour law is not mandatory to the laborer nor does possession of leisure entail idleness it is permitted to the clerk the shopman the street peddlerto all who live by the light employment of keeping the wolf from the door without eating himto abandon their ignoble callings seize the shovel the axe and the sledgehammer and lay about them right sturdily to the ample gratification of their desire and those who are engaged in more profitable vocations will find that with a part of their incomes they can purchase from their employers the right to work as hard as they like in even the dullest times  manual labor has nothing of dignity nothing of beauty it is a hard imperious and dispiriting necessity he who is condemned to it feels that it sets upon his brow the brand of intellectual inferiority and that brand of servitude never ceases to burn in no country and at no time has the laborer had a kindly feeling for the rest of us for everywhere and always has he heard in our patronising platitudes the note of contempt in his repression in the denying him the opportunity to avenge his real and imaginary wrongs government finds its main usefulness activity and justification jeffersons dictum that governments are instituted among men in order to secure them in life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is luminous nonsense governments are not instituted they grow they are evolved out of the necessity of protecting from the handworker the life and property of the brain worker and the idler the first is the most dangerous because the most numerous and the least content take from the science and the art of government and from its methods whatever has had its origin in the consciousness of his illwill and the fear of his power and what have you left a pure republicthat is to say no government  i should like it understood that if not absolutely devoid of preferences and prejudices i at least believe myself to be that except as to result i think no more of one form of government than of another and that with reference to results all forms seem to me bad but bad in different degrees if asked my opinion as to the results of our own i should point to homestead to wardner to buffalo to coal creek to the interminable tale of unpunished murders by individuals and by mobs to legislatures and courts unspeakably corrupt and executives of criminal cowardice to the prevalence and immunity of plundering trusts and corporations and the monstrous multiplication of millionaires i should invite attention to the pension roll to the similar and incredible extravagance of republican and democratic housesa plague o them both if addressing democrats only i should mention the protective tariff if republicans the hilltribe clamor for free coinage of silver i should call to mind the existence of prosperous activity of a thousand lying secret societies having for their sole object mitigation of republican simplicity by means of pageantry and costumes grotesquely resembling those of kings and courtiers and titles of address and courtesy exalted enough to draw laughter from an ox  in contemplation of these and a hundred other results no less shameful in themselves than significant of the deeper shame beneath and prophetic of the blacker shame to come i should say behold the outcome of hardly more than a century of government by the people behold the superstructure whose foundations our forefathers laid upon the unstable overgrowth of popular caprice surfacing the unplummeted abysm of human depravity behold the reality behind our dream of the efficacy of forms the saving grace of principles the magic of words we have believed in the wisdom of majorities and are fooled trusted to the good honor of numbers and are betrayed our touching faith in the liberty of the rascal our strange conviction that anarchy making proselytes and bombs is less dangerous than anarchy with a shut mouth and a watched handlo this is the beginning of the aid of the dream  our government has broken down at every point and the two irreconcilable elements whose suspensions of hostilities are mistaken for peace are about to try their hands at each others tempting display of throats there is no longer so much as a pretense of amity apparently there will not much longer be a pretense of regard for mercy and morals already industrial discontent has attained to the magnitude of war it is important then that there be an understanding of principles and purposes as the combatants will not define their positions truthfully by words let us see if it can be inferred from the actions which are said to speak more plainly if one of the really able men who now direct the destinies of the labor organizations in this country could be enticed into the palace of truth and examined by a skilful catechist he would indubitably say something like this  our ultimate purpose is abolition of the distinction between employer and employee which is but a modification of that between master and slave  we propose that the laborer shall be chief owner of all the property and profits of the enterprise in which he is engaged and have through his union a controlling voice in all its affairs  we propose to overthrow the system under which a man can grow richer by working with his head than with his hands and prevent the man who works with neither from having anything at all  in the attainment of these ends any means is to be judged as to its fitness for our use with sole regard to its efficacy we shall punish the innocent for the sins of the guilty we shall destroy property and life under such circumstances and to such an extent as may seem to us expedient falsehood treachery arson assassination all these we look upon as legitimate if effective  the rules of civilized warfare we shall not observe but shall put prisoners to death or torture them as we please  we do not recognize a nonunion mans right to labor nor to live the right to strike includes the right to strike him  doubtless all that and the half is not told sounds to the unobservant like a harsh exaggeration an imaginative travesty of the principles of labor organizations it is not a travesty it has no element of exaggeration not in the last twentyfive years has a great strike or lockout occurred in this country without supplying facts notorious and undisputed upon which some of these confessions of faith are founded the war is practically a servile insurrection and servile insurrections are today what they ever were the most cruel and ferocious of all manifestations of human hate emancipation is rough work when he who would be free himself strikes the blow he can not consider too curiously with what he strikes it nor upon whom it falls it will profit you to understand my fine gentleman with the soft hands the character of that which is confronting you you are not threatened with a bombardment of roses  let us look into the other camp where general hardhead is so engrossed with his own greatness and power as not clearly to hear the shots on his picket line suppose we hypnotize him and make him open his shut soul to our searching he will say something like this  in the first place i claim the right to own and enclose for my own use or disuse as much of the earths surface as i am desirous and able to procure i and my kind have made laws confirming us in the occupancy of the entire habitable and arable area as fast as we can get it to the objection that this must eventually here as it has actually done elsewhere deprive the rest of you places upon which legally to be born and exclude you after surreptitious birth as trespassers from all chance to procure directly the fruits of the earth i reply that you can be born at sea and eat fish  i claim the right to induce you by offer of employment to colonize yourselves and families about my factories and then arbitrarily by withdrawing the employment break up in a day the homes that you have been years in acquiring where it is no longer possible for you to procure work  in determining your rate of wages when i employ you i claim the right to make your necessities a factor in the problem thus making your misfortunes cumulative by the law of supply and demand god bless its expounder the less you have and the less chance to get more the more i have the right to take from you in labor and the less i am bound to give you in wages  i claim the right to ignore the officers of the peace and maintain a private army to subdue you when you rise  i claim the right to make you suffer by creating for my advantage an artificial scarcity of the necessaries of life  i claim the right to employ the large powers of the government in advancing my private welfare  as to falsehood treachery and the other military virtues with which you threaten me i shall go in them as far as you but from arson and assassination i recoil with horror you see you have very little to burn and you are not more than half alive anyhow  that i submit is a pretty fair definition of the position of the wealthy man who works with his head it seems worth while to put it on record while he is extant to challenge or verify for the probability is that unless he mend his ways he will not much longer be wealthy work nor have a head     ii  in discussion of the misdoings at homestead and coeur d alene it is amusing to observe all the champions of law and order gravely prating of principles and declaring with all the solemnity of owls that these sacred things have been violated on that ground they have the argument all their own way indubitably there is hardly a fundamental principle of law and morals that the rioting laborers have not footballed out of the field of consideration indubitably too in doing so they have forfeited as they must have expected to forfeit all the moral support for which they did not care a tinkers imprecation if there were any question of their culpability this solemn insistence upon it would lack something of the humor with which it is now invested and which saves the observer from death by dejection  it is not only in discussions of the labor situation that we hear this eternal babble of principles it is never out of ear and in politics is especially clamant every success in an election is yawped of as a triumph of republican or democratic principles but neither in politics nor in the quarrels of laborers and their employers have principles a place as factors in the problem their use is to supply to both combatants a vocabulary of accusation and appeal all the fierce talk of an antagonists violation of those eternal principles upon which organized society is foundedand the rest of itwhat is it but the cry of the dog with the chewed ear the dog that is chewing foregoes the advantage of song  human contests engaging any number of contestants are not struggles of principles but struggles of interests and this is no less true of those decided by the ballot than of those in which the franker bullet gives judgment nor but from considerations of prudence and expediency will either party hesitate to transgress the limits of the law and outrage the sense of right at homestead and wardner the laborers committed robbery pillage and murder as striking workmen invariably do when they dare and as cowardly newspapers and scoundrel politicians encourage them in doing but what would you have they conceive it to be to their interest to do these things if capitalists conceive it to be to theirs they too would do them they do not do them for their interest lies in the supremacy of the lawunder which they can suffer loss but do not suffer hunger  but they do murder say the labor unions they bring in gangs of armed mercenaries who shoot down honest workmen striving for their rights this is the baldest nonsense as they know very well who utter it the pinkerton men are mere mercenaries and have no right place in our system but there have been no instances of their attacking men not engaged in some unlawful prank in the fight at homestead the workmen were actually intrenched on premises belonging to the other side where they had not the ghost of a legal right to be american working men are not fools they know well enough when they are rogues but confession is not among the military virtues and the question is roguery expedient is not so simple that it can be determined by asking the first preacher you meet  it would be very nice and fine all round if idle workmen would not riot nor idle employers meet force with force but invoke the impossible sheriff when the dragon has been chained in the bottomless pit and we are living under the rule of the saints things will be so ordered but in these rascal times revolutions are not made with rosewater and this is a revolution what is being revolutionized is the relation between our old friends capital and labor the relation has already been altered many times doubtless once we know within the period covered by history at least in the countries that we call civilized the relation was formerly a severely simple onethe capitalist owned the laborer of the difficulty and the cost of abolishing that system it is needless to speak at length through centuries of time and with an appalling sacrifice of life the effort has gone on a continuous war characterized by monstrous infractions of law and morals by incalculable cruelty and crime our own generation has witnessed the culminating triumphs of this revolution and of its three mightiest leaders the assassination of two the death in exile of the third and now while still the clank of the falling chains is echoing through the world and still a mighty multitude of the worlds workers is in bondage under the old system the others for whose liberation was all this expense of spirit in a waste of shame are sharply challenging the advantage of the new the new is in troth breaking down at every point the relation of employer and employee is giving but little better satisfaction than that of master and slave the difference between the two is indeed not nearly so broad as we persuade ourselves to think it in many of the industries there is practically no difference at all and the tendency is more and more to effacement of the difference where it exists  labor unions strikes and rioting are no new remedies for this insidious disorder they were common in ancient rome and still more ancient egypt in the twentyninth year of rameses iii a deputation of workmen employed in the theban necropolis met the superintendent and the priests with a statement of their grievances behold said the spokesman we are brought to the verge of famine we have neither food nor oil nor clothing we have no fish we have no vegetables already we have sent up a petition to our sovereign lord the pharaoh praying that he will give us these things and we are going to appeal to the governor that we may have the wherewithal to live the response to this complaint was one days rations of corn this appears to have been enough only while it lasted for a few weeks later the workmen were in open revolt thrice they broke out of their quarter rioting like mad and defying the police whether they were finally shot full of arrows by the pinkerton men of the period the record does not state  organized discontent in the laboring population is no new thing under the sun but in this century and country it has a new opportunity and omniscience alone can forecast the outcome of one thing we may be very sure and the sooner the capitalist can persuade himself to discern it the sooner will his eyes guard his neck the relations between those who are able to live without physical toil and those who are not are a long way from final adjustment but are about to undergo a profound and essential alteration that this is to come by peaceful evolution is a hope which has nothing in history to sustain it there are to be bloody noses and cracked crowns and the good people who suffer themselves to be shocked by such things in others will have a chance to try them for themselves the working man is not troubling himself greatly about a just allotment of these blessings so that the greater part go to those who do not work with their hands he will not consider too curiously any persons claim to exemption it would perhaps better harmonize with his sense of the fitness of things as it would no doubt with that of the angels if the advantages of the transitional period fell mostly to the share of such starspangled impostors as andrew carnegie but almost any distribution that is sufficiently objectionable as a whole to the other side will be acceptable to the distributor in the mean time it is to be wished that the moralize and homilizers who prate of principles may have a little damnation dealt out to them on account the head that is unable to entertain a philosophical view of the situation would be notably advantaged by removal     iii  it is the immigration of the oppressed of all nations that has made this country one of the worst on the face of the earth the change from good to bad took place within a generationso quickly that few of us have had the nimbleness of apprehension to get it through our heads we go on screaming our eagle in the selfsame note of triumph that we were taught at our fathers knees before the eagle became a buzzard america is still an asylum for the oppressed and still as always and everywhere the oppressed are unworthy of asylum avenging upon those who give them sanctuary the wrongs from which they fled the saddest thing about oppression is that it makes its victims unfit for anything but to be oppressedmakes them dangerous alike to their tyrants their saviors and themselves in the end they turn out to be fairly energetic oppressors the gentleman in the cesspool invites compassion certainly but we may be very well assured before undertaking his relief without a pole that his conception of a prosperous life is merely to have his nose above the surface with another gentleman underfoot  all languages are spoken in hell but chiefly those of southeastern europe i do not say that a man fresh from the fields or the factories of europeeven of southeastern europemay not be a good man i say only that as a matter of fact he commonly is not in nine instances in ten he is a brute whom it would be gods mercy to drown on his arrival for he is constitutionally unhappy  let us not deny him his grievance he workswhen he worksfor men no better than himself he is required in many instances to take a part of his pay in truck at prices of breathless altitude and the pay itself is inadequatehardly more than double what he could get in his own country against all this his howl is justified but his rioting and assassination are notnot even when directed against the property and persons of his employers when directed against the persons of other laborers who choose to exercise the fundamental human right to work for whom and for what pay they pleasewhen he denies this right and with it the right of organized society to exist the necessity of shooting him is not only apparent it is conspicuous and imperative that he and his horrible kind of whatever nationality are usually forgiven this just debt of nature and suffered to execute like rivers their annual spring rise constitutes the most valid of the many indictments that decent americans by birth or adoption find against the feeble form of government under which their country groans a nation that will not enforce its laws has no claim to the respect and allegiance of its people  this citizen soldiery business is a ghastly failure the national guard is not worth the price of its uniforms it is intended to be a greater constabulary its purpose is to suppress disorders with which the civil authorities are too feeble to cope how often does it do so nine times in ten it fraternizes with or is cowed or beaten by the savage mobs which it is called upon to kill in a country with a competent militia and competent men to use it there would be crime enough and some to spare but no rioting rioting in a republic is without a shadow of excuse if we have bad laws or if our good laws are not enforced if corporations and capital are tyrannous and strong if white men murder one another and black men outrage white women all this is our own faultthe fault of those among others who seek redress or revenge by rioting and lynching the people have always as good government as good industrial conditions as effective protection of person property and liberty as they deserve they can have what ever they have the honesty to desire and the sense to set about getting in the right way if as citizens of a republic we lack the virtue and intelligence rightly to use the supreme power of the ballot so that it       executes a freemans will      as lightning does the will of god  we are unfit to be citizens of a republic undeserving of peace prosperity and liberty and have no right to rise against conditions due to our own moral and intellectual delinquency there is a simple way messieurs the masses to correct public evils put wise and good men into power if you can not do that for you are not yourselves wise or will not for you are not yourselves good you deserve to be oppressed when you submit and shot when you rise  to shoot a rioter or lyncher is a high kind of mercy suppose that twentyfive years ago the longer ago the better two or three criminal mobs in succession had been exterminated in that way as the law provides suppose that several scores of lives had been so taken including even those of innocent spectatorsthough that kind of angel does not abound in the vicinity of mobs suppose that no demagogue judges had permitted officers in command of the firing lines to be persecuted in the courts suppose that these events had writ themselves large and red in the public memory how many lives would this have saved just as many as since have been taken and lost by rioters plus those that for a long time to come will be taken and minus those that were taken at that time make your own computation from your own data i insist only that a rioter shot in time saves nine  you knowyou the peoplethat all this is true you know that in a republic lawlessness is villainy entailing greater evils than it curesthat it cures none you know that even the money power is powerful only through your own dishonesty and cowardice you know that nobody can bribe or intimidate a voter who will not take a bribe or suffer himself to be intimidatedthat there can be no money power in a nation of honorable and courageous men you know that bosses and machines can not control you if you will not suffer then to divide you into parties by playing upon your credulity and senseless passions you know all this and know it all the time yet not a man has the courage to stand forth and say to your faces what you know in your hearts well messieurs the masses i dont consider you dangerousnot very i have not observed that you want to tear anybody to pieces for confessing your sins even if at the same time he confesses his own from a considerable experience in that sort of thing i judge that you rather like it and that he whom secretly you most despise is he who echoes back to you what he is pleased to think you think and flatters you for gain anyhow for some reason i never hear you speak well of newspaper men and politicians though in the shadow of your disesteem they get an occasional gleam of consolation by speaking fairly well of one another     crime and its correctives     i  sociologists have been debating the theory that the impulse to commit crime is a disease and the ayes appear to have itnot the impulse but the decision it is gratifying and profitable to have the point settled we now know where we are at and can take our course accordingly it has for a number of years been known to all but a few backnumber physicianssurvivals from an exhausted rÃ©gimethat all disease is caused by bacilli which worm themselves into the organs that secrete health and enjoin them from the performance of that rite the medical conservatives mentioned attempt to whittle away the value and significances of this theory by affirming its inadequacy to account for such disorders as broken heads sunstroke superfluous toes homesickness burns and strangulation on the gallows but against the testimony of so eminent bacteriologists as drs koch and pasteur their carping is as that of the idle angler the bacillus is not to be denied he has brought his blankets and is here to stay until evicted and eviction can not be wrought by talking doubtless we may confidently expect his eventual suppression by a fresher and more ingenious disturber of the physiological peace but the bacillus is now chief among ten thousand evils and it is futile to attempt to read him out of the party  it follows that in order to deal intelligently with the criminal impulse in our afflicted fellowcitizens we must discover the bacillus of crime to that end i think that the bodies of hanged assassins and such persons of low degree as have been gathered to their fathers by the cares of public office or consumed by the rust of inactivity in prison should be handed over to the microscopists for examination the bore too offers a fine field for research and might justly enough be examined alive whether there is one generalor as the ancient and honorable orders prefer to say grandbacillus producing a general or grand criminal impulse covering a multitude of sins or an infinite number of well defined and several bacilli each inciting to a particular crime is a question to the determination of which the most distinguished microscopist might be proud to devote the powers of his eye if the latter is the case it will somewhat complicate the treatment for clearly the patient afflicted with chronic robbery will require medicines different from those that might be efficacious in a gentleman suffering from constitutional theft or the desire to represent his district in the assembly but it is permitted to us to hope that all crimes like all arts are essentially one that murder arson and conservatism are but different symptoms of the same physical disorder back of which is a microbe vincible to a single medicament albeit the same awaits discovery  in the fascinating theory of the unity of crime we may not unreasonably hope to find another evidence of the brotherhood of man another spiritual bond tending to draw the various classes of society more closely together  from time to time it is said that a wave of some kind of crime is sweeping the country it is all nonsense about waves of crime occasionally occurs some crime notable for its unusual features or for the renown of those concerned it arrests public attention which for a time is directed to that particular kind of crane and the newspapers with businesslike instinct give for a season unusual prominence to the record of similar offenses then selfdeceived they talk about a wave or epidemic of it so far is this from the truth that one of the most noticeable characteristics of crime is the steady and unbroken monotony of its occurrence in certain forms there is nothing so dull and unvarying as this tedious uniformity of repetition the march of crime is never retarded never accelerated the criminals appear to be thoroughly well satisfied with their annual average as shown by the periodical reports of their secretary the statistician  a marked illustration occurs to me many years ago in london a wellknown and respectable gentleman was brutally garroted it was during the silly seasonbetween sessions of parliament when the newspapers are likely to be dull they at once began to report cases of garroting there appeared to be an epidemic of garroting the public mind was terribly excited and when parliament met it hastened to pass the infamous flogging acta distinct reversion to the senseless and discredited methods of physical torture so alluring to the half instructed mind of the average journalist of today yet the statistics published by the home secretary under whose administration the act was passed show that neither at the time of the alarm was there any material increase of garroting nor in the period of public tranquillity succeeding was there any appreciable diminution     ii  by advocating painless removal of incurable idiots and lunatics incorrigible criminals and irreclaimable drunkards from this vale of tears dr w duncan mckim provoked many a respectable but otherwise blameless person to throw a catfit of great complexity and power yet dr mckim seemed only to anticipate the trend of public opinion and forecast its crystallization into law it is rapidly becoming a question of not what we ought to do with these unfortunates but what we shall be compelled to do study of the statistics of the matter shows that in all civilized countries mental and moral diseases are increasing proportionately to population at a rate which in the course of a few generations will make it impossible for the healthy to care for the afflicted to do so will require the entire revenue which it is possible to raise by taxationwill absorb all the profits of all the industries and professions and make deeper and deeper inroads upon the capital from which they are derived when it comes to that there can be but one result high and humanizing sentiments are angel visitants whom we entertain with pride and pleasure but when fine entertainment becomes too costly to be borne we speed the parting guest forthwith and it may happen that in inviting to his vacant place a less exciting successorthat in replacing sentiment with reasonwe shall in this instance learn to our joy that we do but entertain another angel for nothing is so heavenly as reason nothing is so sweet and compassionate as her voice       not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose      but musical as is apollos lute  is it cruel is it heartless is it barbarous to use something of the same care in breeding men and women as in breeding horses and dogs here is a determining question knowing yourself doomed to hopeless idiocy lunacy crime or drunkenness would you or would you not welcome a painless death let us assume that you would upon what ground then would you deny to another a boon that you would desire for yourself     iii  the good american is as a rule pretty hard upon roguery but he atones for his austerity by an amiable toleration of rogues his only requirement is that he must personally know the rogues we all denounce thieves loudly enough if we have not the honor of their acquaintance if we have why that is differentunless they have the actual odor of the prison about them we may know them guilty but we meet them shake hands with them drink with them and if they happen to be wealthy or otherwise great invite them to our houses and deem it an honor to frequent theirs we do not approve their methodslet that be understood and thereby they are sufficiently punished the notion that a knave cares a pin what is thought of his ways by one who is civil and friendly to himself appears to have been invented by a humorist on the vaudeville stage of mars it would probably have made his fortune if warrants of arrest were out for every man in this country who is conscious of having repeatedly shaken hands with persons whom he knew to be knaves there would be no guiltless person to serve them  i know men standing high in journalism who today will expose and bitterly denounce a certain rascality and tomorrow will be hobnobbing with the rascals whom they have named i know legislators of renown who habitually in the halls of legislation raise their voices against the dishonest schemes of some trust magnate and are habitually seen in familiar conversation with him indubitably these be hypocrites all between the head and the heart of such a man is a wall of adamant and neither organ knows what the other is doing  if social recognition were denied to rogues they would be fewer by many some would only the more diligently cover their tracks along the devious paths of unrighteousness but others would do so much violence to their consciences as to renounce the disadvantages of rascality for those of an honest life an unworthy person dreads nothing so much as the withholding of an honest hand the slow inevitable stroke of an ignoring eye  for one having knowledge of mr john d rockefellers social life and connections it would be easy to name a dozen men and women who by a conspiracy of conscription could profoundly affect the plans and profits of the standard oil company i have been asked if john d rockefeller were introduced to you by a friend would you refuse to take his hand i certainly shouldand if ever thereafter i took the hand of that hardy friend it would be after his repentance and promise to reform his ways we have rockefellers and morgans because we have respectable persons who are not ashamed to take them by the hand to be seen with them to say that they know them in such it is treachery to censure them to cry out when robbed by them is to turn states evidence  one may smile upon a rascal most of us do so many times a day if one does not know him to be a rascal and has not said he is but knowing him to be or having said he is to smile upon him is to be a hypocritejust a plain hypocrite or a sycophantic hypocrite according to the station in life of the rascal smiled upon there are more plain hypocrites than sycophantic ones for there are more rascals of no consequence than rich and distinguished ones though they get fewer smiles each the american people will be plundered as long as the american character is what it is as long as it is tolerant of successful knavery as long as american ingenuity draws an imaginary distinction between a mans public character and his privatehis commercial and his personal in brief the american people will be plundered as long as they deserve to be plundered no human law can stop it none ought to stop it for that would abrogate a higher and more salutary law as ye sow ye shall reap  in a sermon by the rev dr parkhurst is the following the story of all our lords dealings with sinners leaves upon the mind the invariable impression if only the story be read sympathetically and earnestly that he always felt kindly towards the transgressor but could have no tenderness of regard toward the transgression there is no safe and successful dealing with sin of any kind save as that distinction is appreciated and made a continual factor in our feelings and efforts  with all due respect for dr parkhurst that is nonsense if he will read his new testament more understandingly he will observe that christs kindly feeling to transgressors was not to be counted on by sinners of every kind and it was not always in evidence for example when he flogged the moneychangers out of the temple nor is dr parkhurst himself any too amiably disposed toward the children of darkness it is not by mild words and gentle means that he has hurled the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree such revolutions as he set afoot are not made with spiritual rosewater there must be the contagion of a noble indignation fueled with harder wood than abstractions the people can not be collected and incited to take sides by the spectacle of a man fighting something that does not fight back it is men that dr parkhurst is trouncingnot their crimesnot crime he may fancy himself dowered with the hate of hate the scorn of scorn but in reality he does not hate hate but hates the hateful and scorns not scorn but the scornworthy  it is singular with what tenacity that amusing though mischievous superstition keeps its hold upon the human mindthat grave bona fide personification of abstractions and the funny delusion that it is possible to hate or love them sin is not a thing there is no existing object corresponding to any of the mere counterwords that are properly named abstract nouns one can no more hate sin or love virtue than one can hate a vacuum which natureitself imaginarywas once by the scientists of the period solemnly held to do or love one of the three dimensions we may think that while loving a sinner we hate the sin but that is not so if anything is hated it is other sinners of the same kind who are not quite so close to us  but says citizen goodheart who thinks with difficulty shall i throw over my friend when he is in trouble yes when you are convinced that he deserves to be in trouble throw him all the harder and the further because he is your friend in addition to his particular offense against society he has disgraced you if there are to be lenity and charity let them go to the criminal who has foreborne to involve you in his shame it were a pretty state of affairs if an undetected scamp fearing exposure could make you a codefendant by so easy a precaution as securing your acquaintance and regard dont throw the first stone of course but when convinced that your friend is a proper target heave away with a right hearty goodwill and let the stone be of serviceable dimensions scabrous textured flintwise and delivered with a good aim  the french have a saying to the effect that to know all is to pardon all and doubtless with an omniscient insight into the causes of character we should find the field of moral responsibility pretty thickly strewn with extenuating circumstances very suitable indeed for consideration by a god who has had a hand in besetting with pitfall and with gin the road we are to wander in but i submit that universal forgiveness would hardly do as a working principle even those who are most apt and facile with the incident of the woman taken in adultery commonly cherish a secret respect for the doctrine of eternal damnation and some of them are known to pin their faith to the penal code of their state moreover there is some reason to believe that the sinning woman being taken was penitentthey usually are when found out  i care nothing about principlesthey are lumber and rubbish what concerns our happiness and welfare as affectible by our fellowmen is conduct principles not men is a rogues cry rascalitys counsel to stupidity the noise of the duper duping on his dupe he shouts it most loudly and with the keenest sense of its advantage who most desires inattention to his own conduct or to that forecast of it his character as to sin that has an abundance of expounders and is already universally known to be wicked what more can be said against it and why go on repeating that the thing is a trifle wordworn whereas the sinner cometh up as a flower every day fresh ingenious and inviting sin is not at all dangerous to society it is the sinner that does all the mischief sin has no arms to thrust into the public treasury and the private no hands with which to cut a throat no tongue to wreck a reputation withal i would no more attack it than i would attack an isosceles triangle a vacuum or humes phantasm floating in a void my chosen enemy must be something that has a skin for my switch a head for my cudgelsomething that can smart and ache and if so minded fight back i have no quarrel with abstractions so far as i know they are all good citizens     the death penalty     i  down with the gallows is a cry not unfamiliar in america there is always a movement afoot to make odious the just principle of a life for a lifeto represent it as a relic of barbarism a usurpation of the divine authority and the rotten rest of it the law making murder punishable by death is as purely a measure of selfdefense as is the display of a pistol to one diligently endeavoring to kill without provocation even the most brainless opponent of capital punishment would do that if he knew enough it is in precisely the same sense an admonition a warning to abstain from crime society says by that law if you kill one of us you die just as by display of the pistol the individual whose life is attacked says desist or be shot to be effective the warning in either case must be more than an idle threat even the most unearthly reasoner among the gallowsdowning unfortunates would hardly expect to frighten away an assassin who knew the pistol to be unloaded of course these queer illogicians can not be made to understand that their position commits them to absolute nonresistance to any kind of aggression and that is fortunate for the rest of us for if as christians they frankly and consistently took that ground we should be under the miserable necessity of respecting them  we have good reason to hold that the horrible prevalence of murder in this country is due to the fact that we do not execute our lawsthat the death penalty is threatened but not inflictedthat the pistol is not loaded in civilized countries where there is enough respect for the laws to administer them there is enough to obey them while man still has as much of the ancestral brute as his skin can hold widiout cracking we shall have thieves and demagogues and anarchists and assassins and persons with a private system of lexicography who define hanging as murder and murder as mischance and many another disagreeable creation but in all this welter of crime and stupidity are areas where human life is comparatively secure against the human hand it is at least a significant coincidence that in these the death penalty for murder is fairly well enforced by judges who do not derive any part of their authority from those for whose restraint and punishment they hold it against the life of one guiltless person the lives of ten thousand murderers count for nothing their hanging is a public good without reference to the crimes that disclose their deserts if we could discover them by other signs than their bloody deeds they should be hanged anyhow unfortunately we must have a death as evidence the scientists who will tell us how to recognize the potential assassin and persuade us to kill him will be the greatest benefactor of his century  what would these enemies of the gibbet havethese lineal descendants of the drunken mobs that pelted the hangmen at tyburn tree this progeny of criminals which has so defiled with the mud of its animosity the noble office of public executioner that even in this enlightened age he shirks his high duty entrusting it to a hidden or unnamed subordinate if murder is unjust of what importance is it whether its punishment by death be just or notnobody needs to incur it  men are not drafted for the death penalty they volunteer then it is not deterrent mutters the gentleman whose rude forefather pelted the hangman well as to that the law which is to accomplish more than a part of its purpose must be awaited with great patience every murder proves that hanging is not altogether deterrent every hanging that it is somewhat deterrentit deters the person hanged a mans first murder is his crime his second is ours  the voice of theosophy has been heard in favor of downing the gallows as usual the voice is a trifle vague and it babbles clear speech is the outcome of clear thought and that is something to which theosophists are not addicted considering their infirmity in that way it would be hardly fair to take them as seriously as they take themselves but when any considerable number of apparently earnest citizens unite in a petition to the governor of their state to commute the death sentence of a convicted assassin without alleging a doubt of his guilt the phenomenon challenges a certain attention to what they do allege what these amiable persons hold it seems is what was held by alphonse karr the expediency of abolishing the death penalty but apparently they do not hold with him that the assassins should begin they want the state to begin believing that the magnanimous example will effect a change of heart in those about to murder this i take it is the meaning of their assertion that death penalties have not the deterring influence which imprisonment for life carries in this they obviously err death deters at least the person who suffers ithe commits no more murder whereas the assassin who is imprisoned for life and immune from further punishment may with impunity kill his keeper or whomsoever he may be able to get at even as matters now are the most incessant vigilance is required to prevent convicts in prison from murdering their attendants and one another how would it be if the lifetermer were assured against any additional inconvenience for braining a guard occasionally or strangling a chaplain now and then a penitentiary may be described as a place of punishment and reward and under the system proposed the difference in desirableness between a sentence and an appointment would be virtually effaced to overcome this objection a life sentence would have to mean solitary confinement and that means insanity is that what these theosophical gentlemen propose to substitute for death  these petitioners call the death penalty a relic of barbarism which is neither conclusive nor true what is required is not loose assertion and dogseared phrases but evidence of futility or in lack of that cogent reasoning it is true that the most barbarous nations inflict the death penalty most frequently and for the greatest number of offenses but that is because barbarians are more criminal in instinct and less easily controlled by gentle methods than civilized peoples that is why we call them barbarous it is not so very long since our english ancestors punished more than forty kinds of crime with death the fact that the hangman the boilerinoil and the breakeronthewheel had their hands full does not show that the laws were futile it shows that the dear old boys from whom we are proud to derive ourselves were a bad lotof which we have abundant corroborative evidence in their brutal pastimes and in their manners and customs generally to have restrained that crowd by the rosewater methods of modern penologythat is unthinkable  the death penalty say the memorialists creates bloodthirstiness in the unthinking masses and defeats its own ends it is a cause of murder not a check these gentlemen are themselves of the unthinking massesthey do not know how to think let them try to trace and lucidly expound the chain of motives lying between the knowledge that a murderer has been hanged and the wish to commit a murder how precisely does the one beget the other by what unearthly process of reasoning does a man turning away from the gallows persuade himself that it is expedient to incur the danger of hanging let us have pointed out to us the several steps in that remarkable mental progress obviously the thing is absurd one might as reasonably say that contemplation of a pitted face will make a man go and catch smallpox or the spectacle of an amputated limb on the scrapheap of a hospital tempt him to cut off his arm  an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth says the theosophist is not justice it is revenge and unworthy of a christian civilization it is exact justice nobody can think of anything more accurately just than such punishments would be whatever the motive in awarding them unfortunately such a system is not practicable but he who denies its absolute justice must deny also the justice of a bushel of corn for a bushel of corn a dollar for a dollar service for service we can not undertake by such clumsy means as laws and courts to do to the criminal exactly what he has done to his victim but to demand a life for a life is simple practicable expedient and therefore right  here are two of these gentlemens dicta between which they inserted the one just considered though properly they should go together in frank inconsistency  6 it the death penalty punishes the innocent a thousand times more than the guilty death is merciful to the tortures which the living relatives must undergo and they have committed no crime  8 death penalties have not the deterring influence which imprisonment for life carries mere death is not dreaded see the number of suicides hopeless captivity is much more severe  merely noting that the living relatives whose sorrows so sympathetically affect these softhearted and softheaded persons are those of the murderer not those of his victim let us consider what they really say not what they think they say death is no very great punishment for the criminal doesnt mind it much but hopeless captivity is a very great punishment indeed therefore let us spare the assassins family the tortures they will suffer if we inflict the lighter penalty let us make it easier for them by inflicting the severer one  there is sense for yousense of the sound old fruity theosophical sortthe kind of sense that has lifted the beautiful cult out of the dark domain of reason into the serene altitudes of inexpressible thrill  as to hopeless captivity though there is no such thing in legislation today can not bind tomorrow by an act of the legislatureeven by a constitutional prohibition we may do away with the pardoning power but laws can be repealed constitutions amended  the public has a short memory signatures to petitions in the line of mercy are had for the asking and tenderhearted governors are familiar afflictions we have life sentences already and sometimes they are served to the endif the end comes soon enough but the average length of life imprisonment is i am told a little more than seven years hope springs eternal in the human beast and matters simply can not be so arranged that in entering the penitentiary he will leave hope behind hopeless captivity is a dream  i quote again  9 life imprisonment is the natural and humane check upon one who has proven his unfitness for freedom by taking life deliberately  what it is no longer much more severe than the relic of barbarism in the course of a half dozen lines of petition it has become humane truly these are lightning changes of character it would be pleasing to know just what these worthy theosophers have the happiness to think that they think  it is the only punishment that receives the consent of conscience  that is to say their conscience and that of the convicted assassin  taking the life of a murderer does not restore the life he took therefore it is a most illogical punishment two wrongs do not make a right  heres richness hanging an assassin is illogical because it does not restore the life of his victim incarceration does therefore incarceration is logicalquod erat demonstrandum  two wrongs certainly do not make a right but the veritable thing in dispute is whether taking the life of a lifetaker is a wrong so naked and unashamed an example of petitio principii would disgrace a debater in a pinafore and these wondermongers have the incredible effrontery to babble of logic why if one of them were to meet a syllogism in a lonely road he would run away in a hundred and fifty directions as hard as ever he could hook it one is almost ashamed to dispute with such intellectual cloudings  whatever an individual may rightly do to protect himself society may rightly do to protect him for he is a part of itself if he may rightly take life in defending himself society may rightly take life in defending him if society may rightly take life in defending him it may rightly threaten to take it having rightly and mercifully threatened to take it it not only rightly may take it but expediently must  the law of a life for a life does not altogether prevent murder no law can altogether prevent any form of crime nor is it desirable that it should doubtless god could so have created us that our sense of right and justice could have existed without contemplation of injustice and wrong as doubtless he could so have created us that we could have felt compassion without a knowledge of suffering but doubtless he did not constituted as we are we can know good only by contrast with evil our sense of sin is what our virtues feed upon in the thin air of universal morality the altarfires of honor and the beacons of conscience could not be kept alight a community without crime would be a community without warm and elevated sentimentswithout the sense of justice without generosity without courage without magnanimitya community of small smug souls uninteresting to god and uncoveted by the devil we can have too much of crime no doubt what the wholesome proportion is none can say just now we are running a good deal to murder but he who can gravely attribute that phenomenon or any part of it to infliction of the death penalty instead of virtual immunity from any penalty at all is justly entitled to the innocent satisfaction that comes of being a simpleton  the new woman is against the death penalty naturally for she is hot and hardy in the conviction that whatever is is wrong she has visited this world in order to straighten things about a bit and is in distress lest the number of things be insufficient to her need the matter is important variously not least so in its relation to the new heaven and the new earth that are to be the outcome of woman suffrage there can be no doubt that the vast majority of women have sentimental objections to the death penalty that quite outweigh such practical considerations in its favor as they can be persuaded to comprehend aided by the minority of men afflicted by the same mental malady they will indubitably effect its abolition in the first lustrum of their political activity the new woman will scarcely feel the seat of power warm beneath her before giving to the assassins unhand me villain the authority of law so we shall make again the old experiment discredited by a thousand failures of preventing crime by tenderness to caught criminals and the criminal uncaught will treat us to a quality of toughness notably augmented by the christian spirit of the rÃ©gime     ii  as to painless executions the simple and practical way to make them both just and popular is the adoption by murderers of a system of painless assassinations until this is done there seems to be no hope that the people will renounce the wholesome discomfort of the style of executions endeared to them by memories and associations of the tenderest character there is also i fancy a shaping notion in the public mind that the penologists and their allies have gone about as far as they can safely be permitted to go in the direction of a softer suasion of the criminal nature toward good behavior the modern prison has become a rather more comfortable habitation than the dangerous classes are accustomed to at home modern prison life has in their eyes something of the charm and glamor of an ideal existence like that in the happy valley from which rasselas had the folly to escape whatever advantages to the public may be secured by abating the rigors of imprisonment and inconveniences incident to execution there is this objection it makes them less deterrent let the penologers and philanthrope have their way and even hanging might be made so pleasant and withal so interesting a social distinction that it would deter nobody but the person hanged adopt the euthanasian method of electricity asphyxia by smothering in roseleaves or slow poisoning with rich food and the death penalty may come to be regarded as the object of a noble ambition to the bon vivant and the rising young suicide may go and murder somebody else instead of himself in order to receive a happier dispatch than his own prentice hand can assure him  but the advocates of agreeable pains and penalties tell us that in the darker ages when cruel and degrading punishment was the rule and was freely inflicted for every light infraction of the law crime was more common than it is now and in this they appear to be right but they one and all overlook a fact equally obvious and vastly significant that the intellectual moral and social condition of the masses was very low crime was more common because ignorance was more common poverty was more common sins of authority and therefore hatred of authority were more common the world of even a century ago was a quite different world from the world of today and a vastly more uncomfortable one the popular adage to the contrary notwithstanding human nature was not by a long cut the same then that it is now in the very ancient time of that early english king george iii when women were burned at the stake in public for various offenses and men were hanged for coining and children for theft and in the still remoter period circa 1530 when poisoners were boiled in several waters divers sorts of criminals were disemboweled and some are thought to have undergone the pÃªne forte et dure of coldpressing an infliction which the pen of hugo has since made popularin literaturein these wicked old days it is possible that crime flourished not because of the laws severity but in spite of it it is possible that our respected and respectable ancestors understood the situation as it then was a trifle better than we can understand it on the hither side of this gulf of years and that they were not the reasonless barbarians that we think them to have been and if they were what must have been the unreason and barbarity of the criminal element with which they had to deal  i am far from thinking that severity of punishment can have the same restraining effect as probability of some punishment being inflicted but if mildness of penalty is to be superadded to difficulty of conviction and both are to be mounted upon laxity in detection the pile will be complete with a vengeance there is a peculiar fitness perhaps in the fact that all these ideas for comfortable punishment should be urged at a time when there appears to be a tolerably general disposition to inflict no punishment at all there are however still a few oldfashioned persons who hold it obvious that one who is ambitious to break the laws of his country will not with as light a heart and as airy an indifference incur the peril of a harsh penalty as he will the chance of one more nearly resembling that which he would select for himself     iii  after lying for more than a century dead i was revived given a new body and restored to society this was in the year 2015 the first thing of interest that i observed was an enormous building covering a square mile of ground it was surrounded on all sides by a high strong wall of hewn stone upon which armed sentinels paced to and fro in one face of the wall was a single gate of massive iron strongly guarded while admiring the cyclopean architecture of the reverend pile i was accosted by a man in uniform evidently the warden with a cheerful salutation  colonel i said pressing his hand it gives me pleasure to find some one that i can believe pray tell me what is this building  that said the colonel is the new state penitentiary it is one of twelve all alike  you surprise me i replied surely the criminal element must have increased enormously  yes indeed he assented under the reform rÃ©gime which began in your day it became so powerful bold and fierce that arrests were no longer possible and the prisons then in existence were soon overcrowded the state was compelled to erect others of greater capacity  but colonel i protested if the criminals were too bold and powerful to be taken into custody of what use are the prisons and how are they crowded  he fixed upon me a look that i could not fail to interpret as expressing a doubt of my sanity what he said is it possible that the modern penology is unknown to you do you suppose we practise the antiquated and ineffective method of shutting up the rascals sir the growth of the criminal element has as i said compelled the erection of more and larger prisons we have enough to hold comfortably all the honest men and women of the state within these protecting walls they carry on all the necessary vocations of life excepting commerce that is necessarily in the hands of the rogues as before  venerated representative of reform i exclaimed wringing his hand with effusion you are knowledge you are history you are the higher education we must talk further come let us enter this benign edifice you shall show me your dominion and instruct me in the rules you shall propose me as an inmate  i walked rapidly to the gate when challenged by the sentinel i turned to summon my instructor he was nowhere visible desolate and forbidding as about the broken statue of ozymandias       the lone and level sands stretched far away     religion     i  this is my ultimate and determining test of rightwhat in the circumstances would christ have donethe christ of the new testament not the christ of the commentators theologians priests and parsons the test is perhaps not infallible but it is exceedingly simple and gives as good practical results as any i am not a christian but so far as i know the best and truest and sweetest character in literature is next to buddha jesus christ he taught nothing new in goodness for all goodness was ages old before he came but with an almost infallible intuition he applied to life and conduct the entire law of righteousness he was a lightning moral calculator to his luminous intelligence the statement of the problem carried the solutionhe could not hesitate he seldom erred that upon his deeds and words was founded a religion which in a debased form persists and even spreads to this day is mere attestation of his marvelous gift adoration is a primitive mode of recognition  it seems a pity that this wonderful man had not a longer life under more complex conditionsconditions more nearly identical with those of the modern world and the future one would like to be able to see through the eyes of his biographers his genius applied to more and more difficult questions yet one can hardly go wrong in inference of his thought and act in many of the complexities and entanglements of modern affairs it is no easy matter to find an answer offhand to the questionwhat is it right to do but put it in another way what would christ have done and lo there is light i doubt spreads her batlike wings and is away the sun of truth springs into the sky splendoring the path of right and marking that of error with a deeper shade     ii  gentlemen of the secular press dealt with the rev mr sheldon not altogether fairly to some very relevant considerations they gave no weight it was not fair for example to say as the distinguished editor of the north american review did that in professing to conduct a daily newspaper for a week as he conceived that christ would have conducted it mr sheldon acted the part of a notoriety seeking mountebank it seldom is fair to go into the question of motive for that is something upon which one has the least light even when the motive is ones own the motives that we think dominale us seem simple and obvious they are in most instances exceedingly complex and obscure complacently surveying the wreck and ruin that he has wrought even that great anarch the well meaning person can not have entire assurance that he meant as well as the disastrous results appear to him to show  the trouble with mr harvey of the review was inability to put himself in anothers place if that happened to be at any considerable distance from his own place he made no allowance for the difference in the point of viewfor the difference that is between his mind and the mind of mr sheldon if mr harvey had undertaken to conduct that kansas newspaper as christ would have done he would indeed have been a notoriety seeking mountebank or some similarly unenviable thing for only a selfish purpose could persuade him to an obviously resultless work but mr sheldon was differenthis was the religious minda mind having faith in an overruling providence who can and frequently does interfere with the orderly relation of cause and effect accomplishing an end by means otherwise inadequate to its production believing himself a faithful servant of that power and asking daily for its interposition for promotion of a highly moral purpose why should he not have expected his favor to the enterprise to expect that was in mr sheldon natural reasonable wise his folly lay in believing in conditions making it expectable a person convinced that the law of gravitation is suspended is no fool for walking into a bog mr harvey may understand but mr sheldon can not understand that jesus christ would not edit a newspaper at all  the religious mind it should be understood is not logical it may acquire as whateleys did a certain familiarity with the syllogism as an abstraction but of the syllogisms practical application its real relation to the phenomena of thought the religious mind can know nothing that is merely to say that the mind congenitally gifted with the power of logic and accessible to its light and leading does not take to religion which is a matter not of reason but of feelingnot of the head but of the heart religions are conclusions for which the facts of nature supply no major premises they are accepted or rejected according to the original mental makeup of the person to whom they appeal for recognition believers and unbelievers are like two boys quarreling across a wall each got to his place by means of a ladder they may fight if they will but neither can kick away the others support  believing the things that he did believe mr sheldon was entirely right in thinking that the main purpose of a newspaper should be the salvation of souls if his religious belief is true that should be the main purpose not only of a newspaper but of everything that has a purpose or can be given one if we have immortal souls and the consequences of our deeds in the body reach over into another life in another world determining there our eternal state of happiness or pain that is the most momentous fact conceivable it is the only momentous fact all others are chaff and rags a man who believing it to be a fact does not make it the one purpose of his life to save his soul and the souls of others that are willing to be saved is a fool and a rogue if he think that any part of this only needful work can be done by turning a newspaper into a gruelpot he ought to do so or preferably perish in the attempt  the talk of degrading the sacred name and all that is mostly nonsense if one may not test his conduct in this life by reference to the highest standard that his religion affords it is not easy to see how religion is to be made anything but a mere body of doctrine i do not think the christian religion will ever be seriously discredited by an attempt to determine even with too dim a light what under given circumstances the man miscalled its founder would do what else is his great example good for but it is not always enough to ask oneself how would christ do this one should first consider whether christ would do it it is conceivable that certain of his thrifty contemporaries may have asked him how he would change money in the temple  if mr sheldons critics were unfair his defenders were as a rule not much better they meant to be fair but they had to be foolish for example there is the rev dr parkhurst whose defence was published with mr harveys attack i shall give a single illustration of how this more celebrated than cerebrated divine is pleased to think that he thinks he is replying to some ones application to this matter of christs injunction lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth this command he gravely says is not against money nor against the making of money but against the loving it for its own sake and the dedicating of it to selfaggrandizing uses i call this a foolish utterance because it violates the good old rule of not telling an obvious falsehood in no word nor syllable does christs injunction give the least color of truth to the reverend gentlemans interpretation that is the reverend gentlemans very own and doubtless he feels an honest pride in it it is the product of a controversial needa characteristic attempt to crawl out of a hole in an enclosure which he was not invited to enter the words need no interpretation are capable of none are as clear and unambiguous a proposition as language can frame moreover they are consistent with all that we think we know of their authors life and character for he not only lived in poverty and taught poverty as a blessing but commanded it as a duty and a means of salvation the probable effect of universal obedience among those who adore him as a god is not at present an urgent question i think even so faithful a disciple as the rev dr parkhurst has still a place to lay his head a little of the wherewithal to be clothed and a good deal of the power of interpretation to excuse it     iii  there are other hypocrites than those of the pulpit dr gatling the ingenious scoundrel who invented the gun that bears his name with commendable fortitude says he has given much thought to the task of bringing the forces of war to such perfection that war will be no more commonly the man who talks of war becoming so destructive as to be impossible is only a harmless lunatic but this fellow utters his cant to conceal his cupidity if he thought there was any danger of the nations beating their swords into plowshares we should see him take the stump against agriculture forthwith the same is true of all military inventors they are lions parasites themselves of cold blood they fatten upon hot the sheepticks paler fare is not at all to their taste  i sometimes wish i were a preacher preachers do so blindly ignore their shining opportunities i am indifferently versed in theologywhereof so help me heaven i do not believe one wordbut know something of religion i know for example that jesus christ was no soldier that war has two essential features which did not command his approval aggression and defence no man can either attack or defend and remain christian and if no man no nation i could quote texts by the hour proving that christ taught not only absolute abstention from violence but absolute nonresistance now what do we see nearly all the socalled christian nations of the world sweating and groaning under their burdens of debt contracted in violation of these injunctions which they believe divinecontracted in perfecting their means of offense and defense we must have the best they cry and if armor plates for ships were better when alloyed with silver and guns if banded with gold such armor plates would be put upon the ships such guns would be freely made no sooner does one nation adopt some rascals costly device for taking life or protecting it from the taker and these soulless inventors will as readily sell the product of their malign ingenuity to one nation as to another than all the rest either possess themselves of it or adopt something superior and more expensive and so all pay the penalty for the sins of each a hundred million dollars is a moderate estimate of what it has cost the world to abstain from strangling the infant gatling in his cradle  you may say if you will that primitive christianitythe christianity of christis not adapted to these roughandtumble times that it is not a practical scheme of conduct as you please i have not undertaken to say what it is not but what it partly is i am no christian though i think that christ probably knew what was good for man about as well as dr gatling or the united states ordnance office it is not for me to defend christianity christ did not nevertheless i can not forbear the wish that i were a preacher in order sincerely to affirm that the awful burdens borne by modern nations are obvious judgments of heaven for disobedience to the prince of peace what a striking theme to kindle fires upon the heights of imaginationto fill the secret sources of eloquenceto stir the very stones in the temple of truth what a noble subject for the pious gentlemen who serve with rank pay and allowances as chaplains in the army and the navy or the civilian divines who offer prayer at the launching of an ironclad     iv  a matter of missionaries commonly is to the fore as a cause of quarrel among nations which have the hardihood to prefer their own religions to ours missionaries constitute in truth a perpetual menace to the national peace i dare say the most of them are conscientious men and women of a certain order of intellect they believe and from the way that they interpret their sacred book have some reason to believe that in meddling uninvited with the spiritual affairs of others they perform a work acceptable to godtheir god they think they discern a moral difference between approaching a man of another religion about the state of his soul and approaching him on the condition of his linen or the character of his wife i think there is no difference i have observed that the person who volunteers an interest in my spiritual welfare is the same person from whom i must expect an impudent concern about my temporal affairs the missionary is one who goes about throwing open the shutters of other mens bosoms in order to project upon the blank walls a shadow of himself  no ruler nor government of sense would willingly permit foreigners to sap the foundation of the national religion no ruler nor government ever does permit it except under the stress of compulsion it is through the peoples religion that a wise government governs wiselyeven in our own country we make only a transparent pretense of officially ignoring christianity and a pretense only because we have so many kinds of christians all jealous and inharmonious each sect would make this a theocracy if it could and would that make short work of any missionary from abroad happily all religions but ours have the sloth and timidity of error christianity alone drawing vigor from eternal truth is courageous enough and energetic enough to make itself a nuisance to people of every other faith the jew not only does not bid for converts but discourages them by imposition of hard conditions and the moslem true believers simple forthright method of reducing error is to cut off the head holding it i dont say that this is right i say only that being practical and comprehensible it commands a certain respect from the impartial observer not conversant with scriptural justification of the other practice  it is only where the missionaries have made themselves hated that there is any molestation of europeans engaged in the affairs of this world chinese antipathy to caucasians in china is neither a racial animosity nor a religious it is an instinctive dislike of persons who will not mind their own business china has been infested with missionaries from the earliest centuries of our era and they have rarely been molested when they have taken the trouble to behave themselves in the time of the emperor justinian the fact that the christian religion was openly preached throughout china enabled that sovereign to wrest from the chinese the jealouslyguarded secret of silkmaking he sent two monks to pekin who alternately preached seriousness and studied sericulture and who brought away silkworms eggs concealed in sticks  in religious matters the chinese are more tolerant than we they let the religions of others alone but naturally and rightly demand that others shall let theirs alone in china as in other oriental countries where the color line is not drawn and where slavery itself is a light affliction the mental attitude of the zealot who finds gratification in spreading the light of which he deems himself custodian is not understood like most things not understood it is felt to be bad and is indubitably offensive     v  at a church club meeting a paper was read by a minister entitled why the masses do not attend the churches this good and pious man was not ashamed to account for it by the fact that there is no sunday law and the masses can find recreation elsewhere even in the drinking saloons it is frank of him to admit that he and his professional brethren have not brains enough to make religious services more attractive than shaking dice for cigars or playing cards for drink but if it is a fact he must not expect the local government to assist in spreading the gospel by roundingup the people and corralling them in the churches the truth is and this gentleman suspects it that the masses stay out of hearing of his pulpit because he talks nonsense of the most fatiguing kind they would rather do any one of a thousand other things than go to hear it these parsons are like a scolding wife who grieves because her husband will not pass his evenings with her the more she grieves the more she scolds and the more diligently he keeps away from her i dont think jack satan is conspicuously wise but he is in the main a good entertainer with a right pretty knack at making people come again but the really reprehensible part of his performance is not the part that attracts them the parsons might study his methods with great advantage to religion and morality  it may be urged that religious services have not entertainment for their object but the people when not engaged in business or labor have it for their object if the clergy do not choose to adapt their ministrations to the characters of those to whom they wish to minister that is their own affair but let them accept the consequences the masses move along the line of least reluctance they do not really enjoy sunday at all they try to get through the day in the manner that is least wearisome to the spirit possibly their taste is not what it ought to be if this minister were a physician of bodies instead of souls and patients who had not called him in should refuse to take the medicine which he thought his best and they his nastiest he should either offer them another a little less disagreeable if a little less efficacious or let them alone in no case is he justified in asking the civil authority to hold their noses while he plies the spoon  the masses have not asked for churches and services they really do not care for anything of the kindwhether they ought is another matter if the clergy choose to supply them that is well and worthy but they should understand their relation to the impenitent worldling which is precisely that of a physician without a mandate from the patient who may not be convinced that there is very much the matter with him the physician may have a diploma and a state certificate authorizing him to practise but if the patient do not deem himself bound to be practised upon has the physician a right to make him miserable until he will submit clearly he has not if he can not persuade him to come to the dispensary and take medicine there is an end to the matter and he may justly conclude that he is misfitted to his vocation  i am sure that the ministers and that singularly small contingent of earnest and on the whole pretty good persons who cluster about them do not perceive how alien they are in their convictions tastes sympathies and general mental habitudes to the great majority of their fellow men and women their voices like the gushing wave which to the ears of the lotuseaters       far far away did seem to mourn and rave  come to us as from beyond a great gulfmere ghosts of sound almost destitute of signification we know that they would have us do something but what it is we do not clearly apprehend we feel that they are concerned for us but why we are imperfectly able to conceive in an intelligible tongue they tell us of unthinkable things here and there in the discourse we catch a word a phrase a sentencesomething which from ancestors whose motherspeech it was we have inherited the capacity to understand but the homily as a whole is devoid of meaning solemn and sonorous enough it all is and not unmusical but it lacks its natural accompaniment of shawm and sackbut and the windswept harp in the willows by the waters of babylon it is in fact something of a survivalthe memory of a dream     vi  the first week of january is set apart as a week of prayer it is a custom of more than a half centurys age and it seems that gracious answers have been received in proportion to the earnestness and unanimity of the petitions that is to say in this worlds speech the more christians that have prayed and the more they have meant it the better the result is known to have been i dont believe all that i dont believe that when god is asked to do something that he had not intended to do he counts noses before making up his mind whether to do it or not god probably knows the character of his work and knowing that he has made this a world of knaves and dunces he must know that the more of them that ask for something and the more loudly they ask the stronger is the presumption that they ought not to have it and i think god is perhaps less concerned about his popularity than some good folk seem to suppose  doubtless there are errors in the record of resultssome things set down as answers to prayer which came about through the orderly operation of natural laws and would have occurred anyhow i am told that similar errors have been made or are believed to have been made in the past in 1730 for example a good bishop at auvergne prayed for an eclipse of the sun as a warning to unbelievers the eclipse ensued and the pious prelate made the most of it but when it was shown that the astronomers of the period had foretold it he was a sufferer from irreverent gibes a monk of treves prayed that an enemy of the church then in paris might lose his head and it fell off but it transpired that unknown or known to the monk the man was under sentence of decapitation when the prayer was made this is related by ausolus who piously explains however that but for the prayer the sentence might perhaps have been commuted to service in the galleys i have myself known a minister to pray for rain and the rain came perhaps you can conceive his discomfiture when i showed him that the weather bureau had previously predicted a fair day  i do not object to a week of prayer but why only a week if prayer is answered christians ought to pray all the time that prayer is answered the scripture affirms as positively and unequivocally as anything can be affirmed in words all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing that ye shall receive why then when all the clergy of this country prayed publicly for the recovery of president mckinley did the man die why is it that although two pious chaplains ask almost daily that goodness and wisdom may descend upon congress congress remains wicked and unwise why is it that although in all the churches and half the dwellings of the land god is continually asked for good government good government remains what it always and everywhere has been a dream from earth to heaven in unceasing ascension flows a stream of prayer for every blessing that man desires yet man remains unblest the victim of his own folly and passions the sport of fire flood tempest and earthquake afflicted with famine and disease war poverty and crime his world an incredible welter of evil his life a labor and his hope a lie is it possible that all this praying is futilized and invalidated by the lack of faiththat the asking is not credentialed by the believing when the anointed minister of heaven spreads his palms and uprolls his eyes to beseech a general blessing or some special advantage is he the celebrant of a hollow meaningless rite or the dupe of a false promise one does not know but if one is not a fool one does know that his every resultless petition proves him by the inexorable laws of logic to be the one or the other     vii  modern christianity is beautiful exceedingly and he who admires not is eyed batly and minded as the mole sell all thou hast said christ and give to the poor allno lessin order to be saved the poor were christs peculiar care ever for them and their privations and not greatly for their spiritual darkness fell from his lips the compassionate word the mandate divine for their relief and cherishing of foreign missions of home missions of mission schools of church buildings of work among pagans in partibus infidelium of work among sailors of communion table of delegates to councilsof any of these things he knew no more than the moon man they were inventions of others as is the entire florid and flamboyant fabric of ecclesiasticism that has been reared stone by stone and century after century upon his simple life and works and words founder indeed he founded nothing instituted nothing paul did all that christ simply went about doing and being goodadmonishing the rich whom he regarded as criminals comforting the luckless and uttering wisdom with that oriental indirection wherein our stupid ingenuity finds imaginary warrant for all desiderated pranks and fads     immortality  the desire for life everlasting has commonly been affirmed to be universalat least that is the view taken by those unacquainted with oriental faiths and with oriental character those of us whose knowledge is a trifle wider are not prepared to say that the desire is universal or even general  if the devout buddhist for example wishes to live alway he has not succeeded in very clearly formulating the desire the sort of thing that he is pleased to hope for is not what we should call life and not what many of us would care for  when a man says that everybody has a horror of annihilation we may be very sure that he has not many opportunities for observation or that he has not availed himself of all that he has most persons go to sleep rather gladly yet sleep is virtual annihilation while it lasts and if it should last forever the sleeper would be no worse off after a million years of it than after an hour of it there are minds sufficiently logical to think of it that way and to them annihilation is not a disagreeable thing to contemplate and expect  in this matter of immortality peoples beliefs appear to go along with their wishes the chap who is content with annihilation thinks he will get it those that want immortality are pretty sure they are immortal and that is a very comfortable allotment of faiths the few of us that are left unprovided for are those who dont bother themselves much about the matter one way or another  the question of human immortality is the most momentous that the mind is capable of conceiving if it is a fact that the dead live all other facts are in comparison trivial and without interest the prospect of obtaining certain knowledge with regard to this stupendous matter is not encouraging in all countries but those in barbarism the powers of the profoundest and most penetrating intelligences have been ceaselessly addressed to the task of glimpsing a life beyond this life yet today no one can truly say that he knows it is still as much a matter of faith as ever it was  our modern christian nations hold a passionate hope and belief in another world yet the most popular writer and speaker of his time the man whose lectures drew the largest audiences the work of whose pen brought him the highest rewards was he who most strenuously strove to destroy the ground of that hope and unsettle the foundations of that belief  the famous and popular frenchman professor of spectacular astronomy camille flammarion affirms immortality because he has talked with departed souls who said that it was true yes monsieur but surely you know the rule about hearsay evidence we anglosaxons are very particular about that your testimony is of that character  i dont repudiate the presumptive arguments of school men i merely supplement them with something positive for instance if you assumed the existence of god this argument of the scholastics is a good one god has implanted in all men the desire of perfect happiness this desire can not be satisfied in our lives here if there were not another life wherein to satisfy it then god would be a deceiver voila tout  there is more the desire of perfect happiness does not imply immortality even if there is a god for   1  god may not have implanted it but merely suffers it to exist as he suffers sin to exist the desire of wealth the desire to live longer than we do in this world it is not held that god implanted all the desires of the human heart then why hold that he implanted that of perfect happiness  2 even if he dideven if a divinely implanted desire entail its own gratificationeven if it can not be gratified in this lifethat does not imply immortality it implies only another life long enough for its gratification just once an eternity of gratification is not a logical inference from it  3 perhaps god is a deceiver who knows that he is not assumption of the existence of a god is one thing assumption of the existence of a god who is honorable and candid according to our finite conception of honor and candor is another  4 there may be an honorable and candid god he may have implanted in us the desire of perfect happiness it may beit isimpossible to gratify that desire in this life still another life is not implied for god may not have intended us to draw the inference that he is going to gratify it if omniscient and omnipotent god must be held to have intended whatever occurs but no such god is assumed in m flammarions illustration and it may be that gods knowledge and power are limited or that one of them is limited  m flammarion is a learned if somewhat yellow astronomer  he has a tremendous imagination which naturally is more at home in the marvelous and catastrophic than in the orderly regions of familiar phenomena to him the heavens are an immense pyrotechnicon and he is the master of the show and sets off the fireworks but he knows nothing of logic which is the science of straight thinking and his views of things have therefore no value they are nebulous  nothing is clearer than that our preexistence is a dream having absolutely no basis in anything that we know or can hope to know of afterexistence there is said to be evidence or rather testimony in assurances of those who are in present enjoyment of itif it is enjoyable whether this testimony has actually been givenand it is the only testimony worth a moments considerationis a disputed point many persons while living this life have professed to have received it but nobody professes or ever has professed to have received a communication of any kind from one in actual experience of the forelife the souls as yet ungarmented if such there are are dumb to question the land beyond the grave has been if not observed yet often and variously described if not explored and surveyed yet carefully charted from among so many accounts of it that we have he must be fastidious indeed who can not be suited but of the fatherland that spreads before the cradlethe great heretofore wherein we all dwelt if we are to dwell in the hereafter we have no account nobody professes knowledge of that no testimony reaches our ears of flesh concerning its topographical or other features no one has been so enterprising as to wrest from its actual inhabitants any particulars of their character and appearance to refresh our memory withal and among educated experts and professional proponents of worlds to be there is a general denial of its existence  i am of their way of thinking about that the fact that we have no recollection of a former life is entirely conclusive of the matter to have lived an unrecollected life is impossible and unthinkable for there would be nothing to connect the new life with the oldno thread of continuitynothing that persisted from the one life to the other the later birth is that of another person an altogether different being unrelated to the firsta new john smith succeeding to the late tom jones  let us not be misled here by a false analogy today i may get a thwack on the mazzard which will give me an intervening season of unconsciousness between yesterday and tomorrow thereafter i may live to a green old age with no recollection of anything that i knew or did or was before the accident yet i shall be the same person for between the old life and the new there will be a nexus a thread of continuity something spanning the gulf from the one state to the other and the same in bothnamely my body with its habits capacities and powers that is i that identifies me as my former selfauthenticates and credentials me as the person that incurred the cranial mischance dislodging memory  but when death occurs all is dislodged if memory is for between two merely mental or spiritual existences memory is the only nexus conceivable consciousness of identity is the only identity to live again without memory of having lived before is to live another reexistence without recollection is absurd there is nothing to reexist     opportunity  this is not a country of equal fortunes outside a socialists dream no such country exists or can exist but as nearly as possible this is a country of equal opportunities for those who begin life with nothing but natures endowmentsand of such is the kingdom of success  in nine instances in ten

begin with nothing is a main condition of successin america  to a young man there is no such hopeless impediment as wealth or the expectation of wealth here a man and there a man will be born so abundantly endowed by nature as to overcome the handicap of artificial advantages but that is not the rule usually the chap born with a gold spoon in his mouth puts in his time sucking that spoon and without other employment counting possession of the spoon success why should he bestir himself to achieve what he already has  the real curled darling of opportunity has nothing in his mouth but his teeth and his appetitehe knows or is likely to know what it is to feel his belly sticking to his back if he have brains aplenty he will get on for he must be up and doingthe penalty of indiligence is famine if he have not he may up and do to the uttermost satisfaction of his mind and heart but the end of that man is failure with possibly socialism that last resort of conscious incompetence it fatigues this talk of the narrowing opportunities of today the closed avenues to success and the rest of it doubtless it serves its purpose of making mischief for the tyrant trusts and the wicked rich generally but in a six months bound volume of it there is not enough of truth to float a religion  men of brains never had a better chance than now to accomplish all that it is desirable that they should accomplish and men of no brains never did have much of a chance nor under any possible conditions can have in this country nor in any other they are natures failures gods botchwork let us be sorry for them treating them justly and generously but the socialism that would level us all down to their plane of achievement and reward is a proposal of which they are themselves the only

almonersphilanthropists who deem it more blessed to allot than to bestow indubitably much is wasted and some mischief done by indiscriminate givingand individual givers are addicted to that faulty practice but there is something to be said for undirected relief quite the same it blesses not only him who receives when he is worthy and when he is not upon his own head be it but him who gives to those uncalculating persons who despite the protests of the organized charitable concede a certain moral value to the spontaneous impulses of the heart and read in the word relief a double meaning the office of the mere distributor is imperfectly sacred he is even without scriptural authority and lives in the perpetual challenge of a moral quo warranto nevertheless he is not without his uses he is a tapper of tills that do not open automatically he is almoner to the uncompassionate who but for him would give no alms he negotiates unnatural but not censurable relations between selfishness and ingratitude the good that he does is purely material he makes two leaves of fat to grow where but one grew before lessens the sum of gastric pangs and dorsal chills all this is something certainly but it generates no warm and elevated sentiments and does nothing in mitigation of the poors animosity to the rich organized charity is a sapid and savorless thing its place among moral agencies is no higher than that of root beer  christ did not say sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the church to give to the poor he did not mention the associated charities of the period i do not find the words the little sisters of the poor ye have always with you nor inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these dorcas societies ye have done it unto me nowhere do i find myself commanded to enable

among them making inquiry of their personal needs who does not wish with all his heart and both his hands to relieve themis a fool     emancipated woman  what i should like to know is how the enlargement of womans sphere by entrance into the various activities of commercial professional and industrial life benefits the sex it may please helen gougar and satisfy her sense of logical accuracy to say as she does we women must work in order to fill the places left vacant by liquordrinking men but who filled these places before did they remain vacant or were there then disappointed applicants as now if my memory serves there has been no time in the period that it covers when the supply of workersabstemious male workerswas not in excess of the demand that it has always been so is sufficiently attested by the universally inadequate wage rate  employers seldom fail and never for long to get all the workmen they need the field then into which women have put their sickles was already overcrowded with reapers whatever employment women have obtained has been got by displacing menwho would otherwise be supporting women where is the general advantage we may shout high tariff combination of capital demonetization of silver and what not but if searching for the cause of augmented poverty and crime industrial discontent and the tramp evil instead of dogmatically expounding it we should take some account of this enormous sudden addition to the number of workers seeking work if any one thinks that within the brief period of a generation the visible supply of labor can be enormously augmented without profoundly affecting the stability of things and disastrously touching the interests of wageworkers let no rude voice dispel his dream of such maleficent agencies as his slumbrous understanding may joy to affirm and let our widows of ashur unlung themselves in advocacy of quack remedies for evils for which they themselves are cause it remains true that when the contention of two lions for one bone is exacerbated by the accession of a lioness the squabble is not composable by stirring up some bears in the cage adjacent  indubitably a woman is under no obligation to sacrifice herself to the good of her sex by refusing needed employment in the hope that it may fall to a man gifted with dependent women nevertheless our congratulations are more intelligent when bestowed upon her individual head than when sifted into the hair of all eves daughters this is a world of complexities in which the lines of interest are so intertangled as frequently to transgress that of sex and one ambitious to help but half the race may profitably know that every effort to that end provokes a counterbalancing mischief the enlargement of womans opportunities has benefited individual women it has not benefited the sex as a whole and has distinctly damaged the race the mind that can not discern a score of great and irreparable general evils distinctly traceable to emancipation of woman is as impregnable to the light as a toad in a rock  a marked demerit of the new order of thingsthe rÃ©gime of female commercial serviceis that its main advantage accrues not to the race not to the sex not to the class not to the individual woman but to the person of least need and worththe male employer female employers in any considerable number there will not be but those that we have could give the male ones profitable instruction in grinding the faces of their employees this constant increase of the army of laboralways and everywhere too large for the work in sightby accession of a new contingent of natural oppressibles makes the very teeth of old munniglut thrill with a poignant delight it brings in that situation known as two laborers seeking one joband one of them a person whose bones he can easily grind to make his bread and munniglut is a miller of skill and experience dusted all over with the evidence of his useful craft when heaven has assisted the daughters of hope to open to women a new avenue of opportunities the first to enter and walk therein like god in the garden of eden is the good mr munniglut contentedly smoothing the folds out of the superior slope of his paunch exuding the peculiar aroma of his oleagmous personality and larding the new roadway with the overflow of a righteousness secreted by some spiritual gland stimulated to action by relish of his own identity and ever thereafter the subtle suggestion of a fat philistinism lingers along the path of progress like an assertion of a possessory right  it is gods own crystal truth that in dealing with women unfortunate enough to be compelled to earn their own living and fortunate enough to have wrested from fate an opportunity to do so men of business and affairs treat them with about the same delicate consideration that they show to dogs and horses of the inferior breeds it does not commonly occur to the wealthy professional man or prominent merchant to be ashamed to add to his yearly thousands a part of the salary justly due to his female bookkeeper or typewriter who sits before him all day with an empty belly in order to have an habilimented back he has a vague hazy notion that the law of supply and demand is mandatory and that in submitting himself to it by paying her a half of what he would have to pay a man of inferior efficiency he is supplying the world with a noble example of obedience i must take the liberty to remind him that the law of supply and demand is not imperative it is not a statute but a phenomenon he may reply it is imperative the penalty for disobedience is failure if i pay more in salaries and wages than i need to my competitor will not and with that advantage he will drive me from the field if his margin of profit is so small that he must eke it out by coining the sweat of his workmen into nickels ive nothing to say to him let him adopt in peace the motto i cheat to eat i do not know why he should eat but nature who has provided sustenance for the worming sparrow the sparrowing owl and the owling eagle approves the needy man of prey and makes a place for him at table  human nature is pretty well balanced for every lacking virtue there is a rough substitute that will serve at a pinchas cunning is the wisdom of the unwise and ferocity the courage of the coward nobody is altogether bad the scoundrel who has grown rich by underpaying the workmen in his factory will sometimes endow an asylum for indigent seamen to oppress ones own workmen and provide for the workmen of a neighborto skin those in charge of ones own interests while cottoning and oiling the residuary product of anothers skinnerythat is not very good benevolence nor very good sense but it serves in place of both the man who eats pÃ¢tÃ© de fois gras in the sweat of his girl cashiers face or wears purple and fine linen in order that his typewriter may have an eocene gown and a pliocene hat seems a tolerably satisfactory specimen of the genus thief but let us not forget that in his own homea fairly good onehe may enjoy and merit that highest and most honorable title in the hierarchy of womans favor a good provider one having a just claim to that glittering distinction should enjoy a sacred immunity from the coarse and troublesome question from whose backs and bellies do you provide  so much for the material results to the sex what are the moral results one does not like to speak of them particularly to those who do not and can not knowto good women in whose innocent minds female immorality is inseparable from flashy gowning and the painted face to foolish booktaught men who honestly believe in some protective sanctity that hedges womanhood if men of the world with years enough to have lived out of the old rÃ©gime into the new would testify in this matter there would ensue a great rattling of dry bones in bodices of reform ladies nay if the young man about town knowing nothing of how things were in the dark backward and abysm of time but something of the moral difference between even so freerunning a creature as the society girl and the average working girl of the factory the shop and the office would speak out under assurance of immunity from prosecution his testimony would be a surprise to the cartilaginous virgins blowsy matrons acrid relicts and hairy males of emancipation it would pain too some very worthy but unobservant persons not in sympathy with the cause  certain significant facts are within the purview of all but the very young and the comfortably blind to the woman of today the man of today is imperfectly polite in place of reverence he gives her deference to the language of compliment has succeeded the language of raillery men have almost forgotten how to bow doubtless the advanced female prefers the new manner as may some of her less forward sisters thinking it more sincere it is not our giddy grandfather talked highflown nonsense because his heart had tangled his tongue he treated his woman more civilly than we ours because he loved her better he never had seen her on the rostrum and in the lobby never had seen her in advocacy of herself never had read her confessions of his sins never had felt the stress of her competition nor himself assisted by daily personal contact in rubbing the bloom off her he did not know that her virtues were due to her secluded life but thought dear old boy that they were a gift of god     the opposing sex  emancipation of woman is not of american invention the movement like most others that are truly momentous originated in europe and has broken through and broken down more formidable barriers of law custom and tradition there than here it is not true that the english married woman is virtually a bondwoman to her husband that she can hardly go and come without his consent and usually he does not consent that all she has is his if there is such a thing as the bitterness of the english married woman to the law underlying it there is such a thing as ignorance of what the law is the subjection of woman as it exists today in england is customary and traditionarya social not a legal subjection nowhere has law so sharply challenged that male dominion whose seat is in the harder muscles the larger brain and the coarser heart and the law it may be worth while to point out was not of woman born nor was it handed down out of heaven engraved on tables of stone learned english judges have decided that virtually the term marital rights has no longer a legal signification as one writer puts it the law has relaxed the husbands control over his wifes person and fortune bit by bit until legally it has left him nothing but the power to prevent her if he is so disposed and arrives in time from jumping out of the window he will find it greatly to his interest to arrive in time when he conveniently can and to be so disposed for the husband is still liable for the wifes torts and if she makes the leap he may have to pay for the telescoping of a subjacent hat or two  in england it is the tyrant man himself who is chafing in his chain not only is a husband still liable for the wrongs committed by the wife whom he has no longer the power to restrain from committing them but in many waysin one very important wayhis obligation to her remains intact after she has had the selfsacrifice to surrender all obligation to him moreover if his wife has a separate estate he has to endure the pain of seeing it hedged about from her creditors themselves not altogether happy in the contemplation with restrictions which do not hamper the right of recourse against his own doubtless all this is not without a softening effect upon his character smoothing down his dispositional asperities and endowing him day by day with fresh accretions of humility and that is good for him i do not say that female autonomy is not among the most efficacious agencies for mans reclamation from the sin of pride i only say that it is not indigenous to this country the sweet sweet home of the assassiness the happy hunting ground of the whiplady the paradise of the vitrioleuse  if the protagonists of woman suffrage are frank they are shallow if wise uncandid continually they affirm their conviction that political power in the hands of women will give us better government to proof of that proposition they address all the powers that they have and marshal such facts as can be compelled to serve under their flag they either think or profess to think that if they can show that womens votes will purify politics they will have proved their case that is not true whether they know it or not the strongest objection to woman suffrage would remain untouched pure politics is desirable certainly but it is not the chief concern of the best and most intelligent citizens good government is devoutly to be wished but more than good government we need good women if all our public affairs were to be ordered with the goodness and wisdom of angels and this state of perfection were obtained by sacrifice of any of those qualities which make the best of our women if not what they should be nor what the mindless male thinks them at least what they are we should have purchased the advantage too dearly the effect of woman suffrage upon the country is of secondary importance the question for profitable consideration is how will it affect the character of woman he who does not see in the goodness and charm of such women as are good and charming something incalculably more precious than any degree of political purity or national prosperity may be a patriot doubtless he is but also he has the distinction to be a pig  i should like to ask the gallant gentlemen who vote for removal of womans political disability if they have observed in the minds and manners of the women in the forefront of the movement nothing ominous and drear are not these women differenti dont say worse just differentfrom the best types of women of peace who are not exhibits and audibles if they are different is the difference of such a nature as to encourage a hope that activity in public affairs will work an improvement in women generally is the glare of publicity good for her growth in grace and winsomeness would a sane and sensible husband or lover willingly forego in wife or sweetheart all that the colonels of her sex appear to lack or find in her all that they appear to have and to value  a few more questionsaddressed more particularly to veteran observers than to those to whom the world is new and strange have you observed any alteration in the manner of men toward women if so is it in the direction of greater rudeness or of more ceremonious respect and again if so has not the change in point of time been coincident with the genesis and development of womans emancipation and her triumphal entry into the field of affairs are you really desirous that the change go further or do you think that when women are armed with the ballot they will compel a return of the old rÃ©gime of deference and delicate considerationextorting by their power the tribute once voluntarily paid to their weakness is there any known way by which women can at once be our political equals and our social superiors our competitors in the sharp and bitter struggle for glory gain or bread and the objects of our unselfish and undiminished devotion the present predicts the future of the foreshadow of the coming event all sensitive female hearts feel the chill for whatever advantages real or illusory some women enjoy under this rÃ©gime of partial emancipation all women pay of the coin in which payment is made the shouldering shouters of the sex have not a groat and can bear the situation with impunity they have either passed the age of masculine attention or were born without the means to its accroachment dwelling in the open bog they can afford to defy eviction  while men did nearly all the writing and public speaking of the world setting so the fashion in thought women naturally extolled with true sexual extravagance came to be considered even by themselves as a very superior order of beings with something in them of divinity which was denied to man not only were they represented as better generally than men as indeed anybody could see that they were but their goodness was supposed to be a kind of spiritual endowment and more or less independent of environmental influences  we are changing all that women are beginning to do much of the writing and public speaking and not only are they going to extol us to the fattening of our conceit but they are bound to disclose even to the unthinking certain defects of character in themselves which their silence had veiled their competition too in several kinds of affairs will slowly but certainly provoke resentment and moreover expose them to temptations which will distinctly lower the morality of their sex all these changes and many more having a similar effect and significance are occurring with amazing rapidity and the stated results are already visible to even the blindest observation in accurate depiction of the new order of things conjecture fails but so much we know the womansuperstition has already received its death wound and must soon expire  everywhere and in no reverential spirit men are questioning the dear old idolatry not sapping a solemn creed with solemn sneer but dispassionately applying to its basic doctrine the methods of scientific criticism he who within even the last twenty years has not marked in society in letters in art in everything a distinct change in mans attitude toward womena change which were one a woman one would not wish to seemay reasonably conclude that much otherwise observable is hidden by his nose in the various movementsnone of them consciously iconoclasticengaged in overthrowing this oddest of modern superstitions there is something to deprecate and even deplore but the superstition can be spared it never had much in it that was either creditable or profitable and all through its rituals ran a note of insincerity which was partly natures protest against the rites but partly too hypocrisy there is no danger that good men will ever cease to respect and love good women and if bad men ever cease to adore them for their sex when not beating them for their virtues the gain in consistency will partly offset the loss in religious ecstasy  let the patriot abandon his fear his betters their hope that only the low class woman will votethe unlettered wench of the slums the raddled hag of the dives the warpainted protÃ©gÃ©e of the police into the vortex of politics goes every floating thing that is free to move the summons to the polls will be imperative and incessant duty will thunder it from every platform conscience whisper it into every ear pride interest the lust of victoryall the motives that impel men to partisan activity will act with equal power upon women as upon men and to all the other forces flowing irresistibly toward the polls will be added the suasion of men themselves the price of votes will not decline because of the increased supply although it will in most instances be offered in currencies too subtle to be counted as now the honest and respectable elector will habitually take bribes in the invisible coin of the realm of sentimenta mintage peculiarly valued by woman for one reason or another all women will vote even those who now view the right widi aversion the observer who has marked the strength and activity of the forces pent in the dark drink of politics and given off in the act of bibation will not expect inaction to the victim of the habit be he male or she female in the partisan conviction is compulsionopinions bear fruit in conduct the partisan thinks in deeds and woman is by nature a partisana blessing for which the lord has never made her male relatives and friends sufficiently thankful not a mere man of them would have the effrontery to ask her toleration if she were not depend upon it the full strength of the female vote will eventually be cast at every election and it would be well indeed for civilization and the interests of the race if woman suffrage meant no more than going to the pollingplace and pollingwhich clearly is all that it has been thought out to mean by the headless horsemen spurring their new hobbies bravely at the tail of the procession that would be a very simple matter the opposition based upon the impropriety of the female rubbing shoulders at the polls with such scurvy blackguards as ourselves may with advantage be retired from service nor is it particularly important what men and measures the women will vote for by one means or another tyrant man will have his way the opposing sex can merely obstruct him in his way of having it and should that obstruction ever be too pronounced the party line and the sex line coinciding woman suffrage will then and henceforth be no more  in the politics of this bad world majorities are of several kinds one of the most overwhelming is made up of these simple elements 1 a numerical minority 2 a military superiority if not a single election were ever in any degree affected by it the introduction of woman suffrage into our scheme of manners and morals would nevertheless be the most momentous and mischievous event of modern history compared with the action of this destructive solvent that of all other disintegrating agencies concerned in our decivilization is as the languorous indiligence of rosewater to the mordant fury of nitric acid  lively woman is indeed as carlyle would put it hellbent on purification of politics by adding herself as an ingredient it is unlikely that the injection of her personality into the contention and politics is essentially a contention will allay any animosities sweeten any tempers elevate any motives the strifes of women are distinctly meaner than those of menwhich are out of all reason mean their methods of overcoming opponents distinctly more unscrupulous that their participation in politics will notably alter the conditions of the game is not to be denied that unfortunately is obvious but that it will make the player less malignant and the playing more honorable is a proposition in support of which one can utter a deal of gorgeous nonsense with a less insupportable sense of its unfitness than in the service of any other delusion  the frosty truth is that except in the home the influence of women is not elevating but debasing when they stoop to uplift men who need uplifting they are themselves pulled down and that is all that is accomplished wherever they come into familiar contact with men who are not their relatives they impart nothing they receive all they do not affect us with their notions of morality we infect them with ours  in the last forty years in this country they have entered a hundred avenues of activity from which they were previously debarred by an unwritten law they are found in the offices the shops the factories like charles lambs fugitive pigs they have run up all manner of streets does any one think that in that time there has been an advance in professional commercial and industrial morality are lawyers more scrupulous tradesmen more honest when one has been served by a saleslady does one leave the shop with a feebler sense of injury than was formerly inspired by a transaction at the countera duller consciousness of being oneself the commodity that has changed hands have actresses elevated the stage to a moral altitude congenial to the colder virtues in studios of the artists is the sound of revelry by night invariably a deep masculine bass in literature are the immoral booksthe books dealing with questionable questionsalways or even commonly written by men  there is one direction in which emancipation of woman and enlargement of her sphere have wrought a reform they have elevated the personnel of the little dinner party in the private room formerly as any veteran manabouttown can testify if he will the female contingent of the party was composed of persons altogether unspeakable that element now remains upon its reservation among the superior advantages enjoyed by the manabouttown of today is that of the companionship at his dinner in camera of ladies having an honorable vocation in the corridors of the french restaurant the swish of pseudonymas skirt is no longer heard she has been superseded by the princess taptap with truckle  cinch by my lady snipsnip from the emporium of boltwhack  co by miss chinkchink who sits at the receipt of customs in that severely unfrench restaurant the maison hash that the manabouttown has been morally elevated by this emancipation of girl from the seclusion of home to that of the private room is too obvious for denial nothing so uplifts tyrant man as the table talk of good young women who earn their own living  i do not wish to be altogether ironical about this rather serious matternot so much so as to forfeit anything of lucidity let me state then in all earnestness and sobriety and simplicity of speech what is known to every worldlywise male dweller in the cities to every scamp and scapegrace of the clubs to every reformed sentimentalist and every observer with a straight eyenamely that in all the various classes of young women in our cities who support or partly support themselves in vocations which bring them into personal contact with men female chastity is a vanishing tradition in the lives of the main and general of these all those considerate which have their origin in personal purity and cluster about it and are its signs and safeguards have almost ceased to cut a figure it is needless to remind me that there are exceptionsi know that with some of them i have personal acquaintance or think i have and for them a respect withheld from any woman of the rostrum who points to their misfortune and calls it emancipationto their need and calls it a spirit of independence it is not from these good girls that you will hear the flippant boast of an unfettered life with freedom to develop nor is it they who will be foremost and furious in denial and resentment of my statements regarding the morals of their class they do not know the whole truth thank heaven but they know enough for a deprecation too deep to find relief in a cheap affirmation of womans purity which is and always has been the creature of seclusion  the fitness of women for political activity is not in present question i am considering the fitness of political activity for women for women as men say they are wish them to be and try to think them it is unfit altogetheras unfit as anything else that mixes them up with us compelling a communication and association that are not social if we wish to have women who are different from ourselves in knowledge character accomplishments manners as different mentally as physicallyand in these and in all odier expressible differences reside all the charms that they have for uswe must keep them or they must keep themselves in an environment unlike our own one would think that obvious to the meanest capacity and might even hope that it would be understood by the daughters of thunder possibly the advanced one hospitably accepting her karma is not concerned to be charming to the likes o wewould prefer the companionship of her blue gingham umbrella her corkscrew curls her epicene audiences and her name in the newspapers perhaps she is content with the comfort of her raucous voice therein she is unwise for selfinterest is the first law when we no longer find woman charming we may find a way to make them more usefulmore truly useful even than the speechladies would have them make themselves by competition really there is nothing in the world between them and slavery but their power of interesting us and that has its origin in the very differences which the colonels are striving to abolish god has made no law of miracles and none of his laws are going to be suspended in deference to womans desire to achieve familiarity without contempt if she wants to please she must retain some scrap of novelty if she desires our respect she must not be always in evidence disclosing the baser side of her character as in competition with us she must do as we do to one another or lamentably fail mrs edmund gosse like ouida mrs atherton and all other women of brains declares that the taking of unfair advantagesthe lack of magnanimityis a leading characteristic of her sex mrs gosse adds with reference to mens passive acquiescence in this monstrous folly of emancipation that possibly our quiet may be the calm before the storm and she utters this warning which also more strongly ouida has uttered how would it be with us if the men should suddenly rise en masse and throw the whole surging lot of us into convents and harems  it is not likely that men will rise en masse to undo the mischief wrought by noisy protagonists of woman suffrage working like beavers to rear their airy fad upon the sandy foundation of masculine tolerance and inattention no rising will be needed all that is required for the wreck of their hopes is for a wave of reason to slide a little farther up the sands of time loll out its large tongue lick the whole labor flat the work has prospered so far only because nobody but its promoters has taken it seriously it has not engaged attention from those having the knowledge and the insight to discern beneath its capandbells and the motley that is its only wear a serious menace to all that civilized men hold precious in woman it is of the nature of menthemselves cheerful polygamists with no penitent intentionsto set a high value upon chastity in woman we need not inquire why they do so those to whom the reasons are not clear can profitably remain in the valley of the shadow of ignorance valuing it they purpose having it or some considerable numerical presumption of it as they perceive that in a general way women are virtuous in proportion to the remoteness of their lives and interests from the lives and interests of mentheir seclusion from the influences of which mens own vices are a main partan easy and peaceful means will doubtless be found for the repression of the shouters  in the orchestration of mind womans instruments might have kept silence without injury to the volume and quality of the music efface the impress of her touch upon the world and by those who come after the blank must be diligently sought go to the top of any large city and look about and below it is not much that you will see but it represents an amazing advance from the conditions of primitive man no where in the wide survey will you see the work of woman it is all the work of mens hands and before it was wrought into form and substance existed as conscious creations in mens brains concealed within the visible forms of buildings and shipsthemselves miracles of thoughtlie such wonderworlds of invention and discovery as no human life is long enough to explore no human understanding capacious enough to hold in knowledge if like asmodeus we could rive the roofs and see womans part of this prodigious exhibitionthe things that she has actually created with her brainwhat kind of display would it be it is probable that all the intellectual energy expended by women from first to last would not have sufficed if directed into the one channel for the genesis and evolution of the modern bicycle  i once heard a lady who had playfully competed with men in a jumping match gravely attribute her defeat to the trammeling of her skirt similarly women are pleased to explain their penury of mental achievement by repressive education and custom and therein they are not altogether in heresy but even in regions where they have ever had the freedom of the quarries they have not builded themselves monuments nobody for example is holding them from greatness in poetry which needs no special education and music in which they have always been specially educated yet where is the great poem by a woman where the great musical composition in the grammar of literature what is the feminine of homer of shakspere of goethe of hugo what female names are the equivalents of the names of beethoven mozart chopin wagner women are not musiciansthey sing and play in short if woman had no better claim to respect and affection than her brain no sweeter charms than those of her reason no means of suasion but her power upon mens convictions she would long ago have been improved off the face of the earth as she is men accord her such homage as is compatible with contempt such immunities as are consistent with exaction but whereas she is not altogether filled with light and is moreover imperfectly reverent it is but right that in obedience to scriptural injunction she keep silence in our churches while we are worshipping ourselves  she will not have it so the good good girl as moral as the best of us she will be as intellectual as the rest of us she will have out her little taper and set the rivers of thought all ablaze legging it over the land from stream to stream till all are fired she will widen her sphere forsooth herself no wider than before it is not enough that we have edified her a pedestal and perform impossible rites in celebration of her altitude and distinction it does not suffice that with never a smile we assure her that she is the superior sexa whopper by the repetition whereof certain callow youth among us have incurred the divine vengeance of belief it does not satisfy her that she is indubitably gifted with pulchritude and an unquestionable genius for its embellishing that nature has endowed her with a prodigious knack at accroachment whereby the male of her species is lured to a suitable doom no she has taken unto herself in these evil days that intelligent discontent which giveth its beloved fits to her flock of graces and virtues she must add our one poor ewe lamb of brains well i tell her that intellect is a monster which devours beauty that the woman of exceptional mind is exceptionally masculine in face figure action that in transplanting brains to an unfamiliar soil god leaves much of the original earth about the roots and so with a reluctant farewell to lovely woman i humbly withdraw from her presence and hasten to overtake the receding periphery of her sphere  one moment more mesdames i crave leave to estop your disfavorwhich were affliction and calamityby defining my position in the words of one of yourselves who has said of me though with reprehensible exaggeration believe me that i hate woman and love womenhave an acute animosity to your sex and adoring each individual member of it what matters my opinion of your understandings so long as i am in bondage to your charms moreover there is one service of incomparable utility and dignity for which i esteem you eminently fitto be mothers of men     the american sycophant  an american newspaper holds this opinion if republican government had done nothing else than give independence to american character and preserve it from the servility inseparable from the allegiance to kings it would have accomplished a great work  i do not doubt that the writer of that sentence believes that republican government has actually wrought the change in human nature which challenges his admiration he is very sure that his countrymen are not sycophants that before rank and power and wealth they stand covered maintaining the godlike attitude of freedom and a man and exulting in it it is not true it is an immeasurable distance from the truth we are as abject toadies as any people on earthmore so than any european people of similar civilization when a foreign emperor king prince or nobleman comes among us the rites of servility that we execute in his honor are baser than any that he ever saw in his own land when a foreign noblemans prow puts into shore the american shin is pickled in brine to welcome him and if he come not in adequate quantity those of us who can afford the expense go swarming over sea to struggle for front places in his attention in this blind and brutal scramble for social recognition in europe the traveling american toady and impostor has many chances of success he is commonly unknown even to ministers and consuls of his own country and these complaisant gentlemen rather than incur the risk of erring on the wrong side take him at his own valuation and push him in where his obscurity being again in his favor he is treated with kindly toleration and sometimes a genuine hospitality to which he has no shadow of right nor title and which if he were a gentleman he would not accept if it were voluntarily proffered it should be said in mitigation that all this delirious abasement in no degree tempers his rancor against the system of which the foreign notable is the flower and fruit he keeps his servility sweet by preserving it in the salt of vilification in the character of a blatant blackguard the american snob is so happily disguised that he does not know himself  an american newspaper once printed a portrait of her whom the irreverent briton had a reprehensible habit of designating colloquially as the old lady but the editor in question did not so designate herhis simple american manhood and republican spirit would not admit that she was a lady so he contented himself with labeling the portrait her most gracious majesty queen victoria this incident raises an important question  important question raised by this incident is it better to be a subject and a man or a citizen and a flunkeyto own the sway of a gory tyrant and retain ones selfrespect or dwell a sovereign elector in the land of liberty and disgrace it  however it may be customary for english newspapers to designate the english sovereign they are at least not addicted to sycophancy in designating the rulers of other countries than their own they would not say his abracadabral humptidumptiness emperor william nor his pestilency the speaker of the american house of representatives they would not think of calling even the most ornately selfbemedaled american sovereign elector his badgesty of a foreign nobleman they do not say his lordship they will not admit that he is a lord nor when speaking of their own noblemen do they spell lord with a capital l as we do in brief when mentioning foreign dignitaries of whatever rank in their own countries the english press is simply and serviceably descriptive the king is a king the queen a queen the jack a jack we use another kind of common sense at the very foundation of our political system lies the denial of hereditary and artificial rank our fathers created this government as a protest against all that and all that it implies they virtually declared that kings and noblemen could not breathe here and no american loyal to the principles of the revolution which made him one will ever say in his own country your majesty or your lordshipthe words would choke him and they ought  there are a few of us who keep the faith who do not bow the knee to baal who hold fast to what is high and good in the doctrine of political equality in whose hearts the altarfires of rational liberty are kept aglow beaconing the darkness of that illimitable inane where their countrymen inaccessible to the light wander witless in the bogs of political unreason alternately adoring and damning the manmade gods of their own stature of that bright band fueling the balefires of political consistency i can not profess myself a member in good standing in view of this general recreancy and treason to the principles that our fathers established by the swordhaving in constant observation this almost universal hospitality to the solemn nonsense of hereditary rank and unearned distinction my faith in practical realization of republican ideals is small and i falter in the work of their maintenance in the interest of a people for whom they are too good seeing that we are immune to none of the evils besetting monarchies excepting those for which we secretly yearn that inequality of fortune and unjust allotment of honors are as conspicuous among us as elsewhere that the tyranny of individuals is as intolerable and that of the public more so that the laws majesty is a dream and its failure a facthearing everywhere the footfalls of disorder and the watchwords of anarchy i despair of the republic and catch in every breeze that blows a cry prophetic of its fall  i have seen a vast crowd of americans change color like a field of waving grain as it uncovered to do such base homage to a petty foreign princess as in her own country she had never received i have seen fullgrown selfrespecting american citizens tremble and go speechless when spoken to by the emperor of brazil i have seen a halfdozen american gentlemen in evening clothes trying to outdo one another in the profundity of their bows in the presence of the nigger king of hawaii i have not seen a chinese earl borne in a chair by four americans officially detailed for the disgraceful service but it was done and did not evoke a hiss of disapproval and i did notthank heavenobserve the mob of american simple republicans that dogged the heels of a disreputable little frenchman who is a count by courtesy only and those of an english duke quietly attending to his business of making a living by being a married man the republican new world is no less impested with servility than the monarchial old one form of government may be better than another for this purpose or for that all are alike in the futility of their influence upon human character none can affect mans instinctive abasement in the contemplation of power and rank  not only are we no less sycophantic than the people of monarchial countries we are more so we grovel before their exalted personages and perform in addition a special prostration at the clay feet of our own idolswhich they do not revere the typical subject hatinhand to his sovereign and his nobleman is a less shameful figure than the citizen executing his genuflexion before the public of which he is himself a part no european court journal no european courtier was ever more abject in subservience to the sovereign than are the american newspaper and the american politician in flattery of the people between the courtier and the demagogue i see nothing to choose they are moved by the same sentiment and fired by the same hope their method is flattery and their purpose profit their adulation is not a testimony to character but a tribute to power or the shadow of power if this country were governed by its criminal idiots we should have the same attestations of their goodness and wisdom the same competition for their favor the same solemn doctrine that their voice is the voice of god our children would be brought up to believe that an idiotocracy is the only natural and rational form of government and for my part im not at all sure that it would not be a pretty good political system as political systems go i have always however cherished a secret faith in smithocracy which seems to combine the advantages of both the monarchial and the republican idea if all the offices were held for life by smithsthe senior john being presidentwe should have a settled and orderly succession to allay all fears of anarchy and a sufficiently wide eligibility to feed the fires of patriotic ambition all could not be smiths but many could marry into the family  the harrison progress left its heritage of shame whereof each abaser would gladly have washed the hands of him in his neighbors basin all this was in due order of nature and was to have been expected it was a phenomenon of the same character as in the loves of the low the squabbling consequent upon satiety and shame we could not slink out of sight we could deny our sycophancy albeit we might give it another name but we could somewhat medicine our damaged selfesteem by dealing damnation round on one another the blush of shame turned easily to the glow of indignation and many a hot hatred was kindled at the rosy flame of selfcontempt persons conscious of having dishonored themselves are doubly sensitive to any indignity put upon them by others the vices and follies of human nature are interdependent they do not move alone nor are they singly aroused to activity in my judgment this entire incident of the presidents tour was infinitely discreditable to president and people i do not go into the question of his motive in making it be that what it may the manner of it seems to me an outrage upon all the principles and sentiments underlying republican institutions in all but the name it was a royal progressthe same costly ostentation the same civic and military pomp the same solemn and senseless adulation the same abasement of spirit of the many before the one and according to republican traditions ten thousand times a year affirmed in every way in which affirmation is possible we fondly persuade ourselves as a true faith in the hearts of our hearts that the one is the inferior of the many and it is no mere political catchphrase he is their servant he is their creature all that in him to which they grovel dignifying and justifying their instinctive and inherited servility by names as false as anything in ceremonial imposture they themselves have made as truly as the heathen has made the wooden god before which he performs his unmanly rite it is precisely this thingthe superiority of the people to their servantsthat constitutes and was by our fathers understood to constitute the essential fundamental difference between the monarchial system which they uprooted and the democratic one which they planted in its stead deluded men how little they guessed the length and strength and vitality of the roots left in the soil of the centuries when their noxious harvestage of mischievous institutions had been cast as rubbish to the void  i am no contestant for forms of governmentno believer in either the practical value or the permanence of any that has yet been devised that all men are created equal in the best and highest sense of the phrase i hold not as i observe it held by others but as a living faith that an officeholder is a servant of the people that i am his political superior owing him no deference and entitled to such deference from him as may be serviceable to keep him in mind of his subordinationthese are propositions which command my assent which i feel to be true and which determine the character of my personal relations with those whom they concern that i should give my hand or bend my neck or uncover my head to any man in homage to or recognition of his office great or small is to me simply inconceivable these tricks of servility with the softened names are the vestiges of an involuntary allegiance to power extraneous to the performer they represent in our american life obedience and propitiation in their most primitive and odious forms the man who speaks of them as manifestations of a proper respect for the presidents great office is either a rogue a dupe or a journalist they come to us out of a fascinating but terrible past as survivals of servitude they speak a various language of oppression and the superstition of manworship they cany forward the traditions of the sceptre and the lash through the plaudits of the people may be heard always the faint far cry of the beaten slave  respect respect the good respect the wise respect the dead let the president look to it that he belongs to one of these classes his going about the country in gorgeous state and barbaric splendor as the guest of a thieving corporation but at our expenseshining and dining and swiningunsouling himself of clotted nonsense in pickled platitudes calculated for the meridian of coon hollow indiana but ingeniously adapted to each water tank on the line of his absurd progress does not prove it and the presumption of his great office is against him  can you not see poor misguided fellow citizens how you permit your political taskmasters to forge legchains of your follies and load you down with them will nothing teach you that all this fussandfeathers all this ceremony all this official gorgeousness and brassbanding this manifestation of a proper respect for the nations head has no decent place in american life and american politics will no experience open your stupid eyes to the fact that these shows are but absurd imitations of royalty to hold you silly while you are plundered by the managers of the performancethat while you toss your greasy caps in air and sustain them by the ascending current of your senseless hurrahs the programmers are going through your blessed pockets and exploiting your holy dollars no you feel secure power is of the people and you can effect a change of robbers every four years inestimable privilegeto pull off the glutted leech and attach the lean one and you can not even choose among the lean leeches but must accept those designated by the programmers and showmen who have the reptiles on tap but then you are not subjects you are citizensthere is much in that your tyrant is not a king he is a president he does not occupy a throne but a chair he does not succeed to it by inheritance he is pitchforked into it by the boss altogether you are distinctly better off than the russian mujik who wears his shirt outside his trousers and has never shaken hands with the czar in all his life  i hold that kings and noblemen can not breathe in america when they set foot upon our soil their kingship and their nobility fall away from them like the chains of a slave in england whatever a man may be in his own country here he is but a man my countrymen may do as they please lickspittling the high and mighty of other nations even to the filling of their spiritual bellies but i make a stand for simple american manhood i will meet no man on this soil who expects from me a greater deference than i could properly accord to the president of my own country my allegiance to republican institutions is slack through lack of faith in them as a practical system of governing men as men are all the same i will call no man your majesty nor your lordship for me to meet in my own country a king or a nobleman would require as much preliminary negotiation as an official interview between the mufti of moosh and the ahkoond of swat the form of salutation and the style and tide of address would have to be settled definitively and with precision with some of my most esteemed and patriotic friends the matter is more simple their generosity in concession fills me with admiration and their forbearance in exaction challenges my astonishment as one of the seven wonders of american hospitality in fancy i see the ceremony of their presentation and as examples of simple republican dignity i commend their posture to the youth of this fair new world inviting particular attention to the grand bold curves of character shown in the outlines of the human ham     a dissertation on dogs  of all anachronisms and survivals the love of the dog is the most reasonless because some thousands of years ago when we wore other skins than our own and sat enthroned upon our haunches tearing tangles of tendons from raw bones with our teeth the dog ministered purveyorwise to our savage needs we go on cherishing him to this day when his only function is to lie sunsoaken on a door mat and insult us as we pass in and out enamored of his fat superfluity one dog in a thousand earns his breadand takes beefsteak the other nine hundred and ninetynine we maintain by cheating the poor in the style suitable to their state  the trouble with the modern dog is that he is the same old dog not an inch has the rascal advanced along the line of evolution we have ceased to squat upon our naked haunches and gnaw raw bones but this companion of the childhood of the race this vestigial remnant of juventus mundi this dismal anachronism this veteran inharmony of the scheme of things the dog has abated no jot nor tittle of his unthinkable objectionableness since the morning stars sang together and he had sat up all night to deflate a lung at the performance possibly he may some time be improved otherwise than by effacement but at present he is still in that early stage of reform that is not incompatible with a mouthful of reformer  the dog is a detestable quadruped he knows more ways to be unmentionable than can be suppressed in seven languages  the word dog is a term of contempt the world over poets have sung and prosaists have prosed of the virtues of individual dogs but nobody has had the hardihood to eulogize the species no man loves the dog he loves his own dog or dogs and there he stops the force of perverted affection can no further go he loves his own dog partly because that thrifty creature ever cadging when not maurauding tickles his vanity by fawning upon him as the visible source of steaks and bones and partly because the graceless beast insults everybody else harming as many as he dares the dog is an encampment of fleas and a reservoir of sinful smells he is prone to bad manners as the sparks fly upward he has no discrimination his loyalty is given to the person that feeds him be the same a blackguard or a murderers mother he fights for his master without regard to the justice of the quarrelwherein he is no better than a patriot or a paid soldier there are men who are proud of a dogs loveand dogs love that kind of men there are men who having the privilege of loving women insult them by loving dogs and there are women who forgive and respect their canine rivals women i am told are true cynolaters they adore not only dogs but dognot only their own horrible little beasts but those of others but women will love anything they love men who love dogs i sometimes wonder how it is that of all our women among whom the dog fad is prevalent none have incurred the husband fad or the child fad possibly there are exceptions but it seems to be a rule that the female heart which has a dog in it is without other lodgers there is not i suppose a very wild and importunate demand for accommodation for my part i do not know which is the less desirable the tenant or the tenement there are dogs that submit to be kissed by women base enough to kiss them but they have a secret coarse revenge for the dog is a joker withal gifted with as much humor as is consistent with biting  miss louise imogen guiney has replied to mrs meynells proposal to abolish the doga proposal which miss guiney has the originality to call original divested of its literature miss guineys plea for the defendant consists essentially of the following assertions 1 dogs are whatever their masters are 2 they bite only those who fear them 3 really vicious dogs are not found nearer than constantinople 4 only wronged dogs go mad and hydrophobia is retaliation 5 in actions for damages for dogbites judicial prejudice is against the dog 6 dogs are continually saving children from death 7 association with dogs begets piety tenderness mercy loyalty and so forth in brief the dog is an elevating influence to walk modestly at a dogs heels is a certificate of merit as to that last if miss guiney had ever observed the dog himself walking modestly at the heels of another dog she would perhaps have wished that it was not the custom of her sex to seal the certificate of merit with a kiss  in all this absurd womans statements thus fairly epitomized there is not one that is truenot one of which the essential falsity is not evident obvious conspicuous to even the most delinquent observation yet with the smartness and smirk of a graduating seminary girl refuting epicurus she marshals them against the awful truth that every year in europe and the united states alone more than five thousand human beings the of hydrophobiaa fact which her controversial conscience does not permit her to mention the names on this needless deathroll are mostly those of children the sins of whose parents in cherishing their own hereditary love of dogs is visited upon their children because they have not the intelligence and agility to get out of the way or perhaps they lack that tranquil courage upon which miss guiney relies to avert the canine tooth from her own inedible shank  finally this amusing illogician this type and example of the female controversialist has the hardihood to hope that there may be fathers who can see their children the the horrible death of hydrophobia without wishing to exile mans best ideal of fidelity from the hearthstones of civilization if we must have an ideal of fidelity why not find it not in the dog that kills the child but in the father that kills the dog the profit of maintaining a standard and pattern of the virtues at considerable expense in the case of this insatiable canine consumer may be great but are we so hard pushed that we must go to the animals for it in life and letters are there no men and women whose names kindle enthusiasm and emulation is fidelity is devotion is selfsacrifice unknown among ourselves as a model of the higher virtues why will not ones mother serve at a pinch and what is the matter with miss guiney herself she is faithful at least to dogs whatever she may be to the hundreds of american children inevitably foredoomed to a death of unthinkable agony  there is perhaps a hope that when the suns returning flame shall gild the hither end of the thirtieth century this savage and filthy brute the dog will have ceased to banquet on through a whole year of human fat and lean that he will have been gathered to his variously unworthy fathers to give an account of the deeds done in body of man in the meantime those of us who have not the enlightened understanding to be enamored of him may endure with such fortitude as we can command his feats of tooth among the shins and throats of those who have we ourselves are so few that there is a strong numerical presumption of personal immunity  it is well to have a clear understanding of such inconveniences as may be expected to ensue from dogbites that inconveniences and even discomforts do sometimes flow from or at least follow the mischance of being bitten by dogs even the sturdiest champion of mans best friend will admit when not heated fay controversy true he is disposed to sympathy for those incurring the inconveniences and discomforts but against apparent incompassion may be offset his indubitable sympathy with the dog no one is altogether heartless  amongst the several disadvantages of a close personal connection with the canine tooth the disorder known as hydrophobia has long held an undisputed primacy the existence of dus ailment is attested by so many witnesses many of whom belonging to the profession of medicine speak with a certain authority that even the breeders and lovers of snapdogs are compelled reluctantly to concede it though as a rule they stoutly deny that it is imparted by the dog in their view hydrophobia is a theory not a condition the patient imagines himself to have it and acting upon that unsupported assumption or hypothesis suffers and dies in the attempt to square his conduct with his opinions  it seems there is firmer ground for their view of the matter than the rest of us have been willing to admit there is such a thing doubtless as hydrophobia proper but also there is such another thing as pseudohydrophobia or hydrophobia improper  pseudohydrophobia the physicians explain is caused by fear of hydrophobia the patient having been chewed by a healthy and harmless dog broods upon his imaginary peril solicitously watches his imaginary symptoms and finally persuading himself of their reality puts them on exhibition as he understands them he runs about when permitted on his hands and knees growls barks howls and in default of a tail wags the part of him where it would be if he had one in a few days he is gone before a victim to his lack of confidence in mans best friend  the number of cases of pseudohydrophobia relatively to those of true hydrophobia is not definitely known the medical records having been imperfectly made and never collated champions of the snapdog as intimated believe it is many to nothing that being so they argue the animal is entirely exonerated and leaves the discussion without a stain upon his reputation  but that is feeble reasoning even if we grant their premises we can not embrace their conclusion in the first place it hurts to be bitten by a dog as the dog himself audibly confesses when bitten by another dog furthermore pseudohydrophobia is quite as fatal as if it were a legitimate product of the bite not a result of the terror which that mischance inspires  human nature being what it is and well known to the dog to be what it is we have a right to expect that the creature will take our weaknesses into considerationthat he will respect our addiction to reasonless panic even as we respect his when as we commonly do we refrain from attaching tinware to his tail a dog that runs himself to death to evade a kitchen utensil which could not possibly harm him and which if he did not flee would not pursue is the author of his own undoing in precisely the same sense as is the victim of pseudohydrophobia he is slain by a theory not a condition yet the wicked boy that set him going is not blameless and no one would be so zealous and strenuous in his prosecution as the cynolater the adorer of dogs the person who holds them guileless of pseudohydrophobia  mr nicholas smith while united states consul at liege wrote or caused to be written an official report wickedly willfully and maliciously designed to abridge the privileges augment the ills and impair the honorable status of the domestic dog in the very beginning of this report mr smith manifests his animus by stigmatizing the domestic dog as an hereditary loafer and having hurled the allegation affirms the dawn of a belgian new era wherein the pampered menial will loaf no more there is to be no more sunsoaking on door mats having a southern exposure no more usurpation of the warmest segment of the family circle no more successful personal solicitation of cheer at the domestic board the dogs place in the social scale is no longer to be determined by consideration of sentiment but will be the result of cold commercial calculation and so fixed as best to serve the ends of industrial expediency all this in belgium where the dog is already in active service as a beast of burden and draught doubtless the transition to that humble condition from his present and immemorial social elevation in less advanced countries will be slow and characterized by bitter factional strife america especially though ever accessible to the infection of new and profitable ideas will be angularly slow to accept so radical a subversion of a social superstructure that almost may be said to rest upon the domestic dog as a basic verity  the dogs are our only true leisure class for even the tramps are sometimes compelled to engage in such simple industries as are possible within the precincts of the county jail and we are justly proud of them they toil not neither spin yet solomon in all his glory was not a dog instead of making them hewers of wood and drawers of water it would be more consonant with the anglomaniacal and general old world spirit now so dominant in the councils of the nation to make them hereditary legislators and mr smith must permit me to add with a special significance that history records an instance of even a horse making a fairly good consul  mr smith avers with obvious and impudent satisfaction that in liege twice as many draught dogs as horses are seen in the streets attached to vehicles he regards a gaily painted cart drawn by a well fed dog and driven by a well fed and gaily painted woman as a pleasing vision i do not i should prefer to see the dog sitting at the receipt of steaks and chops and the lady devoting herself to the amelioration of the condition of the universe and the manufacture of poetry and stories that are not true a more pleasing vision too one endeared to eye and heart by immemorial use and wont is that of stranger and dog indulging in the pleasures of the chasestranger a little aheadwhile the woman in the case manifests a characteristically compassionate solicitude lest the gentlemans trousers do not match fidos mustache it is indeed impossible to regard with any degree of approval the degradation to commercial utility of two so noble animals as dog and woman and if man had joined them together by drivingreins i should hope that god would put them asunder even if the reins were held by dog there would no doubt be a distinct gain as well as a certain artistic fitness in unyoking the strongminded female of our species from the chariot of progress and yoking her to the applecart or fishwagon andbut that is another story the imminence of the draughtwoman is not foreshadowed in the report of our consul at liege  mr smiths estimate of the number of dogs in this country at 7000000 is a conservative one it must be confessed and can hardly have been based on observations by moonlight in a suburban village his estimate of the effective strength of the average dog at 500 pounds is probably about right as will be attested by any intelligent boy who in campaigns against orchards has experienced detention by the cerberi of the places taking his own figures mr smith calculates that we have in this country 3500000000 pounds of idle dog power but this statement is more ingenious than ingenuous it gives as doubtless it was intended to give the impression that we have only idle dogs whereas of all mundane forces the domestic dog is most easily stirred to action his expense of energy in pursuit of the harmless necessary flea for example is prodigious and he is not infrequently seen in chase of his own tail with an activity scarcely inferior if there is anything worth while in accepted theories of the conversion and conservation of force these gigantic energies are by no means wasted they appear as heat light and electricity modifying climate reducing gas bills and assisting in propulsion of street cars even in baying the moon and insulting visitors and bypassers the dog releases a certain amount of vibratory force which through various mutations of its wavelength may do its part in cooking a steak or gratifying the olfactory nerve by throwing fresh perfume on the violet evidently the commercial advantages of deposing the dog from the position of exalted personage and subduing him to that of motor would not be all clear gain he would no longer have the spirit to send whitmanwise his barbarous but beneficent yawp over the housetops nor the leisure to throw off vast quantities of energy by centrifugal efforts at the conquest of his tail as to the fleas he would accept them with apathetic satisfaction as preventives of thought upon his fallen fortunes  having observed with attention and considered with seriousness the london daily news declares its conviction that the dog as we have the happiness to know him is dreadfully bored by civilization this is one of the gravest accusations that the friends of progress and light have been called out to meeta challenge that it is impossible to ignore and unprofitable to evade for the dog as we have the happiness to know him is the only dog that we have the happiness really to know the wolf is hardly a dog within the meaning of the law nor is the scalpyielding coyote whether he howls or merely sings and plays the piano moreover these are beyond the pale of civilization and outside the scope of our sympathies  with the dog it is different his place is among us he is with us and of usa part of our life and love if we are maintaining and promoting a condition of things that gives him that tired feeling it is befitting that we mend our ways lest shaking the carpet dust from his feet and the tenderloin steaks from his teeth he depart from our midst and connect himself with the enchanted life of the thrilling barbarian we can not afford to lose him the cynophobes may call him a survival and sneer at his exhausted mandatealbeit as darwin points out they are indebted for their sneer to his own habit of uncovering his teeth to bite they may seek to cast opprobrium upon the nature of our affection for him by pronouncing it hereditarya bequest from our primitive ancestors for whom he performed important service in other ways than depriving visitors of their tendons but quite the same we should miss him at his meal time and in the but for him silent watches of the night we should miss his bark and his bite the feel of his forefeet upon our shirtfronts the froufrou of his dusty sides against our nether habiliments more than all we should miss and mourn that visible yearning for chops and steaks which he has persuaded us to accept as the lovelight of his eye and a tribute to our personal worth we must keep the dog and to that end find means to abate his weariness of us and our ways  doubtless much might be done to reclaim our dogs from their uncheerful state of mind by abstention from debate on imperialism by excluding them from the churches at least during the sermons by keeping them off the streets and out of hearing when rites of prostration are in performance before visiting notables by forbidding anyone to read aloud in their hearing the sensational articles in the newspapers and by educating them to the belief that labor and capital are illusions a limitation of the annual output of popular novels would undoubtedly reduce the dejection which could be still further mitigated by abolition of the more successful magazines if the dialect story or poem could be prohibited under severe penalties the sum of nighthowling erroneously attributed to lunar influence would experience an audible decrement which also would enable the fire department to augment its own uproar without reproach there is indeed a considerable number of ways in which we might effect a double reformpromoting the advantage of man as well as medicating the mental fatigue of dog for another example it would be a boon and a blessing to man if society would put to death or at least banish the millman or manufacturer who persists in apprising the entire community many times a day by means of a steam whistle that it is time for his oppressed employees every one of whom has a gold watch to go to work or to leave off such things not only make a dog tired they make a man mad they answer with an accented affirmative truthful james plaintive inquiry       is civilization a failure      or is the caucasian played out  unquestionably from his advantageous point of view as a lookeron at the game the dog is justified in the conviction that they are     the ancestral bond  a wellknown citizen of ohio once discovered another man of the same name exactly resembling him and writing a hand which including the signature he was unable to distinguish from his own the two men were unable to discover any blood relationship between them it is nevertheless almost absolutely certain that a relationship existed though it may have been so remote a degree that the familiar term fortysecond cousin would not have exaggerated the slenderness of the tie the phenomena of heredity have been inattentively noted its laws are imperfectly understood even by herbert spencer and the prophets my own small study in this amazing field convinces me that a man is the sum of his ancestors that his character moral and intellectual is determined before his birth his environment with all its varied suasions its agencies of good and evil breeding training interest experience and the rest of ithave little to do with the matter and can not alter the sentence passed upon him at conception compelling him to be what he is  man is the hither end of an immeasurable line extending back to the ultimate adamor as we scientists prefer to name him protoplasmos man travels not the mental road that he would but the one that he mustis pushed this way and that by the resultant of all the forces behind him for each member of the ancestral line though dead yet pusfaedi in one of what dr nolmes holmes ed calls his medicated novels the guardian angel this truth is most admirably and lucidly set forth with abundant instance and copious exposition upon another work of his elsie vennerin which he erroneously affirms the influence of circumstance and environmentlet us lay a charitable hand and fling it into the fire  clearly all ones ancestors have not equal power in shaping his character conceiving them according to our figure as arranged in line behind him and influential in the ratio of their individuality we shall get the best notion of their method by supposing them to have taken their places in an order somewhat independent of chronology and a little different from their arrangement behind his brother immediately at his back with a controlling hand a trifle skinny upon him may stand his greatgrandmother while his father may be many removes arear or the place of power may be held by some fine old asian gentleman who flourished before the confusion of tongues on the plain of shinar or by some cavedweller who polished the bone of life in mesopotamia and was perhaps a respectable and honest troglodyte  sometimes a whole platoon of ancestors appears to have been moved backward or forward en bloc not we may be sure capriciously but in obedience to some law that we do not understand i know a man to whose character not an ancestor since the seventeenth century has contributed an element intellectually he is a contemporary of john dryden whom naturally he reveres as the greatest of poets i know another who has inherited his handwriting from his greatgrandfather although he has been trained to the spencerian system and tried hard to acquire it furthermore his handwriting follows the same order of progressive development as that of his greatgrandfather at the age of twenty he wrote exactly as his ancestor did at the same age and although at fortyfive his chirography is nothing like what it was even ten years ago it is accurately like his greatgrandfathers at fortyfive it was only five years ago that the discovery of some old letters showed him how his greatgrandfather wrote and accounted for the absolute dissimilarity of his own handwriting to that of any known member of his family  to suppose that such individual traits as the configuration of the body the color of the hair and eyes the shape of hands and feet the thousandandone subtle characteristics that make family resemblances are transmissible and that the form texture and capacities of the brain which fix the degree of natural intellect are not transmissible is illogical and absurd we see that certain actions such as gestures gait and so forth resulting from the most complex concurrences of brain nerves and muscles are hereditary is it reasonable to suppose that the brain alone of all the organs performs its work according to its own sweet will free from congenital tendencies is it not a familiar fact that racial characteristics are persistentthat one race is stupid and indocile another quick and intelligent does not each generation of a race inherit the intellectual qualities of the preceding generation how could this be true of generations and not of individuals  as to stirpiculture the intelligent and systematic breeding of men and women with a view to improvement of the speciesit is a thing of the far future it is hardly in sight yet what splendid possibilities it carries two or three generations of as careful breeding as we bestow on horses dogs and pigeons would do more good than all the penal reformatory and educating agencies of the world accomplish in a thousand years it is the one direction in which human effort to elevate the race can be assured of a definitive speedy and adequate success it is hardly better than nonsense to prate of any good coming to the race through for example medical science which is mainly concerned in reversing the beneficent operation of natural laws and saving the unfittest to perpetuate their unfitness our entire system of charities is of to the same objection it cares for the incapables whom nature is trying to weed out this not only debases the race physically intellectually and morally but constantly increases the rate of debasement the proportion of criminals paupers and the various kinds of inmates of charitable institutions augments its horrible percentage yearly on the other hand our wars destroy the capable so thus we make inroads upon the vitality of the race from two directions we preserve the feeble and extirpate the strong he who in view of this amazing folly can believe in a constant even slow progress of the human race toward perfection ought to be happy he has a mind whose olympian heights are inaccessiblethe titans of fact can never scale them to storm its ancient reign     the right to work  all kinds of relief charitable or other doubtless tend to perpetuation of pauperism inasmuch as paupers are thereby kept alive and living paupers unquestionably propagate their unthrifty kind more abundantly than dead ones it is not true though that relief interferes with natures beneficent law of the survival of the fittest for the power to excite sympathy and obtain relief is a kind of fitness i am still a devotee of the homely primitive doctrine that mischance disability or even unthrift is not a capital crime justly and profitably punishable by starvation i still regard the good samaritan with a certain toleration and jesus christs tenderness to the poor as something more than a policy of obstruction  if no such thing as an almshouse a hospital an asylum or any one of the many public establishments for relief of the unfortunate were known the proposal to found one would indubitably evoke from thousands of throats notes of deprecation and predictions of disaster it would be called socialism of the radical and dangerous kindof a kind to menace the stability of government and undermine the very foundations of organized society yet who is more truly unfortunate than an ablebodied man out of work through no delinquency of will and no default of effort is hunger to him and his less poignant than to the feeble in body and mind whom we support for nothing in almshouse or asylum are cold and exposure less disagreeable to him than to them is not his claim to the right to live as valid as theirs if backed by the will to pay for life with work and in denial of his claim is there not latent a far greater peril to society than inheres in denial of theirs so unfortunate and dangerous a creature as a man willing to work yet having no work to do should be unknown outside of the literature of satire doubtless there would be enormous difficulties in devising a practicable and beneficent system and doubtless the reform like all permanent and salutary reforms will have to grow the growth naturally will be delayed by opposition of the workingmen themselvesprecisely as they oppose prison labor from ignorance that labor makes labor  it matters not that nine in ten of all our tramps and vagrants are such from choice and irreclaimable degenerates into the bargain so long as one worthy man is out of employment and unable to obtain it our duty is to provide it by law nay so long as industrial conditions are such that so pathetic a phenomenon is possible we have not the moral right to disregard that possibility the right to employment being the right to life its denial is homicide it should be needless to point out the advantages of its concession it would preserve the life and selfrespect of him who is needy through misfortune and supply an infallible means of detection of his criminal imitator who could then be dealt with as he deserves widiout the lenity that finds justification in doubt and compassion it would diminish crime for an empty stomach has no morals with a wage rate lower than the commercial it would disturb no private industries by luring away their workmen and with nothing made to sell there would be no competition with private products properly directed it would give us highways bridges and embankments which we shall not otherwise have  it is difficult to say if our laws relating to vagrancy and vagrants are more cruel or more absurd if not so atrocious they would evoke laughter if less ridiculous we should read them with indignation here is an imaginary conversation  the law it is forbidden to you to rob it is forbidden to you to steal it is forbidden to you to beg  the vagrant being without money and denied employment i am compelled to obtain food shelter and clothing in one of these ways else i shall be hungry and cold  the law that is no affair of mine yet i am considerateyou are permitted to be as hungry as you like and as cold as may suit you  the vagrant hungry yes and many thanks to you but if i go naked i am arrested for indecent exposure you require me to wear clothing  the law youll admit that you need it  the vagrant but not that you provide a way for me to get it no one will give me shelter at night you forbid me to sleep in a straw stack  the law ungrateful man we provide a cell  the vagrant even when i obey you starving all day and freezing all night and holding my tongue with both hands i am liable to arrest for being without visible means of support  the law a most reprehensible condition  the vagrant one thing has been overlookeda legal punishment for begging for work  the law true i am not perfect     the right to take oneself off  a person who loses heart and hope through a personal bereavement is like a grain of sand on the seashore complaining that the tide has washed a neighboring grain out of reach he is worse for the bereaved grain cannot help itself it has to be a grain of sand and play the game of tide win or lose whereas he can quitby watching his opportunity can quit a winner for sometimes we do beat the man who keeps the tablenever in the long run but infrequently and out of small stakes but this is no time to cash in and go for you can not take your little winning with you the time to quit is when you have lost a big stake your fool hope of eventual success your fortitude and your love of the game if you stay in the game which you are not compelled to do take your losses in good temper and do not whine about them they are hard to bear but that is no reason why you should be  but we are told with tiresome iteration that we are put here for some purpose not disclosed and have no right to retire until summonedit may be by smallpox it may be by the bludgeon of a blackguard it may be by the kick of a cow the summoning power said to be the same as the putting power has not a nice taste in the choice of messengers that argument is not worth attention for it is unsupported by either evidence or anything remotely resembling evidence put here indeed and by the keeper of the table who runs the skin game we were put here by our parentsthat is all anybody knows about it and they had no more authority than we and probably no more intention  the notion that we have not the right to take our own lives comes of our consciousness that we have not the courage it is the plea of the cowardhis excuse for continuing to live when he has nothing to live foror his provision against such a time in the future if he were not egotist as well as coward he would need no excuse to one who does not regard himself as the center of creation and his sorrow as the throes of the universe life if not worth living is also not worth leaving the ancient philosopher who was asked why he did not the if as he taught life was no better than death replied because death is no better than life we do not know that either proposition is true but the matter is not worth bothering about for both states are supportablelife despite its pleasures and death despite its repose  it was robert g ingersolls opinion that there is rather too little than too much suicide in the worldthat people are so cowardly as to live on long after endurance has ceased to be a virtue this view is but a return to the wisdom of the ancients in whose splendid civilization suicide had as honorable place as any other courageous reasonable and unselfish act antony brutus cato senecathese were not of the kind of men to do deeds of cowardice and folly the smug selfrighteous modern way of looking upon the act as that of a craven or a lunatic is the creation of priests philistines and women if courage is manifest in endurance of profitless discomfort it is cowardice to warm oneself when cold to cure oneself when ill to drive away mosquitoes to go in when it rains the pursuit of happiness then is not an inalienable right for that implies avoidance of pain no principle is involved in this matter suicide is justifiable or not according to circumstances each case is to be considered on its merits and he having the act under advisement is sole judge to his decision made with whatever light he may chance to have all honest minds will bow the appellant has no court to which to take his appeal nowhere is a jurisdiction so comprehensive as to embrace the right of condemning the wretched to life  suicide is always courageous we call it courage in a soldier merely to face deathsay to lead a forlorn hopealthough he has a chance of life and a certainty of glory but the suicide does more than face death he incurs it and with a certainty not of glory but of reproach if that is not courage we must reform our vocabulary  true there may be a higher courage in living than in dyinga moral courage greater than physical the courage of the suicide like that of the pirate is not incompatible with a selfish disregard of the rights and interests of othersa cruel recreancy to duty and decency i have been asked do you not think it cowardly when a man leaves his family unprovided for to end his life because he is dissatisfied with life in general no i do not i think it selfish and cruel is not that enough to say of it must we distort words from their true meaning in order more effectually to damn the act and cover its author with a greater infamy a word means something despite the maunderings of the lexicographers it does not mean whatever you want it to mean cowardice means the fear of danger not the shirking of duty the writer who allows himself as much liberty in the use of words as he is allowed by the dictionarymaker and by popular consent is a bad writer he can make no impression on his reader and would do better service at the ribboncounter  the ethics of suicide is not a simple matter one can not lay down laws of universal application but each case is to be judged if judged at all with a full knowledge of all the circumstances including the mental and moral makeup of the person taking his own lifean impossible qualification for judgment ones time race and religion have much to do with it some people like the ancient romans and the modern japanese have considered suicide in certain circumstances honorable and obligatory among ourselves it is held in disfavor a man of sense will not give much attention to considerations of that kind excepting in so far as they affect others but in judging weak offenders they are to be taken into the account speaking generally then i should say that in our time and country the following persons and some others are justified in removing themselves and that to some of them it is a duty  one afflicted with a painful or loathsome and incurable disease  one who is a heavy burden to his friends with no prospect of their relief  one threatened with permanent insanity  one irreclaimably addicted to drunkenness or some similarly destructive or offensive habit  one without friends property employment or hope  one who has disgraced himself  why do we honor the valiant soldier sailor fireman for obedience to duty not at all that alonewithout the perilseldom elicits remark never evokes enthusiasm it is because he faced without flinching the risk of that supreme disasteror what we feel to be suchdeath but look you the soldier braves the danger of death the suicide braves death itself the leader of the forlorn hope may not be struck the sailor who voluntarily goes down with his ship may be picked up or cast ashore it is not certain that the wall will topple until the fireman shall have descended with his precious burden but the suicidehis is the foeman that never missed a mark his the sea that gives nothing back the wall that he mounts bears no mans weight and his at the end of it all is the dishonored grave where the wild ass of public opinion       stamps oer his head but can not break his sleep
