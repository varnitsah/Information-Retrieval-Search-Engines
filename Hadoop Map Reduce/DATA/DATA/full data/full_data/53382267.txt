lie to many naturalists affords me most sincere pleasure i had originally intended to have described only a single abnormal cirripede from the shores of south america and was led for the sake of comparison to examine the internal parts of as many genera as i could procure under these circumstances mr j e gray in the most disinterested manner suggested to me making a monograph on the entire class although he himself had already collected materials for this same object furthermore mr gray most kindly gave me his strong support when i applied to the trustees of the british museum for the use of the public collection and i here most respectfully beg to offer my grateful acknowledgments to the trustees for their most liberal and unfettered permission of examining and when necessary disarticulating the specimens in the magnificent collection of cirripedes commenced by dr leach and steadily added to during many years by mr gray considering the difficulty in determining the species in this class had it not been for this most liberal permission by the trustees the public collection would have been of no use to me or to any other naturalist in systematically classifying the cirripedes  previously to mr gray suggesting to me the present monograph mr stutchbury of bristol had offered to intrust to me his truly beautiful collection the fruit of many years labour at that time i refused this most generous offer intending to confine myself to anatomical observations but i have since accepted it and still have the entire splendid collection for my free use mr stutchbury with unwearied kindness further supplied me with fresh specimens for dissection and with much valuable information at about the same period mr cuming strongly urged me to take up the subject and his advice had more weight with me than that of almost any other person he placed his whole magnificent collection at my disposal and urged me to treat it as if it were my own whenever i told him that i thought it necessary he permitted me to open unique specimens of great value and dissect the included animal i shall always feel deeply honoured by the confidence reposed in me by mr cuming and mr stutchbury  i lie under obligations to so many naturalists that i am in truth at a loss how to express my gratitude mr peach over and over again sent me fresh specimens of several species and more especially of scalpellum vulgare which were of invaluable assistance to me in making out the singular sexual relations in that species mr peach furthermore made for me observations on several living individuals mr w thompson the distinguished natural historian of ireland has sent me the finest collection of british species and their varieties which i have seen together with many very valuable ms observations and the results of experiments prof owen procured for me the loan of some very interesting specimens in the college of surgeons and has always given me his invaluable advice and opinion when consulted by me professor e forbes has been as usual most kind in obtaining for me specimens and information of all kinds to the rev r t lowe i am indebted for his particularly interesting collection of cirripedes from the island of madeiraa collection offering a singular proof what treasures skill and industry can discover in the most confined locality the wellknown conchologist mr j g jeffreys has sent for my examination a very fine collection of british specimens together with a copious ms list of synonyms with the authorities quoted to the kindness of messrs mc andrew lovell reeve g busk g b sowerby sen d sharpe bowerbank hancock adam white dr baird sir john richardson and several other gentlemen i am greatly indebted for specimens and information to mr hancock i am further indebted for several long and interesting letters on the burrowing of cirripedes  nor are my obligations confined to british naturalists dr aug gould of boston has most kindly transmitted to me some very interesting specimens as has prof agassiz other specimens collected by himself in the southern states to mr j d dana i am much indebted for several long letters containing original and valuable information on points connected with the anatomy of the cirripedia to mr conrad i am likewise indebted for information and assistance both the celebrated professors milne edwards and müller have lent me from the great public collections under their charge specimens which i should not otherwise have seen to professor w dunker of cassel i am indebted for the examination of his whole collection i have in a former publication expressed my thanks to professor steenstrup but i must be permitted here to repeat them for a truly valuable present of a specimen of the anelasma squalicola of this work i will conclude my thanks to all the above british and foreign naturalists by stating my firm conviction that if a person wants to ascertain how much true kindness exists amongst the disciples of natural history he should undertake as i have done a monograph on some tribe of animals and let his wish for assistance be generally known  had it not been for the ray society i know not how the present volume could have been published and therefore i beg to return my most sincere thanks to the council of this distinguished institution to mr g b sowerby junr i am under obligations for the great care he has taken in making preparatory drawings and in subsequently engraving them i believe naturalists will find that the ten plates here given are faithful delineations of nature  in monographs it is the usual and excellent custom to give a history of the subject but this has been so fully done by burmeister in his beiträge zur naturgeschichte der rankenfüsser and by m g martin st ange in his mémoire sur lorganisation des cirripèdes that it would be superfluous here to repeat the same list of authors i will only add that since the date 1834 of the above works the only important papers with which i am acquainted are 1st dr coldstream on the structure of the shell in sessile cirripedes in the encyclopædia of anatomy and physiology 2d dr lovén on the alepas squalicola ofversigt

the annals of natural history and lastly m reinhardt has described in the copenhagen journal of natural history jan 1851 the lithotrya nicobarica and has discussed its powers of burrowing into rocks  i have given the specific or diagnostic characters deduced from the external parts alone in both latin and english as i found during the progress of this work that a similarly abbreviated character of the softer internal parts was very useful in discriminating the species i have inserted it after the ordinary specific character  in those cases in which a genus includes only a single species i have followed the practice of some botanists and given only the generic character believing it to be impossible before a second species is discovered to know which characters will prove of specific in contradistinction to generic value  in accordance with the rules of the british association i have faithfully endeavoured to give to each species the first name attached to it subsequently to the introduction of the binomial system in 1758 in the tenth edition1 of the systema naturæ in accordance with the rules i have rejected all names before this date and all ms names in one single instance for reasons fully assigned in the proper place i have broken through the great law of priority i have given much fewer synonyms than is usual in conchological works this partly arises from my conviction that giving references to works in which there is not any original matter or in which the plates are not of a high order of excellence is absolutely injurious to the progress of natural history and partly from the impossibility of feeling certain to which species the short descriptions given in most works are applicablethus to take the commonest species the lepas anatifera i have not found a single description with the exception of the anatomical description by m martin st ange by which this species can be certainly discriminated from the almost equally common lepas hillii i have however been fortunate in having been permitted to examine a considerable number of authentically named specimens to which i have attached the sign  used by botanists so that several of my synonyms are certainly correct     1 in the rules published by the british association the 12th    edition 1766 is specified but i am informed by mr    strickland that this is an error and that the binomial method    was followed in the 10th edition  the lepadidæ or pedunculated cirripedes have been neglected under a systematic point of view to a degree which i cannot quite understand no doubt they are subject to considerable variation and as long as the internal surfaces of the valves and all the organs of the animals body are passed over as unimportant there will occasionally be some difficulty in the identification of the several forms and still more in settling the limits of the variability of the species but i suspect the pedunculated cirripedes have in fact been neglected owing to their close affinity and the consequent necessity of their being included in the same work with the sessile cirripedes for these latter will ever present i am fully convinced insuperable difficulties in their identification by external characters alone  i will here only further remark that in the introduction i have given my reasons for assigning distinct names to the several valves and to some parts of the included animals body and that in the introductory remarks under the general description of the lepadidæ i have given an abstract of my anatomical observations     corrigenda and addenda   page  12 twenty lines from bottom for hinder pair of true thoracic           limbs read pair of true thoracic limbs  42 43 i should have added that the number of the segments in the           cirri increases with the age of the specimen but that the           relative numbers in the different cirri keep as far as i have           seen nearly constant hence the numbers are often given in           the descriptions  99 et passim for pæcilasma read poecilasma  156 in a footnote i have alluded to a new genus of sessile           cirripedes under the name of siphonicella i now find that           this species has been called by professor steenstrup           xenobalanus globicipitis     monograph  on  the cirripedia     introduction   i should have been enabled to have made this volume more complete had i deferred its publication until i had finished my examination of all the other known cirripedes but my work would thus have been rendered inconveniently large until this examination is completed it will be more prudent not to discuss in detail the position of the lepadidæ amongst the cirripedia or of these latter in the great class of crustacea to which they now by almost universal consent have been assigned i may however remark that i believe the cirripedia do not approach by a single character any animal beyond the confines of the crustacea where such an approach has been imagined it has been founded on erroneous observations for instance the closed tube within the stomach described by m martin st ange to whose excellent paper i am greatly indebted as indicating an affinity to the annelides is i am convinced nothing but a strong epithelial lining which i have often seen ejected with the excrement again a most distinguished author has stated that the cirripedia differ from the crustacea1st in having a calcareous shell and true mantle but there is no essential difference as shown by burmeister in the shells in these two classes and cirripedes certainly have no more claim to a mantle than have the bivalve entomostraca 2d in the sexes joined in one individual but this as we shall see is not constant nor of very much weight even if constant 3d in the body not being ringed but if the outer integument of the thorax of any cirripede be well cleaned it will be seen as was long ago shown by martin st ange to be most distinctly articulated 4th in having salivary glands but these glands are in truth the ovaria 5th in the liver being formed on the molluscous type i do not think this is the case but i do not quite understand the point in question 6th in not having a head or organs of sense this is singularly erroneous professor leidy has shown the existence of eyes in the mature cirripede the antennæ though preserved certainly become functionless soon after the last metamorphosis but there exist other organs of sense which i believe serve for smelling and hearing and lastly so far from there being no head the whole of the cirripede externally visible consists exclusively of the three anterior segments of the head  the subclass cirripedia can be divided into three orders the first of which mainly characterised by having six pair of thoracic cirri includes all common cirripedes these latter may be divided into three familiesthe lepadidæ or pedunculated cirripedes the subject of the present memoir the verrucidæ containing the single genus verruca or clisia and lastly the balanidæ which consist of two very distinct subfamilies the balaninæ and chthamalinæ of the other two orders above alluded to one will i believe contain the remarkable burrowing genus alcippe lately described by mr hancock and a second burrowing genus or rather family obtained by me on the coast of south america the third order is highly singular and differs as much from all other cirripedes as does a lernæa from other crustaceans it has a suctorial mouth but is destitute of an anus it has not any limbs and is as plainly articulated as the larva of a fly it is entirely naked without valves carapace or capitulum and is attached to the cirripede in the sack of which it is parasitic by two distinct threads terminating in the usual larval prehensile antennæ i intend to call this cirripede proteolepas i mention it here for the sake of calling attention to any parasite at all answering to this description   nomenclature of the valves  illustration figure i  capitulum  illustration figure ii  scutum of lepas  illustration figure iii  tergum of lepas  although the present volume is strictly systematic i will under the general description of the lepadidæ give a very brief abstract of some of the most interesting points in their internal anatomy and in the metamorphoses of the whole class which i hope hereafter to treat with the necessary illustrations in detail i enter on the subject of the metamorphoses the more readily as by this means alone can the homologies of the different parts be clearly understood   on the names given to the different parts of cirripedes  i have unwillingly found it indispensable to give names to several valves and to some few of the softer parts of cirripedes the accompanying figure of an imaginary scalpellum includes every valve the two most important valves of lepas are also given in which the direction of the lines of growth and general shape differ from those of scalpellum as much as they do in any genus the names which i have imposed will i hope be thus acquired without much difficulty  whoever will refer to the published descriptions of recent and fossil cirripedia will find the utmost confusion in the existing nomenclature thus the valve named in the woodcut the scutum has been designated by various wellknown naturalists as the ventral the anterior the inferior the antelateral and the lateroinferior valve the first two of these titles have moreover been applied to the rostrum or rostral valve of sessile cirripedes the tergum has been called the dorsal the posterior the superior the central the terminal the posterolateral and the laterosuperior valve the carina has received the first two of these identical epithets viz the dorsal and the posterior and likewise has been called the keelvalve the confusion however becomes far worse when any individual valve is described for the very same margin which is anterior or inferior in the eyes of one author is the posterior or superior in those of another it has often happened to me that i have been quite unable even to conjecture to which margin or part of a valve an author was referring moreover the length of these double titles is inconvenient hence as i have to describe all the recent and fossil species i trust i may be thought justified in giving short names to each of the more important valves these being common to the pedunculated and sessile cirripedes  the part supported by the peduncle and which is generally though not always protected by valves i have designated the capitulum  the title of peduncle which is either naked or squamiferous requires no explanation the scales on it and the lower valves of the capitulum are arranged in whorls which in the latin specific descriptions i have called by the botanical term of verticillus  i have applied the term scutum to the most important and persistent of the valves and which can generally be recognised by the hollow giving attachment to the adductor scutorum muscle from the resemblance which the two valves taken together bear to a shield and from their office of protecting the front side of the body from the protection afforded by the two terga to the dorsolateral surface of the animal these valves have been thus called the term carina2 is a mere translation of the name already used by some authors of keelvalve     2 in the carina of fossil species of scalpellum i have found    it necessary to distinguish different parts viz a the tectum    of which half is seen b the parietes and c the    intraparietes  the rostrum has been so called from its relative position to the carina or keel there is often a subcarina and a subrostrum  the remaining valves when present have been called latera there is always one large upper one inserted between the lower halves of the scuta and terga and this i have named the upper latus or latera the other latera in pollicipes are numerous and require no special names in scalpellum where there are at most only three pair beneath the upper latera it is convenient to speak of them vide woodcut i as the carinal inframedian and rostral latera  as each valve often requires especially amongst the fossil species a distinct description i have found it indispensable to give names to each margin these have mostly been taken from the name of the adjoining valve see fig i in lepas pollicipes c the margin of the scutum adjoining the tergum and upper latus is not divided fig ii into two distinct lines as it is in scalpellum and is therefore called the tergolateral margin in scalpellum fig i these two margins are separately named tergal and lateral the angle formed by the meeting of the basal and lateral or tergolateral margins i call the basolateral angle that formed by the basal and occludent margins i call from its closeness to the rostrum the rostral angle in pollicipes the carinal margin of the tergum can be divided into an upper and lower carinal margin of this there is only a trace fig i in scalpellum  that margin in the scuta and terga which opens and shuts for the exsertion and retraction of the cirri i have called the occludent margin in the terga of lepas fig iii and some other genera the occludent margin is highly protuberant and arched or even formed of two distinct sides  occasionally i have referred to what i have called the primordial valves these are not calcified they are formed at the first exuviation when the larval integuments are shed in mature cirripedes they are always seated when not worn away on the umbones of the valves  the membrane connecting the valves and forming the peduncle and sometimes in a harder condition replacing the valves i have often found it convenient to designate by its proper chemical name of chitine instead of by horny or other such equivalents when this membrane at any articulation sends in rigid projections or crests for the attachment of muscles or any other purpose i call them after audouin apodemes for the underlying true skin i use the term corium  the animals body is included within the capitulum within what i call the sack see pl iv figs 2 and 8´ a and pl ix fig 4 the body consists of the thorax supporting the cirri and of an especial enlargement or downward prolongation of the thorax which includes the stomach and which i have called the prosoma pl ix fig 4 n the cirri are composed of two arms or rami supported on a common segment or support which i call the pedicel the caudal appendages are two little projections either unior multiarticulate pl iv fig 8´ a on each side of the anus and just above the long proboscislike penis on the thorax and prosoma or on the pedicels of the cirri there are in several genera long thin tapering filaments which have generally been supposed to serve as branchiæ these i call simply filaments or filamentary appendages pl ix fig 4 gl the mouth fig 4 b is prominent and consists of palpi soldered to the labrum mandibles maxillæ and outer maxillæ these latter serve as an under lip to these several organs i sometimes apply the title used by entomologists of trophi beneath the outer maxillæ there are either two simple orifices or tubular projections these i believe serve as organs of smell and have hence called them the olfactory orifices within the sack there are often two sheets of ova pl iv fig 2 b these i call after steenstrup and other authors the ovigerous lamellæ they are united to two little folds of skin pl iv fig 2 f which i call the ovigerous fræna  from the peculiar curved position which the animals body occupies within the capitulum i have found it far more convenient not to mention the confusion of nomenclature already existing to apply the term rostral instead of ventral and carinal instead of dorsal to almost all the external and internal parts of the animal cirripedes have generally been figured with their surfaces of attachment downwards hence i speak of the lower or basal margins and angles and of those pointing in an opposite direction as the upper strictly speaking as we shall presently see the exact centre of the usually broad and flat surface of attachment is the anterior end of the animal and the upper tips of the terga the posterior end of that part of the animal which is externally visible but in some cases for instance in coronula where the base is deeply concave and where the width of the shell far exceeds the depth it seemed almost ridiculous to call this the anterior extremity as likewise does it in balanus to call the united tips of the terga lying deeply within the shell the most posterior point of the animal as seen externally  i have followed the example of botanists and added the interjection  to synonyms when i have seen an authentic specimen bearing the name in

all cirripedia but more especially in relation to the present family i may premise that since vaughan thompsons capital discovery of the larvæ in the last stage of development in balanus much has been done on this subject this same author subsequently published4 in the philosophical transactions an account of the larvæ of lepas and conchoderma cineras in the first stage and seeing how totally distinct they were from the larva of the latter stage in balanus he erroneously attributed the difference to the difference in the two families instead of to the stage of development burmeister5 first showed and the discovery is an important one that in lepas the larvæ pass through two totally different stages this has subsequently been proved by implication to be the case in balanus by goodsir6 who has given excellent drawings of the larva in the first stage and quite lately mr c spence bate of swansea has made other detailed observations and drawings of the larvæ of five species in this same early stage and has most kindly permitted me to quote from his unpublished paper7 i am enabled to confirm and generalise these observations in all the cirripedes in the order containing the balanidæ and lepadidæ     4 philosophical transactions 1835 p 355 pl vi     5 beiträge zur naturgeschichte der rankenfüsser 1834 mr j    e gray however briefly described in 1833 proceedings

pls iii and    iv     7 this will appear in the october number 1851 of the annals    of natural history  the ova and consequently the larvæ of the lepadidæ in the first stage whilst within the sack of the parent vary in length from 007 to 009 in lepas to 023 of an inch in scalpellum my chief examination of these larvæ has been confined to those of scalpellum vulgare but i saw them in all the other genera the larva is somewhat depressed but nearly globular the carapace anteriorly is truncated with lateral horns the sternal surface is flat and broad and formed of thinner membrane than the dorsal the horns just alluded to are long in lepas and short in scalpellum their ends are either rounded and excessively transparent or as in ibla furnished with an abrupt minute sharp point within these horns i distinctly saw a long filiformed organ bearing excessively fine hairs in lines so exactly like the long plumose spines on the prehensile antennæ of the larvæ in the last stage that i have not the least doubt that these horns are the cases in which antennæ are in process of formation posteriorly to them on the sternal surface near each other there are two other minute doubly curved pointed horns about 004 in length directed posteriorly and within these i again saw a most delicate articulated filiformed organ on a thicker pedicel in an excellent drawing by mr c s bate of the larva of a chthamalus balanus punctatus of british authors after having kept alive and moulted once these organs are distinctly shown as articulated antennæ without a case directed forwards hence before the first moult in scalpellum we have two pair of antennæ in process of formation anteriorly to the bases of these smaller antennæ is seated the heartshaped eye as i believe it to be 001 in diameter with apparently a single lens surrounded except at the apex by darkreddish pigmentcells in some cases as in some species of lepas the larvæ when first excluded from the egg have not an eye or a very imperfect one  there are three pairs of limbs seated close together in a longitudinal line but some way apart in a transverse direction the first pair always consists of a single spinose ramus it is not articulated in scalpellum but is multiarticulate in some genera it is directed forwards the other two pair have each two rami supported on a common haunch or pedicel in both pair the longer ramus is multiarticulate and the shorter ramus is without articulations or with only traces of them the longer spines borne on these limbs at least in scalpellum and chthamalus are finely plumose the abdomen terminates a little beyond the posterior end of the carapace in a slightly upturned horny point a short distance anteriorly to this point a strong spinose forked projection depends from the abdominal surface  messrs v thompson goodsir and bate have kept alive for several days the larvæ of lepas conchoderma balanus verruca and chthamalus and have described the changes which supervene between the first and third exuviations the most conspicuous new character is the great elongation of the posterior point of the carapace into an almost filiform spinose point in lepas conchoderma chthamalus and balanus but not according to goodsir in one of the species of the latter genus the posterior point also of the abdomen becomes developed in balanus goodsir into two very long spearlike processes serrated on their outer sides in lepas and conchoderma according to thompson into a single tapering spinose projection and in chthamalus as figured by mr bate the posterior bifid point as well as the depending ventral fork increase much in size another important change which has been particularly attended to by mr bate is the appearance of spinose projections and spines some of which are thick curved and strongly plumose or almost pectinated along their inner sides on the pedicels and lower segments of the shorter rami of the two posterior pairs of limbs  the mouth in its earliest condition alone remains to be described in s vulgare it is seated on a very slight prominence in a most remarkable situation namely in a central point between the bases of the three pairs of legs i traced by dissection the oesophagus for some little way until lost in the cellular and oily matter filling the whole animal and it was directed anteriorly which is the direction that might have been expected from the course followed by the oesophagus in the larva in the last stage and in mature cirripedes mr a hancock has called my attention to a probosciformed projection on the under side of the larva of lepas fascicularis when just escaped from the egg mr bate has described this same proboscis in balanus and chthamalus and states the important fact that it is capable of being moved by the animal and lastly i have seen it in an australian chthamalus and in ibla of remarkable size this proboscis which is always directed posteriorly like the mouth in the mature animal certainly answers to the mouth as made out by dissection in scalpellum and i believe i saw as has mr bate a terminal orifice it certainly does not possess any trophi in ibla in which the larva is large enough for dissection the base of the proboscis arises posteriorly to the first pair of legs and the orifice at the other end reaches beyond or posteriorly to the point where the mouth in scalpellum opens namely between the middle pair of legs the mouth being either so largely probosciformed or seated only on a slight eminence in two genera so closely allied as ibla and scalpellum and judging from mr thompsons figures and from what i have seen myself in the species of the same genus lepas is a singular difference in the cases in which at first the proboscis is absent it would probably soon be developed i cannot but suppose that the inwardly directed spines on the bases of the two posterior legs which are so rapidly developed serve some important end namely as organs of prehension for the larvæ like the mandibles and maxillæ of mature cirripedes for seizing their prey and conveying it to their moveable mouths conveniently seated for this purpose  the first pair of legs answers as i believe from reasons hereafter to be assigned to the outer pair of maxillipods in the higher crustacea and the other four legs to the first two pair of thoracic limbs in these same crustacea this being the case the highly remarkable position of the mouth in the larva either between the bases of the two posterior pair of legs or at least posteriorly to the first pair together with the probable functions of the spiny points springing from the basal segments of the two hinder pair of true thoracic limbs forcibly bring to mind the anomalous structure of the mouth being situated in the middle of the under side of the thorax in limulusthat most ancient of crustaceans and therefore one likely to exhibit a structure now embryonic in other orders i will only further remark that i suspect that the truncation of the anterior end of the carapace has been effected by the segments having been driven inwards and consequently that the larger antennæ within the lateral horns though standing more in front than the little approximate pair are normally the posterior of the two pair according to milne edwards the posterior pair are normally seated outside the anterior pair and this is the case with those within the lateral horns  larva in the second stagenotwithstanding the considerable changes already briefly given which the larva undergoes during the first two or three exuviations after leaving the egg all these forms may be conveniently classed under the first stage the larva in the second stage is known only from a single specimen described figured and found by burmeister8 adhering to seaweed in the midst of other larvæ of lepas in the last stage in its general shape and compressed form it seems to come nearer to the last than to the first stage it has only three pair of legs situated much more posteriorly on the body than in the first stage and all directed posteriorly they are much shorter than heretofore and resemble rather closely those of the last stage with the important exception that the first pair has only one ramus it is this circumstance which leaves no doubt on my mind that we here have the three pair of limbs of the first stage metamorphosed the body is prolonged some way behind these limbs and ends in a blunt rounded point in which probably are developed the three posterior pair of legs and the abdomen of the larva in the last stage the mouth is now seated some way anteriorly to the limbs is large and probosciformed and is i presume still destitute of trophi there are now two closely approximate eyes but as yet both are simple the smaller pair of antennæ has disappeared the whole animal was attached to the seaweed by a i presume pair of fleischigen fortsatz which burmeister considers as the prehensile antennæ to be presently described in an early state of development i have little doubt that this is correct for in an abnormal cirripede of another order in which the larva appears in the first stage with prehensile antennæ the eggs have two great projecting horns including these organs and attached by their tips through some unknown means to the sack of the parent apparently in the same manner as burmeisters larva was attached to the seaweed i will only further remark on the larva of this second stage that its chief development since the first stage has been towards its anterior end the next great development to be immediately described is towards the posterior end of the animal     8 beiträge zur naturgeschichte der rankenfüsser s 16 tab i    figs 3 4  larva last stagemy chief examination has been directed at this stage of development to the larvæ of lepas australis which are of unusual size namely from 065 to even almost 1 of an inch in length i examined however the larvæ of several other species of lepas of ibla and of balanus with less care but sufficiently to show that in all essential points of organisation they were identical this indeed might have been inferred from the similarity of the larval prehensile antennæ preserved in the bases of all mature cirripedes and which i have carefully inspected in almost every genus the larvæ in this final stage in most of the genera have increased many times in size since their exclusion from the egg for instance in lepas australis from 007 to 065 or even to 1 of an inch they are now much compressed nearly of the shape of a cypris or musselshell with the anterior end the thickest the sternal surface nearly or quite straight and the dorsal arched almost the whole of what is externally visible consists of the carapace for the thorax and limbs are hidden and enclosed by its backward prolongation and even at the anterior end of the animal the narrow sternal surface can be drawn up so as to be likewise enclosed as in several stomapod crustaceans the part of the head bearing the antennæ and organs of sense in front of the mouth equals or even exceeds in length and more than exceeds in bulk the posterior part of the body consisting of the enclosed thorax and abdomen i will now briefly describe in the following order the carapace the organs of sense mouth thorax and limbs abdomen and internal viscera  the form of the carapace has been sufficiently described it consists of thick chitine membrane marked with lines and sometimes with stars and other patterns it is obscurely divided into two halves by a line or suture along part of the dorsal margin these halves or two valves are drawn together by an adductor muscle in the same relative position as in the mature cirripede the part overhanging and enclosing the thorax is lined by an excessively delicate membrane obviously homologous with the lining of the sack in the mature animal and is nothing but a duplicature of the carapace rendered very thin from being on the under or protected side a layer of true skin or corium probably double separates these two folds  acoustic organson the borders of the carapace at the anterior end on the sternal surface there are two minute orifices in l australis 002 in diameter sometimes having a distinct border round them the membrane of the carapace on the inside is prolonged upwards and inwards in two short funnelshaped tubes lodged in closed sacks of the corium within these sacks on each side a delicate bag is suspended and hangs in the mouth of the above funnel at the upper end a large nerve could be distinctly seen to enter the bag i cannot doubt that this is a senseorgan from its position and from the animal not feeding as we shall presently see i conclude that it is an acoustic organ  antennæthese are large and conspicuous they are attached very obliquely on the sternal surface a little way from the anterior end of the carapace beyond which when exserted they extend9 they can at least in ibla be retracted within the carapace they consist of three segments the first or basal one is much larger than the others and apparently always has a single spine on the outer distal margin the second segment consists either of a large thin circular sucking disc or is hooflike tab v figs 5 10 11 12 in all cases it is furnished with one or more spines seven very long ones in lepas on the exteriorhinder margin the third and ultimate segment is small it is articulated on the upper surface of the disc and is directed rectangularly outwards it is sometimes notched and even shows traces of being bifid it bears about seven spines at the end some of these spines are hooked others simple and in lepas and conchoderma two or three are very long highly flexible and plumose a double row of excessively fine hairs being articulated on them i can hardly doubt that these latter spines within which the purple corium could be seen to enter a little way floating laterally outwards serve as feelers the antennæ at first are well furnished with muscles they serve in lepas according to mr king and in balanus according to mr bate and as i saw myself in another unnamed order for the purpose of walking one limb being stretched out before the other but their main function is to attach the larva for its final metamorphosis into a cirripede the disc can adhere even to so smooth a surface as a glass tumbler10 the attachment is at first manifestly voluntary but soon becomes involuntary and permanent being effected by special and most remarkable means which will be most conveniently described in a later part of this introduction i will here only state that i traced with ease the two cementducts running from two large glandular bodies to within the antennæ up to the discs     9 mr j d dana who has examined these organs in the larvæ of    lepas informs me in a letter that in his opinion they    correspond with the inferior antennæ the superior being    wanting as in most daphnidæ he continuesi know of no case    in which the inferior are obsolete when the superior are    developed but the reverse is often true in position these    antennæ certainly correspond to the inferior and central pair of    the larva in the first stage which belong as it would appear    to the first segment of the body but judging from the drawing by    burmeister of the larva in the second stage i am in some    respects more inclined to consider that they correspond to the    larger pair seen within the lateral horns of the carapace in the    first stage     10 rev b l king annual report of b institution of    cornwall 1848 p 55  eyesclose behind the basal articulations of the antennæ the sternal surface consists of two approximate elongated narrow flat pieces or segments these burmeister considers as the basal segments of the antennæ as they are not cylindrical i do not see the grounds for this conclusion their posterior ends are rounded and the membrane forming them is reflected inwards in the form of two forked horny apodemes together resembling two letters uu close together these project up inside the animal for at least one third of its thickness from the sternal to the dorsal surface the two great almost spherical eyes in l australis each 1150th of an inch in diameter are attached to the outer arms thus °uu° in the position of the two full stops hence the eyes are included within the carapace each eye consists of eight or ten lenses varying in diameter in the same individual from 12000 to 32000th of an inch enclosed in a common membranous bag or cornea and thus attached to the outer apodemes the lenses are surrounded half way up by a layer of dark pigmentcells the nerve does not enter the bluntlypointed basal end of the common eye but on one side of the apodeme the structure here described is exactly that found according to milne edwards in certain crustacea in specimens just attached in which no absorption has taken place two long muscles with transverse striæ may be found attached to the knobbed tips of the two middle arms of the two °uu° and running up to the anterodorsal surface of the carapace where they are attached other muscles without transverse striæ are attached round the bases on both sides of both forks the action of these muscles would inevitably move the eyes but i suspect that their function may be to draw up the narrow deeply folded sternal surface and thus cause the retraction of the great prehensile antennæ within the carapace  mouththis is seated in exactly the same position as in the mature cirripede on a slight prominence fronting the thoracic limbs and so far within the carapace that it was obviously quite unfitted for the seizure of prey and it was equally obvious that the limbs were natatory and incapable of carrying food to the mouth this enigma was at once explained by an examination of the mouth which was found to be in a rudimentary condition and absolutely closed so that there would be no use in prey being seized underneath this slightly prominent and closed mouth i found all the masticatory organs of a cirripede in an immature condition the state of the mouth will be at once understood if we suppose very fluid matter to be poured over the protuberant mouth of a cirripede so as to run a little way down in the shape of internal crests between the different parts and in the shape of a short shrivelled certainly closed tube a little way 008 of an inch in l australis down the oesophagus hence the larva in this its last stage cannot eat it may be called a locomotive pupa11 its whole organisation is apparently adapted for the one great end of finding a proper site for its attachment and final metamorphosis     11 m dujardin has lately comptes rendus feb 5 1850 as    cited in annals of nat history vol v p 318 discovered    that the hypopi are acari with eight feet without either mouth    or intestine and which being deprived of all means of    alimentation fix themselves at will so as to undergo a final    metamorphosis and they become gamasi or uropodi here then we    have an almost exactly analogous case m dujardin asksought    therefore the hypopi to be called larvæ when under that    denomination have hitherto been comprised animals capable of    nourishing themselves  thorax and limbsthe thorax is much compressed and consists of six segments corresponding with the six pair of natatory legs the anterior segments are much plainer even the first being distinctly separated by a fold from the mouth than the posterior segments which is exactly the reverse of what takes place in the mature cirripede in the latter the first segment is confounded with the part bearing the mouth the epimeral elements of the thorax are distinguishable the sternal surface is very narrow and is covered with complicated folds and ridges the six pair of legs are all close one behind the other and all are alike in having a haunch or pedicel of two segments directed forwards bearing two arms or rami each composed of two segments the outer ramus being a little longer than the inner one on the lower segments in both rami of all the limbs there is a single spine in all the limbs the obliquely truncated summit of the terminal segment of the inner ramus bears three very long beautifully plumose spines in the first pair the summit of the outer ramus bears four and in the five succeeding pair six similar spines this difference small as it is is interesting as recalling the much greater difference between the first and succeeding pairs in the first and second stage of development the terminal segments of all the rami bearing the long plumose spines are directed backwards the limbs and thorax are well furnished with striated muscles the animal according to mr king swims with great rapidity back downwards the limbs can be withdrawn within the carapace  abdomen and caudal appendagesthe abdomen is small and its structure might easily be overlooked without careful dissection of the different parts it consists of three segments the first can be seen to be distinct from the last thoracic segment bearing the sixth pair of limbs only from the fold of the epimeral element and from its difference in shape the second segment is very short but quite distinct the third is four or five times as long as the second and bears at the end two little appendages each consisting of two segments the lower one with a single spine and the upper one with three very long plumose spines like those on the rami of the thoracic limbs the abdomen contains only the rectum and two delicate muscles running into the two appendages between the bases of which the anus is seated  internal viscerawithin the body in front of the mouth it was easy to find the stomach with two pearshaped cæca at the upper end running first anteriorly and then curving back and reaching the anus by a long rectum difficult to be followed it appeared however to me that this stomach had more relation to the young cirripede of which every part could now generally be traced than to the larva with its closed and rudimentary mouth the fact however of its being prolonged to the anus which is in a different position in the larva and mature state shows that the stomach serves at least as an excretory channel besides the stomach the several muscles already alluded to and much pulpy and oily matter the only other internal organs consist of two long rather thick gutformed masses into the anterior ends of which the cementducts running from the prehensile antennæ could be traced these masses are formed of irregular orange balls about 001 of an inch in diameter made up of rather large cells so to have a grapelike appearance held together by a transparent pale yellowish substance but apparently not enclosed in a membrane these masses lie rather obliquely and approach each other at their anterior ends they extend from above the compound eyes to the cæca of the stomach to which they cohere but in young specimens they extend some way beyond the cæca between the folds of the carapace the two cementducts at the points where they enter these bodies expand and are lost at this point also the little orangecoloured masses of cells have the appearance of being broken down into a finer substance within the cementducts i saw a distinct chord of rather opaque cellular matter we shall presently see that these gutformed masses are the incipient ovaria  the young cirripede within the larvaseveral times i succeeded in dissecting off the integuments of the latelyattached larva and in displaying the young lepas australis entire the following description applies to the cirripede in this state but for convenience sake i shall occasionally refer to its condition when a little more advanced i may premise and the fact in itself is curious that the bivalvelike shell of the larva together with the compound eyes is first moulted and some time afterwards the inner lining of the sack together with the integuments of the thorax and of the natatory legs hence i often found specimens which externally seemed to have perfected their metamorphoses but which within their sacks retained all the characters of the natatory larva according to mr king the larva of lepas throws off its external shell five days after becoming attached whilst the young lepas is closely packed within the larva the capitulum as known by the five valves about equals in length the peduncle the peduncle occupies the anterior half of the larva when fully stretched it becomes narrower and slightly longer than the capitulum the separation between the capitulum and peduncle is almost arbitrary in the mature animal and corresponds with no particular line in the larva even at this early period the muscles of the peduncle are quite distinct no vestige is preserved in the outer integument of the sternal and dorsal sutures of the larval carapace but in the corium of the peduncle three coloured marks which occur near the eyes and two little curled marks which occur near the acoustic orifices of the larva are all preserved for some time after maturity the compound eyes as we have seen are attached to apodemes springing from the sternal surface of the larval carapace and are consequently cast off with it whilst the young cirripede is packed within the larva the outer integument of its peduncle necessarily forms a deep transverse fold passing over the eyes and apodemes and this as we shall presently see plays an important part in the future position of the animal the antennæ are not moulted with the carapace but left cemented to the surface of attachment their muscles are converted into sinewy fibres the corium after a short period is absorbed and they are then preserved in a functionless condition no trace of the two acoustic sacks can be perceived in the corium of the young cirripede excepting the coloured marks above alluded to  in the young capitulum the five valves stand some way apart from each other they are elegant objects under the microscope they are not calcified but consist exclusively of chitine they are rather thick composed of an outer membrane lined by hexagonal prisms quite unlike any other membrane in the animal these valves which i have called primordial valves resemble pretty closely in shape the valves of the mature animal the fork of the carina however is indicated only by a slight constriction above the lower end after the exuviation of the larval integuments and when calcification commences the first layer of shell is deposited under and then round these primordial valves the latter in well preserved old specimens may often be detected on the umbones of the scuta terga and carina but not on the umbones of any other valves  the mouth seems one of the earliest parts developed in the youngest larva dissected i could make out at least points corresponding with each organ and at the period when the young cirripede could be dissected out of its larval envelopes their general details were quite plain the labrum however had not become bullate the mouth as we have seen is formed under the rudimentary mouth of the larva and at the same relative spot occupied by the probosciformed mouth of the larva in the second stage thus far in the young cirripede and larva there has been no great change in the relative positions of the parts the rudimentary eyes however of the former are developed posteriorly to or above as applied to a cirripede the castoff compound eyes of the larva but the position of the mouth of the antennæ and of the several coloured marks in the corium prove to demonstration the correspondence in both of part to part the case is rather different with what follows  the cirri are developed at first of considerable length so that the young animal may soon provide itself with food in lepas australis they are of great length the sixth pair consisting of seventeen or eighteen obscure segments the extreme tips of the twentyfour rami of the six pair of cirri are formed within the twentyfour corresponding little bisegmental rami of the six pair of natatory legs but as the cirri are many times longer than these legs they occupy in a bundle the whole thorax of the larva no part whatever of the thorax of the cirripede is formed within the thorax of the larva but together with the pedicels of the anterior cirri within the cephalic cavity as a consequence of this the longitudinal axis of the thorax of the young cirripede lies almost transversely to the longitudinal axis of the larva and the cirripede from this transverse position of its thorax comes to be as it were internally almost cut in twain and the sack thus produced as soon as the young cirripede is free and can move itself the cirri are curled up and the thorax is advanced towards the orifice of the capitulum its longitudinal axis resuming the position of approximate parallelism to the longitudinal axis of the whole body which it had in the larval condition the reader will perhaps understand what i mean if he will look at the mature cirripede figured in pl ix fig 4 in this he will see that the body or thorax is united to the peduncle only by a small part below the mouth on the other hand if he imagines the whole bottom of the body as high up as the letter h united and blended into the peduncle he will see the state in which these parts exist in the larva now let him greatly shorten the cirri so as to resemble the natatory legs of the larva and then imagine a young cirripede with cirri of full length formed within the old one he will see that the new thorax supporting the cirri will have to be developed in an almost transverse positionthe animal consequently being internally almost separated into twain  of the internal organs whilst the cirripede is still within the larva i have already mentioned the stomach with its pair of cæca from the retracted position of the thorax and rudimentary abdomen and consequently of the anus compared with these parts in the larva the alimentary canal is not above half its former length there is as yet no trace of the filaments supposed by some to act as branchiæ at the base of the first pair of cirri nor could i perceive a trace of the testes or vesiculæ seminales the penis is represented by a minute apparently imperforate projection i have already briefly described the pair of large gutformed bodies in the larva into the anterior ends of which the cementducts ran and evidently derived their slightly opaque cellular contents at a very early age before the young cirripede can be distinctly made out the posterior ends of these gutformed bodies are absorbed so as not to pass beyond the cæca of the stomach when the young cirripede is plainly developed within the larva these bodies in a relatively reduced condition are still distinct near the cæca and at the opposite or anterior end i e lower in the position in which cirripedes are usually figured they have branched out into a sheet of delicate inosculating tubes these could be traced by every stage until in the young perfected cirripede they filled the peduncle as ordinary ovarian tubes in the larva the two gutformed bodies or incipient ovaria keep of equal thickness from one to the other end but in the mature cirripede the ovarian tubes in the peduncle and the small glandular grapelike masses near the stomachcæca are connected only by a delicate tube this i failed in tracing in specimens in the very immature condition of those now under description  the larva fixes itself with its sternal surface parallel and close to the surface of attachment and the antennæ become cemented to it if the cirripede after its metamorphosis had remained in this position the cirri could not have been exserted or only against the surface of attachment but there is a special provision that the young cirripede shall immediately assume its proper position at right angles to the position which it held whilst within the larva namely with its posterior end upwards this is effected in a singular manner by the exuviation of the great compound eyes which we have seen are fastened to the outer arms of the double °uu°like sternal apodemes these together with the eyes stretch transversely across and internally far up into the body of the larva and as the whole has to be rejected or moulted the membrane of the peduncle of the young cirripede has necessarily to be formed with a wide and deep inward fold extending transversely across it this when stretched open after the exuviation of the larval carapace and apodemes necessarily causes the sternal side of the peduncle to be longer than the dorsal and as a consequence gives to the young cirripede its normal position at right angles to that of the larva when first attached                                       i may here state that i have examined the larvæ in this the final or perfect stage in four species of lepas in conchodermavirgata ibla quadrivalvis and though rather less minutely in balanus balanoides and i find all essential points of organisation similar with the exception of diversities in the proportional sizes of the different parts and in the patterns on the carapace the differences even in the arrangement of the spines on the limbs and antennæ are less than i should have anticipated  i have in this abstract treated the metamorphoses at greater length than i should otherwise have done on account of the great importance of arriving at a correct homological interpretation of the different parts of the mature animal in crustacea according to the ordinary view there are twentyone segments of these i can recognise in the cirripede on evidence as good as can generally be obtained all with the exception of the four terminal abdominal segments these do not occur in any species known to me in any stage of its development if that part of the larva in front of the mouth bearing the eyes the prehensile antennæ and in an earlier stage two pair of antennæ be formed as is admitted in all other crustacea of three segments then beyond a doubt from the absolute correspondence of every part and even every coloured mark the peduncle of the lepadidæ is likewise thus formed the peduncle being filled by the branching ovarian tubes is no objection to this view for i am informed on the high authority of mr j d dana12 that this is the case with the cephalothorax in some true crustaceans for instance in sapphirina to proceed the mouth formed of mandibles maxillæ and outer maxillæ correspond with the fourth fifth and sixth segments of the archetype crustacean posteriorly to the mouth we come in the larva to a rather wide interspace without any apparent articulation or organ and then to the thorax formed of six segments bearing the six pair of limbs of which the first pair differs slightly from the others the thorax is succeeded by three small segments differently shaped with the posterior one alone bearing appendages these segments i cannot doubt from their appearance alone and from their apparent function of steering the body are abdominal segments if this latter view be correct the thoracic segments are the six posterior ones of the normal seven segments and there must be two segments missing between the outer maxillæ and first thoracic pair of legs which latter on this view springs from the ninth segment now in a very singular cirripede already alluded to under the name of proteolepas the two missing segments are present the mouth being actually succeeded by eight segments and these by the three usual abdominal segmentsevery segment in the body being as distinct as in an annelid hence in proteolepas adding the three segments for the mouth and three for the carapace we have altogether seventeen segments which as i stated is the full number ever observed in any cirripede the four missing ones being abdominal and i presume the four terminal segments that the cavity in which the thorax is lodged in the larva and therefore in the mature cirripede is simply formed by the backward production of the carapace does not require any discussion the valves have no homological signification     12 this distinguished naturalist has given his opinion in the    american journal of science march 1846 that the pedicel of    anatifa corresponds to a pair of antennæ in the young although    the peduncle or pedicel is undoubtedly thus terminated even in    mature individuals i think it has been shown that it is the    whole of the anterior part of the larva in front of the mouth    which is directly converted into the peduncle professor e    forbes in his lectures and professor steenstrup in his    untersuchungen über das vorkommen des hermaphroditismus in der    natur ch v have considered the peduncle as a pair of fused    legs lovén has taken judging from a single sentence the same    view of the homologies of the external parts as i have done in    his description of alepas squalicola ofversigt of kongl    vetens c stockholm 1844 pp 1924 he uses the following    words capitis reliquæ partes ut in lepadibus semper in    pedunculum mutatæ et involucrum c his involucrum is the    same as the capitulum of this work  as we have just seen that the first pair of natatory legs is borne on the ninth segment of the body so it must be with the first pair of cirri which consequently correspond to the outer maxillipods the two inner pair of maxillipods or piedmachoires being here aborted of the higher crustacea and hence their difference from the five posterior pair which correspond with the five ordinary pair of ambulatory legs in these same crustacea the part of the body which i have called the prosoma that is the protuberant nonarticulated lower part of the thorax pl ix fig 4 n is a special development either of the ninth segment bearing the first pair of cirri or of the segments corresponding with the organs of the mouth the three abdominal segments of the larva are represented in the mature cirripede in the order containing the lepadidæ only by a minute triangular gusset let in between the vshaped tergal arches of the last thoracic segment in this gusset small as it is is seated the anus and on each side the caudal appendages often rudimentary and sometimes absent in another order i may remark including probably the alcippe of mr hancock the cirri of which there are only three pair are abdominal  i feel much confidence that the homologies here given are correct the cause of their having been generally overlooked arises i believe from the peculiar manner already described in which the animal during its last metamorphosis is internally almost intersected even for some little time after discovering that the larval antennæ were always embedded in the centre of the surface of attachment i did not perceive that this was the anterior end of the whole animal the accompanying woodcut gives at a glance a view of the homologies of the external parts the upper figure from milne edwards is a stomapod crustacean leucifer of vaughan thompson and the abdomen which we know becomes in cirripedes after the metamorphosis rudimentary and therefore does not fairly enter into the comparison is given only in faint lines the lower figure is a mature lepas with the antennæ and eyes which are actually present in the larva retained and supposed to have gone on growing all that we externally see of a cirripede whether pedunculated or sessile is the three anterior segments of the head of a crustacean with its anterior end permanently cemented to a surface of attachment and with its posterior end projecting vertically from it  illustration mmouth   capitulum  i will now proceed to a general description of the different parts and organs in the lepadidæ the capitulum is usually much flattened but sometimes broadly oval in section it is generally formed of five or more valves connected together by very narrow or broad strips of membrane sometimes the valves are rudimental or absent when the whole consists of membrane when the valves are numerous and they occasionally exceed a hundred in number they are arranged in whorls with each valve generally so placed as to cover the interval between the two valves above of all the valves the scuta are the most persistent then come the terga and then the carina the rostrum and latera occur only in scalpellum and pollicipes and in a rudimentary condition in lithotrya and perhaps in the fossil genus loricula the valves are formed sometimes of chitine as in ibla and alepas but usually of shell which varies from transparency to entire opacity the shell is generally white occasionally reddish or purple exteriorly the valves are covered by more or less persistent generally yellow strong membrane the scuta and terga are always considerably larger than the other valves in the different genera the valves differ so much in shape that little can be predicated of them in common even the direction of their lines of growth differsthus in lepas and some allied genera the chief growth of the scuta and of the carina is upwards whereas in pollicipes and lithotrya it is entirely downwards in oxynaspis and some species of scalpellum it is both upwards and downwards even in the same species there is often very considerable variation in the exact shape of the valves more especially of the terga the adductor muscle is always attached to a point not far from the middle of the scuta and it generally has a pit for its attachment in several genera namely pæcilasma dichelaspis conchoderma and alepas the scuta show a tendency to be bilobed or trilobed the valves are placed either at some distance from each other or close together but their growing margins very rarely overlap each other though this is sometimes the case with their upper free tilelike apices in a few species the scuta and terga are articulated together or united by a fold the membrane connecting the valves where they do not touch each other is like that forming the peduncle and is sometimes brilliantly coloured crimsonred generally it appears blueishgray from the corium being seen through small pointed spines connected with the underlying corium by tubuli are not unfrequently articulated on this membrane the tubuli however are often present where there are no spines to allow of the growth of the capitulum the membrane between the valves splits at each period of exuviation when a new strip of membrane is formed beneath connected on each side with a fresh layer of shellthe old and outer slips of membrane disintegrating and disappearing when there are many valves the line of splitting is singularly complicated this membrane consists of chitine13 and is composed of numerous fine laminæ after the valves have been placed in acid a residue very different in bulk in different genera is left also composed of successive laminæ of chitine it appears to me that each single lamina of calcified chitine composing the shell must once have been continuous with a noncalcified lamina in the membrane connecting the several valves at the line where this change in calcification supervenes the chitine generally assumes some colour and becomes much harder and more persistent and as the whole valve is formed of component laminæ thus edged the once continuous laminæ of noncalcified chitine connecting the valves having disintegrated and disappeared the surfaces of the valves are generally left covered by a persistent membrane constituted of these edgings this membrane has been called the epidermis in some genera as in lepas this socalled epidermis is seldom preserved excepting on the last zone of growth in scalpellum and pollicipes it usually covers the whole valves it appears to me that the laminæ of chitine and of calcified chitine composing the valves are both formed not by secretion but by the metamorphosis of an outer layer of corium into these substances     13 chitine is confined to the articulata it was dr c schmidt    contributions c being a physiologicochemical investigation    in taylors scientific memoirs vol v who discovered that    the membrane connecting the valves and forming the peduncle and    the tissues of the internal animal were composed of this    substance but dr schmidt says that the valves in lepas are    composed of 309 of albuminates and 9681 of incombustible    residue i cannot but think that the existence of the albuminates    is an error caused by dr schmidts belief that the cirripedia    were intermediate between crustacea and mollusca in the shells    of which latter the animal basis consists of albuminates for    after placing the valves of lepas and pollicipes in cold acid i    found that the membrane left could not be dissolved in boiling    caustic potash but could though slowly and without change of    colour in boiling muriatic acid and these are the main    diagnostic characters of chitine compared with albuminous    substances i may add that schmidt was also induced to consider    the shells of cirripedia as having the same nature with those of    mollusca from finding that in the above 9681 of incombustible    matter 993 consisted of carbonate and only 07 of phosphate of    lime but dr schmidts own analyses prove how extremely variable    the proportions of these salts are in the crustacea as the    following instance shows                           lobster squilla       phosphate of lime     1206      4752      carbonate of lime     8794      5248     and therefore it is not very surprising that cirripedia should    have still less phosphate of lime in their shells than has a    lobster compared with a squilla  within the capitulum is the sack which together with the upper internal part of the peduncle encloses the animals body the sack is lined by a most delicate membrane of chitine under which there is a double layer of corium this double layer is united together by short strong transverse bundles of fibres branched at both ends14 in some genera the ovarian tubes extend between these two layers we have seen under the head of the metamorphoses that the delicate tunic lining the sack is simply a duplicature of the thick membrane and valves forming the capitulum the whole being the posterior portion of the carapace of the larva slightly modified     14 i am much indebted to mr inman of liverpool for having    kindly sent me excellent specimens illustrating this structure  peduncleits length varies greatly in different species and even in the same species according to the situation occupied by the individual its lower end is sometimes pointed but generally only a little narrower than the upper end in outline the peduncle is usually flattened but sometimes quite cylindrical it is composed of very strong generally thick transparent membrane rarely coloured reddish and often penetrated by numerous tubuli the underlying corium is sometimes coloured in longitudinal bands at each period of growth a new and larger integument is formed under the old one which gradually disintegrates and disappears the extreme lower point is often deserted by the corium and ceases to grow whilst the whole upper part still continues increasing in diameter in length the chief addition is made as is clearly seen in those genera having calcified scales round the upper margin at the base of the capitulum the surface of the membrane is either naked or superficially clothed with minute pointed articulated spines or it is penetrated by calcified scales or styles in ibla alone formed of chitine which pass through it to the corium and are added to at their bases like the valves at each period of growth in lithotrya alone the scales of the peduncle are moulted together with the connecting membrane these scales on the peduncle are generally placed symmetrically in whorls with each scale corresponding with the junctions of two scales both above and below except in scalpellum ornatum and the fossil loricula pulchella they are very small compared with the valves of the capitulum when the scales are symmetrical new ones are first formed only round the summit of the peduncle and only those in the few uppermost whorls continue to grow or to be added to at their bases afterwards membrane is deposited under them the shelly matter of the scales resembles that of the valves and the manner of growth is the same tubuli generally run to and through them from the corium from the continued enlargement of the membrane of the peduncle the scales come to stand in the lower portion some way apart in ibla new horny styles are formed indifferently in all parts of the peduncle in some species of pollicipes the calcareous styles are not symmetrical or symmetrically arranged and besides those first formed round the top of the peduncle there are other and larger ones formed near its base lastly in lithotrya we have a row of calcareous discs or an irregular basal cup formed in the same manner as the valves of the capitulum in this genus alone as already stated the calcified scales are moulted and here alone their edges are serrated  the peduncle is lined within by three layers of muscles longitudinal transverse and oblique all destitute of the transverse striæ characteristic of voluntary muscles they run from the bottom of the peduncle to the base of the capitulum as in lepas or half way up it as in conchoderma in alepas alone they surround the whole capitulum up to its summit in lithotrya there are two little fanlike transverse muscles involuntary extending from the basal points of the terga to a central line on the under side of the carina the gentle swaying to and fro movements and the great power of longitudinal contractionmovements apparently common as i infer from facts communicated to me by mr peach to all the pedunculataare produced by these muscles the interior of the peduncle is filled up with a great mass of branching ovarian tubes but in ibla and lithotrya the upper part of the peduncle is occupied by the animals body  means of attachmentif the peduncle be very carefully removed tab ix fig 7 and tab i fig 6 b from the surface of attachment quite close to the end but not at the actual apex the larval prehensile antennæ can always be found these have been sufficiently described for our present purpose under the head of the metamorphoses but i may add that the diagnostic differences between them in the several genera are briefly given for a special purpose in a discussion on the sexes of scalpellum at the end of that genus we have seen in the larva that the cementducts with their opaque cellular contents can be traced from within the discs of the antennæ to the anterior or lower ends of the two gutformed bodies which it can be demonstrated are the incipient ovaria  in mature cirripedes these ducts can be followed in a slightly sinuous course along the muscles on each side within the peduncle till they expand into two small organs which i have called cementglands these glands are found with great difficulty except in conchoderma aurita where they are placed on each side under the inner layer of corium at the bottom of the sack so as to be just above the top of the peduncle they resemble in shape a retort pl ix fig 3 in pollicipes mitella and polymerus they lie half way down the peduncle close together and apparently enclosed within a common membrane in these two species the broad end of the gland is bent towards the neck of the retort in scalpellum the position is the same but the shape is more globular in ibla the structure is more simple namely a tube slightly enlarged running downwards bent a little upwards and then resuming its former downward course the lower portion forming the duct the gland contains a strongly coherent pulpy opaque cellular mass like that in the cementducts but in some instances presently to be mentioned this cellular mass becomes converted within either the ducts or gland or within both into transparent yellow tough cement generally in conchoderma pollicipes and scalpellum two ovarian tubes but in one specimen of conchoderma aurita three tubes and in ibla one tube could be seen running into or forming the gland of the nature of the tubes there could not be the least doubt for at a little distance from the glands they gave out branches pl ix fig 3 containing ova in every state of development in some specimens as in that figured of conchoderma aurita the ovarian tube on one side of the gland is larger than on the other and has rather the appearance of being deeply embedded in the gland than of forming it but in other specimens the two ovarian tubes first formed a little pouch into which their cellular contents could be clearly seen to enter and then this pouch expanded into the gland thus quite removing a doubt which i had sometimes felt whether the ovarian tube was not simply attached to or embedded in the gland without any further connection by dissection the multiple external coats of the gland and ovarian tubes could be seen to be continuous the cellular contents of the tubes passed into the more opaque cellular contents of the gland by a layer of transparent pulpy pale yellowish substance there appeared in several instances to be a relation between the state of fulness and condition of the contents of the gland and of the immediately adjoining portions of the ovarian tubes in one specimen of pollicipes mitella it was clear that the altered tough yellow transparent noncellular contents of the two glands and ducts had actually invaded for some little distance the two ovarian tubes which ran into them thus showing the continuity of the whole from these facts i conclude without hesitation that the gland itself is a part of an ovarian tube specially modified and further that the cellular matter which in the ovarian tubes serves for the development of the ova is by the special action of the walls of the gland changed into the opaquer cellular matter in the ducts and this again subsequently into that tissue or substance which cements the cirripede to its surface of attachment  as the individuals grow and increase in size so do the glands and cementducts but it seems often to happen that when a specimen is immovably attached the cementing apparatus ceases to act and the cellular contents of the duct become converted into a thread of transparent tough cement the investing membrane also of the ducts in conchoderma sometimes becomes hard and mamillated i have already alluded to the case of a pollicipes in which both glands and ducts and even a small portion of the two adjoining ovarian tubes had become thus filled up as in sessile cirripedes at every fresh period of growth a new cement gland is formed it has occurred to me that possibly in pollicipes something similar may take place in sessile cirripedes the old cementglands are all preserved in a functionless condition adhering to the membranous or calcareous basis each new larger one attached to that last formed and each giving out cementducts which bifurcating in the most complicated manner pass outside the shell and thus attach it to some foreign body  the cement removed from the outside of a cirripede consists of a thin layer of very tough brightbrown transparent laminated substance exhibiting no structure under the highest powers or at most a very fine dotted appearance like a mezzotinto drawing it is of the nature of chitine but boiling caustic potash has rather more effect on it than on true chitine and i think boiling nitric acid rather less effect in one single instance namely in coronula the cement comes out of the four orifices of the two bifurcating ducts in the shape of distinct cells which between the whales skin and the basal membrane arrange themselves so as to make a circular continuous slip of cement then the cells blend together and are converted into transparent structureless cement cementing tissue or membrane would perhaps have been a more correct title than cement but in ordinary cases its appearance is so little like that of an organised tissue that i have for this reason and for brevitysake preferred the simple term of cement  in the larva the cement always escapes through the prehensile antennæ and it thus continues to do throughout life in most or all of the species of lepas conchoderma dichelaspis and ibla in the first two of these genera the cement escapes from the borders of the lower side of the disc or penultimate segment of the antennæ and can be there seen radiating out like spokes which at their ends divide into finer and finer branches till a uniform sheet of cement is formed fastening the antennæ and the adjoining part of the peduncle down to the surface of attachment in dichelaspis warwickii and scalpellum peronii the cement or part at least comes out of the ultimate segment of the antennæ in the shape of one tube within another tube of considerable diameter and length in scalpellum vulgare and probably in some of the other species which live attached to corallines the cement soon ceases to debouch from the antennæ but instead bursts through a row of orifices on the rostral margin of the peduncle pl ix fig 7 by which means this margin is symmetrically fastened down to the delicate horny branches of the zoophyte in pollicipes the two cementducts either together or separately pl ix fig 2 2 a´ wind about the bottom of the peduncle in the most tortuous course at each bend pouring out cement through a hole in the membrane of the peduncle in ibla the lower part of the peduncle is internally filled by cement and thus rendered rigid in lepas fascicularis a vesicular ball of cement surrounding the peduncle is thus formed pl i fig 6 and serves as a float all these curious special adaptations are described under the respective genera how the cement forces its way through the antennæ and often through apertures in the thick membrane of the peduncle i do not understand i do not believe though some appearances favoured the notion that the duct itself debouches and divides at least this is not the case in coronula but only that the internal chord of cellular matter thus acts and spreads itself out nor do i understand how when the antennæ and immediately adjoining parts are once cemented down any more cement can escape yet this must take place as may be inferred from the breadth of the cemented terminal portion of the peduncle in lepas and conchoderma and from the often active condition in old individuals of the cementing organs  i have entered on this subject at some length and i wish i had space for more illustrations from its offering perhaps the most curious point in the natural history of the cirripedia it is the one chief character of the subclass i am well aware how extremely improbable it must appear that part of an ovarian tube should be converted into a gland in which cellular matter is modified so that instead of aiding in the development of new beings it forms itself into a tissue or substance which leaves the body15 in order to fasten it to a foreign support but on no other view can the structure clearly seen by me both in the mature cirripede and in the larva be explained and i feel no hesitation in advancing it i may here venture to quote the substance of a remark made by professor owen when i communicated to him the foregoing facts namely that there was a new problem to solvenew work to performto attach permanently a crustacean to a foreign body and that hence no one could a priori tell by what singular and novel means this would be effected     15 the protrusion of the eggbearing pouches in cyclops and its    kindred genera outside the body offers a feeble analogy with    what takes place in cirripedes professor allman annals of    natural history vol xx p 7 who has attended to the    subject says that the external eggbearing pouches are a    portion of the membrane of the true ovaries if the membrane of    these pouches had been specially made adhesive the analogy would    have been closer  filamentary appendagesthese have generally been considered to act as branchiæ they occur at the bases of the first pair of cirri in lepas alepas conchoderma and in three species of pollicipes in conchoderma there are similar appendages attached to the pedicels of the cirri pl ix fig 4 gk and in the above three species of pollicipes there is a double row of them on the prosoma their numbers differ in different species in some there being none of the same genus and even in different individuals of the same species they are entirely absent in the majority of the genera these facts would indicate that they are not of high functional importance and they seem so generally occupied by testes pl iv fig 5 that i suspect their function is quite as much to give room for the development of these glands as to serve for respiratory purposes with the exception of the four abovenamed genera the mere surface of the body and of the sack must be sufficient for respiration in conchoderma aurita the two great expansions of surface afforded by the folded tubular earlike projections aid as i believe towards this end  the shape of the body varies owing to the greater or less development of the lower part of the prosoma the greater or less distance of the first from the second pair of cirri and of the mouth from the adductor scutorum muscle pl ix fig 4 and pl iv 8 a´ in all the genera the body is much flattened i may here mention a few particulars about the muscular system one of the largest muscular masses is formed by the adductor scutorum and by the muscles which surround in a double layer the fasciæ being oblique to each other the whole of the upper part of the prosoma from under the adductor a pair of delicate muscles runs to the basal edge of the labrum so as to retract the whole mouth and two other pair to the integument between the mouth and the adductor so as to fold it again there are other delicate muscles in some for instance in lepas hillii if not in all the lepadidæ crossing each other in the most singular loops and serving apparently to fold the membrane between the occludent edges of the scuta within the prosoma there is a strong adductor muscle running straight from side to side for the purpose as it appears of flattening the body the thorax on the dorsal and ventral surfaces is well furnished with straight and oblique muscles without striæ which straighten and curl up this part of the body the muscles running into the pedicels of the cirri cross each other on the ventral surface of the thorax the muscles within the rami are attached to the upper segments of the pedicels finally i may remark that the whole of the body and the cirri are capable of many diversified movements  mouththis is prominent and almost probosciformed pl ix fig 4 b and in the abnormal anelasma pl iv fig 2 d quite probosciformedsuch also was its character in the larval condition in outline it is either subtriangular or oval with the longer axis transverse the whole is capable as well as the separate organs of considerable movement as i have seen in living sessile cirripedes it is composed tab v fig 2 of a labrum swollen or bullate often to such an extent as to equal in its longitudinal axis the rest of the mouth of palpi soldered to the labrum of mandibles maxillæ and outer maxillæ the latter serving as a lower lip these organs have only their upper segments free but there are traces clearly seen in the mandibles pl x fig 1 a b of their being formed of three segments the two lower segments are laterally united and open into each other the prominence of the mouth being thus caused this condition appears to me curious and is to a certain limited extent intermediate between those articulated animals which have their trophi soldered into a proboscis and those furnished with entirely free masticatory or prehensile organs the palpi adhere to the corners of the labrum and i call them palpi only from seeing that they spring laterally from above the upper articulation of the mandibles the prominence of the mouth measured from the basal fold by which the whole is separated from the body is much greater on the half formed by the labrum and mandibles than on the other half facing the cirri the trophi surround a cavitythe supraoesophageal cavityin the middle of which between the mandibles is seated the orifice of the oesophagus the oesophagus is surrounded by long fine muscular fasciæ radiating in all directions opposing the constrictor muscles and is capable of violent swallowing movementsconstriction after constriction being seen to run down its whole course there are also some fine muscles attached to the membrane forming the supraoesophageal cavity the trophi serve merely for the prehension of prey and not for mastication  the labrum as stated is always bullate or swollen and sometimes the upper exterior part forms as in ibla pl iv fig 8 a c and dichelaspis an overhanging blunt point the object i suspect of this bullate form is to give in the upper part attachment to longer muscles running to the lateral surfaces of the mandibles and lower down to the oesophagus the crest close over the supraoesophageal cavity is generally furnished with small often beadlike teeth the palpi are small their apices never actually touching each other they are more or less blunt not differing much in shape in the different genera pl x figs 6 to 8 and clothed with spines they are not capable of movement their function seems to be to prevent prey brought by the cirri escaping over the labrum i infer this from finding in anelasma and in the male of ibla which have the cirri functionless that the palpi are rudimentary  the mandibles pl x figs 15 have from two to ten strong teeth in a single row where the number exceeds five several of the teeth are small the inferior angle is generally pectinated with fine spines in lithotrya fig 2 the interspaces between the teeth are also pectinated in the same individual there is not unfrequently one tooth more or less on opposite sides of the mouth internally the mandibles are furnished on their outer and inner sides with several ligamentous apodemes in lithotrya roughened with points pl x fig 2 for the attachment of the muscles of these fig 1 there is a chief depressor and elevator attached at their lower ends to near the basal fold of the mouth and a lateral muscle attached to the broad basal end of the palpi and serving apparently to oppose the edge of mandible to mandible the maxillæ in the different genera pl x figs 9 to 15 differ considerably in outline they are generally about half the size of the mandibles at the upper corner there are always two or three spines larger than the others and often separated from them by a notch the rest of the spinose edge is straight or irregular or stepformed or with the lowest part projecting or with one or two narrow prominences bearing fine spines all these spines quite differently from the teeth of the mandibles are articulated on the edge of the organ and stand in a double row at a point corresponding with the upper articulation of the mandibles a long thin narrow rigid apodeme projects inwards fig 10 and running down nearly parallel to the thin outer flexible membrane of the mouth is attached to the corium and thus serves as a support to the whole organ this apodeme is embedded in muscles pl x fig 10 there are other large muscles attached to the inner side of the organ and again others running laterally towards the mandibles the apodeme of course is moulted with the integuments of the mouth the outer maxillæ pl x figs 16 17 serve as a lower lip they are thicker than the other trophi they have their inner surfaces clothed with spines sometimes divided into an upper and lower group and occasionally separated by a deep notch there are often long bristles outside they are furnished with at least two muscles in sessile cirripedes i have seen that they are capable of a rapid to and fro movement and i have no doubt that their function is to brush any small creature caught by the cirri towards the maxillæ which are well adapted to aid in securing the prey and to hand it over to the mandibles by them to be forced down the oesophagus on the exterior face of the outer maxillæ above a trace of an upper articulation either two small orifices or two large tubular projections can always be discovered and these as will presently be mentioned i believe to be olfactory organs  cirrithe five posterior pair are seated close to each other and equidistant the first pair is generally seated at a little distance and sometimes at a considerable distance from the second pair the first pair is the shortest the others proceeding backwards increase gradually in length the rami of each pair are either equal in length or slightly unequal those of the first pair are oftenest unequal the number of segments in the posterior cirri is sometimes very great in one species of alepas there were above sixty segments in one ramus the other ramus being in this unique case pl x fig 28 small and rudimentary the pedicels consist of two segments a lower longer and upper short one fig 18 c d in the usual arrangement of the spines on the segments of the three posterior pair of cirri there are figs 26 27 from three to six pair of long spines on the anterior face with generally some minute spines occasionally forming a tuft intermediate between them on the dorsal surface in the uppermost part of each segment there is a tuft of short spines generally mingled with some longer finer ones on the inner side of each segment on the upper rim there are generally a few extremely minute and short spines from the increase of these latter and of the intermediate spines the anterolateral faces of the segments of the first cirrus and of the lower segments of the anterior ramus of the second cirrus pl x fig 25 are almost always thickly paved with brushlike masses of spines the lower segments of the anterior ramus of the third cirrus is generally though not always thus paved these paved segments are much broader than the others the posterior rami of the second and third cirri are often in some slight degree paved though in other cases they resemble the three posterior pair of cirri the two segments of the pedicels have bristles on their anterior faces essentially arranged on the same plan as on the segments of the rami the bristles are generally not so symmetrically arranged on the pedicels of the second and third cirri as on the three posterior pair there are some exceptions to the foregoing general rules in the posterior cirri of alepas cornuta there is only one pair of long spines to each segment fig 28 in dichelaspis lowei there are eight pair in lepas fascicularis in old specimens the segments are paved with a triangular brush of spines the upper segments in pæcilasma eburnea support small oblong brushes and lastly in pæcilasma fissa fig 29 and crassa the spines form a single circle round each segment interrupted on the two sides these spines are often doubly serrated or plumose many of them on the protuberant segments of the first three pair of cirri are sometimes coarsely and doubly pectinated  caudal appendagesthese are present pl x figs 18 to 24 seated on each side of the anus in all the genera except in conchoderma anelasma and scalpellum villosum they consist of a very small single segment destitute of spines in lepas and spinose in pæcilasma dichelaspis oxynaspis scalpellum and some species of pollicipes they consist of several segments in alepas ibla lithotrya and in some species of pollicipes in the latter genus some species have their caudal appendages multiarticulate though so obscurely articulated that the passage fig 22 from several to one segment is seen to be easily effected when the appendage consists of many articulations it is generally about as long as the pedicel of the sixth cirrus but in ibla quadrivalvis it is four times as long the segments are narrow slightly flattened much tapering each fig 24 is surmounted by a ring of short spines which are generally longest on the apex of the terminal segment i could never trace muscles into these appendages  alimentary canalthe oesophagus is of considerable length it is formed of strong transparent much folded membrane continuous with the outer integuments and moulted with them it is surrounded by corium and as already stated by numerous muscles at its lower end it expands into a bell with the edges reflexed and sometimes sinuous this bell lies within the stomach and keeps the upper broad end expanded according to the less or greater distance of the mouth from the adductor muscle the oesophagus runs in a more or less parallel course to the abdominal surface between the first and succeeding pairs of cirri and enters the stomach more or less obliquely in ibla alone it passes exteriorly to and over the adductor scutorum muscle the stomach lies in a much curved almost doubled course it is often a little constricted where most bent it is broadest at the upper end and here in lepas and conchoderma there are some deep branching cæca in the latter of these two genera the whole surface is in addition pitted in transverse lines the stomach is coated by small opaque pulpy slightly arborescent glands believed to be hepatic these are arranged in longitudinal lines in all the genera except in alepas in which they are transverse and reticulated the whole stomach is thus coated there is also a coating of excessively delicate longitudinal and transverse muscles without striæ the rectum varies in length extending inwards from the anus to between the bases of the second and fifth pair of cirri it is narrow and formed of much folded transparent membrane resembling the oesophagus continuous with the outer integuments with which it is periodically moulted the anus is a small longitudinal slit in the triangular piece of membrane representing the abdomen let in between the last thoracic tergal arches as already mentioned under the head of the metamorphoses it lies almost between the caudal appendages and opens on the dorsal surface within the stomach there can generally be plainly seen in accordance with the period of digestion when the specimen was taken a thin yet strong perfectly transparent epithelial membrane not exhibiting under the highest power of the microscope any structure it enters the branching cæca and extends from the edge of the bell of the oesophagus to the commencement of the closed rectum and consequently terminates in a point it consists of chitine like the outer integuments of the animal and by placing the whole body in caustic potash i have dissolved the outer coats of the stomach and seen the bag open at its upper end perfectly preserved floating in the middle of the body and full of the debris of the food in most of the specimens which i have examined preserved in spirits of wine this epithelial lining was some little way distant and separate from the coats of the stomach and hence was thought by m martin st ange to be a distinct organ like the closed tube in certain annelids occasionally i have seen one imperfect epithelial bag or tube within another and laterformed one digestion seems to go on at the same rate throughout the whole length of the stomach if there be any difference the least digested portions lie in the lower and narrower part the prey consisting generally of crustacea infusoria minute spiral univalves and often of the larvæ of cirripedes is not triturated when the nutritious juices have been absorbed the rejectamenta are cast out through the anus all kept together in the epithelial bag which is excluded like a model of the whole stomach with the exception of that part coated by the bell of the oesophagus i have sometimes thought that the bag was formed so strong for the sake of thus carrying out the excrement entire so as not to befoul the sack i believe lepas can throw up food by its oesophagus at least i found in one case many halfdigested small crustaceans in the sack and others of the same kind in the stomach  circulatory systemi can add hardly anything to what little has been given by m martin st ange like others i have failed as yet in discovering a heart the whole body is permeated by channels which have not any proper coat there is one main channel along the ventral surface of the thorax dividing and surrounding the mouth and giving out branches which enter the inner of the two channels in each cirrus as burmeister has shown there are also two channels in the penis there are two dorsolateral channels in the prosoma which are in direct connection with the great main channel running down the rostral i e ventral side of the peduncle this latter main channel branches out in the lower part and transmits the fluid through the ovarian tubes whence i believe it flows upwards and round the sack reentering the body near the sides of the adductor scutorum muscle the main rostral channel or artery in the uppermost part of the peduncle has a depending curtain which i think must act as a valve so as to prevent the circulating fluid regurgitating into the animals body during the contractions of the peduncle  nervous system and organs of sensein most of the genera there are six main ganglia namely the supraoesophageal and five thoracic ganglia but in pollicipes mitella there are only four thoracic ganglia of these the first thoracic or infraoesophageal ganglion is considerably the largest and most massive it is squarish or oval or heartshaped it presents no trace of being formed by the union of two lateral ganglia two great nerves spring from its under side a represented in the woodcut on page 49 by dotted lines and run straight down amongst the viscera in the prosoma these nerves are about as large as those forming the collar and those running to the second ganglion hence six great nerves meet here two in front two behind and two on the under side at the anterior end over the junction with the collar chord three equalsized nerves rise on each side with a fourth smaller one outside these go to the trophi and to the two olfactory sacks at the posterior end on each side a pair of nerves branch out rectangularly one of which a goes to the first cirrus and there divides into two branches of these the upper runs up the cirrus and the lower one downwards the other nerve b proceeding on each side from this first thoracic ganglion runs to the muscles beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus the collar surrounding the oesophagus is generally very long sometimes equalling the whole thoracic chord at a middle point a small branch is sent off and at the anterior end e e close to the supraoesophageal ganglia double or treble fine branches run to the true ovaria lying close to the upper end of the stomach the four or only three other thoracic ganglia when viewed as transparent bodies are seen to be solid but in some of the genera as in conchoderma the outline plainly shows that each consists of a lateral pair fused together the second thoracic ganglion b is rather small it is either close to the first as in pollicipes mitella and lepas fascicularis or far distant as in ibla the third c and fourth are of about the same size with the second these three ganglia send large branches to the second third and fourth pair of cirri other minute branches spring from their under sides and from the intermediate double chords the fifth ganglion is larger and longer than the three preceding ones and gives off nerves to the fifth and sixth pair of cirri it is clearly formed by the union of the fifth with what ought to have formed a sixth ganglion the two nerves going to the sixth cirrus give off on their inner sides each a great branch to the penis in pollicipes mitella in which there are only four instead of five thoracic ganglia it is evident from the outline and position of the nerves going to the fourth pair of cirri that the fourth ganglion is fused into the fifth itself as we have just seen normally composed of two consecutive ganglia in this pollicipes there is other evidence of concentration in the nervous system for none of the ganglia show signs of being formed of lateral pairs the second is close to the first and the abdominal double chord is in part separated by a mere cleft lastly as we shall immediately see the same remark is applicable to the supraoesophageal ganglia  the latter d alone remain to be described they present far more diversity in shape than do the thoracic ganglia they are almost always seen in outline to be laterally distinct and usually resemble two pears with their tapering ends cut off and united in a transverse line they are as long as the infraoesophageal ganglion but are much less massive in lepas fascicularis d they are pearshaped in pollicipes mitella they are globular and separated by a third globular ganglion which i believe is the ophthalmic ganglion presently to be described in pollicipes spinosus however the ophthalmic ganglion is as usual placed in advance of the supraoesophageal ganglion which latter in this one species shows no sign of being formed of a lateral pair fused together in alepas cornuta the supraoesophageal ganglion consists of two quite distinct ganglia elongated in the longitudinal axis of the body and separated from each other by the whole width of the mouth the chord which unites them is of the same thickness as the rest of the collar in all the genera from the front of each of the two supraoesophageal ganglia a pair of nerves f f united and together as large as the collar nerve rises and can be traced running unbranched in a nearly straight line for a length equalling the whole rest of the nervous chord so as to supply the peduncle and the inside of the capitulum or sack at the inner ends of these two same ganglia from a central point where they are united a little central branch runs in front to the adductor scutorum and other adjoining muscles

aurita the ophthalmic ganglia are much smaller and nearer to the supraoesophageal ganglion than in l fascicularis in alepas cornuta the ophthalmic chords run towards each other from the two distant and separate supraoesophageal ganglia and the ophthalmic ganglia instead of being quite separate as in l fascicularis are united by their front ends and the two eyes instead of standing some way in front with nerves running to them are embedded on the double ophthalmic ganglion the pigmentcapsules here also have the shape of mere saucers and are joined back to back with the two lenses projecting far out of them in neither sex of ibla could i perceive that the eye was double in pollicipes spinosus the ophthalmic ganglion stands in front of the single supraoesophageal ganglion and shows no signs of being formed of a lateral pair the eyes themselves however differently from in all the foregoing cases are though approximate quite distinct in pollicipes mitella i did not see the eyes but the ophthalmic ganglion consists as i believe of a single globular one placed exactly between the two globular supraoesophageal ganglia all three being of nearly equal size professor leidy does not mention the ophthalmic ganglia hence i infer that in balanus which is a more highly organised cirripede they are fused into the supraoesophageal ganglion  in all the genera the double eye is seated deep within the body it is attached by fibrous tissue to the radiating muscles of the lowest part of the oesophagus and lies actually on the upper part of the stomach consequently a ray of light to reach the eye has to pass through the exterior membrane and underlying corium connecting the two scuta and to penetrate deeply into the body in living sessile cirripedes vision seems confined to the perception of the shadow of an object passing between them and the light they instantly perceived a hand passed quickly at the distance of several feet between a candle and the basin in which they were placed  as the infraoesophageal ganglion sends nerves to the trophi and to the first pair of cirri it must correspond to the segments from the fourth to the ninth inclusive of the archetype crustacean the state of the supraoesophageal and ophthalmic ganglia appears to me very interesting i do not believe that in any mature ordinary crustacean the first or ophthalmic ganglion can be shown to be distinct from the two succeeding ganglia or to be itself composed of a pair laterally distinct the ganglia corresponding with the second and third segments of the body which should normally support two pair of antennæ are in the lepadidæ united together but laterally they are generally distinct in outline and are actually separate in alepas the supraoesophageal ganglion shows also its double nature by giving rise to a pair of large double nerves evidently corresponding with the two pair of antennular nerves in ordinary crustaceans the embryonic condition of the whole supraoesophageal portion of the nervous system in the lepadidæ corresponds with the rudimentary state of the only organ of sense supplied by it namely the eye which in size and general appearance has retrograded to the state in which it was in during the first stage of development of the larvai have used the term embryonic because in the embryos of ordinary crustacea all the ganglia are at first longitudinally distinct and laterally quite separate the conclusion at which we before arrived from studying the metamorphoses namely that the whole peduncle and capitulum consisted of the first three segments of the head is beautifully supported by the structure of the nervous system in which these parts are seen to be supplied with nerves exclusively from the supraoesophageal ganglion now in ordinary crustacea the supraoesophageal ganglion sends nerves to the eyes and the two pair of antennæ corresponding as is known by embryological dissections to the first three segments of the body moreover it is asserted that the carapace which covers the thorax in crustacea is not formed by the development of the first segment and this likewise may be inferred to be the case with the peduncle and capitulum in the lepadidæ as the nerves of the ophthalmic ganglia go exclusively to the eyes finally i may remark that in pollicipes looking to the whole nervous system the state of concentration nearly equals that in certain macrourous decapod crustaceans for instance the astacus marinus of which a figure is given by milne edwards  olfactory organsin the outer maxillæ at their bases where united together but above the basal fold separating the mouth from the body there are in all the genera a pair of orifices pl x fig 16 these are sometimes seated on a slight prominence as in lithotrya or on the summit of flattened tubes pl x fig 17 projecting upwards and towards each other as in ibla scalpellum and pollicipes in ibla these tubular projections rise from almost between the outer and inner maxillæ it is impossible to behold these organs and doubt that they are of high functional importance to the animal the orifice leads into a deep sack lined by pulpy corium and closed at the bottom the outer integument is inflected inwards hence periodically moulted and becoming of excessive tenuity runs to near the bottom of the sack where it ends in an open tube so excessively thin is this inflected membrane that until examining anelasma i was not quite certain that i was right in believing that the outer integument did not extend over the whole bottom i several times saw a nerve of considerable size entering and blending into a pulpy layer at the bottom of the sack of corium but i failed in tracing to which of the three pair of nerves springing from the front end of the infraoesophageal ganglion it joined i can hardly avoid concluding that this closed sack with its naked bottom is an organ of sense and considering that the outer maxillæ serve to carry the prey entangled by the cirri towards the maxillæ and mandibles the position seems so admirably adapted for an olfactory organ whereby the animal could at once perceive the nature of any floating object thus caught that i have ventured provisionally to designate the two orifices and sacks as olfactory  acoustic  organsa little way beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus pl ix fig 4 d and pl iv fig 2 e on each side there may be seen a slight swelling and on the under side of this a transverse slitlike orifice 120th of an inch in length in conchoderma but often only half that size in ibla this orifice is seated lower down pl iv fig 8 a´ e between the bases of the first and second cirri which are here far apart in alepas cornuta it is placed rather nearer to the adductor scutorum muscle namely beneath the mandibles the orifice leads into a rather deep and wide meatus the external integument is turned in for a short distance widening a little and then ends abruptly the meatus enlarging upwards is lined by thick pulpy corium and is closed at the upper end from its summit is suspended a flattened sack of singular and different shapes in the different genera this the socalled acoustic sack of conchoderma virgata is figured pl ix fig 6 the deep and wide notch faces towards the posterior end of the animal the inferior lobe thus almost cut off is flattened in a different plane from the upper part the lobe is lodged in a little pouch of corresponding form leading from the open meatus in which the upper part is included in conchoderma aurita the top of the acoustic sack is narrower and more constricted the whole more rounded and the lobe more turned down in lepas fascicularis the notch is not so deep or wide and the lobe larger in ibla cumingii the sack is of the shape of a vase with one corner folded over in scalpellum vulgare it is small oval with the lower end much pushed in and furnished with a little crest lastly in pollicipes mitella it is simply oval in all cases the sack is empty or contains only a little pulpy matter it consists of brownish thick and remarkably elastic tissue formed apparently of transverse little pillars becoming fibrous on the outside and with their inner ends appearing like hyaline points the mouth of the acoustic sack removed in the drawing is closed by a tender diaphragm through which i saw what i believe was a moderatelysized nerve enter i have not yet succeeded in tracing this nerve the first pair of cirri seem to a certain extent to serve as antennæ and therefore the position of an acoustic organ at their bases is analogous to what takes place in crustacea but there are not here any otolites or the siliceous particles and hairs as described by dr farre in that class nevertheless the sack is so highly elastic and its suspension in a meatus freely open to the water seems so well adapted for an acoustic organ that i have provisionally thus called it in the larva as i have shown a pouch certainly serving for some sense i believe for hearing is seated in quite a different position at the anterior end of the carapace i may mention that i found sessile cirripedes very sensitive of vibrations in objects adjoining them though not apparently of noises in the air or water in a group of specimens i could not touch one even most delicately with a needle without all the adjoining ones instantly withdrawing their cirri it made no difference if the one touched had its operculum already closed and motionless  reproductive systemmale organsall the cirripedia which i have hitherto examined with the exception of certain species of ibla and scalpellum are hermaphrodite or bisexual17 i shall so fully describe the sexual relations of the several species of these two genera under their respective headings and at the end of the genus of scalpellum that i will not here give even an abstract of the grounds on which my firm belief is based that the masculine power of certain hermaphrodite species of ibla and scalpellum is rendered more efficient by certain parasitic males which from their not pairing as in all hitherto known cases with females but with hermaphrodites i have designated complemental males     17 i am compelled to differ greatly from the account given by    prof steenstrup of the reproductive system in the cirripedia in    his untersuchungen über das vorkommen des hermaphroditismus ch    v 1846a translation of which i have seen owing to the great    kindness of mr busk mr goodsir has described edin new phil    journal july 1843 what he considers the male of balanus but    i have seen this same parasitic creature charged with ova    including larvæ from the resemblance of the larvæ to the little    crustacean described by mr goodsir in the same paper as a    distinct parasite i believe the latter to be the male of his    socalled male balanus and that all belong to the same species    allied to bopyrus this genus as is well known is parasitic on    other crustacea and it is a rather interesting fact thus to    find that this new parasite which is allied to bopyrus in    structure is likewise allied to it in habits living attached to    cirripedia a subclass of the crustacea  the male organs have been well described by m martin st ange whose observations have since been confirmed by r wagner18 the testes are small often leadencoloured either pear or fingershaped or branched like clubmossthese several forms sometimes occurring in the same individual they coat the stomach enter the pedicels and even the basal segments of the rami of the cirri and in some genera occupy certain swellings on the thorax and prosoma and in others the filamentary appendages the testes seen in the apex in one of these appendages in conchoderma is represented in pl ix fig 5 the two vesiculæ seminales are very large they lie along the abdominal surface of the thorax and generally but not in some species of scalpellum enter the prosoma where their broad ends are often reflexed here the branched vessels leading from the testes enter the membrane of the vesiculæ seminales is formed of circular fibres and is i presume contractile for i have seen the spermatozoa expelled with force from the cut end of a living specimen the two canals leading from the vesiculæ generally unite in a single duct at the base of the penis but in conchoderma aurita halfway up it the probosciformed penis except in certain species of scalpellum is very long it is capable of the most varied movements it is generally hairy especially at the end it is supported on a straight unarticulated basis which in ibla quadrivalvis alone pl iv fig 9 a is of considerable length in this species the upper part is seen to be as plainly articulated as one of the cirri in alepas the articulations are somewhat less plain and in the other genera the organ can be said only to be finely ringed but these rings no doubt are in fact obscure articulations in the females of ibla cumingii and scalpellum ornatum there is of course no penis     18 in müllers archiv 1834 p 467 i have already several    times referred to m martin st anges excellent memoir read    before the academy of sciences and subsequently in 1835    published separately  female organsm martin st ange has described how the peduncle19 is gorged with an inextricable mass of branching ovarian tubes filled with granular matter and immature ova in conchoderma and alepas the ovarian tubes run up in a single plane pl ix fig 3 between the two folds of corium round the sack here the development of the ova can be well followed a minute point first branches out from one of the tubes its head then enlarges like the bud of a tulip on a footstalk becomes globular shows traces of dividing and at last splits into three four or five eggshaped balls which finally separate as perfect ova within the peduncle the ovarian tubes branch out in all directions and within the footstalks of the branches differently from what takes place round the sack ova are developed as well as at their ends close together along the rostral i e ventral edge of the peduncle two nearly straight main ovarian tubes or ducts may be detected which do not give out any branches till about half way down the peduncle where they subdivide into branches which inosculate together and give rise to the mass filling the peduncle and sometimes as we have just seen sending up branches round the sack these two main unbranched ovarian ducts followed up the peduncle are seen to enter the body of the cirripede close along side the great double peduncular nerves and then separating they sweep in a large curve along each flank of the prosoma under the superficial muscles towards the bases of the first pair of cirri and then rising up they run into two glandular masses these latter rest on the upper edge of the stomach and touch the cæca where such exist they were thought by cuvier to be salivary glands they are of an orange colour and form two parallel gutformed masses having in conchoderma a great flexure and generally dividing at the end near the mouth into a few blunt branches i was not able to ascertain whether the two main ducts coming from the peduncle expanded to envelope them or what the precise connection was the state of these two masses varied much sometimes they were hollow with only their walls spotted with a few cellular little masses at other times they contained or rather were formed of more or less globular or fingershaped aggregations of pulpy matter and lastly the whole consisted of separate pointed little balls each with a large inner cell and this again with two or three included granules these so closely resembled in general appearance and size the ovigerms with their germinal vesicles and spots which i have often seen at the first commencement of the formation of the ova in the ovarian tubes in the peduncle that i cannot doubt that such is their nature hence i conclude that these two gutformed masses are the true ovaria i may add that several times i have seen in the two long unbranched ducts connecting the true ovaria and the ovarian tubes in the peduncle pellets of orangecoloured cellular matter i e ovigerms forming at short intervals little enlargements in the ducts and apparently travelling into the peduncle     19 i may here mention that in all sessile cirripedes the    ovarian branching tubes lie between the calcareous or membranous    basis and the inner basal lining of the sack and to a certain    height upwards round the sack the true ovaria and the two ducts    occupy the same position as in the lepadidæ  the structure here described is quite conformable with that which we have seen in the larva in the latter two gutformed masses of equal thickness extended from the cæca of the stomach to within the future peduncle where the cementducts entered them and where after a short period they were seen to expand into a mass of ovarian tubes in the mature cirripede the cementducts can still be found united to the ovarian tubes in the middle of peduncle and the cause of the wide separation of the true ovaria and ovarian tubes can be simply accounted for by the internal almost complete intersection of the animal which takes place during the last metamorphosis  the ova when excluded remain in the sack of the animal until the larvæ are hatched they are very numerous and generally form two concave nearly circular leaves which i have called after steenstrup and other authors the ovigerous lamellæ pl iv fig 2 b these lamellæ lie low down on each side of the sack in conchoderma virgata however there is often only a single lamella forming a deeply concave cup in c aurita there are generally on each side four lamellæ one under the other the ova lie in a layer from two to four deep and all are held together by a most delicate transparent membrane which separately enfolds each ovum this membrane is often thicker and stronger round the margins of the lamellæ where they are united in a peculiar manner presently to be described to a fold of skin on each side of the sack these two folds i have called the ovigerous fræna pl iv fig 2 f  m martin st ange describes an orifice under the carina by which he supposes the ova to enter the sack this after repeated and most careful examinations i venture to affirm does not exist on the contrary i have every reason to believe that the ova enter the sack in the following curious manner immediately before one of the periods of exuviation the ova burst forth from the the ovarian tubes in the peduncle and round the sack and carried along the open circulatory channels are collected by means unknown to me beneath the chitinetunic of the sack in the corium which is at this period remarkably spongy and full of cavities the corium then forms or rather as i believe resolves itself into the very delicate membrane separately enveloping each ovum and uniting them together into two lamellæ the corium having thus far retreated then forms under the lamellæ the chitinetunic of the sack which will of course be of larger size than the lastformed one now immediately to be moulted with the other integuments of the body as soon as this exuviation is effected the tender ova united into two lamellæ and adhering as yet to the bottom of the sack are exposed as the membranes harden the lamellæ become detached from the bottom of the sack and are attached to the ovigerous fræna to demonstrate this view an individual should have been found with both the old and new chitine tunic of the sack and with the lamellæ lying between them this i believe i have seen but it was before i understood the full importance of the fact a great number of specimens would have to be examined in order to succeed again for the changes connected with exuviation supervene very quickly i have however several times found the ova so loose under the sack as to be detached with a touch from the ovarian tubes and i have twice carefully examined specimens which had just moulted as shown by even the mandibles being flexible in which the lamellæ had not become united to the fræna but still adhered to the newlyformed chitine tunic of the sack in these the ova were so tender that they broke into pieces rather than be separated from the membrane of the lamella itself hardly perfectly developed for pulpy cellular matter adhered outside some of the ova these and other facts are quite inexplicable on any other view than that advanced  as the lamellæ are formed without organic union with the parent they would be liable to be washed out of the widely open sack of the lepadidæ if they had not been specially attached to the fræna these fræna consist of a pair of more or less semicircular folds of skin depending inside the sack on each side of the point of attachment of the body the fræna are often of considerable size but in ibla they are very minute they are formed of chitine tunic with underlying corium like the rest of the sack on their crests there is a row or a set of circular groups or a broad surface covered either with minute pointed beadlike bodies mounted on long hairlike footstalks or with staffformed bodies on very short footstalks i measured some of the beadlike bodies in lepas anserifera and they were 12000th of an inch in diameter and the footstalks three or four times as long as the elongated heads these heads of whatever shape they may be have an opaque and i believe glandular centre i could not make out with certainty an aperture at their ends but i believe such exists and they seem to secrete a substance which hardens into a strong membrane serving to unite the crest of the frænum to the edges of the lamellæ in one case this bit of membrane seemed formed of a woven mass of threads these little glandular bodies with the membrane formed by them are cast off at each exuviation and new glands formed on the crest of the frænum underneath in some species of pollicipes viz p cornucopia and elegans the fræna though present and large are functionless and destitute of the glands i believe they exist in this same functionless condition and in rather a different position in the sessile cirripedes and that in this family they serve as branchiæ  the abovedescribed method by which cirripedia lay their eggs namely united together in a common membrane placed between their old outer and new inner integuments and the manner in which the lamellæ when thus formed are retained for a time fastened to the fræna and are then cast off appears to me very curious in some of the lower crustacea it is known that the ova escape by rupturing the ovisacs formed by the protruded ovarian tubes and this is the nearest analogy with which i am acquainted the ova are impregnated as i infer from the state of the vesiculæ seminales when first brought into the sack and whilst the membrane of the lamellæ is very tender the long probosciformed penis seems well adapted for this end in the male of ibla cumingii which has not a probosciformed penis the whole flexible body probably performs the function of the penis in scalpellum ornatum however the spermatozoa must be brought in by the action of the cirri or of the currents produced by them that cross impregnation may and sometimes does take place i infer from the singular case of an individual in a group of balani in which the penis had been cut off and had healed without any perforation notwithstanding which fact larvæ were included in the ova  exuviation rate of growth sizei have had occasion repeatedly to allude to the exuviation of the lepadidæ with the exception of the genus lithotrya20 in which the calcareous scales on the peduncle together with the membrane connecting them is cast off neither the valves nor the membrane uniting them nor that forming the peduncle with its scales and styles are moulted but the surface gradually disintegrates and is removed perhaps sometimes in flakes whilst new and larger layers are formed beneath in scalpellum i ascertained that the new membrane connecting together the newlyformed calcified rims under the valves of the capitulum was formed as a fold with the articulated spines which it bears all adpressed in certain definite directions this fold of new membrane when the old membrane splits and yields of course expands and thus the size of the capitulum is increased in the peduncle lines of splitting can seldom be perceived except indeed in the subglobular embedded downwardgrowing peduncle of anelasma as described under that genus i do not understand what determines the complicated lines of splitting of the old membrane between the several valves of the capitulumwithout it be simply that along these lines alone the old membrane is not strengthened by the new membrane being closely applied under it the new being formed as we have just said in a fold in order to allow of increase in size although as i believe there is strictly no exuviation in the outer membranes of mature lepadidæ it seems that narrow strips of membrane are cast off from between the valves for the few first moults after the final metamorphosis of the larva i may here remark that in most sessile cirripedes the outside membrane connecting the operculum and shell is regularly moulted     20 the external integuments being moulted in crustacea but not    in the cirripedia may appear at first an important difference    but we here see that nonexuviation is not universal amongst the    lepadidæ and on the other hand according to m joly annales    des sciences naturelles 2d series zoolog there is one true    crustacean the isaura cycladoides which has a persistent    bivalve shell  the delicate tunic lining the sack a mere duplicature of that thick one forming the outside of the capitulum and generally transformed into valves and the integuments of the whole body are regularly moulted with these integuments the membrane lining the oesophagus the rectum and the deep olfactory pouches and the horny apodemes of the maxillæ are all cast together i have seen a specimen of lepas in which from some morbid adhesion the old membrane lining one of the olfactory pouches had not been moulted but remained projecting from the orifice as a brown shrivelled scroll the new spines on the cirri and on the maxillæ are formed within the old ones but as they have to be a little longer than the latter and as they cannot enter these up to their very points their basal portions are not thus included but are formed running obliquely across the segments of the cirri and what is curious these same basal portions are turned inside out like the fingers of a glove when hastily drawn off after the exuviation of the old spines the new spines have their inverted basal portions drawn out from within the segments and turned outside in so as to assume their proper positions  all cirripedia grow rapidly the yawl of h m s beagle was lowered into the water at the galapagos archipelago on the 15th of september and after an interval of exactly thirtythree days was hauled in i found on her bottom a specimen of conchoderma virgata with the capitulum and peduncle each half an inch in length and the former 720ths in width this is half the size of the largest specimen i have seen of this species several other individuals not half the size of the above contained numerous ova in their lamellæ ready to burst forth supposing the larva of the largest specimen became attached the first day the boat was put into the water we have the metamorphosis an increase of length from about 05 the size of the larva to an whole inch and the laying of probably several sets of eggs all effected in thirtythree days from this rapid growth repeated exuviations must be requisite mr w thompson of belfast kept twenty specimens of balanus balanoides a form of much slower growth alive and on the twelfth day he found the twentyfirst integument showing that all had moulted once and one individual twice within this period i may here add that the pedunculated cirripedes never attain so large a bulk as the sessile lepas anatifera is sometimes sixteen inches in length but of this the far greater portion consists of the peduncle pollicipes mitella is the most massive kind i have seen a specimen with a capitulum 23 of an inch in width  affinitiesconsidering the close affinity between the several genera there are i conceive no grounds for dividing the lepadidæ into subfamilies as has been proposed by some authors who have trusted exclusively to external characters in establishing the eleven genera in the lepadidæ no one part or set of organs affords sufficient diagnostic characters the number of the valves is the most obvious and one of the most useful characters but it fails when the valves are nearly rudimentary and when they are numerous the direction of their lines of growth is more important and fails to be characteristic only in scalpellum with the same exception the presence or abscence of calcified or horny scales on the peduncle is a good generic character for this same end the shape of the scuta and carina but not of the other valves comes into play in three genera the presence of filamentary appendages on the animals body is generic in pollicipes however they are found only on three out of the six species the number of teeth in the mandibles and the shape of the maxillæ often prove serviceable for this end as does more generally the presence of caudal appendages and whether they be naked or spinose uniarticulate or multiarticulate in pollicipes alone this part is variable being uniand multiarticulate and in one species of scalpellum they are absent though present in all the others the shape of the body the absence or presence of teeth on the labrum the inner edge of the outer maxillæ being notched or straight the prominence of the olfactory orifices the arrangement of the spines on the cirri and the number and form of their segments are only of specific value  comparing the pedunculated and sessile cirripedes it is i think impossible to assign them a higher rank than that of families the chief difference between them consists in the lepadidæ in the presence of three layers of striæless muscles longitudinal transverse and oblique continuously surrounding the peduncle but not specially attached to the scuta and terga and on the other hand in the balanidæ of five longitudinal bundles of voluntary muscles with transverse striæ fixed to the scuta and terga and giving them powers of independent movement in the lepadidæ the lower valves or when such are absent the membranous walls of the capitulum move with the scuta and terga when opened or shut and the lower part of the capitulum is separated by a moveable peduncle from the surface of attachment in the sessile cirripedes the lower valves are firmly united together into an immovable ring fixed immovably on the surface of attachment i will not compare the softer parts such as the cirri and trophi of the lepadidæ with those of the balanidæ as my examination of this latter family is not fully completed i will only remark that there is a very close general resemblance more especially with the subfamily chthamalinæ  geographical range habitatsthe pedunculated cirripedes extend over the whole world and most of the individual species have large ranges more especially as might have been expected those attached to floating objects excepting these latter the greater number inhabit the warmer temperate and tropical seas of those attached to fixed objects or to littoral animals it is rare to find more than three or four species in the same locality on the shores of europe i know of only three viz a scalpellum pollicipes and alepas at madeira owing to the admirable researches of the rev r t lowe two pæcilasmas a dichelaspis and an oxynaspis are known in new zealand there are two pollicipes and an alepas and perhaps a fourth form from the philippine archipelago in the great collection made by mr cuming there are a pæcilasma an ibla a scalpellum pollicipes and lithotrya of all the lepadidæ nearly half are attached to floating objects or to animals which are able to change their positions the other half are generally attached to fixed organic or inorganic bodies and more frequently to the former than to the latter most of the species of scalpellum are inhabitants of deep water on the other hand most of pollicipes21 of ibla and lithotrya are littoral forms the species of lithotrya have the power of excavating burrows in calcareous rocks shells and corals and the singular manner in which this is effected is described under that genus anelasma has its subglobular peduncle deeply embedded in the flesh of northern sharks and i have seen instances of the basal end of the peduncle of conchoderma aurita being sunk into the skin of cetacea in the same way the point of the peduncle in the male of ibla is generally deeply embedded in the sack of the female i believe in all these cases the cementing substance affects and injures the corium or true skin of the animal on which the creature is parasitic whilst the surrounding parts being not injured continue to grow upwards thus causing the partial embedment of the cirripede in the case of anelasma we have growth at the end of the peduncle and consequently downward pressure and this may possibly cause absorption to take place in the skin of the shark at the spot pressed on     21 i am informed by mr l reeve that pollicipes mitella is    eaten on the coast of china and ellis states phil trans    1758 that this is the case with p cornucopia on the shores of    brittany it is well known that the gigantic balanus psittacus    on the chilian coast is sought after as a delicacy and i am    assured by mr cuming that it deserves its reputation  geological historyhaving treated this subject at length in the volume of the palæontographical society for 1851 i will not here enter on it i will only remark that the lepadidæ or pedunculated cirripedes are much more ancient according to our present state of knowledge than the balanidæ the former seem to have been at their culminant point during the cretaceous period when many species of scalpellum and pollicipes and a singular new genus loricula existed pollicipes is the oldest genus having been found in the lower oolite and perhaps even in the lias the fossil species do not appear to have differed widely from existing forms

and transparent and hence though themselves colourless they are often coloured by the underlying corium their surfaces are either smooth and polished or striated or furrowed and sometimes pectinated they are not subject to disintegration they are generally naked except on the borders where they are coated and held together by membrane in l fascicularis however the valves are covered with thin membrane bearing very minute spines the manner of growth of the valves will be best described under each all the valves even in the same species are subject to considerable variation in shape more especially the terga  scutathese valves are subtriangular in outline with the basal margin straight and rather short and with occludent and tergocarinal margins more or less protuberant in l fascicularis however the basal pl i fig 6 and occludent margins are slightly reflexed and prominent a ridge generally runs from the umbo to the upper point internally there is no conspicuous pit for the adductor muscle under the umbones there is generally either on both valves or only on the righthand side pl i fig 1 c a small calcareous projection or tooth of variable size and shape even in the same species it is generally largest on the righthand valve these teeth at first sight appear to form a hinge uniting the opposite scuta at their umbones but this is not really the case and their use appears to be only to give attachment to the membrane uniting the valves together and to the peduncle the basal margin is internally strengthened by a calcified rim more or less developed the umbones and primordial valves when distinguishable are seated at the rostral angles during growth the basal margin is not added to and the occludent margin only to small extent hence the main growth of the valve is at the upper end and along the carinatergal margin in l fascicularis however the basal reflexed margin is slightly added to beneath the umbo  tergaflat small compared with the scuta usually of an irregular quadrilateral figure with the two upper or occludent margins very short in proportion to the two carinal and scutal lower margins all the margins are nearly straight the two occludent margins generally meet each other at about right angles forming a small triangular projection in l fascicularis however the occludent margin is formed by a single slightly curved line the umbones and primordial valves when distinguishable are not seated at the uppermost point but at the angle where the carinal margin unites to the upper of the two occludent margins during growth the terga are added to both on the occludent and on the scutal margins and slightly along the carinal margin hence their growth is unequally quaquaversal except at one angle of the irregular quadrilateral figure  carinathis is always very narrow and curved concave within often carinated and barbed exteriorly it extends upwards between the terga for one half or two thirds of their length at the lower extremity it ends with the exception of l fascicularis in a small fork pl i fig 1 a b rectangularly inflected and embedded in the membrane beneath the basal margin of the scuta from comparing this lower part of the carina in l australis fig 5 a with the same part in some of the species of the allied genus pæcilasma it would appear that the fork is formed by an oblong disc more and more notched at the end and with the rim between the two points more or less folded backwards conformably with this view in very young specimens of l australis instead of a large and sharp fork there is a small disc the only use of the fork appears to be to give firm attachment to the membrane uniting the valves and peduncle in l fascicularis instead of a fork there is a broad oblong disc figs 6 6 a rectangularly inflected it is much longer than the fork in proportion to the upper part of the carina the disc is not more deeply embedded than the upper part the umbo and primordial valve when distinguishable of the carina is seated just above the embedded fork or disc in l fascicularis at the point where the inflection takes place hence the main growth of the carina is upwardsthe fork however being of course likewise added to at its point in l fascicularis the growth is both upwards and downwards  peduncle and attachmentthe peduncle is generally quite smooth though with a high power its surface may be seen to be studded with minute beads or larger discs of yellowish and hard chitine in the young of l australis and i suspect of some other species it is covered with very minute spines the peduncle in this genus attains its greatest development the cementtissue debouches i believe only through the functionless larval antennæ except in one species l fascicularis in which a ball of this substance is formed in a most peculiar manner round the peduncle pl i fig 6 apparently for the purpose of serving as a float as will be presently described  size and colourthe species of this genus are the largest of the pedunculata with the exception of some pollicipes even in the smallest species l pectinata the capitulum sometimes attains a length of about half an inch the peduncle varies much in length in the same species in l anatifera it is occasionally above a foot long the colours of l anatifera l hillii and l anserifera are very bright and striking the membrane bordering the valves and that round the top of peduncle in two of the species is of the brightest scarletorange the valves owing to the underlying corium are pale blueishgrey and the interspaces between them dark leadenpurple the cirri and trophi are generally dark purple or leadcolour  filamentary appendagesthese are attached to beneath the basal articulation of first pair of cirri they vary in the several species from one to five or six on each side the lowest being always the longest several of them are occupied by testes in l pectinata generally not even one is developed they are subject to great variation in their proportional lengths and in number in the same species these organs have generally been considered to serve as branchiæ i see no reason to believe that they are more especially designed for this end than is the general surface of the body  mouththe labrum is moderately bullate the longitudinal diameter of this part equalling about one third or half of that of the rest of the mouth the palpi are moderately developed the mandibles pl x fig 5 have five teeth with the inferior point either broad or very narrow and toothlike the maxillæ are stepformed pl x fig 9 the first step is sometimes indistinct and curved and in l pectinata all the steps vary much and are more or less blended together the outer maxillæ like those at pl x fig 16 are internally clothed continuously with spines the olfactory orifices are not at all prominent  cirrithe first pair is placed near the second pair and is of considerable length the second has the anterior ramus thicker than the posterior ramus and the segments brushlike the segments pl x fig 26 of the four posterior cirri bear from four to six pair of long spines with a row of small intermediate spines in the posterior cirri of l australis the lateral rim spines are much developed and in those of l fascicularis the usual pairs of large spines are lost in a broad triangular brush formed by the increase of the lateral marginal and intermediate spines  caudal appendages pl x fig 18 b very small either blunt or pointed and quite destitute of spines  the prosoma is well developed the stomach is surrounded in the upper part by a circle of large branching cæca the generative system is highly developed the testes coating the whole of the stomach entering the filamentary appendages and the pedicels of the cirri the two ovigerous lamellæ contain a vast number of ova they are united to rather large fræna of which the sinuous margin supports either a continuous row or separate tufts of glands  distributionthe species abound over the arctic temperate and tropical parts of the atlantic indian and pacific oceans and are always or nearly always attached to floating objects dead or alive the same species have enormous ranges in proof of which i may mention that of the six known species five are found nearly all over the world including the british coast and the one not found on our shores the l australis apparently inhabits the whole circumference of the southern ocean  general remarks and affinitiesthe first five species form a most natural genus they are often sufficiently difficult to be distinguished owing to their great variability the sixth species l fascicularis differs to a slight extent in many respects from the other species and has considerable claims to be generically separated as has been proposed by mr gray under the name of dosima but as it is identical in structure in all the more essential parts i have not thought fit to separate it as far as external characters go some of the species of pæcilasma have not stronger claims than has l fascicularis to be generically separated and i at first retained them altogether but in drawing up this generic description i found scarcely a single observation applicable to both halves of the genus hence i was led to separate lepas and pæcilasma if i had retained these two genera together i should have had also to include the species of dichelaspis and oxynaspis and even scalpellum would have been separable only by the number of its valves this would obviously have been highly inconvenient although some of the species of pæcilasma so closely resemble externally the species of lepas yet if we consider their entire structure we shall find that they are sufficiently distinct as indirect evidence of this i may remark that conchoderma as defined in this volume includes two genera of most authors and yet certainly comes if judged by its whole organisation nearer to lepas than does pæcilasma   1 lepas anatifera tab i fig 1 var    l

difference is seen in the colours of this species caused by the method of preparation if dried without having been in spirits and subsequently kept dry the orange tint round the orifice is preserved if kept long in spirits this is quite lost but sometimes in specimens in spirits the colour of the membrane of peduncle is preserved and rendered pinker the colours of the sack and animal are either quite discharged or rendered extremely dark the valves themselves also often become more opaque in some specimens well preserved in spirits the sack and cirri were purplishbrown or leadcolour tinted with dirty green or orange or bright yellow or brickred  general remarksfrom the foregoing description it will be seen how extremely variable almost every part of this species is i find in the british museum ten distinct specific names given by dr leach to different varieties or rather to different specimens for some of them are undistinguishable a specimen from the sandwich islands sent by mr conrad to mr cuming is marked a engonata  in looking over a large collection of specimens in a museum the most distinctive characters appear at first to be the colours the dentation or barbed condition of the carina the row of square marks on the scuta and terga and the more or less produced form of the whole capitulum all these characters are absolutely worthless as distinctive characters and blend into each other in a fresh condition the colours of this species and of l anserifera and l hillii are surprisingly alike though in l anatifera alone the uppermost part of the peduncle is dark as far as i have seen the smoothness of the valves together with the presence of a tooth beneath the umbo on the righthand scutum and its entire absence on the left side in other species it is smaller on this than on the righthand side is an unfailing diagnostic mark i believe this species is always attached to floating objects though there are some very young specimens in the british museum collected by sir g grey adhering to sandstone but this may have been buoyed up by some large seaweed mr peach has given me the particulars of two instances in which after gales of wind this species of nearly full size adhering to apparently freshly brokenoff laminariæ has been cast upon the coast of england and scotland   2 lepas hillii pl i fig 2    anatifa vel pentalasmis lÆvis

l anatifera quoy and gaimard however appear to have distinguished it under the name of a tricolor from its colours leach named it accidentally for he specifies not one distinctive character and besides his two published names he has appended two other names to specimens in the british museum a specimen from the sandwich islands sent by mr conrad to mr cuming is marked a substriata in a dry state from the shrinking of the membranes and consequent approach of the carina to the other valves and of the fork to the basal margin of the scuta it is most difficult to distinguish this species though so decidedly distinct from l anatifera the absence however of a tooth on the under side of the righthand scutum is at once characteristic even in specimens kept in spirits in which there has been no shrinking but in which the colours have changed and taking into account the variation in the carina and upper part of the terga this species is not always readily distinguished from l anatifera without opening the valves and looking for the righthand tooth of the latter in fresh specimens the orange ring at the top of the peduncle and the broad purplish interspace between the carina and other valves are characteristic in all states the filamentary appendages offer a good character   3 lepas anserifera pl i fig 4    l anserifera linnæus syst naturæ 1767    anatifa striata

cirrus had its posterior ramus in a rudimentary condition in mr cumings collection there are small specimens with the zones of growth overlapping each other with thick irregular margins and with the carina distorted  this species has cost me much trouble i have examined vast numbers of specimens from a tenth to half an inch in length attached to light floating objects such as janthinæ and spirulæ from the tropical oceans which all resembled each other and slightly differed from the common appearance of l anserifera this variety is the pentalasmis dilatata of leach and for a long time i considered it as a distinct species it differs from l anserifera in the less thickness of the valves in their being more finely and yet plainly furrowed in the greater width of the scuta and more especially of that part of the valve lying between the occludent margin and the ridge running from the umbo to the apex in the less elongation of the area in the terga bounded by the two occludent margins and lastly in the less size of the whole individual the trophi and cirri are absolutely identical lately however in carefully going over a great suite of specimens all the above few distinctive characters broke down and insensibly graduated away and i am convinced that this form is only a variety of l anserifera its different aspect being caused partly by youth but chiefly i suspect from being attached to light objects floating close to the surface of the sea  the lepas anserifera can be distinguished by the slight furrows on its valves from all the other species excepting l pectinata this latter species can be readily known by the close proximity in the scuta of the occludent margin and the ridge extending from the umbo to the apex by its carina being very narrow above the fork by the prongs of the fork diverging at an angle of from 135° to 180° by the thinness of its valves by the coarseness of the furrows on them and lastly by there being at most in l

depth of the furrows the margins of the valves are sinuous scuta the ridge running from the umbo to the apex is unusually prominent and curved it runs very close to the occludent margin so that

of the carina with the rim connecting the prongs being not or scarcely reflexedand in the shortness and narrowness of the peduncle there is some approach to l australis and thence to l fascicularis in the form of the maxillæin one specimen having the mandible on one side bearing only four teethand in the frequent absence of filamentary appendages there is some approach to the genus pæcilasma but there is no such approach in the characters derived from the capitulum we have seen that as in so many other species of this genus most of the parts are variable and this is the case to a most unusual

externally sometimes there is an internal transverse depressed line on the fork in young specimens with the capitulum about a quarter of an inch long the fork of the carina is not developed the lower slightly inflected portion consisting simply of an oval plate twice as wide as the upper part until i had carefully examined a perfect series showing the gradual changes in this part i did not doubt that the young specimens formed a distinct species and named it accordingly the shortness of the penis first made me perceive that the specimens were immature at this early age i may add the filamentary appendages were not developed peduncle either quite short or as long as the capitulum close under which it is considerably constricted all round  filamentary appendagestwo on each side one

the valves much darker brown or almost black segments of the cirri clouded with dark brown body and pedicels of the cirri dirty yellowish i have reason to believe that the colours are totally different in living specimens  monstrous varietiesmost of the specimens from lat 50° s on the coast of patagonia were more or less deformed with the successive zones of growth overlapping each other and forming coarse concentric ridges the carina in several specimens was laterally distorted  i have already remarked that this species has some affinity to l pectinata but it is much more closely related to l fascicularis the affinity being clearly shown by the thinness and translucency of the valves their convexity by the width and little acumination of the upper part of the carina by the width of the fork and by its not being deeply imbedded in young specimens moreover before the fork is fully developed there is a remarkable similarity between the two species in the form of this lower part of the carina again the narrowness and inflection of the peduncle under the capitulum in l australis and lastly the lateral marginal spines on both sides of the segments of the posterior cirri all clearly indicate this same affinity to l fascicularis  i believe this species is confined to the southern ocean and perhaps there represents l fascicularis of the northern and tropical seas it must judging from the number of specimens brought home by captain sir j ross and from those previously in the british museum and from those collected by myself be a very common species   6 lepas

length than broad in others onefifth broader than long valves generally approximate in some varieties however from the narrowness of the carina and terga the valves stand far apart there being an interval between the carina and scuta of nearly half the breadth of the latter valves excessively thin brittle transparent colourless smooth but generally sinuous along the zones of growth which are conspicuous valves generally covered throughout by thin chitine membrane which is thickly clothed especially in the interspaces between the valves with minute spines barely visible to the naked eye scuta with the lower part of the tergocarinal margin extremely protuberant occludent margin more or less but slightly reflexed with a depressed line running from the umbo to the apex basal margin much reflexed but to a variable extent and at a varying angle even up to a right anglean external rim or collar being thus formed there are no distinct internal teeth but the basal margin under the umbones is more or less distinctly produced into a rounded disc or projection which is generally not so much outwardly reflexed as the rest of the basal margin there is no distinct internal basal rim the primordial valves are generally visible but they do not lie as in all other species close to the basal margin but a little above itthe lower reflexed portion having been subsequently developed terga flat with the occludent margin slightly arched and not as in the foregoing species formed of two sides apex bent towards the carina width of the lower half highly variable owing to the varying extent to which the scutal margin is hollowed out in some specimens the whole lower half beneath the apex of the scuta is of nearly the same width throughout in other specimens this lower part is spearshaped the widest part of the tergum either equals in width or is only twothirds of the width of the widest part of the carina beneath its umbo carina pl i fig 6 a highly variable in shape with the part above the umbo either spearshaped and slightly concave within or nearly flat and furnished with a central external ridge or the upper part fig 6 c is of equal and extreme narrowness throughout and deeply concave within appearing as if only the central ridge had been developed the part below the umbo answering to the fork in the foregoing species is about onethird of the length of the whole valve and generally twice as wide as the upper part but in the variety with the upper part of the carina equally narrow throughout the lower part is thrice as wide as the upper the disc or lower part is generally slightly concave within exteriorly either with or without a central ridge basal margin rounded lateral margin more or less curved according to the form of the upper part the disc is not more deeply imbedded in membrane than is the upper part of the valve the heel or umbo is either angular and prominent or rounded in very young specimens the carina is simply bowed instead of being rectangularly bent  peduncleshort narrow being abruptly inflected all round under the basal edges of the capitulum lower part of very variable shape being often suddenly contracted into a mere thread fig 6 b which sometimes widens again at the extreme end the external membrane is very thin and is penetrated by the usual fine tubuli leading to the corium its surface is wrinkled and destitute of spines or with extremely few the peduncle is often completely surrounded by a yellowish ball of which i have seen specimens from the coast of england and from off borneo sometimes half as wide as the capitulum composed of very tender vesicular structureless membrane and of a pulpy substance perhaps the yellow colour may be owing to long immersion in spirits some authors have supposed that the ball was the ovisac of the animal and for the first few minutes deceived by the numerous included spores of as i believe bacillariæ i thought that this was the case others have supposed that it consisted of some encrusting algæ or other foreign organism but it is in reality a most singular development of the cementtissue which ordinarily serves to attach cirripedes by their bases to some extraneous object but here surrounding that object and the peduncle gives buoyancy by its vesicular structure to the whole the membrane of the ball falls to pieces in caustic potash differently from the chitine membrane of the enclosed peduncle and this shows that there is some difference in composition from ordinary cement the ball when cut in two exhibits an obscure concentric structure the whole is excreted by the two cementducts through two rows of orifices one on each side of the surrounded portion of the peduncle and i actually traced in one case the yellow pulpy substance coming out of the cementducts the upper apertures are in gradation larger than those below them and they stand a little further apart from each other these are figured as seen from the outside much magnified at pl i fig 6 d i did not succeed in finding the cementglands but i followed the ducts of rather large size running for a considerable distance as usual along and within the longitudinal muscles of the peduncle nearly opposite the uppermost aperture on each side the duct passes out through the corium and becomes laterally attached to the outer membrane of the peduncle at which point an aperture is formed as in other cases by some unknown process thus giving exit to the contents of the duct beneath this upper aperture the duct runs down the peduncle between the corium and the outer membrane till it comes to the next aperture to which it is also attached and so on to all the lower ones but i believe no cement tissue continues to pass out through these lower apertures beneath the lowest aperture the two ducts run into the two prehensile antennæ of the larva which as usual terminate the peduncle the antennæ are attached to some small foreign body in the centre of the vesicular ball by the usual tough light brown transparent cement the two upper apertures are nearly on a level with the outside surface of the ball and it was evident that as the animal grows new apertures are formed higher and higher up on the sides of the peduncle and that out of these fresh vesicular membrane proceeds and grows over the old ball in a continuous layer it appears that the growth of the vesicular ball is not regularthat it is not always formedand that when formed the whole or the lower part sometimes disintegrates and is washed away as that portion of the peduncle which is enclosed ceases to grow and has its muscles absorbed retaining only the underlying corium whereas the upper unenclosed portion and likewise as it appears lower portions once enclosed but since denuded continue to increase in diameter the peduncle when the vesicular ball is removed often has the most irregular outline contracting suddenly into a mere thread and then occasionally expanding again at the basal point  frequently two or three specimens have their peduncles imbedded in one common ball of which there is a fine specimen in the college of surgeons pl i fig 6 the ball being about one inch and a quarter in diameter with a slice cut off in this specimen it is seen that the vesicular membrane proceeding from several individuals unites to form one more or less symmetrical whole and that the original common object of attachment is entirely hidden dr coates29 gives a curious account of the infinite number of specimens through which he sailed during several days in the southern atlantic ocean the balls appeared like birds eggs and were mistaken for some fucus which was supposed to have encrusted the scales of the velellæ to which the cirripede had originally become attached several individuals had their peduncles imbedded in the same ball which floated like a cork on the water as this species grows into an unusually bulky animal we here see a beautiful and unique contrivance in the cement forming a vesicular membranous mass serving as a buoy to float the individuals which when young and light were supported on the small objects to which they originally had been cemented in

animal when fresh are pale blue with the cirri spotted with brown  general remarksthe extreme variability of this species is remarkable in the college of surgeons there is a group of specimens collected by mr bennett i believe in the atlantic in which the extreme narrowness of the carina and of the terga pl i fig 6 b c with consequent wide spaces of membrane left between these valves led me at first to entertain no doubt that it was quite a distinct species which was strengthened by finding that the whole surface of the cirri were villose with very minute spines hence i called this variety villosa on the closest examination however i could detect no other differences and the narrowness of the carina and terga varied very considerably moreover in one of the specimens which was about intermediate in the form of its valves between this variety and the common form the surfaces of the cirri were not in the least degree villose again in some other specimens the terga were as narrow as in mr bennetts whilst the carina had its usual outline  in a var called by leach p donovani from the atlantic under the equator the carina is remarkable from the extreme flatness of the upper part and from the presence of an exterior narrow central ridge in one specimen from jersey in the british museum the carina made an extremely near approach to this same form  affinitiesthis species is certainly much the most distinct of any in the genus and mr gray has proposed to separate it under the name of dosima but considering the close similarity of the whole organisation of the internal parts together with the transitional characters afforded by l australis i think the grounds for this separation are not quite sufficient i have remarked under l australis on the affinity between that and the present species in the carina terminating in a disc though here not imbedded there is some slight affinity to pæcilasma eburnea and crassa and markedly so in the arrangement of the bristles on the posterior cirri in the valves being covered with villose membrane and to a certain extent in the form of the carina and of the occludent margin of the terga and especially in the two rows of cementorifices in the peduncle there is some affinity to scalpellum   pÆcilasma nov genus30 plate ii    anatifa j e gray proc zoolog soc 1848 p 44    trilasmis hinds voyage of the sulphur

posterior ramus caudal appendages uniarticulate spinose      generally attached to crustacea  i have already given my reasons for instituting and separating this genus from lepas as far as the capitulum is concerned the differences between these genera certainly appear trivial they consist in the carina not extending up between the terga and in the lower end being either truncated or produced into an imbedded disc the terga have a single occludent margin the included animals body differs in more important respects for both mandibles and maxillæ are very distinct the cirri of some of the species also differ and the caudal appendages are here always spinose there are no filamentary appendages and lastly the habits are different  the genus may be divided into two sections firstly p kæmpferi and p aurantia which have their carinæ basally truncated the basal angles of their terga cut off and the anterior rami of their second cirri shorter than the posterior rami and secondly p crassa p fissa and p eburnea which in these several respects are otherwise characterised the p eburnea however differs rather more from p crassa and p fissa than these two do from each other but certainly not enough to allow of the retention of mr hinds genus of trilasmis p crassa in an especial degree connects together all the forms  general appearancecapitulum oval more or less produced flat or gibbous formed of three five or seven approximate valves the lesser number arising from the abortion of the terga and the greater number from the scuta being divided into two segments valves

blends into the carinatergal margin the internal basal rim generally is well developed sometimes with and sometimes without internal teeth beneath the umbones in p eburnea and sometimes in p crassa there is a line of apparent fissure and in p fissa of actual disseverment running from the umbo to the apex of each scutum nearly in the line in which a ridge extends in lepas the primordial valves of the scuta in these three species are seated at the basal angles of the lateral and larger segments the positions of the primordial valves and the direction of growth in the calcified valves are in all the species the same as in lepas in several of the species attached to crustacea the two scuta are unequally convex which is caused as was pointed out to me by mr gray by that valve which lies close and nearly parallel to the body of the crab being least developed the terga are either quite absent or rudimentary as in p crassa or pretty well developed as in the other species the occludent margin is single and not double as generally in lepas the basal angle is either pointed or truncated the carina varies considerably in shape but never extends up between the terga nor ends downwards in a fork in the first two species it is truncated in the others it terminates in a deeplyimbedded oblong disc which in p eburnea seems almost entirely but of course not quite to separate the inside of the capitulum from the peduncle a similar separation is effected in p fissa where the imbedded disc is small by two large teeth on the internal basal rims of the two scuta the carina is always narrow and

from the second the arrangement of the spines on the posterior cirri varies to an unusual degree within the limits of the same genus we have either the ordinary structure of anterior pairs with single fine intermediate spines as in p kæmpferi and aurantia or we have the pairs increased by one or two additional longitudinal lateral rows as in p eburnea or we have the front spines forming a single

separation is hardly visible and does not allow of movement the fissure thus formed runs almost in the line connecting the umbo and apex where in most species a ridge extends but a little on the carinal side of it the occludent segment is narrowly bowshaped pointed at both ends with the upper end projecting slightly beyond the apex of the lateral segment and with the occludent margin regularly curved from end to end the lateral segment is large of an oval shape with a narrow strip cut off on one side primordial valves very plain at the umbones of the lateral segments but none are visible on the occludent segments and this makes me believe that these two pieces are normally parts of a single valve having only one specimen of p fissa i was not able to make out quite certainly whether the two segments are continuously united at their umbones by a noncalcified portion of valve as is certainly the case with dichelaspis the basal margin of the lateral segment is narrow inflected and blends with the carinotergal margin it has an internal prominent basal rim and towards the occludent margin a large prominent internal tooth this internal basal rim is not parallel to the outer basal margin but rises to a point a little way up the occludent margin in the same manner as in p eburnea but in a lesser degree in this latter species the peduncle is internally almost cut

clawlike mingled with some fine spines in the four anterior cirri the spines of the dorsal tufts are even thicker and more clawlike on the anterior faces also of all the segments the spines form a single row they are shorter than those composing the dorsal tuft hence the spines on each segment are arranged in a circle interrupted widely on the two sides this arrangement is common to all five

affinity between the present and following species for we shall immediately see that in p eburnea there is evidence of the scuta being composed of two segments fused together and the larger segment is furnished with an internal oblique strong basal rim to this same species there is an evident affinity in the form of the mandibles and of the caudal appendages and in the anterior rami of the cirri being longer than the posterior rami notwithstanding these points of affinity i consider that p fissa is more closely related in its whole organisation as more particularly shown in the arrangement of the spines on the cirri and in the presence of terga to p crassa than to p eburnea although in dichelaspis the scuta are invariably composed of two almost separate segments yet p fissa shows no

an internal basal rim fig 5 b along which the imbedded disc of the carina runs shows where in the other species the basal and carinal margins are separated this basal internal rim is not parallel to the external basal margin but runs upwards to the occludent margin leaving beneath it a large triangular space to which the membrane of the peduncle is attached and this makes it appear as if the rostral umbones of these valves had grown downwards but judging from the allied species p fissa i have no doubt that the primordial valves really lie on the umbones and that the growth has been in the usual direction that is exclusively upwards the occludent margin is curved and blends by a regular sweep into the carinal margin so that there is no acute upper angle a distinct line can be seen as if two calcareous valves had been united running from the umbo to the upper end of the valve thus in appearance separating a slip of the occludent margin internally this appearance is more conspicuous

lateral marginal spines are not so much developed nor is the dorsal tuft and hence the segments can hardly be said to be brushlike the first cirrus is placed rather distant from the second pair the

to crustacea seasnakes c  descriptionthe capitulum appears to contain seven valves but on examination it is found that two of the valves on each side are merely segments of the scutum these are united at the umbo in three of the species by a narrow noncalcified portion of valve where the primordial valve is situated in d orthogonia however the junction of the two segments is perfectly calcified and of the same width as the whole of the basal segment the capitulum is much compressed broad at the base and extends a little beneath the basal segments of the scuta the valves are very thin often imperfectly calcified and generally covered with membrane they are not placed very close together and in all the species a considerable interspace is left between the carina and the two other valves in the d grayii the valves are so narrow that they form merely a calcified border round the capitulum the membrane between the valves and over them is very thin and is thickly studded in some of the species with minute blunt conical points apparently representing spines the valves in the same species present considerable variations in shape in their manner or direction of growth and in the position of their primordial valves they agree with lepas and pæcilasma  scutain three of the species the two segments named the occludent and basal appear like separate valves but these by dissection can be most distinctly seen to be united at the rostral angle the primordial valve formed of the usual hexagonal tissue is elliptic elongated and placed in the direction of the occludent segment calcification commences at its upper point so as to form the occludent segment and afterwards at its lower point but rectangularly outwards to form the basal segment in the minute space between these two points of the primordial valve there is in four of the species no calcification so that the two segments are united by what may be called a flexible hinge in d orthogonia the two calcareous segments are absolutely continuous the occludent segment is longer than the basal segment it either runs close along the orifice or in the upper part bends inwards both segments are narrow except in d warwickii in which the basal segment is moderately broad the two segments are placed at an angle varying from 45° to 90° to each other the capitulum generally extends for a little space beneath the basal segments of the scuta where it contracts to form the peduncle  the terga present singular differences in shape and are described under the head of each species scarcely any point can be predicated of them in common except that they are flat and thin  the carina is much bowed narrow and internally either slightly concave or convex and solid the upper end extends far up between the terga the lower end is formed by a rectangularly inflected imbedded triangular or oblong disc deeply notched at the end or as in h lowei of a fork the base however of which is wider than the rest of the carina so as to present some traces of the disclike structure of the other two species or lastly as in d orthogonia it terminates in a crescentformed cup  pedunclethis is narrow compressed and

at madeira and off borneo     to seasnakes in the indian ocean the individuals of all the     species appear to be rare  general remarksfour of the five species forming this genus though certainly distinct are closely allied i have already shown that although the characters separating lepas pæcilasma and dichelaspis are not very important yet if they be neglected these three natural little groups must be confounded together dichelaspis is much more closely united to pæcilasma than to lepas and as far as the more important characters of the animals body are concerned there is no important difference between them consequently i at first united pæcilasma and dichelaspis but the latter forms so natural a genus and is so easily distinguished externally that i have thought it a pity to sacrifice it the carina which seems to afford better characters than the other valves in dichelaspis from generally running up between the terga and in ending downwards in three of the species in a deeply notched disc or fork more resembles that in lepas than in pæcilasma in the manner however in which the imbedded disc in d warwickii and d grayii nearly cuts off the inside of the capitulum from the peduncle there is a resemblance to pæcilasma eburnea in the extent to which the valves are separated from each other in the bilobed form of the scuta the two segments in dichelaspis perhaps answering to the upper and lateral projections in the scuta of conchoderma virgata and in the basal half of the scuta not descending to the base of the capitulum there is a considerable resemblance to conchoderma in both genera the adductor muscle is attached under the umbones of the scuta but the structure of the mouth and cirri and caudal appendages shows that the affinity is not stronger to conchoderma than to lepas it appears at first probable that dichelaspis would present a much closer affinity to pæcilasma fissa in which owing to the scuta being formed of two segments there are seven valves than to any other species of that genus but in p fissa the primordial valve is triangular and is situated on the basal segment whereas in dichelaspis it is elliptic and is seated between the two segments and is more in connection with the occludent than with the basal segment and this i cannot but think is an important difference in other respects p fissa shows no more affinity to dichelaspis than do the other species of the genus finally i may add that dichelaspis bears nearly the same relation to pæcilasma as conchoderma does to lepas   1 dichelaspis warwickii pl ii figs 6 6

throughout and very slightly concave within the occludent segment widens a little above the junction or umbo and then keeps of the same width to the apex which is obliquely truncated internally this segment is concave externally it has a central ridge running along it the occludent segment is twice as long and twice as broad as the basal segment both segments are a little bowed from their junction to their apices  tergathese are of a singular shape they are about threefourths as long as the occludent segment of the scuta and in their widest part of greater width than it they consist of four prominent ridges proceeding from the umbo and united together for part only of their length and therefore ending in four prominences one of these the longest has the same width throughout and forms the basal point a second very small one is seated high up on the carinal margin just above the apex of the carina the third and fourth are nearly equal in length and project one above the other on the scutal margin there are two occludent margins meeting each other at right angles and forming a prominence as in lepas and this gives to the margin of the valve the five prominences the whole valve internally is flat externally it is ridged as described  carina fig 10 a b much bowed narrow long externally the central ridge is quite flattened internally slightly concave but scarcely so towards the lower part which is narrow the upper part widens gradually and the apex is rounded the basal embedded portion is as wide as the uppermost part and forms a cup unlike anything else known the outline of this cup is semioval and crescentformed it is moderately deep it is formed by the external lamina of the carina bending rectangularly downwards and a little outwards whereas the inner lamina of the lower part which is slightly concave is continued with the same curve as just above and forms the concave chord to the semioval rim of the cup this cup i believe lies under the points of

anterior ramus of the second cirrus thicker than the posterior ramus caudal appendages uniarticulate spinose      attached to horny corallines  i have most unwillingly instituted this genus but it will be seen by the following description that the one known species could not have been introduced into lepas or pæcilasma without destroying these genera although it has a close general resemblance with both as far as the valves are concerned it is more nearly related to lepas than to pæcilasma but taking the entire animal its relation is much closer to the latter genus than to lepas it differs from both these genera in the manner of growth of the scuta which is both upwards and downwards the primordial valve being situated in nearly the middle of the occludent margin in this respect and in the shape of the carina and terga there is an almost absolute identity with scalpellum i may however remark that in scalpellum the scuta first grow downwards and afterwards in most of the species upwards whereas here from the beginning the growth is both upwards and downwards in the mouth and cirri there is rather more resemblance to scalpellum than to pæcilasma and lepas in habits also this genus agrees with scalpellum and if it had possessed a lower whorl of valves it would have quite naturally entered that genus it is unfortunate that so insignificant and poorly characterised a form should require a generic appellation in natural position it appears to lead from scalpellum through pæcilasma to lepas   1 oxynaspis celata pl iii fig 1      madeira attached in numbers to an

reference by the    editor it appears that schumachers volume appeared before the    number of the journal de physique containing leachs paper     35 under these nine generic names the two common species of    conchoderma have received thirtythree different specific    denominations caused partly by changes of nomenclature and    partly from varieties having ranked as species  valvæ 2 ad 5

absent valves minute thin generally more or less linear placed far distant from each other sometimes imperfectly calcified and covered by chitine membrane or imbedded in it the umbones of the valves together with the primordial valves are nearly central so that they are added to at their upper and lower ends hence their manner of growth is considerably different from that of the valves in lepas the adductor muscle is attached to a slight concavity on the under side of each scutum at the point whence the lobes diverge  the terga are placed almost transversely to the scuta at their lower ends there is either a very slight prominence in the capitulum or there is a large tubular folded appendage opening into the sack and apparently serving for respiratory purposes  peduncle smooth moderately long attachment effected by the cementstuff being poured out exclusively as it appears from the larval antennæ these antennæ in c aurita and c virgata resemble in the form of the disc and in the long feathered spines on the ultimate segment those in lepas  the filamentary appendages are highly developed there are six or seven on each side two are attached beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus as is usual in lepas and near them there are one or two small papformed projections of apparently similar nature the rest of the filaments are attached to the posterior edges low down on

nearly equal in length and in the anterior ramus of the second cirrus the faces of the segments are highly protuberant and clothed with thick transverse rows of finely and doubly serrated spines the anterior ramus of the second cirrus is considerably thicker than the posterior ramus which latter together with both rami of the third cirrus differ from the three posterior cirri only in the intermediate and in the lateral marginal spines being slightly more developed  caudal appendages absent  alimentary canalthe upper part of the stomach has four large cæca of which the posterior one is the largest the whole surface also is covered with minute pits arranged in transverse rows  generative system developed to an extraordinary degree the testes run into all the filamentary appendages as well as more or less into the pedicels of the cirri the two vesiculæ seminales unite within the penis either just beyond its basal constriction or up one third of its length penis short hairy the ovarian tubes not only fill the peduncle but extend in a thin sheet between the two folds of corium all round the sack close up to the terga the two ovigerous fræna are present in the usual position the ovigerous lamellæ either form several layers in pairs one under the other or are united in a single large cupformed sheet enclosing the whole animal  coloursthe prevailing tint is a dark purplishbrown which forms or tends to form broad longitudinal bands on the peduncle and capitulum  general remarksthis genus is intimately related as has been remarked by professor macgillivray36 to lepas if we look to the body of the animal which from being less exposed to external influences must in the cirripedia offer the most trustworthy characters we find that in conchoderma there are additional filamentary appendages attached to the cirri that there are no caudal appendages that the teeth of the mandibles are finely pectinated and that the ovarian tubes run higher up round the sack in every other respect there is the closest similarity even to the arrangement of the bristles on the cirri in the capitulum the difference consists chiefly though not exclusively in the less development of the valves and their consequent wide separation the scuta however in conchoderma are added to beneath their umbones or original centres of growth which is never the case or only to a very slight degree in lepas conchoderma has no very close affinity to any other genus as the majority of authors have ranked the two common species under two distinct genera otion and cineras i may observe that there is no good ground for this separation in the above few specified points in which conchoderma differs from the genus most closely allied to it the two species essentially agree together if we take the nearest varieties of c virgata and c aurita there is but a very slight difference even in the form of their valves and these hold the same relative positions to each other the carina however is always less developed in c aurita even the colouring in both tends to follow the same arrangement the only obvious distinction between the two species are the earlike appendages of c aurita which however are not developed in its early age are subject to considerable variation are of no high functional signification and are indicated in c virgata by two prominences on the same exact spots on these grounds i conclude that the generic separation of the two species is quite inadmissible     36 remarks on the cirripedia c edin new phil journal    vol xxxix p 171   1 conchoderma

slightly compressed almost globular composed of thick membrane with two large earlike flexible tubular folded appendages at the upper end opening into the sack these appendages are seated behind the rudimentary terga when such are present or behind the spots which they would have held if not aborted in a young condition they are tubular but not folded and often according to prof macgillivray either one or both are at first imperforate they are formed externally of the outer membrane of the capitulum rendered thin where folded and internally of a prolongation of the inner tunic of the sack between the two there is as around the whole sack a double layer of corium a section across both appendages near their bases is given in pl iii fig 4 b showing how they are foldedthe chief fold being directed from below upwards with a smaller fold not always present from between the two outwards the folds sometimes do not exactly correspond on opposite sides of the same individual they are almost confined to the lower part the orifice itself being often simply tubular these appendages are sometimes very nearly as long as the whole capitulum a section near their bases is subtriangular i shall presently make some remarks on their functions and manner of formation  the scuta as well as the other valves are imperfectly calcified shape variable they usually consist of two lobes or plates placed at above a right angle to each other and rarely fig 4 c almost in a straight line the lower lobe is more pointed and narrower than the upper the two correspond to the lower and middle lobes in the scuta of c virgata the upper one being here absent  the terga are developed in an extremely variable degree they are often entirely cast off and absent in very young specimens they are of the same length with the carina but after the carina has ceased to grow the terga always increase a little and sometimes to such a degree as to be even thirty or forty times as long as carina when most developed fig 4 a they are not above one third as long as the scuta to which they lie at nearly right angles they consist of imperfectly calcified plates square at both ends slightly broader and thinner at the end towards the carina where they are a little curled inwards than at the opposite end they are not quite flat in any one plane internally they are slightly concave finally i may add they nearly resemble in miniature the terga of c virgata in full grown specimens the terga almost invariably drop out and are lost but even in this case a long brownish cleft in the membrane of the capitulum marks their former position the orifice of the capitulum is usually notched between the terga or between the clefts left by them on each side of the notch there is a slight prominence in some few cases however there is no trace of this notch behind the terga or the clefts the great earlike appendages as we have seen are situated  carina rudimentary fig 4 and often absent it is pointedelliptical and is rarely above the 140th of an inch long after arriving at this full size calcareous matter is added to the under surface over a less and less area so that it becomes internally pointed and finally in place of calcareous matter continuous sheets of chitine are spread out beneath it hence during the disintegration of the outer surface the carina comes to project more and more and at last drops out subsequently even the little hole in which it was imbedded disintegrates and disappears  peduncle cylindrical distinctly separated from the capitulum and generally twice or thrice as long as it the thickness of the outer membrane generally great but variable surface of attachment variable either pointed or widely expanded or formed into divergent projections  filamentary appendages seven on each side highly developed long and tapering there are two beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus and one on the posterior margin of the pedicel of each cirrus excepting the sixth pair the filaments on the pedicels are nearly twice as long as the cirri themselves  mouthmandibles with the five teeth nearly equidistant and towards their bases finely pectinated on both sides inferior angle rudimentary often represented by a single minute spine in one specimen there were only four teeth on one side maxillæ with five steps not very distinct from each other with the first step much curved the larger of the two upper great unequal spines is pectinated like the teeth of the mandibles there is a third long finer spine beneath the upper large pair  cirri rather short broad with the anterior faces of the segments protuberant especially those of the first cirrus and of the anterior ramus of the second pair spines on the anterior cirri doubly serrated posterior cirri with the intermediate spines between the pairs long dorsal tufts minute on the lower segment of the pedicels of the four posterior cirri there are two separate tufts of bristles  colours extremely variable sometimes five longitudinal bands of dark purple can be distinctly seen as in c virgata on the peduncle these bands becoming more or less confluent on the capitulum at other times the capitulum is more or less spotted or often nearly uniformly purple the sack cirri and trophi are also purple  sizethe largest specimen which i have seen was including the peduncle and ears five inches in length the capitulum itself being rather above one inch in length and 710ths of an inch in breadth  general remarksi have come to the same conclusion with prof macgillivray concerning the variability of this form and i believe there is only one true species with respect to dr coatess species viz otion depressa and o saccutifera though i have not seen specimens i can hardly doubt from the insufficient characters given that they are mere varieties  with respect to the earlike appendages we shall presently see in c virgata that at corresponding points on the capitulum tab iii fig 2 b there are two slight closed prominences according to professor macgillivray in c aurita every gradation can be followed by which the appendages at first closed become tubular and open the opening would ensue if the corium became absorbed at the bottom of the appendages whilst still imperforate for then the inner tunic would be cast off at the next moult and would not be reformed whilst the outer membrane would gradually disintegrate together with the other external parts of the capitulum and not being reformed at this point an aperture would at last be left these appendages have no relation to the generative system the ovarian tubes which surround the sack do not extend into them nor do the ovigerous lamellæ i believe that their function is respiratory the corium lining them is traversed by riverlike circulatory channels and their muchfolded tubular and open structure must freely expose a large surface to the circumambient water why this species should require larger respiratory organs than any other i know not in this species moreover the filamentary appendages are developed to a greater extent than in any other cirripede in most genera the surface of the body and of the sack suffices for respiration   2 conchoderma virgata pl iii fig 2 pl ix fig 4    lepas virgata spengler skrifter naturhist selbskabet b i         1790 tab vi fig 9     coriacea poli test

one inch long and three fourths of an inch wide growth very rapid  monstrous varietyin the british museum there is a dried and somewhat injured specimen of a monstrous variety the pamina trilineata of j e gray it differs from the common form only in having a tubular projection just behind the notch separating the upper points of the terga this tube springs from over the terga and is therefore in a different position from the earlike appendages in conchoderma aurita it does not open into the sack the membrane composing it appears to have been double in the upper part and to have been lined with corium in short this tube seems to have been an excrescence or tumour of a cup or tubular form  general remarksit will have been seen how much subject to variation the valves of this species are when i first examined the cineras chelonophilus of leach from 36° n lat atlantic ocean and found in many specimens both old and young that the terga were very small flat acuminated at both ends with a projecting shoulder on the carinal margin and situated at about their own length from the apex of the carina and at twice their own length from the scuta and when i found the carina acuminated at both ends and the scuta very imperfectly calcified with the lateral lobe broad flat and standing out at right angles and lastly when i found the whole capitulum bluntly pointed instead of being square on the summit i had not the least doubt that it was a quite distinct species afterwards i found in the cineras olfersii of leach from the south atlantic the same form of terga but within slightly more concave or furrowed and not nearly so small and therefore not placed at above half so great a distance from the other valves and here the carina had its usual outline as had nearly the scutum on one side whereas on the other side it presented a new and peculiar form having five ridges or points and was imperfectly calcified seeing this it was impossible to place much weight in the precise form or size and therefore relative separation of the calcified valves and on close examination i found every part of the mouth and cirri identical in leachs cineras chelonophilus and c olfersii and in the common form therefore i conclude that c chelonophilus and still more c olfersii are only varieties the terga presenting the greatest yet variable amount of difference namely in their acumination and flatness we know also that in the species of the closely allied genus of lepas the terga are very variable in shape and this is the case even in a still more marked degree in conchoderma aurita professor macgillivray i may add has come to a similar conclusion regarding the extreme variability of the valves of this species  as the varieties here mentioned are very remarkable and may perhaps turn out to be true species i think they are worth describing in some detail i will only further add that we must either make several new species or consider as i have done several forms as mere

without a particle of calcareous matter the summit of the capitulum nearly intermediate in outline between the common square and bluntlypointed form of var chelonophilus i compared the cirri and trophi with those of a common variety and could detect not the smallest difference this variety differs from var olfersii in the less development of its carina and from chelonophilus in the greater development of its carina and especially of its terga it would appear as if the great variability of the valves was connected with the absence of calcareous matter   3 conchoderma hunteri pl iii fig 3

very young one in which the scuta had not upper lobes so that in outline they exactly resembled the scuta in the quite distinct c aurita there was not even a rudiment of a carina the tergum on one side was externally bordered by a projecting semicircular calcified disc and the upper points of both terga showed only traces of the rectangular projection which is the chief characteristic of c hunteri from these traces alone and from the specimen being mingled with the others do i here include this variety  general remarksi have very great doubts whether i have acted rightly in considering this as a species but as there were many specimens old and young all differing remarkably from the common species this form anyhow deserves description the points by which it can be distinguished from c virgata arethe almost rectangular manner in which the upper portion of the tergum is bent outwards and along the orifice of the sackthe narrowness of all the valves and especially of the lateral lobes of the scutaand lastly the greater curvature of the carina which in some specimens runs up far between the terga had this last character been constant it would have been an important one but such is far from being the case great as are these differences in the valves and though common to many specimens they are not sufficient to convince me that it is a true species and i should not be at all surprised at varieties intermediate between it and the common form being hereafter foundhad a name not been already attached to it i should not have given one in the monstrous variety described we see to what an extent the valves may vary the c hunteri approaches nearest to the var of c virgata called by leach cineras chelonophilus for in both the top of the capitulum is bluntly pointed and the terga are solid within in the var chelonophilus the terga and carina are minute whereas here though very narrow they are much elongated certainly c chelonophilus has almost as strong a claim to rank as a species as c hunteri but in the former by the aid of other varieties the differences were almost reduced to the peculiarities in the tergathe valves the most subject to variation in c hunteri we have other differences and the form of the terga is even still more peculiar i have therefore provisionally attached to it the specific name by which it is designated in the museum of the college of

almost tubular in a parasita and a minuta it does not project and is either moderately large or very small in proportion to the length of the capitulum from contraction it is much wrinkled the membrane forming the capitulum is smooth and very transparent it contains very few tubuli except under certain irregular projections in a cornuta  the peduncle is rather short and narrow it blends into the capitulum and is not in some of the species separated from it by any distinct line the surface of attachment is rather wide within the peduncle we have the three usual layers of striæless muscles namely the innermost and longitudinal which run lower down than the others the middle and transverse and lastly the exterior oblique muscles which cross each other becoming transparent on the rostral central line these several muscles run up from the peduncle and surround the capitulum from the transparency of the membranes they can be seen from the outside they are particularly conspicuous round the orifice which they probably serve to close there is in all cases the usual adductor scutorum muscle with transverse striæ which is attached under the horny scuta where such exist the fact of the striæless muscles of the peduncle surrounding the whole capitulum has been observed only in one other genus namely anelasma in consequence of this structure the capitulum must possess considerable powers of contraction  the antennæ of the larva in the alepas cornuta and a minuta have the sucking disc nearly circular with the spines unusually plain on the distal as well as proximal

muscles of the peduncle run up and surround the capitulum and likewise in the reticulated character of the biliary envelope of the stomach to conchoderma especially to c aurita there is manifest affinity in the form of the horny scuta there is also some affinity to this same genus in the presence of filamentary appendages though here little developed and in the circular form of the disc of the larval antennæ and lastly in the ovarian tubes in a cornuta surrounding the capitulum there is quite as close if not closer affinity to ibla in the following peculiaritiesin the curved

one rather thicker than the posterior one this posterior ramus has fiftyfive segments the bristles on the second and third cirri are arranged on the same principle as on the three posterior pair but from an increase in size and number of the little intermediate bristles between the main pairs and of those on the lateral rims the segments especially the basal ones of the anterior ramus of the second cirrus are clothed with thin brushes of bristles these same bristles on the posterior ramus of the second and on both rami of the third cirrus can hardly be said to form brushes though longer and more numerous than those on the three posterior pair of cirri  fifth and sixth cirrithese resemble each other and have their inner or posterior rami in an almost rudimentary condition in the sixth cirrus pl x fig 28 the outer ramus a has actually sixtythree segments whereas the rudimentary ramus k has only eleven nearly cylindrical segments these are furnished with extremely minute spines of which those on the dorsal face are longer than those on the anterior face the spines on the summit of the terminal segment are the longest the segments are not half as thick as the normal ones in the outer ramus the rudimentary ramus is only one seventh part longer than the pedicel which supports both it and the normal ramus in the fifth cirrus the rudimentary ramus is rather longer and has thirteen segments resembling those in the rudimentary ramus of the sixth in the fourth cirrus there is no trace of this peculiar structure the rami being equal in length and strength the two rudimentary rami on each side are nearly straight and seem incapable of movement they project out behind the normal rami and closely resemble in general appearance the two caudal appendages hence this cirripede at first sight appears to be sixtailed  pedicels of cirrithe pedicel of the first pair is very short that of the second is the longest those of the posterior cirri decreasing in length upper segments short lower segments in the second third and fourth cirri irregularly and rather thickly clothed with bristles but in the fifth and sixth cirri there is a regular double row of main spines with some minute intermediate ones hence there is a difference both in the rami and in the pedicels between the fourth cirrus and the fifth and sixth and this is a unique case on the dorsal surface of the pedicel of the second cirrus there is a tuft of much feathered fine spines  caudal appendageseach consists of eight much tapering very thin segments furnished with a few short simple spines round their upper margins and with a longer tuft on the terminal short segment basal segments twice as thick as the middle ones in length these caudal appendages equal the pedicels of the sixth pair of cirri and are a very little shorter than the rudimentary rami of these same cirri  general remarkshaving examined this species first in the genus i fully anticipated that the very remarkable character of the inner rami of the fifth and sixth cirri being rudimentary and serving the same function if any with the caudal appendages would have been generic but this is not the case for alepas cornuta

professor steenstrup an examination of this very curious cirripede well described and figured by lovén who considered it an alepas it lives parasitic with its peduncle imbedded in the skin of sharks in the north sea according to the principles of classification which i have followed this cirripede cannot possibly remain in alepas and must form a new genus for some time indeed i thought that a new family or subfamily ought to have been instituted for its reception but when i considered that its highly peculiar characters are all negative as the nonarticular nonspinose structure of the cirri and that no new or greatly modified functional organ is present i concluded that it might properly remain amongst the lepadidæ we shall moreover hereafter see that the male of ibla which of course must remain in the same family with the female is in some analogous respects even more abnormal than anelasma   1 anelasma squalicola pl iv figs 17    alepas squalicola lovén ut supra      north sea parasitic on squalus  capitulum destitute of valves oval much flattened the double membrane composing it thin highly flexible coloured externally and internally by the underlying corium of a blackish purple aperture extremely large extending from the upper end of the capitulum to close above the peduncle gaping and not protecting in the dead condition the cirri and mouth  the peduncle is about half as long as the capitulum but according to lovén this part varies in length it is a little narrower than the capitulum colourless from being imbedded in the sharks skin subglobular basal end almost hemispherical total length of animal 13 diameter of peduncle 4 of an inch  the external membrane of the capitulum is not nearly so thick as is usual in other cirripedes and is therefore unusually flexible the internal membrane on the other hand is very much thicker than is usual being only a little thinner than the outside coat this circumstance as well as the similarity in colour on both sides is evidently due to the remarkable openness of the sack and consequent exposure of its inside the inner membrane when viewed under a high power is seen to be covered with the minutest spines the external membrane is structureless except that there are a few rows of very minute beads of hard chitine like those which occur on the capitulum of conchoderma aurita lovén however states that there are imbedded in the outer membrane scattered minute dendritic calcareous particles of these i could see no trace there is a very thin muscular layer between the two coats all round the capitulum and this layer becomes rather thicker round the base near the peduncle the adductor muscle occupying its usual place close below the mouth is thinner than in any other cirripede of the same size seen by me nor does it end so abruptly at each extremity as is usual where attached to the outer coat no impression is left it is a singular fact that in this cirripede alone the fibres of the adductor and of the muscles of the cirri and of the trophi of the mouth are destitute of transverse striæ but it is not singular that the muscles surrounding the capitulum should also be destitute of striæ for this is the case with the muscles which running up from the peduncle surround the capitulum in alepas and partly surround it in conchoderma it must not be inferred from the absence of transverse striæ in the muscular fibres of the adductor and of the cirri and trophi that they are involuntary but only that they are in an embryonic condition for i find in the natatory larva that all the muscles with the exception of some connected with the eyes are similarly destitute and yet perform voluntary movements46     46 dr c schmidt in his contribution to the comparative    anatomy of the invertebrate animals c translated in taylors    scientific memoirs vol v p 1 says that in young crustacea    we find plain primitive fibres which subsequently acquire the    transversely striated aspect  although in the dead state the aperture of the capitulum seems to be always gaping yet i have little doubt that the living animal can fold the flexible membrane like a mantle round its thorax and cirri and thus protect though feebly compared with most cirripedes these organs i suspect that the mouth is always exposed  pedunclethe membrane of the peduncle is thin the whole surface is sparingly and quite irregularly studded with minute muchbranched filaments pl iv fig 3 highly magnified these are occasionally as much as l5th of an inch in length the degree of branching varies much but is generally highly complex the ordinary diameter of the branches is about 1200th of an inch their tips are rounded and even a little enlarged and frequently torn off as if they had been attached to or buried in the flesh of the shark in which the whole peduncle is imbedded these filaments are formed of and are continuous with the external transparent membrane of the peduncle and they contain up to the tips of every subbranch a hollow thread of corium prolonged from the layer internally coating the whole peduncle in all other lepadidæ the peduncle increases in length chiefly at the summit where joined to the capitulum and in diameter throughout nearly its whole length except close to the base but owing to the constant disintegration of the outer surface the old outside coat does not split in defined lines like the membrane of the capitulum in anelasma however owing to the imbedded position of the peduncle the old outer coats are preserved the lines in which they have split during continued growth being thus exhibited those in the uppermost part almost symmetrically surround the peduncle showing that here as in other lepadidæ has been one regular line of growth but in the lower part the lines are extremely irregular and what is almost unique it appears that the blunt basal end is constantly increasing in length and breadth and apparently at a greater rate than any other part i judge of this latter fact from the whole bottom of the peduncle being covered with numerous curved or nearly circular lines of natural splitting the nature of which can be best understood by examining the muchenlarged drawing pl iv fig 3 of a small portion taken by chance of the membrane of the base seen from the outside and bearing some of the simplest branched filaments other branches as may be seen have been cut off this manner of growth explains the broad blunt basal termination of the peduncle so unlike that in other lepadidæ new membrane is formed not continuously as in other cases under the whole surface of the old membrane but in irregular patches thus the portion marked a runs under b but not under the little circles c c for these are the lastformed portions and underlie the membrane a and b i do not understand how the splitting of the old membrane is effected but no doubt it is by the same process by which the membrane of the capitulum in other genera as in scalpellum splits symmetrically between the several valves in the branched filaments it is particularly difficult to understand their growth for it is not possible after examining them to doubt that they continue to increase and send off subbranches which it would appear probable penetrate the sharks flesh like roots i may remark that one or more commonly two or three branched filaments stand nearly in the centre of each circular line of exuviation or splitting the branched filaments first commence as mere little pustules and these appear to be most numerous at the bottom of the peduncle  the final cause of the downward growth of the bottom of the peduncle is obviously to allow of the animal burying itself in the sharks body in the same way as coronula and tubicinella become imbedded by the downward growth of their parietes in the skin of cetacea the only other genus of lepadidæ in which the growth of the peduncle is at all analogous is lithotrya in this genus however the animal burrows mechanically into soft rock or shells  i looked in vain for cement or for the cementglands but the specimen was in an extremely unfavorable state for finding the latter or for the prehensile antennæ of the larva no doubt this cirripede at first becomes attached in the same way as others but after early life i suspect it is retained in its place by being so deeply imbedded in the sharks body and perhaps by the rootlike branched filaments the irregular growth and splitting of the membrane at the base of the peduncle where the prehensile antennæ of the larva must originally have been situated would account for not finding them  the inside of the peduncle fig 2 g was gorged in the specimen examined by me with immature ova the innermost muscular layer consists of longitudinal bundles of unusual size but placed rather far apart from each other these do not extend to the very base of the peduncle and at the upper end they curve inwards almost to the middle of the under side of the diaphragm separating the peduncle and capitulum outside these longitudinal muscles there are delicate transverse ones but apparently there are no oblique muscles in the upper part of the peduncle as in other lepadidæ near the bottom the transverse muscles form a thicker layer with many of the bundles running in oblique lines  mouthulovén has not described this part quite accurately owing to his not having used high enough magnifying powers he states that the trophi are soft and functionless which is far from the case the whole mouth fig 2 d is unusually small it is to a certain extent probosciformed and being curved a little downwards projects slightly over the adductor muscle to which it is closely placed the labrum does not project more beyond the general surface of the body than in many other cirripedes but the probosciformed structure is caused by the elongation of the surface fronting the thorax the summit of the mouth stands above the level of the top of the pedicels of the first pair of cirri the labrum is slightly hollowed out in the middle of its upper margin it can scarcely be called bullate in which it differs from all other lepadidæ on the other hand the outer and inner folds of the labrum are not so close together as in balanus on each upper corner there is as usual a small rounded prominence close to which there is a second slight rounded spineless swelling these latter represent the quite rudimentary palpi  the mandibles figs 4 5 are more highly developed than the other trophi they are however very minute the toothed edge being only about 161000th of an inch in length measured in its longest direction the edge is unusually thick with the teeth placed rather on one side this organ when viewed on the labrum side fig 5 shows two large teeth placed low down with the inferior angle pectinated and broadly truncated but when viewed on the other or maxillæ side fig 4 several large and small teeth placed alternately and irregularly in pairs are seen extending along the whole edge the mandibles are furnished as usual with three principal sets of muscles attached to the basal fold of the mouth  the maxillæ fig 7 are still smaller than the mandibles the spinose edge being only the 1100th of an inch in length the edge instead of being square and furnished with a double row of long spines as in all other cirripedes is rounded thick clubshaped and with the side facing the mandibles thinly and irregularly strewed with short thick very minute spines there is a large broad apodeme a in the usual place but it is much more transparent and flexible than common there are also the usual muscles in other cirripedes the mandibles alone seem to force the prey down the oesophagus but here the mandibles and maxillæ equally stand over the orifice and their adjoining spinose faces and edges seem excellently adapted to force by their united action any minute living creature down the passage  the outer maxillæ are almost in as rudimentary a condition as the palpi they are quite spineless viewed externally they appear like two smooth blunt very minute projecting points but viewed internally the membrane forming the supraoesophageal hollow seems to be united actually to their tips so that they do not project at all i was surprised to find that the longitudinal muscles going to these organs were developed in proportion to the other muscles quite as fully as in ordinary cirripedes hence these two little outer maxillæ no doubt serve as an under lip and possess the usual backward and forward movement  the surface of the probosciformed mouth facing the first pair of cirri has a deep central longitudinal fold and rather more than halfway down a transverse fold just above this latter fold and therefore quite below the outer maxillæ themselves the two olfactory orifices are seated these are unusually large and the sack into which they lead is most unusually large and deep in this cirripede i was first enabled to observe that the membrane lining the sack is tubular and open at the bottom  cirrithere are as usual six pair and not of very small size they have a shapeless and rudimentary appearance they are coloured like the rest of the body blackish purple they are quite spineless and not articulated but their anterior faces are either obscurely or very plainly lobed so that in some for instance in the third pair pl iv fig 6 nine or ten prominent steps could be counted manifestly representing so many segments the rami are equal in length in the first pair and slightly unequal in the second and third pair these two latter are longer than either the first or three posterior pair there is a small interspace as usual between the first and second pair of cirri internally the cirri are occupied even up to their tips by delicate striæless muscles the external membrane of the thorax and limbs when examined under a very high power is seen to be covered with minute toothed scales as in most cirripedes  the thorax is articulated as usual the posterior part however is smaller and tapers more suddenly than in other species and this corresponds with the smaller size and more rudimentary condition of the three posterior pair of cirri compared with the anterior pair the prosoma is hardly at all developed the orifice pl iv fig 2 e of the acoustic  sack beneath the first cirrus is unusually large  there are no filamentary appendages  alimentary canalthe membrane lining the oesophagus is unusually thin it is furnished with the ordinary constrictor muscles and others radiating from them like spokes of a wheel the stomach is lined by unusually prominent biliary folds which in the duodenum are transverse sending forth however short folds at right angles and these latter in the proper stomach become so much developed that the folds appear longitudinal the rectum extends inwards about as far as the base of the fourth pair of cirri but is very short owing to the little development of the three posterior segments of the thorax the anus is seated in its usual place at the dorsal basis of the penis and is hidden by loose folds of skin but there are no distinct caudal appendages the stomach in the specimen examined was quite empty  reproductive organthe penis fig 2 c is thick short about twice as long as the sixth cirrus constricted at the base ringed spineless with the terminal aperture large internally it is well furnished with muscles the two vesiculæ seminales appeared to be unusually small and one was much smaller than the other they do not i believe become united into a common tube till near the apex of the penis they were empty and i presume from the state of the ova that their contents had lately been discharged the whole thorax was filled with a white fibrous and cellular mass consisting perhaps of the testes in their undeveloped state the individual dissected by me appeared to have been defective in its last act of reproduction for there were only two or three ova attached to the frænum on one side and not very many on the other the ova are much less elongated than is usual they are of a remarkable size namely 221000ths of an inch in their longer diameter the membrane by which they are united into a pair of lamellæ is remarkably strong the frænum pl iv fig 2 f on each side is large strong with rounded edges pale coloured and hence conspicuous on the side nearest the body the whole surface is covered with clubshaped glands having very short footstalks and being in total length 56000ths of an inch these glands secrete a reticulated layer of gutformed fibres attached to the ovigerous lamellæ in the specimen described by lovén the lamellæ fig 1 and fig 2 b b appear to have been very large and in that examined by myself the peduncle was gorged with immature ova showing that the female reproductive powers were ample though at the foregoing period only a few eggs had been formed  habitsaccording to lovén this species lives imbedded in the skin of squalus maximus and spinax in the north sea i suspect that it is not closely compressed in its cavity otherwise i do not see the use of the two layers of muscles round the whole peduncle it probably adheres to the sides of the cavity by the tips of the branched rootlike filaments owing to the flexible nature of the capitulum this cirripede can offer little resistance to the water and therefore is little likely to be torn out of its cavity i have no doubt that it can fold the membrane of the capitulum like a cloak round its thorax and cirri but it certainly can offer far less resistance than other cirripedes to any enemy this creature must obtain its food and considering its productiveness much food must be required in a manner quite different from nearly every other member of its order as the whole of the peduncle is imbedded and as the mouth is probosciformed with the labrum a little curled over the adductor muscle i conclude that this cirripede can reach minute animals crawling by on the surface of the sharks body  it must be borne in mind that the mouth as in all cirripedes has the power of independent movement and that the mandibles and maxillæ are here beautifully adapted to catch and force down any small living creature into the muscular oesophagus the rudimentary outer maxillæ moreover no doubt have the power of scraping like a lip anything towards these prehensile organs it will hereafter be seen that the male of ibla cumingii in which the cirri are quite rudimentary obtains its food in a somewhat analogous manner though in this case the whole peduncle moves and not merely a probosciformed mouth it deserves attention that in the male ibla and in anelasma in neither of which the cirri are prehensile the palpi are rudimentary and useless i am tempted to believe that the largely developed olfactory sacks and perhaps likewise acoustic  sacks in anelasma replace by giving notice of the proximity of prey the loss of tactile cirri it should be remembered that all cirripedes subsist on animals which happen to swim or float within reach of the cirri but here it is only those which happen to crawl within reach of the probosciformed mouth it would however be rash to assert that the cirri in anelasma considering their muscular though feeble structure may not be of some slight use when thrown over the prey in preventing its escape  professor steenstrup informs me that from late observations it appears that this animal always adheres to the sharks body in pairs i regret extremely that i have not been able to examine a pair that the individual examined by me was bisexual i can hardly doubt though the male organs certainly were feebly developed it appears probable that the individual described by lovén was likewise bisexual but after the facts presently to be revealed regarding the sexes in ibla and scalpellum it is quite possible that the male and female organs may be developed in inverse degrees in different and adjoining individuals  the genus anelasma is i think properly placed between alepas and ibla in several of its characters such as the absence of calcareous valves the broad blunt end of the peduncle the spineless cirri the small size of the trophi and more especially the absence of transverse striæ in those muscles which in mature cirripedes are thus furnished we see that this genus is in some degree in an embryonic condition   genusibla pls iv v    ibla leach zoolog journal vol ii july 1825    anatifa cuvier mem pour servir  mollusques art anatifa         1817

there are only two species as yet known and as these resemble each other in every respect most closely a generic description would be a useless repetition of the full details given under ibla cumingii i have taken this latter species as the type from having owing to the kindness of mr cuming better and more numerous specimens ibla and lithotrya are the only two recent genera in which the body of the animal is lodged within the peduncle but there is no distinction of any importance though useful for classification between the capitulum and peduncle and these two parts as we have seen tend to blend together in some species of conchoderma and alepas the entire absence of calcareous matter in the valves and spines of the peduncle at first appears very remarkable but we have seen a similar fact in alepas and there is an approach to it in some varieties of conchoderma aurita and c virgata in all four valves of ibla the umbones or centres of growth are at their upper points the horny spines on the peduncle are the analogues of the calcareous scales in scalpellum and pollicipes and in this latter genus two of the species have their scales almost cylindrical placed irregularly with new ones forming over all parts of the surface and not exclusively at the summitin which several respects there is an agreement with ibla the shape of the body i e thorax and prosoma pl iv fig 8 a´ is peculiar but it is only a slight exaggeration of what we have seen in several genera and shall meet again in some species of scalpellum the presence of hairs on the outer membrane of the prosoma is a peculiarity confined to this genus amongst the lepadidæ though observed in the sessile genus chthamalus the caudal appendages in the i quadrivalvis attain a greater length than in any other species of the family being four times the length of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus a far more important peculiarity is the fact of the oesophagus in both species running over or exteriorly to the adductor scutorum muscle instead of as in every other species close under this muscle i took great pains in ascertaining the truth of this singular anomaly the course of the oesophagus is approximately represented in pl iv fig 8 a´ by faint dotted lines the stomach has no cæca the biliary folds are longitudinal there is a marked constriction at the line corresponding with the junction of the thorax and prosoma there are no filamentary appendages  the generative system gives the chief interest to this genus we here first meet with males and females distinct and within the limits of this same restricted genus the far more wonderful fact of hermaphrodites whose masculine efficiency is aided by one or two complemental males the complemental and simple males closely resemble each other as do the female and hermaphrodite forms but under the two following species i enter into such full and minute details on these remarkable facts that i will not here dilate on them i may add that at the end of the genus scalpellum i give a summary of the facts and discuss the whole question the penis pl iv fig 9 a in the hermaphrodite i quadrivalvis is singular from the length of its unarticulated support and from the distinctness of the segments in the articulated portion  as ovigerous fræna occur in the usual place in i quadrivalvis though much smaller than in any other species i have no doubt that they occur in i cumingii although i failed in observing them the glands on the margin in i quadrivalvis are singular from not being borne on a long hairlike footstalk  affinitiesibla though externally very different in appearance from scalpellum is more nearly related to that genus than to any other in both genera some species have the sexes separate the imperfect males being parasitic on the female and other species are bisexual or hermaphrodite but aided by parasitic complemental males in scalpellum again the oesophagus pursues a sinuous course resembling that in ibla though it does not pass exteriorly to the adductor scutorum muscle the disc of the prehensile antennæ of the larva in both genera has an unusual oblong form like a mules hoof there is also an affinity between the two genera in the size and form of the ova in the prominent orifices of the olfactory cavities and in the peduncle not being naked though in these two latter respects in the structure of the cirri and in the multiarticulate caudal appendages there is an equal affinity to pollicipes and lithotrya i have already shown that alepas is likewise related to ibla   1 ibla cumingii pl iv fig 8  i foem

contain any calcareous matter they are extremely flat or thin and both pairs project freely like curved horns to a considerable height above the sack enclosing the body the terga project about twice as much as the scuta and their flat apices generally diverge a little the tips of the valves are frequently broken off their surfaces are plainly marked or ribbed by the layers of growth which are

thickly clothed with long cylindrical horns or spines of chitine these horns fig 8 c´ are not the analogues of the spines which are articulated on the external membranes of many pedunculated and sessile cirripedes but of the calcified scales on the peduncle of scalpellum and pollicipes for they pass through the membrane the underlying corium being marked by their bases and are persistent being added to like the valves during each successive period of growth their bases are concave so that a section of the layers of growth exhibits a series of pointed cones one within another each spine is nearly cylindrical irregularly curled and nodose or slightly enlarged at intervals the apex smooth and pointed the exterior surface longitudinally and finely ribbed like the valves the spines increase irregularly in size from the bottom to the top of the peduncle those at the carinal and rostral ends being generally the longest they point upwards and hide the bases of the valves they are not arranged symmetrically and new ones are formed over all parts of the peduncle they are formed of the same substance as the valves and do not contain any calcareous matter these horns are yellowish generally ringed with pale and dark blueish brown which on pressure becomes slightly opalescent with pale blue and fiery red sometimes only the upper horns are thus ringed and in rare instances all are simply yellowish the muscles of the peduncle run up to the bases of the four valves  surface of attachmentthe cement appears to proceed from only two points in some specimens a considerable length

the length of an average specimen including the peduncle and valves is about half an inch and the width across the widest part one fifth of an inch mr cuming has one specimen an inch in length but

i suspect to fill up a little interval between the outer maxillæ  cirri long little curved the first pair pl iv fig 8 a´ is situated at an extraordinary distance from the second hence its basal articulation is on a level with the upper articulation of the pedicel of the second cirrus in the three posterior cirri the segments are laterally very flat with their anterior surfaces not protuberant each supports three pairs of thin nonserrated bristles of which the second pair is much shorter than the upper and the lowest pair minute between each pair there is a minute rectangulary projecting bristle dorsal tufts consist of two or three spines of which one is longer than the others the two bristles forming each pair are not of equal length for in the rami of each cirrus the inner row of bristles is much shorter than the outer and this seems to be connected with the flatness of the whole animal and the consequent little power of divergence in the rami of the cirri the first cirrus is rather short with the rami unequal in length by about two segments the anterior ramus is shorter and thicker than the other segments numerous each clothed with several rows of bristles the second cirrus has the anterior ramus thicker and more thickly clothed with spines than the posterior ramus this latter is rather more thickly clothed with spines than are the three posterior cirri the third cirrus is in all these respects characterised like the second cirrus but in a lesser degree the pedicels of the second and third cirri are thickly and irregularly clothed with spines in the three posterior pairs the spines are placed in two regular rows with some minute intermediate spines  caudal appendages pl iv fig 8 a´ f multiarticulate thin tapering in one specimen equalling in another just exceeding in length the pedicels of the sixth cirrus in the latter specimen there were thirteen segments of which the basal segments were broader and shorter than the upper these latter are slightly constricted round the middle so that they resemble in a small degree an hourglass their upper margins are surrounded by rings of bristles the terminal segment being surmounted by one or two very fine bristles much longer than the others the two appendages are closely approximate each arises from a narrow elongated slip attached to the side of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus  nervous systemi examined the upper part of the nervous chord in order to ascertain whether the infraoesophagean ganglion which is of a globulooblong shape was far separated from the second ganglion and this i found to be the case in accordance with the distance of the first cirrus from the second i may here remark that in s quadrivalvis i discovered the eye which though in all probability really double appeared to be single it was situated near to the supraoesophageal ganglion and this ganglion was situated near to the adductor scutorum muscle and at a considerable distance from the labrum the aperture leading into the acoustic  sack is situated much lower down than is usual pl iv fig 8 a´ namely at the length of the pedicel of the first cirrus beneath its basal articulation  generative systemthe specimens here described of which i examined six are exclusively female they have no trace of the external probosciformed penis or of the two great vesiculæ seminales or of the testes on the other hand the ovarian tubes within the peduncle are developed in the usual manner and owing to the large size of the ova are of large diameter and hence very distinct i detected also the true ovaria at the upper edge of the stomach   male plate v figs 18  of the abovedescribed ibla cumingii i dissected six specimens four from the philippine archipelago47 and two from the burmah empire and none of them as we have just seen possessed the probosciformed penis the vesiculæ seminales or the testes so conspicuous in other cirripedes on the other hand all were furnished with the usual branching ovarian tubes and sometimes with ova and consequently were unquestionably of the female sex within each of these specimens there was attached within the sack in a nearly central line at the rostral end pl iv fig 8 a´ h magnified five times a flattened purplish wormlike little body projecting about the 120th of an inch in one of the six individuals there was a second similar little creature attached at the carinal end of the sack before giving the reasons which i think conclusively prove that these little animals are the males of the ordinary form of the ibla cumingii it will be convenient to describe their structure in detail     47 i am deeply indebted to the liberality and kindness of mr    cuming in allowing me to cut up four specimens of this new    species and to dr gould of boston u s for the examination    of the burmese specimens  the whole consists of a long much flattened peduncle separated from the mouth and thorax by an oblique fold pl v fig 1 h b which is conspicuous on the dorsal margin under the cirri and can be traced with difficulty to the ventral margin the thorax itself rudimentary and supporting rudimentary cirri is in some individuals as in the one represented fig 1 magnified 32 times covered by or received in the oblique fold h just mentioned in other individuals the thorax is drawn out and then the fold shows merely as a notch on the dorsal margin and the basal articulations of the cirri stand some little way above it the basal edge of the large welldeveloped month can be traced all round and on the ventral margin b is generally marked by a slight notch the dimensions and proportions vary much the longest specimen including the imbedded portion was 8100th and the shortest barely 5100ths of an inch in length the width of the widest portion varied from 1 to 2100ths of an inch the specimen figured pl iv fig 8 a´ and pl v fig 1 is a broad short individual generally the middle of the peduncle is rather wider than the upper part  pedunclethe main part of the animal as may be seen in the drawing consists of the peduncle of which the imbedded portion tapers more or less suddenly in a very variable manner and is of variable lengthin one specimen being one fourth of the entire length and in another consisting of a mere minute blunt point the free upper part of the animal is bent in various directions in relation to the imbedded portion the latter passes obliquely through the chitine membrane and corium lining the sack of the female and running along amidst the underlying muscles and inosculating fibrous tissue is attached to them by cement at the extremity the peduncle is often but not in the individual represented much constricted at the point where it passes through the skin of the female and generally at several other points especially towards the extremity see fig 1 the stages of its deeper and deeper imbedment being thus marked the constrictions are i believe simply due to the continued growth of the male whilst the hole through the membrane of the female does not yield the imbedment which is considerable only when the lower part of the peduncle is almost parallel to the coats of the sack seems caused by the growth and repeated exuviations of the female i believe that the larva attaches itself to the chitine tunic of the sack and that the cement by some unknown means affects the underlying corium so that this particular portion of the tunic is not moulted with the adjoining integuments and that the growth of the surrounding parts subsequently causes this portion to be buried deeper and deeper it is i believe in the same way as the end of the peduncle in conchoderma aurita sometimes becomes imbedded in the skin of the whale to which it is attached  the outer tunic of the peduncle is thin and structureless in the fold fig 1 h under the cirri there is a central triangular gusset of still thinner membrane corresponding in position to the membrane connecting the two terga in the female and there subjected to much movement i may here remark that this fold in its office of slightly protecting the thorax and in its position evidently represents the capitulum with its valves enclosing the whole body of the female the outer tunic is lined by corium mottled with purple and within this there are two layers of striæless muscles transverse and longitudinal as in all pedunculated cirripedes the corium extends some way into the imbedded portion of the peduncle and consequently the outer tunic there continues to be added to layer under layer and as it cannot be periodically moulted it becomes much thicker than in the upper free part of the animal the corium however does not extend to the extreme point so that in it growth of all kind ceases  antennæthe peduncle terminates pl v fig 1 e in the two usual larval prehensile antennæ which it is very difficult to see distinctly they are tolerably well represented in fig 5 greatly magnified their extreme length measured from the basal articulation to the tip of the hooflike disc is 226000ths of an inch the disc itself being 76000ths of an inch the disc is slightly narrower than the long basal segment from which it is divided by a broad conspicuous articulation its lower surface is flat and its upper convex altogether resembling in shape a mules hoof its apex is fuzzy with the finest down it bears a narrow ultimate segment thrown as usual on one side this segment supports on its rounded irregular summit at least five i believe judging from the structure of the same part in the male larva of ibla quadrivalvis six or seven spines longer than the segment itself one long spine arises from the under side of the disc near the base of the ultimate segment and points backward there is also a single curved spine on the outside near the distal end of the basal segment these organs were imbedded in a heartshaped ball or cylinder of brown transparent finely laminated cement and thus attached to the fibrous tissue of the female the two cementducts fig 1 f were very plain each about 16000th of an inch in diameter containing the usual inner chord of opaque cellular matter i traced them at the one end into the prehensile antennæ as far as the disc and at the other up the peduncle for about one fourth of its length where i lost them and could not discover with certainty any cement glands i may however here mention that i found in the lower half of the peduncle numerous yellowish transparent excessively minute pyramidal bodies with stepformed sides of these two or three often cohered by their bases like crystals i have never seen anything like these in other cirripedes but it has occurred to me that they may possibly be connected with the formation of the cement for in the last larval condition of lepas the cementducts run up to the gutformed ovaria filled at this period with yellowish grapelike cellular masses without the intervention of cement glands and i can imagine that similar masses not being developed into functional ovaria might give rise to the yellow pyramidal bodies  mouththe mouth is well developed it is represented as seen vertically from above in pl v fig 2 magnified about 60 times the positions of the cirri and the outline of the thorax are accurately shown by dotted lines a lateral view is given in fig 1 in the specimen figured the longitudinal diameter of the mouth including the labrum was 5400th of an inch the muscles of the several trophi have transverse striæ and are the strongest and most conspicuous of any in the body the labrum is largely bullate with its summit slightly concave the trophi are arranged in a remarkable manner in a semicircular line so as to be opposed to the labrum rather than to each other there are no teeth or spines on the crest of the labrum which overhangs the oesophageal cavity  the palpi fig 2 b and fig 3 are very small dark purple bluntly pointed with a few small bristles at the point they do not extend beyond the knob at each corner of the labrum which is here present as in all other lepadidæ they are much smaller than in the female though of a similar shape and consequently their points are much further apart within their bases the lateral muscles of the mandibles are as usual attached they are represented in fig 3 as seen from the inside with the eye on a level with the concave summit of the labrum the rudimentary condition of the palpi is connected as remarked under the anelasma squalicola with the absence of efficient cirri  the mandibles fig 7 are well developed they so closely resemble those of the female that it is superfluous to describe them they are however smoother without any trace of the teeth being pectinated and with the inferior point smaller measured in their longer direction they are 72000th of an inch in length and therefore a little less than one third of the size of those of the female these organs have the usual muscles well developed and the usual articulations  the maxillæ fig 8 have a rather rudimentary appearance yet they have the same size relatively to the mandibles as in the female the spinose edge being 32000ths of an inch in length these organs resemble to a certain extent those of the female differing from them in being less prominentin the outline being more rounded with the notches even less distinctand in the spines being fewer the apodeme is short and broad  the outer maxillæ fig 6 are pointed with a small tuft of bristles at the apex they are much less hairy than in the female but have nearly the same unusual shape outside their bases and between them and the inner maxillæ the two welldeveloped tubular flattened squaretopped olfactory orifices project in exactly the same remarkable position as in the female these are not represented in fig 2 though sometimes they can be very distinctly seen when the mouth is viewed from vertically above  thorax and cirrithe thorax is in a rudimentary condition i did not observe the usual articulations the whole as seen from vertically above is of small size compared with the mouth the outline is accurately shown by dotted lines in tab 5 fig 2 together with the positions of the two pair of cirri the caudal appendages and anus the posterior end of the thorax does not rise to the level of the summit of the mouth and the thorax seems of no service excepting perhaps as a sort of outer lip to protect the mouth the cirri are in an extreme state of abortion and evidently functionless they are lined with purplish corium without the vestige of a muscle they are usually distorted and bent in different directions they vary in size and even those on opposite sides of the same individual sometimes do not correspond and do not arise from exactly corresponding points of the thorax there are always two pair of cirri which as i conclude from the position of the excretory orifices answer to the fifth and sixth pair in other cirripedes each cirrus fig 4 usually carries only one ramus placed on a large basal segment evidently corresponding to the pedicel of a normal cirrus the posterior are larger than the anterior cirri which latter spring from points a little lower down on the thorax in the posterior cirrus figured the great basal articulation or pedicel almost equals in length and much exceeds in thickness the four segments of the ramus these segments are furnished on their upper dorsal edges with little brushes of spines but have not even a trace of the normally larger and far more important anterior spines in one specimen the anterior cirrus had a large pedicel carrying three segments like those of the posterior pair but in another specimen one of the three segments showed traces of being divided into two thus making four imperfect segments whilst on the corresponding side of this same individual there were only two illformed segments with their few spines differently arranged again in a third specimen the great basal segment of the anterior cirrus on one side bore exteriorly to the usual ramus a single segment furnished with bristles and evidently representing a second ramus thus showing that the great basal segment certainly answers to a pedicel i may here add that on the integuments of these cirri i observed with a high power the serrated scalelike appearance common in other cirripedes directly between the bases of the sixth cirrus there is a very minute papillus which under the highest power can be seen to consist of two closely approximate flattened points these i have no doubt are the caudal appendages in an extremely rudimentary condition for i traced the vesiculæ seminales to this exact spot close outside these rudimentary points on a slight swelling is the anus it will presently be seen that in the male of the closely allied ibla quadrivalvis the nature of these caudal appendages admits of no doubt for in this species they consist of more than one segment are spinose and close under them towards the mouth there is a perfectly distinct papillus representing the usual probosciformed penis  alimentary canalthe oesophagus is very narrow and of remarkable length from the orifice under the mandibles it first runs back in this respect not well represented in pl v fig 1 under the bullate labrum and then straight down the peduncle where it terminates in the usual bellshaped expansion entering one side of the small globular stomach the latter at its lower end is slightly constricted and then is rather abruptly upturned the rectum is of unparalleled length and extremely narrow it can be best detected after the dissolution by caustic potash of the softer parts when its inner coat of chitine can be seen to be continuous in the ordinary manner with the outer integuments of the thorax the anus as already stated is seated on a slight swelling and consists of a small longitudinal slit f fig 2 placed close outside the two very minute caudal appendages  organ of sightin all the specimens a little below the fold separating the mouth from the peduncle and near the abdominal or rostral edge a black ball c fig 1 about 11000th of an inch in diameter is conspicuous when dissected out it is somewhat conical in form and appears to consist of an outer coat with a layer of pigmentcells of a dark purple colour surrounding a transparent rather hard lens apparently leaving a circular orifice at the summit and forming a short tube at the base surrounding what i believe to be a nerve i was not able to perceive that this eye consisted of two eyes united which the analogy of other cirripedes makes me suppose probable although in the ordinary and hermaphrodite ibla quadrivalvis the eye also appeared single it is seated under the two transparent muscular layers close upon the upper end of the stomach and this is the exact position as stated in the introductory discussion p 49 in which the eyes of pedunculated cirripedes are commonly situated  generative systemwithin the muscular layer all round the upper part of the peduncle and surrounding the stomach there are numerous little rather irregular globular balls with brown granular centres so closely resembling the testes in other cirripedes though of smaller size that i cannot doubt that this is their nature they were much plainer larger and more numerous in some specimens than in others the vesiculæ seminales can seldom be made distinctly out but having cut one specimen transversely across the thorax they were as plain as could be desired lying parallel and close to each other above the rectum the animal being in the position as drawn and therefore in their normal situation each had a diameter four times as great as that of the rectum in this individual the contents seemed whether from decomposition or state of development or from my not having used high enough power i know not merely pulpy but i have since found in another specimen masses of the most distinct spermatozoa with the usual little knots on them associated with numerous cells about as large as and resembling those which i have examined in living cirripedes and from which i have every reason to believe the spermatozoa are developed the vesiculæ seminales unite and terminate under the two extremely minute caudal appendages and here i think i saw an orifice but there is certainly no projecting probosciformed penis  having dissected the six specimens with the utmost care and having scrupulously examined the ovaria in other cirripedes during their early stages of development even before the exuviation of the larval locomotive organs and in specimens of smaller size than the male ibla i am prepared to assert that there are no ovaria and that these little creatures are exclusively males it should be borne in mind that in some of the specimens there were perfect spermatozoa in the vesiculæ seminales as likewise in some of the males of i quadrivalvis and therefore if these individuals had been hermaphrodites their ova would have been at this period well developed and ready for impregnation in this state it is almost impossible that they could have been overlooked moreover it is probable that such ova would not have been very small for the larvæ whence the parasitic males are derived attain as might have been inferred from the known dimensions of their prehensile antennæ and as we shall show actually is the case in i quadrivalvis the size common amongst ordinary cirripedia  concluding remarksthat these animals are true cirripedes though having so different an external appearance from others of the class admits of not the least doubt the prehensile antennæ enveloped in cement and including the two cementducts would have been amply sufficient without other partsfor instance the mouth by itself perfectly characteristic with each organ together with the whole alimentary canal constructed on the normal planto have proved that they were cirripedia under the head of the closelyallied ibla quadrivalvis we shall moreover see that the males are developed from larvæ having every point of structurethe peculiar quasibivalve shell the two compound eyes the six natatory legs ccharacteristic of the order but in some respects the males are in an embryonic condition though unquestionably mature as shown by the spermatozoathus in the thorax and mouth opening throughout their whole width into the cavity of the peduncle that is homologically into the anterior part of the head and in the viscera being there lodged instead of in the thorax and prosoma there is a manifest resemblance to the larva in its last stage of development the absence of a probosciformed penis the spineless peduncle the food being obtained without the aid of cirri and the length of the rectum are likewise embryonic characters not only are these males as just remarked cirripedia but they manifestly belong to the pedunculated family if a specimen had been brought to me to class without relation to its sexual characters i should have placed it without any hesitation next to the genus ibla if the mouth alone had been brought i should assuredly have placed it actually in the genus ibla for let it be observed how nearly all the parts resemble those of ibla cumingii excepting only in size and in being less hairy the trophi are arranged in the same peculiar position as in the female the labrum is largely bullate without teeth on the crest the palpi though relatively smaller are of the same shape so are the mandibles the maxillæ are more rounded and less prominent but have the same exact size relatively to the mandibles the outer maxillæ have the same quite peculiar pointed outline and the olfactory orifices are tubular and hold the same unusual position it is most rare to find so close a resemblance in the parts of the mouth except in very closely allied genera and often species of the same natural genus differ more again in the long oesophagus and constricted stomach there is a resemblance to ibla in the male of ibla quadrivalvis the caudal appendages are multiarticulate now this is a character confined to four genera namely ibla alepas pollicipes and lithotrya i may add that large tubular olfactory orifices are confined to the same genera together with scalpellum lastly it particularly deserves notice that the prehensile antennæ in having a hooflike and pointed disc with a single spine on the heel much more closely resemble these organs in scalpellum certainly the nearest ally of ibla than in any other genus they differ from the antennæ in scalpellum only in the ultimate segment not having a notch on one side these organs unfortunately for the sake of comparison were not found in the female and ordinary form of ibla the full importance of the above generic resemblance in the antennæ will hereafter be more clearly seen when their classificatory value is shown in the final discussion on the sexual relations of ibla and scalpellum  here then we have a pedunculated cirripede very much nearer in all its essential characters to ibla than to any other genus and exclusively of the male sex and this cirripede in six specimens from two distant localities adhered to an ibla exclusively of the female sex may we not then safely conclude that these parasites are the males of the ibla cumingii considering that in the same class with the cirripedia there is a whole family of crustaceans the lerneidæ in which the males compared with the females to which they cling differ as much in appearance as in ibla and are even relatively smaller i should not have added another remark had there not been under the head of the following species and of the next genus scalpellum a class of allied facts to be advanced which in some respects support the view here taken but in others are so remarkable and so hard to be believed that i will call attention to the alternative if the above view be rejected the ordinary ibla cumingii must have a male for that it is not an hermaphrodite can hardly be questioned seeing how easy it always is to detect the male organs of generation and we must consequently believe in the visits of a locomotive male though the existence of a locomotive cirripede is improbable in the highest degree again as the little animal considered by me to be the male of i cumingii is exclusively a male for there were no traces of ova or ovaria though the spermatozoa were perfect we must believe in a locomotive cirripede of the opposite sex though the existence in any class of a female visiting a fixed male is unknown48 in short we should have hypothetically to make two locomotive cirripedes which in all probability would differ as much from their fixed opposite sexes as does the cirripede considered by me to be the male of i cumingii from the ordinary form this being the case i conclude that the evidence is amply sufficient to prove that the little parasitic cirripede here described is the male of ibla cumingii     48 it deserves notice that in the class crustacea both in the    lerneidæ and in the cirripedia the males more closely resemble    the larvæ than do the females whereas amongst insects as in    the case of the glowworm in coleoptera and of certain nocturnal    lepidoptera it is the female which retains an embryonic    character being wormlike or caterpillarlike without wings    but in all these cases the male is more locomotive than the    female  if we look for analogies to the facts here given we shall find them in the lerneidæ already alluded to but in these the males are not permanently attached to the females only cling i believe to them voluntarily the extraordinary case of the hectocotyle originally described as a worm parasitic on certain cephalopoda but now shown by kölliker to be the male of the species to which it is attached is perhaps more strictly parallel so again in the entozoic worm the heteroura androphora the sexes cohere but are essentially distinct this singular species however according to professor owen49 offers the transitional grade to that still more extraordinary entozoon the syngamus trachealis in which the male is organically blended by its caudal extremity with the female immediately anterior to the slitshaped aperture of the vulva by this union a kind of hermaphroditism is produced but the male apparatus is furnished with its own peculiar nutrient system and an individual animal is constituted distinct in every respect save in its terminal confluence with the body of the female this condition of animal life which was conceived by hunter as within the circle of physiological possibilities has hitherto been exemplified only in the single species of entozoon the discovery of the true nature of which is due to the sagacity and patient research of dr c th von siebold in ibla the males and females are not organically united but only permanently and immovably attached to each other we have in this genus the additional singularity of occasionally two males parasitic on one female     49 cyclopædia of anatomy and physiology p 142  i have used the term parasitic which perhaps ought strictly to be confined to cases where one creature derives its nutriment from another inasmuch as the male is invariably and permanently attached to and imbedded in the femalefrom its being protected by her capitulum so that its own capitulum is not developedand from its feeding on minute animals infesting her sack the male ibla must seize its prey guided probably by its welldeveloped olfactory organs through the movement of its long flexible body furnished with muscles and with the mouth seated on the summit we have already seen one instance of a cirripede the anelasma obtaining its food without the aid of cirri by means of its probosciformed flexible mouth the eye can serve only to announce to the male when the female opens her valves allowing occasionally some minute prey to enter in ordinary cirripedes the penis is long articulated and capable of varied movements i presume for the purpose of impregnating each separate ovum the male ibla has no such organ and no doubt the whole body furnished like the penis with longitudinal and transverse muscles serves the same purpose i may remark that it seems surprising that so small a male should secrete sufficient semen to impregnate the ova of the female but the ova are not nearly so numerous in ibla as in most genera of cirripedes and the smallness of the males in some parasitic crustacea has already been alluded to the male must always be younger than the female for the latter must first grow large enough for the larva of the male to crawl into her sack whether the male lives as long as the female i know not but he certainly lives for a considerable period and increases in size as shown by the depth to which the end of the peduncle is imbedded moreover we shall see under the next species that the male is metamorphosed from a larva not one sixth of its own size  in the male ibla abortion has been carried to an extraordinary and i should think almost unparalleled extent of the twentyone segments believed to be normally present in every crustacean or of the seventeen known to be present in cirripedes the three anterior segments are here well developed forming the peduncle the mouth consists as usual of three small segments the succeeding eight segments are represented by the rudimentary and functionless thorax supporting only two pair of distorted rudimentary and functionless cirri the seven segments of the abdomen have disappeared with the exception of the excessively minute caudal appendages so that of the twentyone normal segments fifteen are more or less aborted the state of the cirri is curious and may be compared to that of the anthers in a semidouble flower for they are not simply rudimentary in size and function but they are monstrous and generally do not even correspond on opposite sides of the same individual as males in other classes of the animal kingdom often retain some female characters so here though the case is not strictly analogous50 the male possesses the cementing apparatus which homologically is part of an ovarian tube modified     50 certain plants offer a closer though not perfect analogy    thus in the florets of some compositous flowers the pistil    besides its proper female functional end serves to brush the    pollen off the anthers while in the florets of some other    compositæ see the account of silphium in ch k sprengel das    entdeckte geheimniss der natur the pistil is functionless for    its proper end the flower being exclusively male but its style    is developed and still serves as a brush so in the male ibla    part of the ovaria in a modified condition is still present    and serves as a cementing apparatus  the individuals in every other genus with the exception of scalpellum in the several families in the three orders of cirripedia are hermaphrodite or bisexual why then is ibla unisexual yet becoming in the most paradoxical manner from its earliest youth essentially bisexual would food have been deficient and was the seizure of infusoria by another and differently constructed individual necessary for the support of the male and female organs the orifice of the sack of the female is unusually narrow would the presence of testes and vesiculæ seminales have rendered her thorax and prosoma inconveniently thick seeing the analogous facts in the six differentlyconstructed species of the allied genus scalpellum i infer there must be some profounder and more mysterious final cause   2 ibla quadrivalvis pl iv fig 9    anatifa quadrivalvis cuvier mém pour servir  mollusq         1817 art

slightly more hollowed out and the fold on the upper free and hornlike portion rather deeper  the terga viewed internally have the apex of the growing or coriumcovered surface higher relatively to the scuta than in i cumingii and the basal angle is much broader owing to the lower carinal margin being much more protuberant than the scutal margin the spines on the peduncle are all yellowishbrown and are rather longer than in i cumingii i observed in three or four specimens that the lowest part of the peduncle had become internally filled up with the usual brown transparent laminated cement cone within cone so that this lower part was rendered rigid and sticklike this latter effect i apprehend is the object gained by the formation of cement within the peduncle of which i have not observed any other instance the entire length of the largest specimen was one inch some other specimens were only half this size  the thorax and prosoma are of the same shape as in i cumingii and in the largest specimen about one tenth of an inch square the prosoma as in that species is hairy in the mouth all the parts are closely similar to those of i cumingii but one third larger the crest of the labrum is a little roughened with minute points the palpi are squarer and blunter at their extremities the mandibles have their second and third teeth nearly equal in size to the first and they do not appear pectinated the maxillæ have their spinose edge very nearly straight the outer maxillæ are pointed the olfactory orifices are similarly situated and of similar shape they are dark coloured  cirrithese

than broad each has a few short bristles round its upper margin the terminal segment has a circular brush of bristles the vesiculæ seminales are easily seen though they are narrow they are slightly tortuous they enter the prosoma and lie on each side of the stomach their outer case has a ringed structure but is not fibrous the contents in the best specimen consisted of a mass of spermatozoa which i saw with perfect distinctness the testes are unusually large and eggshaped  ova spherical 5400ths of an inch in diameter united as usual into two ovigerous lamellæ the ovigerous fræna are extraordinarily small and might be very easily overlooked their length in a fullsized specimen was only 7400ths of an inch and they projected only 2400ths from the inner surface of the sack the glands on their margin to which the lamellæ adhere are pointed oval with an extremely short footstalk and that rather thick the entire length of gland and footstalk being only 23000ths of an inch the larvæ in their first stage of development offer the usual characters and closely resemble those of scalpellum the probosciformed mouth however is remarkably prominent and the limbs unusually thick  affinitiesthis species most closely resembles i cumingii and cannot be distinguished externally except by the absence of the blue colour on the marginal and interior portions of the valves and this can hardly be ascertained without separating and cleaning them owing to the blueness of the underlying corium internally some slight differences may be perceived in the form of the valves considering these so slight differences it is highly remarkable that this species should be hermaphrodite whilst i cumingii is unisexual there is a greater though still slight difference in the included animals body the palpi in i quadrivalvis are blunter the mandibles smoother the olfactory orifices darkercoloured the rami of the first cirrus more unequal the spines more numerous on the segments of the posterior cirri and lastly and most conspicuously the caudal appendages are very much longer relatively to the length of the sixth cirrus than in ibla cumingii   complemental male  i have examined one specimen of the hermaphrodite i quadrivalvis preserved in spirits from kangaroo island and one dry from adelaide both places in south australia and four from an unknown locality purchased from mr sowerby and within five out of these six specimens males were attached in one of them two males of different ages were included one adhering to the peduncle of the other in i cumingii also it may be remembered there was a case of two males parasitic on one female i may add that i opened another quite young specimen from adelaide not counted with the above and it was without a male the males in the five specimens were attached low down at the rostral end almost in a horizontal position stretching across the bottom of the sack one of them however was placed considerably on one side one individual which i measured was 16100ths of an inch in length and 5100ths in width in the widest part namely about half down the peduncle i may state for the sake of comparison that the hermaphrodite to which this individual was attached was including the peduncle and capitulum one inch in length that is six times as long as the male and one fifth of an inch in width that is four times as wide the above measurements show that the male of this species is rather more than twice as large as that of i cumingii in consequence of this greater size i dissected with the utmost care the one specimen which was excellently preserved in spirits and found every part with a few exceptions so exactly the same as in the male of i cumingii only larger and more conspicuous that it will be sufficient to indicate the few points of difference  the most conspicuous difference is that the oblique fold separating the thorax and peduncle is more plainly developed projecting at the point corresponding to h in fig 1 pl v 81000ths of an inch in the middle the fold is notched it can be traced more easily than in i cumingii running beneath and parallel to the basal edge of the mouth to the ventral margin of the body in the mouth there is hardly any difference the maxillæ however have two notches even plainer than in the hermaphrodite i quadrivalvis or than in the male i cumingii but the depth of such notches is always a variable character there are also more spines on the edge in the male of the present species than in i cumingii both mandibles and maxillæ in the male i quadrivalvis are larger than in the male i cumingii to a greater degree than the larger proportional size of the body in the former will account for and this likewise is the case with these same organs in the hermaphrodite i quadrivalvis compared with the female i cumingii the tubular olfactory orifices are situated in the same peculiar position as in the hermaphrodite and as in both sexes of i cumingii they are 1500th of an inch in diameter and about as thick as one of the lower segments in the rami of the sixth cirrus  the thorax as in the male of i cumingii is quite rudimentary and serves as a mere flap to protect the mouth in the three specimens carefully examined the posterior cirri had each only one ramus whilst the anterior cirri generally had two in one specimen one of the rami in the anterior cirrus was formed of five segments and the other ramus of three segments both rami being supported on a uniarticulated pedicel but on the opposite side of the same individual the anterior cirrus was represented by a mere knob the longer ramus of the anterior cirrus in the bestdeveloped individual barely exceeded in length the mandibles measured along the line of the teeth in one specimen between the bases of the posterior cirri there were two perfectly distinct caudal appendages these like the cirri are in a quite rudimentary condition one was 51000ths of an inch in length and consisted of three segments the upper edges of which had short spines the other was shorter uniarticulated but spinose in a second specimen these appendages were quite aborted close under them on the inside or towards the mouth that is in the normal position there was a rudimentary but quite distinct penis with the apex projecting freely and with the sides distinguishable from the ventral surface of the thorax for the length of 11000th of an inch the corium lining this little penis made the terminal orifice plainly visible the vesiculæ seminales lie in the usual position and are conspicuous they are slightly tortuous with their ends blunt in the specimen so well preserved in spirits they were filled with a mass of spermatozoa perfectly distinct and the whole cavity of the body was lined with globular and pearshaped testes assuredly there was no vestige of ovarian tubes from the greater size and excellent preservation of this specimen which rendered the examination of the generative system so easy i was able to examine the contents of the stomach in which i found the delicate epithelial coat separated as usual and containing cellular matter on which the animal had preyed but the nature of which i was unable to make out the anus was much plainer than in the male of i cumingii i saw the eye distinctly i could not distinguish the orifices of the acoustic  sacks and i think i should have seen them if they had existed  prehensile antennæi examined these in the larvæ presently to be mentioned and therefore they were in better condition than in the mature animal when cemented their total length measured along the outside from the basal articulation to the end of the disc is 326000ths or 336000ths of an inchthat is one third longer than in i cumingii whilst the hooflike disc itself is 86000ths or only 16000th of an inch longer than this same part in i cumingii the apex of the disc is downy or bears some excessively minute spines the ultimate segment has its end irregularly rounded with the spines obscurely divided into two groups the outer group consisting of two or three longer and thinner spines and the inner group of as i believe five rather shorter spines the longer spines equal in length the whole ultimate segment i could not perceive that they were plumose as in many other genera a single rather thicker and long spine pointing backwards is attached to the under side of the disc nearly opposite to the point where the ultimate segment is articulated on the upper convex surface another single curved spine is attached on the outer side of the basal segment near its distal end  development of the malein the specimen before alluded to which included two males one of these was only the 301000ths of an inch in length and therefore between one fifth and one sixth of the size of the mature male it had probably undergone only one exuviation since its metamorphosis for the larva is nearly as long namely 251000ths of an inch in this young male the mouth formed one third of the entire length it was attached not as in every other case to the sack of the hermaphrodite but low down to the peduncle of the other male  in the sack with these two males there were certainly four i believe five larvæ which in every main point of structure resembled the larvæ of other pedunculated cirripedes from the peculiar form of their prehensile antennæ differing in no respect except in the proportional lengths of the segments from the same organ in the male i cumingii i can feel no doubt that these were the larvæ of the male i quadrivalvisfor a moments reflection will show how excessively improbable it is that several larvæ of some other cirripede and that a cirripede intimately allied to the parasitic male ibla should have forced themselves without any apparent object into the sack of the hermaphrodite ibla the larvæ though not yet attached were on the point of attachment so that the single eye of the mature animal could be distinctly seen lying near to the two great compound eyes of the larva we have also just seen that one male quite recently here had undergone its metamorphosis the larvæ are 251000ths of an inch in length and rather more than 101000ths in width in the widest part they are boatshaped the dorsal edge forming the keel of the boat the anterior end is only a little blunter than the posterior end the quasibivalve carapace is smooth all the essential points of structure in the larvæ of other cirripedes at this stage could be distinctly here seensuch as the two compound eyes with the apodemes to which they are attached and the two oblong sternal plates whence the apodemes springthe adductor musclethe six natatory legs with long plumose spinesthe abdomen with its three small segments and the caudal appendagesthe prehensile antennæ already describedand lastly the two little auditory sacks at the anterosternal edges of the carapace but not so near the anterior extremity as in lepas the four or five larvæ after having undergone in the open sea the several preparatory metamorphoses common to the class must have voluntarily entered the sack of the hermaphrodite ultimately would they on finding two males already attached there have retired and sought another individual less well provided or would they all have remained and so formed a polyandrous establishment such as we shall presently see occurs sometimes in scalpellum this must remain quite uncertain  in this same hermaphrodite specimen of i quadrivalvis the two ovigerous lamellæ contained some hundreds of larvæ in the first stage of development which were liberated from their enveloping membranes by a touch of a needle they were about the 161000ths of an inch in length and presented all the usual characters of larvæ at this period what a truly wonderful assemblage of beings of the same species but how marvellously unlike in appearance did this individual hermaphrodite present we have the numerous almost globular larvæ with lateral horns to their carapaces with their three pair of legs single eye probosciformed mouth and long tailwe have the somewhat larger larvæ in the last stage of development much compressed boatformed with their two great compound eyes curious prehensile antennæ closed rudimentary mouth and six natatory legs so different from those in the first stagewe have the two attached males with their bodies reduced almost to a mouth placed on the summit of a peduncle with a minute apparently single eye shining through the integuments without any carapace or capitulum and with the thorax as well as the legs or cirri rudimentary and functionlesslastly we have the hermaphrodite with all its complicated organisation its thorax supporting six pairs of multiarticulated twoarmed cirri and its welldeveloped capitulum furnished with horny valves surrounding this wonderful assemblage of beings unquestionably without a rigid examination these four forms would have been ranked in different families if not orders of the articulated kingdom  concluding remarksif the creature which i have considered as the male of ibla cumingii be really so and the evidence formerly given seems to me amply conclusive then the animal just described from its close affinity in every point of structure with the former assuredly is the male of ibla quadrivalvis but feeling strongly how improbable it is that an additional or complemental male should be associated with an hermaphrodite i will make a few remarks on the only possible hypothesis if my view be rejectednamely that the two parasites considered by me to be exclusively males are not so but are independent hermaphrodite cirripedes the female organs and ova which if present would have been nearly mature judging from the presence of spermatozoa in both species having been overlooked by me in every specimen and again that in the animal described as the female i cumingii i have though minutely dissecting several specimens and finding far smaller parts such as the organs of sense and nervous system entirely overlooked all the conspicuous male organs though when i came to i quadrivalvis and naturally expected to find it likewise exclusively female a single glance showed me the great probosciformed penis and by the simplest dissection the vesiculæ seminales and testes were exhibited such an oversight is scarcely credible but even if assumed we have to believe in the extraordinary circumstance of the two parasites being species of an independent genus not only the very next in alliance to the animals to which they are attached but in certain most important points namely the organs of the mouth actually deserving a place in the very same genus moreover the two parasites differ from each other not only in about the same slight degree but in a corresponding manner as do the two iblas to which they are attached thus the mouths of ibla quadrivalvis and i cumingii are closely similar the difference being barely of specific value so are the mouths of the two parasites but the parts are larger in the hermaphrodite i quadrivalvis than in i cumingii so are they in the parasites again the most conspicuous character in i quadrivalvis is the number of segments in the caudal appendages far exceeding those in the other species of ibla as well as of every other pedunculated cirripede and the parasite of this species has articulated spinose appendages far larger than the barely visible nonarticulated pair in i cumingii  considering the whole case there seems no room to doubt the justness of the conclusion arrived at under the former as well as under the present species namely that these little parasites are the males of the two species of ibla to which they are attachedwonderful though the fact be that in one case the male should pair with an hermaphrodite already provided with efficient male organs it is to bring this fact prominently forward that i have called such males complemental males as they seem to form the complement to the male organs in the hermaphrodite we look in vain for any as yet known analogous facts in the animal kingdom in the genus scalpellum however next in alliance to ibla in which consequently if anywhere we might expect to find such facts they occur and until these are fully considered i hope the conclusions here arrived at will not be summarily rejected although the existence of hermaphrodites and males within the limits of the same species is a new fact amongst animals it is far from rare in the vegetable kingdom the male flowers moreover are sometimes in a rudimentary condition compared to the hermaphrodite flowers exactly in the same manner as are the male iblas if the final cause of the existence of these complemental males be asked no certain answer can be given the vesiculæ seminales in the hermaphrodite of ibla quadrivalvis appeared to be of small diameter but on the other hand the ova to be impregnated are fewer than in most cirripedes no explanation as we have seen can be given of the much simpler case of the mere separation of the sexes in ibla cumingii nor can any explanation i believe be given of the much more varied arrangement of the parts of

short and distinct or confounded with the capitulum sometimes mouth and stomach absent and cirri nonprehensile sometimes mouth and cirri normal      generally attached to horny corallines in the warmer temperate     seas over the whole world  i have felt much doubt in limiting this genus the six recent species which it contains differ more from each other than do the species in the previous genera mr gray has proposed or adopted generic names for four of the species and a fifth certainly has equal claims to this same rank these genera have been founded almost exclusively on the number of the valves and oddly enough the numbers have generally been given wrongly namely in scalpellum calantica thaliella and xiphidium scalpellum blends through s villosum into pollicipes and this latter genus has an equal right with scalpellum to be divided into subgenera three in number hence no less than eight genera might be made out of the twelve recent species of scalpellum and pollicipes and their formation in some degree be justified but in my opinion this inordinate multiplication of genera destroys the main advantages of classification at one time i even thought that it would be best to follow lamarck and keep the twelve recent species in one genus but considering the number of fossil species i believe the more prudent course has been followed in retaining the two genera scalpellum and pollicipes more especially as i can hardly doubt that several other species will be hereafter discovered  having so lately described in the memoirs of the palæontographical society the fossil species i will not here further allude to them than to state that out of the fifteen species therein described s magnum comes very close to the recent s vulgare and that several eocene and cretaceous species such as s quadratum s fossula and s maximum are allied to s rutilum and s ornatum scalpellum villosum a recent species has stronger claims than any other species to be generically separated and its habits in not being attached to horny corallines are also different but the identity of its complemental male with that of s peronii and its numerous points of resemblance in structure with the other species have determined me not to separate it scalpellum peronii villosum and rostratum in having a subcarinain the rostrum being pretty well developedand in the complemental male being pedunculated and furnished with a functional mouth and prehensile cirri may be separated from s vulgare ornatum and rutilum but even between these two little groups s rostratum is in some respects intermediate namely in having three pairs of latera and more especially in the rudimentary condition of the valves of its complemental male and in the position in which the male is attached to the hermaphrodite the three species in the second little group namely s vulgare s ornatum and s rutilum are more nearly allied to each other in all their characters especially in the characters drawn from their males than are the other three species s ornatum and s rutilum are considerably nearer to each other than any other two of the species upon the whole i conclude that the six species must be thrown either into five or into four genera the first three species making one genus or all into one genus and this latter has appeared to me the preferable course the separation even of scalpellum and pollicipes as already stated is hardly natural the fact of these genera having existed from a remote epoch and having given rise during successive periods to many species now extinct is probably the cause that the few remaining species are so much more distinct from each other than is common in the other genera of lepadidæ whenever the structure of the whole capitulum in the fossil species is well known and as soon as more species recent and fossil shall have been discovered then probably the genus scalpellum will have to be divided into several smaller genera  descriptionthe capitulum is much compressed and generally produced upwards it is formed of from twelve to fifteen valves which are rather thin and with the exception of s ornatum almost entirely covered by membrane bearing spines the valves are seldom locked very closely together a subrostrum exists only in s villosum which species leads on to pollicipes in s vulgare the rostrum is rudimentary and hidden the scuta terga and carina are much larger than the other valves these five valves seem to differ essentially from the others in being at first developed under the form of the socalled primordial valves the other valves commence by a small indistinct brown spot very different from the hexagonal tissue of the primordial valves i saw this very clearly in young specimens of s vulgare at first the scuta terga and carina grow exclusively downwards and permanently so in most fossil species and therefore the growth of the scuta and carina is in an absolutely opposite direction to what it is in lepas pæcilasma and dichelaspis after a short period the scuta are added to at their upper ends the portion thus added stands at a rather lower level and projects in a rather different direction from the firstformed part of the valve giving to it in some respects the appearance of having been broken and mended this structure is common to s vulgare s rostratum and s peronii the upper latera except in s villosum grow in the same manner namely at first exclusively downwards and then both upwards and downwards the rostral and carinal latera with the same exception of s villosum have their umbones seated laterally at opposite ends of the capitulumthe umbones of the rostral latera being close to the rostrum and those of the carinal pair close to the carina and consequently their chief growth is directed towards each other the carina in all the species except s villosum is either bowed or angularly bent in the latter case the lower half is parallel to the peduncle and the upper half extending far up between the terga is parallel to their longer axes in some of the species the carina is added to almost equally at both ends in s ornatum it grows but little at the upper end and to a varying degree in different individuals according to their age in s rutilum the umbo is at the apex and there is consequently no upward growth lastly in s villosum the carina widening much from the apex to the basal margin grows exclusively downwards and a portion of the apex projects freelycharacters all common to the carina in the genus pollicipes the upper latera occur in all the species in the lower whorl there are either two or three pair of latera in the former case the inframedian pair being absent the latera differ considerably in shape in the different species  the peduncle is generally rather short and with the exception of s peronii is covered with calcified scales these scales are generally small and placed symmetrically in close whorls in an imbricated order with each scale corresponding to the interspace between two scales in the whorls above and below in s ornatum the scales are so wide transversely that there are only four in each whorl in s villosum the scales are spindleshaped and arranged somewhat irregularly in transverse rows not very near to each other new calcareous scales originate only round the top of the peduncle and they continue to grow only in the few upper whorls and as the peduncle itself continues to increase in diameter by the formation of new inner membranous layers and the disintegration of the old outer layers the calcareous scales come in the lower part of the peduncle to stand further and further apart in the earliest stage of growth there are no calcareous scales on the peduncle in s vulgare they first appear under the carina spines are articulated in great numbers on the surface of the peduncle in s vulgare s peronii and s villosum and very short ones on that of s rostratum  attachmentall the species except s villosum are attached to horny corallines the singular means of attachment in s vulgare will be described under that species and is probably common to several of the other species the larva in most or in all cases when it proceeds to attach itself clings head downwards to the branch and hence the capitulum comes to be placed upwards with its orifice fronting the branch and the carina outwards the sucking disc of the prehensile antennæ of the larva in the five species examined was a little pointed and in shape resembled the hinder hoof of a mule this may perhaps be accounted for by the narrowness of the branches of the corallines to which it has to adhere a large circular disc as in lepas would have been worse than useless the ultimate segment in most or all the species has on its inner side the segment being supposed to be extended straight forward a notch or step bearing i believe two spines  size and coloursome of the species attain a medium size others are small the valves are generally clouded red or pink but sometimes white  mouththe various parts vary far more than in any genus hitherto described the labrum is highly bullate with the upper part forming a rounded overhanging projection and with the lower part much produced so that the mouth is placed far from the adductor scutorum muscle and consequently the orifice is directed more towards the ventral surface of the thorax than in most other cirripedes on the crest of the labrum there are some very small teeth in several of the species but not in all the mandibles have either three or four main teeth generally with either one or two small teeth intermediate between the first and second large teeth and in the case of s peronii with small teeth between all the larger ones the maxillæ have their edges furnished with many spines and are either straight or have the inferior part prominent and stepformed the outer maxillæ have the spines on their inner edges either continuous or divided into two groups of which latter structure we have not hitherto had any very well characterised example the olfactory orifices are either highly or moderately protuberant  in most of the species the prosoma is little developed and the first cirrus is placed far from the second the cirri are generally but little curled and have elongated segments with long generally serrated spines the first cirrus varies in proportional length the second and third cirri have both their rami more thickly clothed with spines than are the three posterior cirri the spines being generally arranged in three or four longitudinal rows the cirri however of s villosum in all respects resemble closely the cirri of pollicipes sertus and p spinosus  the caudal appendages are uniarticulate small and clothed with spines in s villosum however differently from in all other allied forms there are no appendages  the stomach in those species which i opened is destitute of cæca there are no filamentary appendages  generative system the ova are nearly spherical and remarkably large as was stated to be the case in the introductory discussion in which the larva of s vulgare in the first stage of development was described the ovigerous fræna are small the testes are large but the vesiculæ seminales in some of the species extraordinarily small scalpellum ornatum and perhaps s rutilum are unisexual the other species are hermaphrodite but most or at least some of the individuals are furnished with complemental males these latter are fully described under each species so i will here only remark that s ornatum which alone excepting perhaps s rutilum is unisexual has less claim than the other species to be generically separated we have seen also in ibla that similar sexual differences occur in two most closely allied species it is very singular how much more some of the males and complemental males in scalpellum differ from each other than do the female and hermaphrodite forms this seems due to the different stages of embryonic development at which the males have been arrested in the males however of s rostratum s peronii and s villosum compared one with another but not with the males of the other species the parts of the mouth and apparently the cirri resemble each other more closely than do the same organs in the hermaphrodites at the end of this genus i shall give a summary on the highly remarkable sexual relations both in scalpellum and ibla      distributionthe species seem distributed over the whole     world but as far as we can trust our present scanty materials     are most common in the warmer temperate regions the s     vulgare ranges from the norwegian seas to naples most of the     species are inhabitants of deep water  affinitiesin the preliminary remarks we have seen how this genus blends into pollicipes and under the head of oxynaspis i have shown its close affinity to that genus if indeed we take pollicipes spinosus and destroy all but six of the already minute and almost rudimentary latera we shall as far as the capitulum is concerned convert it into a scalpellum closely similar to s villosum if we take any species of scalpellum excepting s villosum and s rutilum and destroy all the valves but the scuta terga and carina we shall convert it into an oxynaspis lastly i have shown under ibla that in several most remarkable peculiarities of structure there is a manifest affinity between scalpellum and that genus  geological historyfull details on this subject have been given in the memoirs of the palæontographical society i will here

upper point generally stands a little above that of the carinal latera  carinal latera flat less in area than the inframedian latera basal margin nearly straight carinal margin slightly hollowed out terminal margin arched and protuberant the umbones of the two valves almost touch each other under the middle of the carina main growth towards the inframedian latera and upwards umbones projecting not above one fifth of the entire length of the valve  peduncle much flattened rarely as long as the capitulum with the upper end nearly as wide as it the lower end is either blunt or tapers to a very fine point the calcareous scales are transversely elongated and are about four times as wide as high their internal surfaces are slightly concave and their external convex the two ends are pointed viewed internally the scales approach in shape to rhomboids there are in a mediumsized specimen about twenty scales in each whorl their tips overlapping each other the whorls are placed not very near each other and at rather unequal distances except round the uppermost part where being in process of formation they are packed closely together the membrane uniting the scales supports numerous transverse rows of articulated spines varying from 1100th to 1500th of an inch in length and each furnished with a long sinuous tubulus 110000th of an inch in diameter running through the membrane to the underlying corium  attachmentspecimens are attached to various horny corallines and occasionally to the peduncles of each other51 in both cases supposing the coralline to be erect the capitulum is placed upwards with its orifice towards the branch to which it is attached and consequently with its carina outwards where several are crowded in a group their peduncles often become twisted and their positions irregular with their orifices facing in any direction this uniform position is simply the consequence of the larva attaching itself headdownwards and from the position of the prehensile antennæ necessarily with its sternal surface parallel and close to the branch of the coralline hence the dorsal surface which afterwards is converted into the carina faces outwards the peduncle as already stated often tapers at its basal extremity to a sharp point in very young specimens for instance in one with a capitulum only 120th of an inch in length the method of attachment is the same as in lepas and many other genera namely by cement proceeding exclusively from the antennæ of the larva but in older and fullgrown specimens instead of the whole bottom of the peduncle becoming flattened and broadly attached which would be here impossible the cement is poured out through a straight row of orifices along the rostral edge thus causing by an excellent adaptation a narrow margin to adhere firmly to the thin and cylindrical branches of the coralline these orifices are represented magnified seven times in pl ix fig 7 in which the lower attached portion of the peduncle is split open and exhibited they are circular and stand at regular intervals in a straight line the higher orifices are larger but further apart from each other than the lower ones in one fullgrown specimen i counted ten of these orifices in a length of exactly a quarter of an inch at each period of growth the corium recedes a little from the attached portion of the peduncle of which portion the greater part is thus left empty and as incapable of further growth as are the larval antennæ at the extreme point in the specimen figured the corium extended a little below the upper orifice the prehensile antennæ however i must remark do not strictly rise from the extreme point of the peduncle but at a little distance from it on the rostral surface this simply ensues from the antennæ in the larva being situated on the sternal surface close to but not actually on the front of the head the two cement glands are seated high up on the sides of the peduncle and remote from each other they are small unusually globular and transparent the two cementducts fig 7 a a proceeding from them are 32000ths of an inch in diameter and run in a zigzag line at the point where they pass through the corium to enter the lower attached portion of the peduncle they become closely approximated and partially imbedded in the membrane of the peduncle together they run along the rostral edge giving out through each orifice a little disc of brownish cement and finally they enter the larval antennæ the peduncle just above the attached portion where still lined by corium no doubt increases in diameter at each period of growth and must i presume become pressed against the almost parallel branch of the coralline the corium at this same period shrinks or is absorbed and the two cementducts come in contact with and adhere to the inner surface of the outer membrane of the peduncle and then by a process which i do not understand in this or any other cirripede apertures are formed both in the ducts and through the membrane so that the cement passes through firmly fastening the outer surface of the peduncle with its calcareous scales and spines to the coralline     51 mr peach transact brit assoc

the membrane connecting them either nearly white or dirty pale yellowish or purplishbrown within the sack the corium under the valves is tinted pale purple and two very faint bands of the same colour can generally be distinguished running down the two sides of the peduncle body coloured yellowishwhite with the upper segments of the pedicels of the cirri tinted in front with purple  body much

teeth with the second or second and third when there are six teeth smaller than the others in two specimens there were five teeth on one side and six on the other inferior angle rather broad and strongly pectinated  maxillæ with the edge nearly straight without any notch but with the inferior portion very slightly projecting there are twelve or thirteen pairs of unequal spines of which some of the middle ones are rather longer than the others and almost as long as the two upper great spines  outer maxillæon the inner margin the bristles are divided into two separate tufts exteriorly near the base there is a distinct rounded swelling with bristles the olfactory orifices are highly protuberant approximate flattened scarcely tapering towards their upper ends  cirrithe five posterior pair are elongated very little curled with short pedicels their segments are long not at all protuberant in front bearing five or six pairs of long slightly serrated spines with a very minute tuft of bristles between each pair and with some short lateral spines on the inner side of each segment on the fourth pair of cirri these lateral spines are considerably developed dorsal tufts consist of fine spines with one much longer than the others first pair short separated by a wide interval from the second rami unequal in length by between two and four segments longer ramus having nine segments scarcely half as long as the rami of the second cirrus shorter ramus with seven segments in the same individual there were twenty segments in the sixth cirrus the segments in the shorter ramus of the first cirrus are oblong in a transverse direction and may be compared to a set of shields placed transversely and strung together in the longer ramus the segments are longitudinally oblong in both they are thickly covered with spines second cirrus the anterior ramus is a little broader than the posterior ramus with the segments bearing about five rows of bristles fifteen segments in the shorter ramus third pair with the two rami equal in thickness and with the segments differing very little from those of the posterior cirri excepting that the serrated spines in the external lateral rows are rather larger the fourth pair is remarkable by having on the inner side of the upper edge of each segment a little tuft of minute smooth spines flattened and a little enlarged near their ends so as to be spearshaped i could not see these singular spines on the other cirri the lower segments of the pedicels of all the cirri excepting the sixth pair are remarkable from having their inner edges in the middle produced into a considerable abrupt rounded projection irregularly covered with spines  caudal appendages pl x fig 21 very small flattened of nearly the same width throughout in a mediumsized

spherical and large namely 9400ths of an inch in diameter they are not numerous and lie in single layers in the two lamellæ the ovigerous fræna are well developed and lie under the scuta one i measured was 5100ths of an inch in length and 2100ths in width the margin is obliquely truncated and slightly sinuous this species breeds late in the autumn and even in midwinter i have examined a specimen from cornwall with ova containing larvæ taken on the 26th of october again in another specimen from belfast sent to me by mr thompson taken in january there were ova in the lamellæ and therefore no doubt impregnated and on february the 12th i received from mr peach from cornwall specimens so very young that they must have become attached during the first days of the month  varietiesthe specimens from near naples which i owe to the kindness of the rev f w hope are somewhat larger and differ slightly from those of britain they form i imagine the s siciliæ of chenu after carefully examining them internally and externally i think it is quite impossible to consider them specifically distinct for although in several specimens the valves were placed a little further apart from each otherthe upper latera a little more elongatedthe carinal latera rather narrower in their upper halfthe inframedian latera rather more roundedand lastly in the scuta the tergal margin extended almost in the same line with the lateral margin nevertheless in other specimens i could perceive no difference whatever it is however remarkable that in several fullgrown neapolitan specimens there were no complemental males whereas i have never seen a single fullgrown british specimen without such being present in some specimens in the british museum without any given locality i have observed considerable variation in the breadth of the carinal and rostral latera   complemental male pl v figs 914  when first dissecting scalpellum vulgare i was surprised at the almost constant presence of one or more very minute parasites on the margins of both scuta close to the umbones these are represented but rendered darker and therefore more conspicuous than in nature in the drawing pl v fig 15 which is three times the natural size i carelessly dissected one or two specimens and concluded that they belonged to some new class or order amongst the articulata but did not at that time even conjecture that they were cirripedes many months afterwards when i had seen in ibla that an hermaphrodite could have a complemental male i remembered that i had been surprised at the small size of the vesiculæ seminales in the hermaphrodite s vulgare so that i resolved to look with care at these parasites on doing so i soon discovered that they were cirripedes for i found that they adhered by cement and were furnished with prehensile antennæ which latter i observed with astonishment agreed in every minute character and in size with those of s vulgare the importance of this agreement will not at present be fully appreciated i also found that these parasites were destitute of a mouth and stomach that consequently they were shortlived but that they reached maturity and that all were males subsequently the five other species of the genus scalpellum were found to present more or less closely analogous phenomena these facts together with those given under ibla and had it not been for this latter genus i never probably should have even struck on the right track in my investigation appear sufficient to justify me in provisionally considering the truly wonderful parasites of the several species of scalpellum as males and complemental males when these parasites are fully described will be the proper time to discuss and weigh the evidence on their sexual relations and nature i will now describe the parasite of s vulgare  general appearanceshape flasklike compressed pl v fig 9 magnified 36 times with a short neck the outline is usually symmetrical but sometimes is a little distorted on the under side the creature is imbedded more than half its length or depth in the transparent spinebearing chitine border of the scutum of the hermaphrodite its length or longer axis varies from 10 to 11400ths its breadth or transverse axis is 6 to 7400ths and its thickness for it is much flattened is only 4400ths of an inch on the summit there is a fimbriated orifice a the size of which can rarely be made out quite distinctly owing to the extreme thinness of the membranous edges a little way beneath the orifice there are four little blunt bristly points b generally rather more than the 11000th of an inch in length they are rather variable in size and seem to be of no functional importance directly beneath them there are four little calcareous beads as may be known by their dissolving with effervescence in any acid and breaking easily under the needle these are the 32000ths of an inch in their larger external diameter they are rather deeply imbedded in the outer integument and taper a little downwards ending in a concave terminal point into which a minute tubulus enters like those passing into and through the valves of ordinary cirripedia along the axis of imbedment they are often 42000ths of an inch in length these calcareous beads or rudimental valves are seated in pairs at the two ends of the flattened animal so that when the animal is laid on one side the upper bead in each pair exactly covers and hides the lower one the outer integument is composed of chitine as may be inferred from boiling caustic potash having no effect on it the upper part is thicker than the imbedded portion and is wrinkled transversely it is covered with minute spines 410000ths of an inch in length either single or in groups of two and three pl v fig 14 this outer tunic is lined by corium sometimes slightly mottled with dull purple and this by delicate longitudinal striæless muscles running from the base up to the under edge of the orifice these longitudinal muscles are crossed at least in the upper part by still finer transverse muscles  thorax and abdomenwhen the external integument is cut open the thorax pl v fig 13 is found lodged within an inner sack or rather tube extending from near the bottom of the animal up to the external orifice the whole thorax is sometimes forced through the orifice owing perhaps to the action of the spirits of wine and consequent endosmose and is thus well displayed without dissection the thorax tapers a little is much flattened and straight its length together with the terminal abdominal lobe is about 6400ths of an inch it is formed of very thin most finely hirsute membrane transversely wrinkled and so extensible that when everted by the internal muscles being seized it stretches to twice its former length in this condition five transverse articulations are displayed the abdominal lobe is smooth and cannot be stretched or turned inside out by pulling the above muscles on the thorax corresponding with the interspaces between the five transverse articulations there are four pair of short limbs but their bases i believe are prolonged across the inner or ventral surface of the thorax so as almost to touch each other these limbs i believe have no articulations except perhaps where united to the thorax the anterior or lowest limb on each side supports two or sometimes only a single spine this pair is rather smaller than the second and is placed a little more distant from it than are the upper pairs from each other the second pair differs from the upper two only in having its three spines a very little shorter the two upper or posterior pair exactly resemble each other each has two spines on the summit and a third seated lower down on a little notch on the outer side but with its point on a level with the others the points of the spines of the two upper limbs stand on a level with the external spines at the end of the abdomen all the spines are of excessive tenuity and sharpness they are straight long and not plumose  the abdominal lobe is square and from not being wrinkled has a different appearance from the thorax on each of the posterior angles there are three moderately long very sharp spines with the tips of the outer pair bent a little inwards in the middle between them there are two little spines and a little below and outside these latter on the ventral surface there are two other longer spines with their tips bent inwards and again lower down two other pair one beneath the other of short spines perhaps the three pair of spines on the ventral surface mark the three segments which are distinct on the abdomen of the larva in the last stage of its development in lepas and other genera in the same way it is probable that the lateral spine on the notch in each limb marks the point where in the larva there is an articulation altogether there are seven pairs of spines on the abdomen and eleven pairs on the thoracic limbs  a little way beneath the lower or anterior pair of limbs the thorax is abruptly bent and becomes confluent with the lower internal parts of the whole animal here the very delicate membrane of chitine which lines the sack or tube extending from the external orifice can be seen to be continuous as in all cirripedes with the outer tunic of the thorax within the thorax there are some longitudinal muscles without transverse striæ which i believe enter the short limbs but not the abdomen as i infer from the latter not being everted when they are pulled at their lower ends these muscles terminate abruptly and from being contracted are often a little enlarged they extend a short way beneath the lower pair of limbs and are i suspect attached to the outer integument of the animal near the base  after the most careful dissection of very many specimens and their examination in many different methods as by caustic potash c i can venture positively to assert that there is no vestige of a mouth or masticatory organs or stomach i did not see any anus but i will not affirm that such does not exist  in the upper part of the animal lying under the superficial muscles and close beneath the upper line of their attachment i found in all the specimens an eye of a pointed oval form rather less than 1112000ths of an inch in diameter formed of an outer capsule lined with purple pigmentcells and surrounding as it appeared a lens the eye is not introduced in fig 9 for i could not see it except by dissection and therefore do not know its exact relative position  generative systemthe contents of the animal between the sack containing the thorax and the outer integuments and directly under the thorax varied much in condition in young and lately attached specimens the whole consisted of a pulpy mass with numerous oilglobules in other specimens apparently more mature there were vast numbers of cells sometimes cohering in sheets about 310000ths of an inch in diameter and having darkish granular centres these i believe to be the testes for in a specimen presently to be mentioned in which the vesicula seminalis was gorged with spermatozoa i found adhering to its outside a mass of cells of exactly the same diameter but now empty and transparent instead of having brownish centres lastly in several other specimens at the very bottom of the sackformed animal there was a brownish pearshaped bag of different sizes in different individuals and occasionally broader even than the thorax this bag contained either pulpy matter or a great mass of spermatozoa before being disturbed these spermatozoa lay parallel to each other in flocks and they yielded to the needle in a peculiar manner so that i found having had experience with these bodies in living cirripedia i could almost tell before examination under the compound microscope whether or not i should see spermatozoa many had distinct heads52 which were two or three times as broad as the filamentary bodies the latter when placed between glass were the 120000th of an inch in diameter i compared these spermatozoa with others taken out of the vesiculæ seminales of the individual hermaphrodite s vulgare to which the parasite was attached and could not perceive the slightest difference in them the brownish pearshaped bag or vesicula seminalis the coat of which seems fibrous could sometimes be distinctly traced sending a chord or prolongation far up the thorax at the end of the abdominal lobe no doubt there is an orifice and this i believe i once distinguished owing to this chord the bag often adheres to the thorax when the latter is dissected out of the general integuments in this condition i twice clearly made out that it was single in one other specimen however there appeared to be two small vesiculæ seminales by using a condenser and very brilliant light the outline of the vesicula seminalis could sometimes be distinguished before dissection at the bottom of the sackformed animal and such was the case in the specimen drawn in fig 9     52 i do not understand the development of the spermatozoa in    cirripedia in a recent chthamalus and balanus i found the    greater number had a little filament in front of the head or    nodular enlargement which latter varied in size and in shape    from globular to that of a spindle the filament before the head    also varied in proportional length it did not project in    exactly the same straight line with the hinder part and some of    the spermatozoa were entirely without this filament in    frontsuch is the case with the spermatozoa here described  although i have dissected at least thirty specimens taken at different times of the year and from different localities and when many of the specimens were mature and ready for the impregnation of ova as clearly shown by the presence of innumerable spermatozoa i have never seen even a trace of an ovum or ovaria  antennæ and attachmentthe prehensile antennæ pl v fig 10 are seated a little above the very base of the sacklike animal and this might have been expected from the antennæ in the larva being seated on the ventral surface not at the very extremity of the head by a very strong light they can sometimes just be seen whilst the parasite is attached to the hermaphrodite the scutum of the latter having been cleaned on the under side and are thus represented in fig 9 they are formed of thicker membrane than the general integument of the body the second segment or disc is pointed and hooflike when seen in profile fig 11 the upper convex surface has a uniform slope with the upper surface of the basal segment it is furnished with a single backward pointing spine attached i believe on the under side nearly opposite the articulation of the ultimate segment at the apex there are some excessively minute hairs or down the ultimate segment projects rectangularly outwards as usual and has on its inner side rather beneath the middle a conspicuous notch fig 12 which bears two or three long nonplumose spines on the summit there are three or four rather shorter spines on the outside of the great basal segment there is a single spine curving backwards the importance of the following measurements in fractions of an inch will hereafter be seen    length of whole organ from end of disc to the further      margin of the oblique basal articulation                  38396000    length of whole organ to the inner margin of the oblique   basal articulation                                        16000    breadth of basal segment measured halfway between the     basal and second articulationsthe limb being viewed      from vertically above                                     86000    length of hooflike disc measured from the

           66000    breadth of ultimate segment beneath the notch              720000    breadth of ultimate segment above the notch                520000  i did not see the cementducts which perhaps was owing to the corium extending from the inside of the whole animal some way into the antennæ thus rendering them rather less transparent than in common cirripedes that the ducts and cementglands exist is certain for the antennæ in every case were enveloped in a little irregular mass or capsule of the usual brown transparent laminated cement when several of these parasites were attached close together the cement ran up between them  i may here state that i found on one scalpellum three males very lately attached and not as yet imbedded in the chitine border they were white opaque pulpy and full of oily globules the lower part was considerably more pointed and extended further beyond the prehensile antennæ than in the older and imbedded specimens there were distinct remnants of two great reddishbrown eyes showing that in this respect the larvæ of the male in their last stage of development are characterised like the larvæ of other lepadidæ the male larva would probably be a little larger than the male itself but yet compared with the larva in the earliest stage there can have been unusually little increase of size during the several intermediate metamorphoses i judge of this from the dimensions of the larva of the hermaphrodite in the first stage namely 9400ths of an inch exactly the size of some of the smaller males in the allied genus ibla the increase is also less than is usual namely from 151000ths of an inch the diameter of the ovum to only 251000ths of an inch the length of the boatshaped larva just before its final metamorphosis  habits and concluding remarksthe males are imbedded in the spinose chitine border of the occludent margin of the scuta exactly over an oblique fold or notch fig 15 á a close by the umbo this fold has no direct relation to the males but being present is taken advantage of by them for it occurs in the young hermaphrodite before the attachment of the males and in species of the genus in which the males are attached to other parts it occurs also in fossil species of pollicipes and in these it seems caused by the upper inner part of the valve being rendered more and more prominent during growth in the present species i suspect its origin is connected with the formation of a ridge bounding the outer side of the pit for the adductor scutorum muscle we shall see in the next species that this fold is of the highest importance in relation to the position of the males the transparent chitine border of the scuta is broad and fills up the fold in the shell so that the outline of the occludent margin is not affected by it in the drawing fig 9 some of the inner layers of chitine e e which dipped into and filled up the fold have been removed that the lower part of the animal might be more plainly exhibited the chitine bears numerous spines of various lengths which must afford some protection to the males rudely arranged in lines parallel to the edge of the valve indicating the successivelyformed layers of chitine each spine has a fine tortuous tubulus connecting its base with the underlying corium the extreme outer edge of the border is thin forming a kind of lip close beneath which the delicate tunic lining the sack is attached during continued growth the valve is added to in thickness and so is the chitine border and likewise in breadth it appears that the larva of the male must attach itself on the under side of this border on the edge of the tunic of the sack and that by the action of the cement the corium beneath is killed as i believe always is the case with other parasitic cirripedia whereas on both sides the chitine continues to be added to so that the male excepting the upper and always projecting portion becomes imbedded at first laterally and ultimately all round i have seen specimens in several different stages of imbedment hence in old specimens with a thick and broad chitine border it might and does come to pass that one male is imbedded the valve being laid flat directly beneath another  i have examined a great number of specimens from various localities taken at different times of the yearsome dozen specimens from cornwall53 and several from unknown localities in various collections some from ireland from the shetland islands from norway and from near naples every one of these specimens with the exception of some of the neapolitan ones had parasitic males attached to them i must also except very young specimens on which they never occur on a cornish specimen with a capitulum a little more than one fifth of an inch in length it may be mentioned as unusual that there were three males in young specimens there is generally one male on each scutum but sometimes there are two and sometimes none on one side in large old cornish specimens i have counted on the two sides together six seven and eight males and in one irish specimen no less than ten seven all close together on one valve and three on the other but i do not suppose that all these were alive at the same time in the neapolitan specimens however which are the largest that i have seen there was in no case more than two and out of seven or eight specimens four had not any male so that it would appear there is something in this locality hostile to the development of the parasitic males i have noticed only one instance that given in fig 9 in which the males were imbedded a little way apart generally they touch each other and are cemented together where there are several males they occur at different levels as measured from the under or upper surface of the chitine border in one instance of four males adhering to one valve i distinctly perceived that the lowest one was white pulpy and recently attached the two above which were placed close together and between the same laminæ of chitine were mature and the third still higher up was dead empty transparent and half decayed in some other instances i have found the uppermost parasites dead and together with the surrounding chitine partially worn away     53 i am greatly indebted to mr peach for his unwearied    kindness in procuring me fresh specimens mr w thompson allowed    me to dissect one possessing particular interest out of his    three irish specimens professor forbes procured me a specimen    from the shetland islands and professor steenstrup was so kind    to take pains to send me some scandinavian specimens  the larva of the male must have a different instinct from the larva of the hermaphrodite for the latter attaches itself head downwards to a coralline whilst the male larva crawling on the scuta of the hermaphrodite discovers i presume by eyesight the fold in the shell beneath the translucent border of chitine and there invariably attaches itself its object in choosing this particular spot i believe simply is that the depth or thickness of the chitine is there greater and sufficient for its imbedment which would hardly be the case elsewhere this parasite has as we have seen no mouth or stomach and indeed considering its fixed position and the nonprehensile condition of its limbs or cirri a mouth would have been of no service to it without it had been extraordinarily elongated the male must live on the nourishment acquired during its locomotive larval condition and its life no doubt is short but yet not very short as i infer from the depth to which mature specimens are buried in the chitine border the full development of the spermatozoa consumes i suppose some considerable lapse of time the thorax and limbs though furnished with muscles are obviously as already remarked of no use for prehension these parts serve probably to defend the little creature when its eye announces the passing shadow of some enemy and for this purpose they are well adapted from the extreme sharpness of the spines the thorax into which i traced the vesicula seminalis no doubt also serves for the emission and first direction of the spermatozoa and hence perhaps its singularly extensible structure i have already remarked that in specimens preserved in spirits the thorax is often largely protruded and bent down at right angles to the orifice i presume this is caused by endosmose nevertheless it deserves notice that it was in these protruded specimens that the vesicula seminalis was most conspicuously gorged with spermatozoa i suspect the longitudinal and transverse muscles lining the upper part of the outer integuments of the whole animal can be of little use to the creature without it be to aid in the protrusion of the thorax and perhaps in the violent expulsion of the spermatozoa thus causing them to reach the ovigerous lamellæ within the sack of the hermaphrodite it is also probable that the action of the cirri of the hermaphrodite would tend to draw inwards the spermatozoa in the right direction in one specimen the spermatozoa in the hermaphrodite and in the male were mature at the same time in another this was not the case and as the males apparently become attached at all periods of the year this want of coincidence in maturity must often occur can the males retain their spermatozoa till told by some instinct that the ova in the sack of the often fecundated hermaphrodite are ready for impregnation or are the spermatozoa sometimes wasted as must annually happen with such incalculable quantities of the pollen of many dioecious plants  this little cirripede is in many respects in a partially embryonic condition there is no separation between the capitulum and peduncle there is no mouth and the thorax throughout its whole width opens into the anterior part of the animal the limbs differ greatly from those both of the mature cirripede and of the larva but come closest to the latter the preservation of the abdomen is a wellmarked embryonic character on the other hand the four rudimentary calcareous valves the narrow orifice the hirsute outer integument the two muscular layers the single eye and male internal organs are all characteristic of the fullydeveloped condition the four little valves as i believe represent the scuta and terga though they are placed considerably below the orifice the little bristly points have no homological signification and are absent in the male of the following closely allied species the four pairs of limbs answer to the four posterior cirri as may be inferred from their proximity to the abdominal lobe and from the three posterior pairs closely resembling each other and differing a little from the first pair this latter pair corresponds with the third pair in the hermaphrodite form of scalpellum if i am right in believing that only a single vesicula seminalis is ordinarily developed in the male this is a special and singular character  as stated in the beginning of this description from the one great fact of the absolute correspondence of the prehensile antennæ of the parasite with those of the hermaphrodite scalpellum vulgare together with its fixed condition its short existence and exclusively male sex i have thought myself justified in provisionally considering it as the complemental male of the cirripede to which it is attached but i hope final judgment will not be passed on this view until the whole case is summed up at the end of the genus54     54 i trust before long that some naturalist with more skill    than i possess will examine these parasites on scalpellum    vulgare which unfortunately is the only species of the genus    that can be easily obtained fresh specimens or those preserved    in spirits of wine are necessary the action of boiling caustic    potash is very useful in cleaning the prehensile antennæ if    these latter organs are sought in the hermaphrodite for the sake    of comparison young

this    extremely interesting species also to mr morris to whom mr    bowerbank had given some of the original specimens   female  capitulum oblong with the upper portion much produced valves 14 thick naked closely locked together irregularly clouded with pale crimson the membrane connecting the valves is not furnished with spines on most of the valves there are furrows and ridges diverging from the umbones and the lines of growth are plainly marked in the valves of the lower whorl the umbones are slightly protuberant  scuta convex unusually thick oblong quadrilateral with the occludent margin the longest lateral margin slightly hollowed out the umbo and primordial valve is situated at the uppermost point of the valve and consequently the growth is exclusively downwards on the under side pl vi figs 1 b´ and 1 c´ in about the middle of the valve there is a pit a for the adductor scutorum muscle the depth and distinctness of which varies a little above the pit and between it and the apex there is a transverse oblong deeper depression b within which the male is lodged a small portion of the apex of the valve projects over the terga  terga large nearly equalling the scuta in area flat and subtriangular the scutal margin is not quite straight the apex of the valve is thick and solid and must have projected freely for a length equalling one third of the occludent margin  carina laterally broad angularly bent slightly widening from the apex to the base internally deeply concave the position of the umbo varies in young specimens it is seated at the uppermost point and consequently in such there is no upward growth in older specimens from the junction and upward production of that part on each side of the valve which i have called in fossil specimens the intraparietes the valve is added to above the umbo but to a lesser degree than in s vulgare slight ridges separate the roof from the parietes and the parietes from the intraparietes  rostrum minute narrow widening a little from the apex downwards inserted like a wedge between the umbones of the rostral latera and hardly projecting above their upper margins so as to be easily overlooked internally concave  upper latera fig 1 á quadrantshaped with a deep square notch cut out of the arched margin which notch receives the upper point of the carinal latera the surface of the valve between the notch and the umbo is depressed56  rostral latera small gradually widening from the umbo to the opposite end which is obliquely rounded  inframedian latera approaching to diamondshaped placed obliquely to the longer axis of the capitulum or the upper part may be described as spearshaped     56 the only valve which i have seen at all like this is a    fossil specimen from the upper chalk of scania this is described    in my memoir on the fossil lepadidæ palæontographical society    under the name of scalpellum solidulum tab 1 fig 8 e    f and is perhaps erroneously there considered as a carinal    latus  carinal latera these appear as if formed of two valves united together the upper portion widening as it ascends in a curved line terminates in a rounded margin which enters the deep notch in the upper latera the other and lower portion is shorter and terminates in a square margin abutting against the inframedian latera the umbones of the carinal latera project beyond the line of the carina  direction of the lines of growth in the valvesthis should always be carefully observed on account of the great diversity there is in this respect between the different species especially when the recent are compared with the older fossil species moreover one of the chief characters between the genus scalpellum and pollicipes depends on the direction of the lines of growth in the scuta terga rostrum and upper latera of the present species the chief growth is downwards in the carina in mature specimens it is both upwards and downwards in the carinal latera both upwards and towards the inframedian latera in the inframedian latera chiefly upwards and lastly in the rostral latera towards the inframedian latera  peduncle short not half as long as the capitulum calcareous scales imbricated as usual tinged red almost crescentshaped acuminated at both ends of remarkable length so that in each whorl there are only four scales a fullsized scale equals in length one of the rostral latera the tips of two scales in one whorl lie under the middle points of the carina and rostrum and in the whorl both above and below a single much curved scale occupies this same medial position the peduncle does not seem to have been attached in any definite position to the horny coralline as is the case with s vulgare  length of capitulum in the largest specimen 2 of an inch  the mouth is directed towards the ventral surface of the thorax the labrum is far removed from the adductor muscle with the upper part forming an overhanging projection i believe there are some very minute beadlike teeth on the crest palpi small narrow thinly clothed with bristles  mandibles with three teeth of which the first is distant from the second inferior angle not much acuminated pectinated on both edges  maxillæ small narrow produced without any notch with two large upper spines of which one is much thicker than the other on the convex upper margin there are some minute tufts of very small hairs  outer maxillæ with few bristles arranged in a continuous line on the anterior surface on the external surface there is a tuft of long bristles olfactory orifices situated laterally forming two flattened tubular projections  cirrifirst pair placed not far from the second the three posterior pair not very long with their segments elongated not protuberant bearing four pair of nonserrated spines with a single short bristle between each pair dorsal tufts small with one spine longer than the others first cirrus rather short segments not very broad second cirrus with the rami nearly equal in length anterior ramus rather thicker than the posterior ramus with three longitudinal rows of spines  caudal appendagesthese are minute rather broad not half as long as the lower segments of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus with four very long spines at the tip  penisthere is no trace of a probosciformed penis in the four specimens examined and as this organ is present in every ordinary cirripede with the exception of ibla cumingii which we know to be exclusively female so we may infer with some confidence that the form here described is female although it is impossible in specimens once dried to demonstrate the absence of the vesiculæ seminales and testes  affinitiesthis is a very distinct species it is however much more nearly related to s rutilum than to any other species and next to this to s vulgare from this latter species it chiefly differs in the large scales of the peduncle in the scuta not being added to at their upper ends and in the membrane covering and connecting the valves being spineless but there is a greater difference in the trophi and in the cirri the peduncle of s ornatum presents some resemblance to that of the singular cretaceous genus loricula   male  all the specimens as already stated were dry but in an excellent state of preservation so that after having been soaked in spirits they could be minutely examined in the four which i opened i found in a transverse pouch on the under side of each scutum a male lodged in a fifth dead and bleached specimen the cavities in the shell for the reception of the males were present and in a sixth young specimen also dead cavities were in process of formation as compared with plants the relation of the sexes in this species may be briefly given by saying that it belongs to the class diandria monogynia i will first describe the males themselves and then the cavities in the shell of the female the males differ in every point of detail from the complemental males of s vulgare but yet present so close a general resemblance that a comparative description will be most convenient  the general shape of the whole animal is rather more elongated and i suspect flatter but this latter point could not be positively ascertained in dry specimens the entire length is greater being in the largest specimen 13400 instead of at most 11400 and the width 7400 of an inch the orifice is not fimbriated the four bristly points over the calcareous beads are absent the whole outer integument is much thinner owing evidently to its protected position and is not covered by little bristles but with an extremely high power minute points arranged in transverse lines can be distinguished the calcareous beads or rudimentary valves are thin and regularly oval it is remarkable that in all the specimens two on one side were smaller than the two on the other sidethe smaller beads being 166000 and the larger 226000 of an inch in diameter therefore more than twice the size of one of the beads in s vulgare which are only 96000 externally in diameter from the position of the eye close to one margin near the upper end of the flattened animal and from the manner in which the little limbs and spines lay between two of the beads at the opposite end it was manifest that these latter one large and one small corresponded with the terga of the other cirripedes and that the other two near the eye answered to the scuta the valves being of unequal sizes on the right and lefthand sides of the animal is probably connected with one side being pressed against the hard shelly valve of the female in the same way as the valves in certain pæcilasmas are smaller and flatter on the side nearest to the crustacean to which they are attached the eye in being slightly notched on the upper and lower edge shows signs of really consisting of two eyes which i believe is always normally the case it is rather larger in the proportion of 13 to 11 being 1312000 of an inch in diameter than in s vulgare and from the almost perfect transparency of the integuments is far more conspicuous than in that species hence when the valves of the female are opened the black little eye is the first part of the male which catches the attention no vestige of a mouth could be discovered  thorax and abdomenthe thorax as in s vulgare is highly extensible and when stretched exhibits the same five transverse folds or articulations when contracted it is broader so that even the truncated end of the abdomen is wider than the lower properly anterior end of the thorax in s vulgare its thin outer integument is studded with excessively minute points in transverse rows the four pair of limbs are longer than in s vulgare but the spines on them much shorter and thicker each limb including the first supports three spines of which one is seated on a notch low down on the outside and is longer than the other two of these two the one on the same side with the notch is a little longer than the other the spines on the first and second pair of limbs are considerably shorter than those on the third pair and these latter are a little shorter than those on the fourth or posterior pair hence the spines on the thoracic limbs compared with those of s vulgare present considerable differences both in their relative and absolute dimensions the abdominal lobe is in proportion rather shorter its end is less abruptly truncated and supports a row of i believe six moderately long and basally thick spines these spines are not so long as those surmounting the fourth pair of limbs on both lateral margins of the abdomen rather on the ventral face there is a row of i believe seven long spines but it is very difficult to count the spines in specimens which have been once dried i was able to distinguish that the two lower pair of spines on the ventral surface are seated a little way one below and within the other as in s vulgare the abdominal spines altogether form quite a brush and there are certainly several more than in s vulgare and those on the two sides are much longer  antennæthe disc is hooflike with the upper surface forming a straight line with the upper edge of the basal segment the apex is pointed and clothed with some fine down there is a single spine pointing backwards which rises from the lower flat surface the ultimate segment was hidden in laminæ of cement and i was not able to make out its structure there is a single spine on the outer edge of the basal segment in the usual position the entire length of the limb measured from the end of the disc to the further margin of the basal articulation is 366000ths of an inch measured to the inner margin it is 216000ths of an inch the disc itself is 126000ths of an inch long these measurements differ a little both absolutely ad proportionally compared with those of the antennæ of s vulgare  cavities in the scuta of the female for the reception of the malesthese extend nearly parallel to the tergal margin transversely across the valves for three fourths of their width they are seated above the depression for the adductor muscle and are more conspicuous than it they are deep and well defined and each exactly contains one male the males are placed with their orifices in a little notch in the occludent margin and their prehensile antennæ at the further end the distance to which the cavities extend across the valve and their distance from the upper or tergal margin varies a little but chiefly in accordance with the age of the specimens for the valve continues to increase in width whilst the size of the cavity remains the same the occludent margin of the scutum in the largest female was 1 of an inch in length of another in which there was a fully developed cavity 084 of a third in which there was no cavity only a slight concavity with a preparatory impression the length of the occludent margin was 062 the larger and smaller of these three valves are drawn of their proper proportional sizes in pl vi figs 1 b´ 1 c´ the preparatory impression fig 1 c´ b consists of a narrow not quite straight extremely slight furrow of slightly irregular width bordered on each side by a very minute ridge which is distinctly continuous with the inner edge of the occludent margin both above and below the cavity the furrow appears to have been formed by calcareous matter not having been deposited along this line during the thickening or growth of the internal surface of the valve i suspect that it originates at a single period of growth for i could see no signs of successivelyformed transverse lines i believe that it is strictly homologous with the fold over which the complemental male is attached in s vulgare but carried for a special purpose much further across the valve and rectangularly inwards for in structure and position both are identical in comparing the internal views of the scuta in s vulgare and s ornatum pl v fig 15 a´ and pl vi fig 1 c´ it must be borne in mind that the latter should be compared as clearly shown by the lines of growth with that portion alone of the scutum in s vulgare which lies under the curved ridge connecting the umbo and tergolateral angle the deep cavity in which the male is lodged is formed subsequently to the preparatory furrow simply by the gradual thickening of the surrounding surface of the valve more especially of a ridge just above the pit for the adductor muscle and of another broad ridge just beneath the tergal margin the deepest part of the cavity lies parallel to the tergal margin along the upper side and here in the older valves the preparatory furrow can by care be distinctly traced in conformity with the shape of the cavity the orifice or notch in the occludent margin of the scutum is situated at the point where the preparatory furrow sweeps round and enters i believe that the cavity is lined by membrane and that between the cavity and the body of the female there is a complex membranous layera pouch or bag being thus formed an imaginary section of this pouch with the thickness of all the parts extremely exaggerated and in a reversed position is given in pl vi fig 1 d´ a is the shell x the cavity converted as i believe into a pouch by firstly the delicate tunic c lining the sack of the female secondly a double layer d of corium and thirdly by a special rather thick membranous layer b which thinning out round the cavity coats only part of the under surface of the scutum this latter membrane i have not seen in any other cirripede and i believe it is nothing but the tissue here not calcified which in a calcified condition ordinarily forms the valves on this view the males may be said to be lodged in pouches formed in the thickness of the valves  concluding remarksthe males from the absence of a mouth and no doubt of a stomach must necessarily be shortlived and i suppose are periodically replaced by fresh males57 in one instance the remnants of the two great compound eyes of the larva could be seen at the end of the pouch opposite the orifice the larvæ i conclude crawl in at the orifice one side of which is formed as we have seen of yielding membrane and scratch out the dead exuviæ of the former occupant certainly the males are less firmly attached to their pouches though some small quantity of cement is excreted than are other cirripedes to the objects to which they are attached the small size of the female and her valves not being thickly edged with chitine accounts for the males having pouches specially formed for them instead of being as in s vulgare laterally imbedded in the chitineborder of the scuta in hereafter weighing the evidence on the nature of the parasites in ibla and in scalpellum the fact of the valves of the supposed female being here modified for the special purpose of lodging the males will be seen to be important if we imagine the male parasites to be extraneous animals and that by adhering to the sack of the scalpellum they injure the corium and thus prevent the growth of the shell over an area exactly corresponding to their own size and so form for themselves cavities yet what can be said regarding the preparatory furrows surely these narrow lines cannot have been produced by the pressure of the much broader parasites must we not see in the furrows the first marking out if such an expression may be used of the habitation for the male which has to be specially formed by the independent laws of growth of the female     57 it is possible though opposed to all analogy that the    females may be shortlived and breed only once in which case    the males would not have to be periodically replaced   3 scalpellum rutilum pl vi fig 2  s foem an herm valvis 14 subrufis carinæ tecto plano utrinque cristâ rotundatâ instructo margine

membrane bearing some thin spines on the margins clouded with a fine though pale orange tint surfaces plainly marked with lines of growth     58 in my first and as i thought careful examination of the    separated valves my only materials of this species i mistook    one of the triangular rostral latera for the rostrum and hence    was unfortunately led into an error in my monograph on the    fossil lepadidæ of great britain in which i state that the    present species has only twelve valves in the capitulum and i    inferred from this that s quadratum s fossula c had    only twelve valves i still believe this to be correct but the    existence of fourteen valves in s rutilum and s ornatum    the recent species to which the above fossils are most closely    allied no doubt is a strong argument in favour of this higher    number  scuta elongated nearly three times as long as broad apex pointed basal margin extremely oblique forming an acute angle with the occludent margin the lateral margin is slightly hollowed out and is separated from the tergal margin by a large rectangular projection or shoulder the occludent margin is nearly straight externally there is a slight ridge running down the middle of the valve from the apex to the basolateral angle and a second ridge running from the apex to the tergolateral angle the lines of growth do not end abruptly at the tergolateral angle as is the case with s ornatum and several fossil species but run up a little way along the tergal margin the umbo is seated at the uppermost point and therefore the main growth is downwards there is a large rounded depression for the adductor muscle a fig 2 a´ and higher up opposite the tergolateral angle there is another hollow b for the lodgment of the males this latter is of nearly the same shape as the hollow for the adductor muscle but rather more conspicuous than it from the appearance of the under surface of the scuta it might readily have been thought that there had been two adductor muscles  terga of large size longer than the scuta flat triangular with the whole inferior part much produced and spearlike a portion of the apex must have projected freely above the

squareedged furrow running from the apex to the basal margin and widening downwards these two ridges have their lines of growth oblique and hence have a twisted appearance the central depressed portion of the basal margin which is square or truncated descends lower down than the two ridges the sides of the valve close to the apex are broad and consist as i believe of intraparietes as well as of parietes but these parts are not separated from each other by ridges as is commonly the case more especially with the fossil species i have described the carina in some detail on account of its resemblance to that of the cretaceous s fossula s trilineatum and s quadricarinatum  rostrum unknown but one probably existed  upper latera of large size elongated quadrilateral approaching to diamondshaped with the angles rounded nearly twice as long as broad almost flat upper half acuminated lying between the scuta and terga the lower half broad forming a rectangular projection lying between two latera of the lower whorl the umbo is near the apex the greater part of the growth being downwards but the valve is added to a little round the two sides of the apex these additions do not take place in the early stages of growth as explained under s vulgare and therefore they form a depressed rim  rostral latera almost exactly triangular curved basal margin furnished with a just perceptible rim  inframedian latera quadrilateral sides unequal in length the carinobasal margin being the longest in area not quite twice double the rostral latera directed obliquely upwards  carinal latera subtriangular produced upwards with the apex rounded and the two lateral margins hollowed out the basal margin exceeds a little in length the basal margin of the rostral latera the umbones of these two latera are seated at their basal outer angles so that the growth of the valves is towards each other and upwards the umbo of the inframedian latus is seated at the basorostral angle and hence the growth is obliquely upwards the umbones of the rostral latera must have been close together over the unknown rostrum  length of capitulum about 410th of an inch  peduncle only small fragments are preserved the calcified scales are small closely imbricated several of them together only equalling in length the basal margin of the rostral latera each scale is thin transversely

on the convex upper margin there are some minute tufts of the smallest hairs  outer maxillæ rounded with the inner margins very sparingly but continuously covered with bristles i could not ascertain whether the olfactory orifices were tubular  cirrithese consisted in the one specimen of merely small fragments the segments of the posterior cirri are elongated not protuberant and support i believe five pair of nonserrated spines and an exterior row of very minute spines dorsal spines fine and long either the second or third cirri or probably both are remarkable for having the whole of one side of each segment covered with irregular rows of long spines moreover in the upper segments of these same cirri between each separate dorsal tuft there is placed one or two long bristles the first cirrus appears to have had very broad segments and these are singular from the spines in the dorsal rows being extremely long in some of the cirri several of the basal segments are soldered together  caudal appendages lost  from the state of the specimen it was quite impossible to ascertain whether the individual here described was an hermaphrodite or female from the analogy of its nearest congener s ornatum the latter is the most probable but the genus ibla shows how the sexes may differ in the most closelyallied forms  affinitiesfrom the hollows on the under sides of the scuta for the lodgment of the males from the umbones of the scuta and of the carina being situated on the apices of these valves and from all the characters of the mouth s rutilum is much more closely allied to s ornatum than to any other species   male or complemental male  in the concavity or hollow above the depression for the adductor muscle pl vi fig 2 a´ i found males but in so extremely decayed a condition that they could hardly be examined on one side however i distinctly saw the larval prehensile antennæ with pointed hooflike discs and part of the thorax with its small limbs and long spines as in s vulgare or s ornatum i also saw clearly the eye the four calcified beads or rudimentary valves i believe were present but in removing the specimen the whole fell to pieces and was lost the outer integument was covered with rather thick very minute bristles each about 210000th of an inch in length and therefore only half the length of those on the complemental males of s vulgare the cavities for the males are not formed as in s ornatum by the thickening of the internal surface of the valve round a defined space but by the scutum being externally convex and internally concave down the middle hollows being thus produced both for the lodgment of the males and for the attachment of the adductor muscle these hollows are separated from each other by a slight transverse ridge i do not know at which point of the margin of the valve the orifice of the male is situated but i presume close under the apex in this species as in s ornatum there can be no question that the scuta of the female are specially modified by their own growth for the reception of the males it must be added that as it was not possible to ascertain whether the ordinary form of s rutilum was hermaphrodite or female so it must remain doubtful whether the parasites are males or complemental males but the former i think is most probable   tt subcarinÂ presente  4 scalpellum rostratum pl vi fig 7  s herm

scarcely exceeding in length the pedicel of the sixth cirrus   complemental male pl vi fig 5  before describing the parasite of the present species which departs entirely from the character of the males of the three preceding species it is proper to state that i consider it to be a complemental male simply from analogy as will hereafter be more fully shown at the end of the genus had a specimen of the parasite been brought to me without any information i should have concluded that it was an immature individual of a new genus of pedunculated cirripedes remarkable from the rudimentary condition of the valves and exhibiting in one important character namely in the form of the larval prehensile antennæ an alliance to scalpellum had i been then told that three individuals in a group had been found attached to s rostratum not outside the valves but to the integument in a central line between the labrum and the adductor scutorum muscle in such a position that when the scalpellum closed its valves these parasites were enclosed within the capitulum my surprise would have been great for it is very improbable that this singular and unparalleled position was accidental in this one group of specimens inasmuch as there seems to be a relation between the naked condition of the capitulum of the parasite and the protection afforded to it by the capitulum of the scalpellum it further becomes apparent on reflection that these minute parasites though having the appearance of immaturity can not increase in size or but little for if they did grow and acquired an ordinary size they would either be killed by the pressure of the scuta of the scalpellum or they would destroy the latter and in doing so soon lose their own support and thus necessarily perish  the one fullgrown specimen of s rostratum in mr cumings collection was in a good state of preservation but dry the three parasites were attached as stated close under the labrum between it and the adductor muscle they are constructed like ordinary cirripedia and have a mouth thorax and cirri enclosed in a capitulum supported on a peduncle of moderate length and narrow the entire length of the capitulum and peduncle as far as could be ascertained in the shrivelled condition of the specimens was 351000ths and the greatest width of the capitulum 111000ths of an inch both capitulum and peduncle are hirsute with spines nearly 11000th of an inch in length mingled with shorter hairs in little rows of three and four together the figure 5 in pl vi is merely a restoration as accurate as could be made from the much shrivelled specimens there are only three valvesnamely an oval carina a seated rather high up on the capitulum in a rudimentary condition and only 11000th of an inch in length and a pair of scuta these latter consist of a narrow slightly curved plate 81000ths in length broadest at the lower end where the breadth is 21000ths of an inch the prehensile antennæ at the end of the peduncle have pointed hooflike discs i was not able to make out the other parts it deserves notice that in the young specimen of the ordinary form of s rostratum 110th of an inch in length and therefore only thrice as long as the parasites all the valves were perfect and seemed to have followed the ordinary law of development  mouththe largely bullate labrum is placed far from the adductor in the same manner as in the hermaphrodite the mandibles have three large sharp teeth with the inferior point very sharp and small so that there is one less tooth than in the hermaphrodite the maxillæ have two or three large upper spines the others being very thin i believe the lower part is upraised and steplike as in the hermaphrodite the outer maxillæ are bilobed in front with a few short bristles on the outer side near the bottom i was not able from the dried state of the specimens to discover whether the olfactory orifices were tubular altogether it was apparent from this imperfect examination that there was a close similarity between the mouth of the parasite and of the hermaphrodite  the thorax is unusually elongated  cirrithe first pair is very short and is distant from the second all have the appearance of immaturity with their pedicels very long in proportion to their rami the latter are slightly unequal in length even in the sixth pair there appeared to be six segments in the rami of the sixth pair each segment bearing two or three pair of long spines  caudal appendages with two or three little spines on their summits  penis short blunt thick at the apex with one or two spines on it i did not see any ovaria but this could hardly have been expected in specimens in a dried condition without they had happened to have been in a gorged condition certainly there were no ova  in the general summary at the end of the genus i shall give my reasons for believing this parasite to be the complemental male of the scalpellum rostratum   5 scalpellum peronii pl vi fig 6    smilium

formed of 13 valves namely two scuta two terga a carina and subcarina a rostrum a pair of upper latera and two pair of lower latera these latter valves with the subcarina and the rostrum make a whorl of six pieces the upper part of the capitulum is as usual produced the upper valves are separated in specimens which have not been dried by rather wide interspaces of membrane they are covered excepting generally their umbones by membrane which in the interspaces is clothed with fine spines the spines or the marks where they were once articulated are visible over nearly the entire surface of the membrane covering the valves the spines are particularly numerous round the orifice of the sack the whole capitulum in a dried condition is coloured dull purplishred which is only in part due to the underlying corium for the valves themselves are pale red after having been long kept in spirits the whole capitulum becomes colourless the valves are smooth faintly marked by lines of growth the umbones of the lower valves project outwards giving a denticulated appearance to the base of the capitulum  scuta slightly convex oblong breadth about two thirds of the length almost quadrilateral with the upper portion produced into a flat projection this projection is almost spearshaped being constricted a little on each side below the apex there is a deep pit for the adductor muscle the umbo is near the apex the part above not being above one fifth of the whole length of the valve as in s vulgare the growth is at first downwards and subsequently a little upwards and downwards thus producing the upper small spearlike projection which lies at a lower level than the umbo there is a fold on the occludent margin  terga large flat triangular carinal margin slightly hollowed out occludent margin slightly arched with a small portion protuberant to a variable amount the apex is slightly curved towards the carina  carina long internally deeply concave angularly bent the lower portion slightly longer and wider than the upper part the two halves meet each other at about an angle of 135° the upper half is parallel to the longer axis of the terga between which it extends for three fourths of their length the external surface is rounded except near the umbo where the edge is carinated growth almost equally upwards and downwards the parietes and tectum are not separated by ridges  the subcarina lies close under the carina and is placed almost transversely to the longer axis of the capitulum external surface arched and smooth the whole having the shape of half of a cone

extend below the basal margins of the scuta the umbo is placed a little above the centre  rostral latera minute scarcely exceeding one third of the size of the carinal latera and very much less than the rostrum they are placed transversely under the basal point of the upper latus or rather between it and the basolateral angle of the scutum basal margin as seen internally straight upper margin arched rostral angle produced internally flat the whole valve is very thick and solid so that the umbo which lies at the rostral end projects rectangularly outwards  carinal latera oblong nearly quadrilateral with the upper angle produced placed obliquely parallel to the lower half of the upper latera umbo slightly prominent seated near the apex with three rounded ridges proceeding from it internal surface very slightly concave  peduncle and attachmentthe peduncle is short not equalling the capitulum in length the whole surface is most thickly clothed with minute spines which are not visible when the specimen is dry i think it probable that they may sometimes all drop off before a new period of exuviation the peduncle does not at least in the specimens which i have examined which were grouped in a bunch taper at the lower end to a point and after careful examination i feel sure that the cement does not debouch from several successively formed orifices as in s vulgare and as in some pollicipes but only from the two original orifices in the prehensile antennæ of the larva in these latter organs the sucking disc is hooflike and pointed and is narrower than the basal segment the ultimate segment has on its inner side supposing this segment stretched straight forwards a notch or step bearing at least three spines the proportions of the different parts differ slightly from those in s vulgare but as i shall hereafter have to give all the measurements i do not think them worth repeating here in the one large group of specimens examined by me in mr cumings possession all were attached symmetrically to the coralline as in the case of s vulgare capitulum upwards and their carinas outwards  length of capitulum about three quarters of an inch width about half an inch entire length with peduncle a little more than one inch  the mouth is placed far from the adductor muscle  labrum with its basal margin much produced upper part highly bullate forming a rounded projection equalling the longitudinal axis of the rest of the mouth crest without any teeth  palpi triangular with the two margins thickly clothed with bristles on each side of the mouth near where the palpi are united to the mandibles there is a slight orbicular shieldlike swelling  the mandibles pl x fig 3 have nine or ten very unequal teeth with the inferior angle rather broad and pectinated of these there are four main teeth of which the second is always the smallest and between the four one or two small teeth are interpolated so that the total number is either nine or ten and often varies on the two sides of the same individual as likewise does the shape of the inferior angle  maxillæ with the edge nearly half as long as that of the mandibles supporting from seventeen to twenty pairs of spines the upper pair is only slightly larger than the others a part near the inferior angle projects slightly beyond the rest of the nearly straight edge the apodeme at its base or point of origin is unusually broad and flat  outer maxillæ large and triangular the inner margin is slightly concave and continuously covered with short spines the outer margin is bilobed as in s vulgare with the basal part supporting a great tuft of long bristles of which the greater number turn outwards and almost cover the olfactory orifices the latter are slightly prominent placed some way apart from each other with the abovementioned tufts of bristles between them all the spines of the trophi are in some degree doubly serrated  cirrithe first pair is seated rather far from the second pair and the prosoma being little developed the shape of the body nearly resembles that of s vulgare the posterior cirri are elongated very little curled with the segments much flattened not at all protuberant bearing from five to seven pair of long serrated spines with a few small spines in an exterior row between each pair there is a very minute tuft of small bristles the upper lateral rim of each segment is toothed with small spines spines of the dorsal tufts long serrated first pair elongated having numerous segments namely seventeen whilst the sixth pair in the same individual had only twentyone segments rami nearly equal segments short nearly cylindrical thickly clothed with long serrated spines the second and third pair are nearly equal in length they have their anterior rami slightly thicker than their posterior rami both being much more thickly clothed with spines than are the three posterior pair of cirri pedicels rather short with their inner edges not forming a projection as in s vulgare  caudal appendages pl x fig 20 uniarticulate flat rounded at their ends and moderately long clothed most thickly like brushes with very fine bristles which latter are serrated and are longer than the appendages themselves  penis of small size narrow pointed and thickly clothed with delicate hairs in length equalling only one fourth of the sixth cirrus  ovigerous fræna small semicircular entire edge thickly covered with glands ovarian tubes within the peduncle fully developed as usual  affinitiesthis species differs from all the others in the absence of calcareous scales on the peduncle but it has no other character which at all justifies its generic separation in the shape of the scuta and carina it comes nearest to s vulgare taking all the characters together it is scarcely possible to say to which of the other species it is most closely allied having close affinities with all in the entire structure however of the complemental male immediately to be described this species certainly comes nearer to s villosum than to any other species i may add that in s villosum the latera are almost rudimentary and therefore tend to disappear whereas in s peronii it is the calcareous scales on the peduncle which have actually disappeared   complemental male pl vi fig 3  i examined owing to the great kindness of mr cunning six dry specimens of the hermaphrodite s peronii from swan river and one in spirits from another locality in the british museum out of these seven specimens only three appeared to have had parasites attached to them and these i infer from reasons to be more fully given at the end of the genus are complemental males one of the three specimens however had two males close together these parasites were firmly cemented to the integument of the hermaphrodite in a fold in a central line between the scuta a little below the animal being in the position in which it is figured the adductor scutorum muscle and therefore some way below the umbones of these valves when the scuta are closed the parasites from their small size are enclosed and protected in every detail of structure they are obviously pedunculated cirripedia  the capitulum pl vi fig 3 has six valves namely a pair of scuta and of terga a carina and a rostrum all united by finelyvillose membrane furnished near the orifice with some much longer and thicker spines the capitulum is truncated in a remarkable manner the orifice not being as in the hermaphrodite in the same line with the peduncle but almost transverse to it and therefore almost parallel to the surface of attachment the largest specimen measured transversely through the scuta and terga was 301000ths of an inch in breadth another was only 261000ths to 271000ths this latter specimen measured longitudinally from the base of the carina to the tips of the terga was 151000ths of an inch a scutum of the largest specimen was 171000ths in length the scuta and terga are broadly oval with the primordial valves very plain at their upper ends i may here mention that in a central line between the scuta i observed the apparently single minute black eye as in ordinary cirripedia  the carina is straight triangular and internally slightly concave its basal margin descends far below the basal points of the terga  the rostrum is shorter and internally more concave than the carina i believe it projects more abruptly outwards than is represented in the figure  the peduncle commences some little way below the scuta it is narrow and very short it is finely villose it is lined by delicate transverse striæless muscles within which there are the usual stronger longitudinal muscles the base is flat and truncated i examined and carefully compared the prehensile antennæ with those of the hermaphrodite and found every part and every measurement the same the full importance of this identity will hereafter be more fully insisted on the antennæ are represented of their proper proportional size in fig 3  mouththe labrum as in the hermaphrodite is highly bullate and far removed from the adductor scutorum muscle the palpi are small and triangular with their blunt apices clothed with a very few scattered bristles  mandibles with only three teeth and the lower angle minute slightly pectinated the first tooth is distant from the second and larger than it width of the whole organ 0021 of an inch  maxillæ bearing only a few spines furnished with a long apodeme beneath the upper large pair there is a notch under which there are two spines of considerable size and a small tuft of fine bristles width 001 of an inch and therefore only 116th of the size of the same organ in the hermaphrodite the relative sizes of the maxillæ and mandibles are the same in the male and hermaphrodite  outer maxillæ blunt triangular with a few thinlyscattered bristles on the inner face those on the outside being longer  cirrithe first pair is far removed from the second the rami are very short barely exceeding the pedicel in length they are formed of only four segments each bearing a pair of spines but on the end of the terminal segment there are three spines of which the central one is very long second pair also short in the sixth pair there are five or six elongated segments each bearing three pair of long spines dorsal tufts large the cirri are furnished with transverselystriated muscles  the caudal appendages exist as two very minute plates with a few bristles at their apices  the penis is not acuminated with four bristles at the end it is short equalling only the lower segment of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus in the one specimen preserved in spirits i unfortunately omitted to search for the vesiculæ seminales i cannot doubt that such existed but it would have been important to have ascertained whether they contained spermatozoa i made out most distinctly that there was no trace of ovarian tubes within the peduncle and my assertion may be believed when i state that i traced the two much finer and more transparent cementducts from the prehensile antennæ up to the body of the animal in lepas i have repeatedly detected with ease the ovarian tubes within the peduncle before the calcification of the valves had even commenced and therefore at a much earlier period of growth than in these parasites consequently i am prepared to affirm that these parasites are not females but that as far as can be judged from external organs they are exclusively males  concluding remarksin comparing the capitulum of the hermaphrodite with that of the complemental male pl vi figs 6 and 3 we must be struck with the differences in their shape in the number relative sizes and forms of the several valves it should however be borne in mind that the scuta and carina in the hermaphrodite at first grow exclusively downwards so that if we remove the upper portions subsequently added the difference in shape in these valves is not so great as it at first appears the rostrum in the male is of much larger relative size whilst of the upper latera there is not a trace although in the hermaphrodite these valves are larger than the rostrum the terga compared with those of the hermaphrodite differ more essentially than do the other valves and the manner in which the primordial valves project shows that from the first commencement of calcification the lines of growth have followed an unusual course the great breadth and shortness of the terga is evidently related to the shortening of the whole capitulum and the transverse position of the orifice and this shortening of the capitulum no doubt is rendered necessary for its reception and protection within the shallow furrow between the scuta of the hermaphrodite finally if we compare the internal parts of the hermaphrodite and male the differences are considerable though partly to be accounted for by the youth of the latter the form and position of the labrum and the distance between the first and second pair of cirri is the same in both but the mandibles and maxillæ differ considerably  to put the case as i have before done if a specimen of one of these parasites had been brought to me to class without any information of its habitsthe downward direction of growth in all the valves the presence of a rostrum the villose outer integument all the details of the prehensile antennæ the form of the animals body and the position of the labrum would have convinced me that though a quite new genus it ought to have stood close to scalpellum and nearer to it than to ibla   6 scalpellum

this whorl the latera are smaller than the rostrum or the subcarina they are placed far distant from each other their inner surfaces are triangular their umbones point upwards the rostral pair is smaller than the other two pair which are of equal size the exact position of the rostral latus differed on the two sides of the specimen examined apparently its normal position is at the basolateral angle of the scuta  peduncle wide at the summit longer than the capitulum calcified scales small not arranged very regularly flattened spindleshaped rather far separated from each other imbedded in membrane so that even their summits are rarely uncovered the surface of the membrane is thickly clothed with spines which are strong thick yellow pointed and furnished with large tubuli running to the underlying corium these spines are arranged in groups of from three or four to five or six besides these larger spines the whole surface is villose with very minute colourless spines not above 120th

angle broad pectinated  maxillæ with a long rather sinuous edge which near the inferior angle has a narrow projecting point bearing rather finer spines there is also apparently a very minute tuft of small spines close under the two large upper spines there are altogether about twenty pair of spines without counting the smaller ones  outer maxillæ with the inner edge slightly concave continuously covered with bristles exteriorly with a prominence covered with longer bristles olfactory orifices prominent protected by a slight punctured swelling between the bases of the first pair of cirri  cirriprosoma moderately developed first pair of cirri rather far removed from the second pair the segments of the three posterior pair are not elongated short slightly protuberant in front bearing four or five pairs of strong spines a little below each pair there is an intermediate tuft of very fine straight bristles of which the upper tuft is the largest on the lateral upper rims there are some short strong spines dorsal tufts rather small and thick spines all more or less serrated especially on the broad basal segments of the three anterior cirri pedicels of the cirri not particularly protuberant in front first cirrus with rami slightly unequal in length not short basal segments much thicker and more protuberant than the upper segments second cirrus anterior ramus with six or seven

subrostrum in the shape of the scuta carina and more especially of the triangular latera in the form of the peduncle with its irregularlyscattered calcified scales in the shape of the animals body in the structure both of the mandibles and maxillæ in the arrangement of the spines both on the anterior and posterior cirri scalpellum villosum most closely resembles or rather is identical with pollicipes had it not been for the formation of the valves forming the capitulum and from the presence of complemental males i should have placed this species alongside of pollicipes spinosus and sertus in not having caudal appendages s villosum differs from all the species of scalpellum and pollicipes but this organ is variable to an unusual degree in pollicipes   complemental male pl vi fig 4  from the kindness of professor owen mr gray and mr cuming i have been enabled to examine six specimens of this species and on two of them i found complemental males they were attached in the same position as in s peronii namely beneath the adductor muscle in the fold between the scuta so as to be protected by the latter when closed this parasite is sixvalved and has a close general resemblance with that of s peronii but differs in very many points of detail it is represented of the natural size at á fig 4 the capitulum is 431000ths of an inch measured across the scuta and terga and the same measured from the base of the carina to the top of the capitulum hence it is broader by a quarter of the above measurement and considerably higher than the male of s peronii from the capitulum being higher that is not so much truncated the orifice is placed more obliquely the membrane connecting the valves is finely villose and is besides furnished with spines conspicuously thicker and longer than those on the male s peronii the scuta and terga are much more elongated a scutum being here 351000ths of an inch in length the carina descends only just below the basal points of the terga instead of far below them the rostrum is a little broader and more arched than the carina it is 21000ths in length and therefore more than two thirds of the length of the carina the latter being 281000ths of an inch from the apex to the basal margin the primordial valves with the usual hexagonal tissue are seated on the tips of the scuta terga and carina but not on the rostrum so that these valves follow the same law of development as in the ordinary and hermaphrodite form of scalpellum the scuta a fig 4 greatly enlarged the terga b and carina c of the male resemble the same valves in the hermaphrodite much more closely than do these valves in the male and hermaphrodite s peronii the rostrum has not its basal margin hollowed out and is very much larger relatively to the carina than in the hermaphrodite the large relative size of the rostrum in the complemental male both of this species and of s peronii is a remarkable character which i can in no way account for  the peduncle is narrow and short but in a different degree in the two specimens examined it is naked the prehensile antennæ were not in a good state of preservation the disc is narrower than the basal segment and only slightly pointed in which important respect it differs from the same part in the foregoing species at its distal end rather on the inner side there are two or three spines apparently in place of the excessively minute hairs which are found at the same spot in some or in all the other species of scalpellum and in ibla similar strong spines occur in pollicipes unfortunately for the sake of comparison i was not able to find the prehensile antennæ in the hermaphrodite s villosum  mouthlabrum bullate with teeth on the crest palpi blunt spinose  mandibles with three teeth inferior point rather strongly pectinated  maxillæ with a considerable notch under the upper pair of large spines inferior part of the edge not prominent  outer maxillæ with the spines on the inner edge arranged into two groups olfactory orifices tubular and prominent with some long bristles near their bases in the mandibles having only three teeth in the maxillæ being notched and in the lower part not being prominent and lastly in the bristles on the inner face of the outer maxillæ being arranged in two groups these several organs differ from those in the hermaphrodite  cirrifirst pair short with only three or four segments in each ramus second cirrus with the basal segments not very thickly clothed with spines sixth cirrus with seven segments not protuberant in front each bearing four pairs of spines without intermediate tufts  caudal appendages none this is an interesting fact considering that these organs are likewise absent in the hermaphrodite s villosuman absence highly remarkable and confined to the genus conchoderma and the one species of anelasma  penis thick not tapering rather exceeding in length the pedicel of the sixth cirrus square at the end and furnished with some spines in one specimen i believe i distinguished the vesiculæ seminales if so they contained only pulpy matter and not spermatozoa there were no ovarian tubes within the peduncle which was lined by the usual muscles i traced the two delicate cementducts running from within the antennæ close up to the animals body hence in this case as in that of s peronii i dare positively affirm that ovarian tubes do not occur for it is out of the question that i could have traced the cementducts and at the same time overlooked the far larger and more conspicuous ovarian tubes into which moreover the ducts had they existed would have run consequently these parasites are not females but judging from the probosciformed penis and from the presence as i believe of vesiculæ seminales they are males  the complemental males of the present species and of s peronii so closely resemble each other that what i have stated regarding the affinities of the latter are here quite applicable it is singular how much more alike the parts of the mouth and the cirri of these two complemental males are than the corresponding parts in the two hermaphrodites this no doubt is due to the two males having been arrested in their development at a corresponding early period of growth several of the characters by which the hermaphrodite s villosum so closely approaches and almost blends into the genus pollicipessuch as the thicker cirri with the intermediate tufts of bristles the small second tooth of the mandibles and the little brushlike prominence on the maxillæare not in the least apparent in the complemental male   summary on the nature and relations of the males and complemental males in ibla and scalpellum  had the question been whether the parasites which i have now described were simply the males of the cirripedes to which they are attached the present summary and discussion would perhaps have been superfluous but it is so novel a fact that there should exist in the animal kingdom hermaphrodites aided in their sexual functions by independent and as i have called them complemental males that a brief consideration of the evidence already advanced and of some fresh points will not be useless these parasites are confined to the allied genera ibla and scalpellum but they do not occur in pollicipesa genus still more closely allied to scalpellum and it deserves notice that their presence is only occasional in those species of scalpellum which come nearest to pollicipes in the genera ibla and scalpellum the facts present a singular parallelism in both we have the simpler case of a female with one or more males of an abnormal structure attached to her and in both the far more extraordinary case of an hermaphrodite with similarly attached complemental males in the two species of ibla the complemental and ordinary males resemble each other as closely as do the corresponding hermaphrodite and female forms so it is with two sets of the species of scalpellum but the males of ibla and the males of scalpellum certainly present no special relations to each other as might have been expected had they been distinct parasites independent of the animals to which they are attached and considering that they are all cirripedes having the same most unusual habits on the contrary it is certain that the animals which i consider to be the males and complemental males of the two species of ibla if classed by their own characters would from the reasons formerly assigned form a new genus nearer to ibla than to the parasites of scalpellum so again the assumed males of the three latter species of scalpellum would form two new genera both of which would be more closely allied to scalpellum than to the parasites of ibla with respect to the parasites of the first three species of scalpellum they are in such an extraordinarily modified and embryonic condition that they can hardly be compared with other cirripedes but certainly they do not approach the parasites of ibla more closely than the parasites of scalpellum and in the one important character of the antennæ they are identical both with the parasitic and ordinary forms of scalpellum that two sets of parasites having closely similar habits and belonging to the same subclass should be more closely related in their whole organisation to the animals to which they are respectively attached than to each other would if the parasites were really distinct and independent creatures be a most singular phenomenon but on the view that they differ only sexually from the cirripedes on which they are parasitic this relationship is obviously what might have been expected  the two species of ibla differ extremely little from each other and so as above remarked do the two males in scalpellum the species differ more from each other and so do the males in this latter genus the species may be divided into two groups the first containing s vulgare s ornatum and s rutilum characterised by not having a subcarina by the rostrum being small by the constant presence of four pair of latera and by the peculiar shape of the carinal latera the second group is characterised by having a subcarina and a large rostrum and may be subdivided into two little groups viz s rostratum having four pairs of latera and s peronii and villosum having only three pairs of latera now the males if classed by themselves would inevitably be divided in exactly the same manner namely into two main groupsthe one including the closely similar sackformed males of s vulgare ornatum and rutilum the other the pedunculated males of s rostratum peronii and villosum but this latter group would have to be subdivided into two little subgroups the one containing the threevalved male of s rostratum and the other the sixvalved males of s peronii and s villosum it should not however be overlooked that the two main groups of parasites differ from each other far more than do the two corresponding groups of species to which they are attached and on the other hand that the parasitic males of s peronii and s villosum resemble each other more closely than do the two hermaphrodite formsbut it is very difficult to weigh the value of the differences in the different parts of species  besides these general there are some closer relations between the parasites and the animals to which they are attached thus the most conspicuous internal character by which ibla quadrivalvis is distinguished from i cumingii is the length of the caudal appendages and the greater size of the parts of the mouth in the parasites we have exactly corresponding differences out of the six species of scalpellum in their ordinary state s ornatum is alone quite destitute of spines on the membrane connecting the valves and had it not been for this circumstance i should even have used the presence of spines as a generic character on the other hand s villosum in accordance with its specific name has larger and more conspicuous spines than any other species in the parasites we have an exactly parallel case the parasite of s ornatum being the only one without spines and the spines on the parasite of s villosum being much the largest this latter species is highly singular in having no caudal appendages and the parasite is destitute of these same organs though present inn the parasites of s rostratum and s peronii again s villosum approaches in all its characters very closely to the genus pollicipes and the parasite in having prehensile antennæ with the disc but little pointed and with spines at the further end departs from scalpellum and approaches pollicipes will any one believe that these several parallel differences between the cirripedial parasites and the cirripedes to which they are attached are accidental and without signification yet this must be admitted if my view of their male sex and mature be rejected  one more and the most important special relation between the parasites and the cirripedes to which they are attached remains to be noticed namely that of their prehensile larval antennæ i observed the antennæ more or less perfectly in the males of all and except in s villosum in all the species though so utterly different in general appearance and structure i found the peculiar pointed hooflike discs which are confined i believe to the genera ibla and scalpellum in the hermaphrodite forms of scalpellum i was enabled to examine the antennæ only in two species s vulgare and s peronii belonging fortunately to the two most distinct sections of the genus and after the most careful measurements of every part i can affirm that in s vulgare the antennæ of the male and of the hermaphrodite are identical but that they differ slightly in the proportional lengths of their segments and in no other respect from these same organs in s peroniiin which again the antennæ of the male and of the hermaphrodite are identical the importance of this agreement will be more fully appreciated if the reader will consider the following table in which the generic and specific differences of the antennæ in the lepadidæ as far as known to me are given these organs are of high functional importance they serve the larva for crawling and being furnished with long sometimes plumose spines they serve apparently as organs of touch and lastly they are indispensable as a means of permanent attachment being adapted to the different objects to which the larva adheres hence the antennæ might à priori have been deemed of high importance for classification they are moreover embryonic in their nature and embryonic parts as is well known possess the highest classificatory value from these considerations and looking to the actual facts as exhibited in the following table the improbability that the parasites of s vulgare and s peronii so utterly different in external structure and habits one from the other and from the cirripedes to which they are attached should yet have absolutely similar prehensile antennæ with these cirripedes appears to me on the supposition of the parasites being really independent creatures and not as i fully believe merely in a different state of sexual development insurmountably great  the parasites of s vulgare take advantage of a preexisting fold on the edge of the scutum where the chitine border is thicker and in this respect there is nothing different from what would naturally happen with an independent parasite but in s ornatum the case is very different for here the two scuta are specially modified before the attachment of the parasites in a manner which it is impossible to believe can be of any service to the species itself irrespectively of the lodgment thus afforded for the males so again in s rutilum the shape of the scutum seems adapted for the reception of the male in a manner which must be attributed to its own growth and not to the pressure or attachment of a foreign body now there is a strong and manifest improbability in an animal being specially modified to favour the parasitism of another though there are innumerable instances in which parasites take advantage of preexisting structures in the animals to which they are attached on the other hand there is no greater improbability in the female being modified for the attachment of the male in a class in which all the individuals are attached to some object than in the mutual organs of copulation being adapted to each other throughout the animal kingdom    generic characters of the larval prehensile antennÆ in the lepadidæ   as far as known from their imperfect

this border be not the first rim of    cementing tissue as all the specimens of which measurements are    here given had been removed after attachment in using the terms    inner and outer sides of the end segment it is supposed that    this segment is stretched straight forwards instead of being    bent rectangularly outwards as in its natural position and then    there can be no doubt which is the inner and outer sides  it should be observed that the evidence in this summary is of a cumulative nature if we think it highly or in some degree probablefrom the ordinary form of ibla cumingii having been shown on good evidence to be exclusively femalefrom the absence of ova and ovaria in the assumed males of both species of ibla at the period when their vesiculæ seminales were gorged with spermatozoafrom the close general resemblance between the parts of the mouth in the parasites and in the iblas to which they are attachedfrom the differences between the two parasites being strictly analogous to the differences between the two species of iblafrom the generic character of their prehensile antennæand from other such pointsif from these several considerations we admit that these parasites really are the males of the two species to which they adhere then in some degree the occurrence of parasitic males in the allied genus scalpellum is rendered more probable so the absolute similarity in the antennæ of the males and hermaphrodites both in s vulgare and s peronii and such relations as that of the relative villosity of the several species in this same genus all in return strengthen the case in ibla again the sixvalved parasites of s peronii and s villosum are so closely similar that their nature whatever it may be must be the same hence we may add up the evidence derived from the identity of the antennæ in the parasite and hermaphrodite s peronii with that from the antennæ in the male s villosum approaching in character to pollicipes to which genus the hermaphrodite is so closely allied and to this evidence again may be added the singular coincident absence of caudal appendages in the male and hermaphrodite s villosum if these two sixvalved parasites be received as the complemental males of their respective species no one probably will doubt regarding the nature of the parasite of s rostratum in which the direct evidence is the weakest but even in this case the particular point of attachment and the state of development of the valves form a link connecting in some degree the parasites of the first three species with the last two species of scalpellum in accordance with the affinities of the hermaphrodites  when first examining the parasites of s rostratum s peronii and s villosum before the weight of the cumulative evidence had struck me and noting their apparent state of immaturity it occurred to me that possibly they were the young of their respective species in their normal state of development attached to old individuals as may often be seen in lepas this however would be a surprising fact considering that s rostratum and s peronii are ordinarily attached in a certain definite position to horny corallines and considering that the exact points of attachment in these three parasites of which i have seen no other instance amongst common cirripedes namely between the scuta would inevitably cause their early destruction either directly or indirectly by their living supports being destroyed nevertheless i carefully examined a young specimen of s rostratum only thrice as large as the parasite and not having very young specimens of s peronii and villosum i procured the young of closelyallied forms namely of s vulgare with a capitulum only 4100th of an inch in length and of pollicipes polymerus with a capitulum of less size than that of one of the parasites and there was not the least sign of anything abnormal in the development of the valves in s vulgare at a period when the calcified scuta could have been only 1100th of an inch in length and therefore considerably less than the scuta in the parasites the upper latera must have been as much as 41000ths of an inch in length and the valves of the lower whorl certainly distinguishable  to sum up the evidence on the sex of the parasites i was not able to discover a vestige of ova or ovaria in the two male iblas and i can venture to affirm positively that the parasites of s peronii and s villosum are not female on the other hand in the two male iblas i was enabled to demonstrate all the male organs and i most distinctly saw spermatozoa in the parasitic complemental male of s vulgare i also most plainly saw spermatozoa in the parasites of s rostratum s peronii and s villosum the external male organs were present i may here just allude to the facts given in detail under ibla showing that it was hardly possible that i could be mistaken regarding the exclusively female sex of the ordinary form of i cumingii seeing how immediately i perceived all the male organs in the hermaphrodite i quadrivalvis and as the parasite contained spermatozoa and no ova the only possible way to escape from the conclusion that it was the male and i cumingii the female of the same species was to invent two hypothetical creatures of opposite sexes to the ibla and its parasite and which though cirripedes would have to be locomotive i insisted upon this alternative because if the parasite of i cumingii be the male of that species then unquestionably we have in i quadrivalvis a male complemental to an hermaphroditea conclusion as we have seen hardly to be avoided in the genus scalpellum even if we trust exclusively to the facts therein exhibited  with respect to the positions of the parasitic males in relation to the impregnation of the ova in the females and hermaphrodites it may be observed that in the two male iblas the elongated moveable body seems perfectly adapted for this end in the males of the first three species of scalpellum the spermatozoa owing to the manner in which the thorax is bent when protruded would be easily discharged into the sack of the female or hermaphrodite this would likewise probably happen with the complemental male of s rostratum considering its position within the orifice of the capitulum between the mouth and the adductor scutorum muscle the males of s peronii and villosum being fixed a little way beneath the orifice of the sack below the adductor muscle are less favorably situated but the spermatozoa would probably be drawn into the sack by the ordinary action of the cirri of the hermaphrodite and therefore would at least have as good a chance of fertilising some of the ova as the pollen of many dioecious plants trusted to the wind has of reaching the stigmas of the female plants regarding the final cause both of the simpler case of the separation of the sexes notwithstanding that the two individuals after the metamorphosis of the male become indissolubly united together and of the much more singular fact of the existence of complemental males i can throw no light i will only repeat the observation made more than once that in some of the hermaphrodites the vesiculæ seminales were small and that in others the probosciformed penis was unusually short and thin  viewing the parasitic males in relation to the structure and appearance of the species to which they belong they present a singular series in s peronii and s villosum the internal organs have the appearance of immaturity the shape of the capitulum is specially modified for its reception between the scuta of the hermaphrodite and several of the valves have not been developed this atrophy of the valves is carried much further in s rostratum in ibla many of the parts are embryonic in character but others mature and perfect some parts as the capitulum thorax and cirri are in a quite extraordinary state of atrophy in fact the parasitic males of ibla consist almost exclusively of a mouth mounted on the summit of the three anterior segments of the 21 normal segments of the archetype crustacean in the males of the first three species of scalpellum some of the characters are embryonicas the absence of a mouth the presence of the abdominal lobe and the position of the few existing internal organs other characters such as the general external form the four beadlike valves the narrow orifice the peculiar thorax and limbs are special developments these three latter parasites certainly are wonderfully unlike the hermaphrodites or females to which they belong if classed as independent animals they would assuredly be placed not in another family but in another order when mature they may be said essentially to be mere bags of spermatozoa  in looking for analogies to the facts here described i have already referred to the minute male lerneidæ which cling to their femalesto the wormlike males of certain cephalopoda parasitic on the femalesand to certain entozoons in which the sexes cohere or even are organically blended by one extremity of their bodies the females in certain insects depart in structure nearly or quite as widely from the order to which they belong as do these male parasitic cirripedes some of these females like the males of the first three species of scalpellum do not feed and some i believe have their mouths in a rudimentary condition but in this latter respect we have amongst the rotifera a closely analogous case in the male of the asplanchna of gosse which was discovered by mr brightwell62 to be entirely destitute of mouth and stomach exactly as i find to be the case with the parasitic male of s vulgare and doubtless with its two close allies for any analogy to the existence of males complemental to hermaphrodites we must look to the vegetable kingdom  finally the simple fact of the diversity in the sexual relations displayed within the limits of the general ibla and scalpellum appears to me eminently curious we have 1st a female with a male or rarely two permanently attached to her protected by her and nourished by any minute animals which may enter her sack 2d a female with successive pairs of shortlived males destitute of mouth and stomach inhabiting two pouches formed on the under sides of her valves 3d an hermaphrodite with from one or two up to five or six similar shortlived males without mouth or stomach attached to one particular spot on each side of the orifice of the capitulum and 4th hermaphrodites with occasionally one two or three males capable of seizing and devouring their prey in the ordinary cirripedial method attached to two different parts of the capitulum in both cases being protected by the closing of the scuta as i am summing up the singularity of the phenomena here presented i will allude to the marvellous assemblage of beings seen by me within the sack of an ibla quadrivalvisnamely an old and young male both minute wormlike destitute of a capitulum with a great mouth and rudimentary thorax and limbs attached to each other and to the hermaphrodite which latter is utterly different in appearance and structure secondly the four or five free boatshaped larvæ with their curious prehensile antennæ two great compound eyes no mouth and six natatory legs and lastly several hundreds of the larvæ in their first stage of development globular with hornshaped projections on their carapaces minute single eyes filiformed antennæ probosciformed mouths and only three pair of natatory legs what diverse beings with scarcely anything in common and yet all

under scalpellum villosum that the addition of a few small valves to the lower whorl would convert it into a pollicipes most closely allied to p sertus and spinosus it has also been shown that the six recent species of pollicipes might be divided into three genera of which p cornucopia p elegans and p polymerus would form one thoroughly natural genus as natural as lepas and the earlier genera p mitella would form a second and p sertus and p spinosus a third but i have acted to the best of my judgment in at present retaining the six species together as far as the valves of the capitulum are concerned it would be very difficult to separate p mitella from p sertus and spinosus  description the number of valves in the capitulum has in this genus acquired its maximum the number varies considerably in the same species and even on opposite sides of the same individual and generally increases with age it is more important that the number of the whorls in p cornucopia and in the two following closelyallied forms also increases with age in p sertus and p spinosus even the number of the whorls varies in different individuals independently of age the valves are arranged alternately with those above and below they are generally thick and strong making the capitulum somewhat massive in some species they are subject to much disintegration but in others the apices of the several valves especially of the carina and rostrum are well preserved and project freely they are covered with membrane which differently from in most species of scalpellum either does not bear any spines or only exceedingly minute points in all the species there is a subrostrum and subcarina and often beneath these a second subrostrum and subcarina in mediumsized specimens there are at least 20 valves in the lowermost whorl the carina is either straight or curved but never rectangularly bent and is always of considerable breadth none of the valves are added to at their upper ends the scuta have a deep pit for the adductor muscle the valves lie either some little way apart or more commonly close together in p mitella the scuta and terga are locked together by a fold and the valves of the lower whorl overlap each other in a peculiar manner resembling that in which the compartments in the shells of sessile cirripedes fold over each other  the peduncle is of considerable length in some of the species and rather short in others it is in every case clothed with calcified scales the scales in the first four species are placed alternately and symmetrically they are formed and added to in the same manner as in scalpellum they differ in size according to the size of the individual and consequently the lower scales on the peduncle formed when the specimen was young are smaller than the upper scales the lower scales are separated from each other by wide interspaces of membrane owing to the continued growth of the peduncle by the formation of new layers of membrane and the disintegration of the old outer layers each scale is invested by tough membrane or has been for it is often abraded off in the same manner as the valves each is furnished with one or more tubuli in connection with the underlying corium in p sertus and p spinosus the scales are small spindleshaped and not of equal sizes and the rows are distant from each other so that their alternate arrangement is not distinguishable in these two species new scales are formed round the summit of the peduncle and the growth of each is completed whilst remaining in the uppermost row but besides these normal scales such as exist in the other species of pollicipes and in scalpellum new scales are formed in the lower part of the peduncle which are generally of very irregular shapes are often larger than the upper ones are crowded together and sometimes do not reach the outer surface of the membrane this formation of scales in the lower part of the peduncle independently of the regular rows round the uppermost part is perhaps a feeble representation of the calcareous cup at the bottom of the peduncle in the genus lithotrya the prehensile antennæ will be described under p cornucopia  sizemost of the species are large and p mitella is the most massive of the pedunculated cirripedes  the mouth is not placed far from the adductor muscle the labrum is highly bullate the mandibles have either three or four main teeth pl x fig 1 with often either one or two smaller teeth inserted between the first and second the maxillæ pl x figs 13 14 have their edges either straight and square or notched or more commonly with two or three prominences bearing tufts of finer spines the outer maxillæ fig 17 generally have a deep notch on their inner edges but this is not invariable the olfactory orifices in most of the species are highly prominent  cirrithe first pair is never placed far distant from the second the posterior cirri have strong somewhat protuberant segments and between each of the four or five pair of main spines pl x fig 27 there is a rather large tuft of straight fine short bristles the second and third pair have the basal segments either of the anterior rami or of both rami so thickly clothed with spines fig 25 as to be brushlike in p mitella however the third pair is like the three posterior pair in the arrangement of its spines in this respect resembling the sessile chthamalinæ the caudal appendages are either uniarticulate and spinose or multiarticulate it is remarkable that there should be this difference in such closely allied species as p cornucopia and p polymerus the short obtuse obscurelyarticulated caudal appendage of the former species fig 22 makes an excellent passage from the uniarticulate fig 19 to the multiarticulate form as in p mitella  the stomach in those species which i opened is destitute of cæca the hepatic glands are arranged in straight lines the rectum is unusually short the prosoma is well developed  in p cornucopia p elegans and p polymerus there are numerous filamentary appendages both on the prosoma and at the bases of the first pair of cirri these appendages are occupied by testes and i suspect stand in relation to the length of the peduncle and consequent great development of the ovaria in order to give space for the filamentary appendages the sack generally roughened by small inwardlypointing papillæ penetrates more deeply than usual into the upper part of the peduncle there are small ovigerous fræna in p sertus p spinosus and p mitella in the three other species the frænum or fold occupies the usual position on each side and is large but in one specimen carefully examined by me i was unable to see any glands and in another specimen the ovigerous lamellæ were not attached to the fræna hence i conclude that the fræna are functionless in these three species  affinitiesi have already remarked on the close relationship between this genus and scalpellum there is also some affinity with lithotrya      distributionall over the world the p cornucopia ranges     from scotland to teneriffe the p polymerus is found in     opposite hemispheres in the pacific ocean extending from     california to at least as far as 32° south of the equator  geological historyhaving so lately given in the memoirs of the palæontographical society a full account of all the fossil species known i

the capitulum and scales of the peduncle coloured after having been in spirits reddishorange in a specimen in which the capitulum was 13 of an inch in length there were three whorls of valves below the carina in this large specimen altogether there were about eighty valves in mediumsized specimens the number is about the same as in p cornucopia the upper latus viewed internally has an area about twice as large as that latus which corresponds to the interspace between the carina and terga whereas in p cornucopia the upper latus is only slightly larger than this same valve the apex of the basal internal margin of the carina is here rounded instead of being square as is generally the case with p cornucopia the strong membranous margin of the orifice of the sack in its upper part is almost one third as wide as the widest part of the terga whereas in p cornucopia it is only one fourth of this same width the peduncle apparently is rather longer compared with p cornucopia and the calcareous scales on it perhaps a little larger in proportion  in a very young specimen with the capitulum barely exceeding 120th of an inch in length i could distinguish the subrostrum subcarina the upper and some of the lower latera  filamentary appendagesthese in a mediumsized specimen are arranged on the prosoma in four longitudinal approximate rows there being twelve in each row those in the two outer rows are only half the length of those in the two inner rows those nearest the thorax are the longest there are some papillæ outside the outer rows in a very large specimen with its capitulum 13 in

and even branched in all the specimens at the bases of the first pair of cirri there are on each side a pair of filaments one below the other pointing upwards less than half as long as those on the prosoma also on each side of the mouth there is a longer and thicker filament pointing upwards with a few very minute scattered spines on it the apices of these three pair of filaments as well as of some of the others are roughened with very minute pectinated scales all these filaments were gorged with the branching testes  mouththe parts are closely similar to those in p cornucopia in the mandibles the interspace between the third tooth and the inferior angle is slightly pectinated in the maxillæ there are six or eight pairs of spines between the two upper tufts of fine spines  cirrithese are in most respects similar to those of p cornucopia in a specimen in which the sixth cirrus had eighteen segments the shorter ramus of the first pair had ten segments of which the five lower segments were thick and clothed with doubly serrated spines in the second cirrus the anterior ramus had fifteen segments of which the four basal ones were highly protuberant and thickly clothed with spines these spines and some on the third cirrus and a few on the first cirrus have peculiar bent teeth presently to be described under p polymerus these singularly toothed spines are absent in p cornucopia from the above numbers we see that the first and second pairs of cirri have more segments in proportion to the sixth pair than in p cornucopia and in the second pair a fewer proportional number of the basal segments are protuberant and thickly clothed with spines  caudal appendages shorter than the lower segments of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus with only four articulations rather constricted near the base  the ovigerous fræna consist of very long and prominent folds thinning out to nothing towards the bases of the scuta but not furnished as far as i could see with glands and therefore not normally functional  diagnosis with p cornucopiathe reddishorange colour of the valves alone suffices there is a very slight difference in the larger proportional size of the upper latera and in the outline of the basal margin of the carina in the maxillæ there is in p elegans a greater width between the two upper tufts of fine spines in the cirri the segments in the first pair are more than half as many as those in the sixth pair in the anterior ramus of the second pair only 415ths of the segments are protuberant and brushlike whereas in p cornucopia 512ths are in this

lowest of these whorls there were between eighty and ninety valves and in the whole capitulum from one hundred and seventy to one hundred and eighty the valves in the lower whorls are not of equal

structure and the third thin transparent and marked with arborescent lines which i imagine to be tubes as will be hereafter seen in lithotrya near the exterior surface there are many tubuli it appears to me probable that the strong tendency which the valves in this species have to disintegrate is connected with the unusual quantity of animalized tissue contained by them externally the valves are covered by a strong membrane either white or yellow or white streaked with yellow and marked by lines of growth and by longitudinal sinuous little ridges  peduncle in the upper part of rather less diameter than the capitulum twice or thrice as long as it tapering a little downwards surface of attachment wide and flat calcareous scales minute symmetrically and closely packed together each scale

this hollow there is a false appearance of an open tube running through the scale  attachmentthe surface of attachment is wide the two cementducts after running down the sides of the peduncle in a sinuous course within the longitudinal muscles and close outside the ovarian tubes pass through the corium and then separately form the most abrupt loops or folds these are represented in pl ix fig 2

the thorax i do not doubt that their numbers vary according to the size of the specimen i believe that they are occupied by testes outside these filaments on each side of the prosoma there are two very irregular rows of papillæ intermediate in length between the filaments and the rounded swellings at the bottom of the sack beneath the basal articulation of the first cirrus there is on each side

southern ocean and in another older set from an unknown source several parts of the outer tunic of the animals body presented the remarkable fact of being calcified but to a variable degree whereas in several specimens from california there was no vestige of this encasement considering it most improbable that the calcification of the integuments should be a variable character i most carefully compared the abovementioned sets of specimens valve by valve trophi by trophi and cirri by cirri and found no other difference of any kind therefore i cannot hesitate to consider both to be the same species the first southern specimen which i examined presented the following characters on the prosoma there was a central longitudinal band formed of a thin brittle browncoloured calcified layer which became irregularly rather narrow towards the thorax on each side it sent out six or seven irregular rectangular plates which surrounded and supported the bases of the two rows of filamentary appendages and outside these some of the papilliform projections also had their bases surrounded by small calcified separate rings the thoracic segments corresponding with the second fourth fifth and sixth cirri had on each side an elongated calcified plate on the ventral surface of the thorax between the first and second cirri there were two minute plates in all the cirri excepting the first pair the segments of the rami and in the three posterior pairs the segments of the pedicels had their dorsal surfaces strengthened by oblong quadrilateral calcified shields the upper margins of which are notched for the dorsal tufts of spine and the two lateral margins are also slightly hollowed out these are represented in figure 27 the lower segments of the pedicels of some of the cirri had an additional calcified plate on the anterolateral face  these plates are of a faintbrown or yellowish colour and are conspicuous the degree of calcification differs considerably some are quite brittle and very thin others half horny and effervesce only slightly in acids after having been placed in acid there is no apparent difference between the parts before occupied by the calcified plates and the surrounding membrane these plates however are not superficial but consist of several of the laminæ which together compose the ordinary integument in a calcified condition like the integuments of the body and unlike the valves of the capitulum these calcified plates are thrown off at each exuviation neither the exact shape nor number of the plates corresponded in different individuals nor even on opposite sides of the same individual the margins of the plates often have a sinuous corroded appearance they are moreover often penetrated by minute rounded holes that is by minute rounded noncalcified portions in one specimen from the antarctic expedition there were only here and there a single shield on the segments of the posterior rami and no plate on the prosoma of two specimens in another and older set in the british museum from an unknown locality both had shields on the segments of the cirri but only one had the large plate on the prosoma i may here mention that in one specimen in which the calcified plates were most developed and which was nearly ready to moult there were within the filamentary appendages on the prosoma small irregular balls of calcareous matter appearing to me as if calcareous matter had been morbidly excreted and not like a provision for the future  rangethis species in the present state of our knowledge seems to range further than any other of the genus extending from upper california lat 32° to 35° n across the pacific to at least 32° s perhaps much farther south for it was collected during the antarctic expedition and 32° was the highest latitude traversed by that expedition  affinitiesthis species is closely related to p cornucopia and p elegans but differs rather more from them than these two do from each other in the capitulum the chief distinctive characters arethe more perfect graduation in size and the greater number taking equalsized specimens of the whorls of laterathe darker coloursthe central part of the basal margin of the carina in this species being considerably excisedthe peculiar form of the basal margin of the scutaand lastly the scutal margin of the terga being more hollowed out in the animals body the most obvious distinctive character is the uniarticulate caudal appendage this species agrees with p elegans in the presence of the singular elbowed teeth on some of the spines in the first

single lower whorl of smaller valves these latter vary from 22 in very small specimens to 26 in large specimens the capitulum therefore is formed of at most 34 valves but in the largest specimen seen by me the capitulum being 23 of an inch in width there were only 32 valves in the smallest namely with a capitulum 15 of an inch in width there were 30 valves the valves are remarkably strong and formed of white shelly matter they are closely approximate and overlap each other the scuta and terga are articulated together by a fold the apices of the valves are either worn and disintegrated or they project freely like horns beyond the sack to a much greater extent than in any other recent species of the genus even a considerable portion of the scuta projects obliquely upwards the exterior surfaces of the valves when not worn are covered by a strong yellow membrane and the upper free parts are generally attached together for some little length by this same membrane the valves are plainly marked by the zones of successive growth and most of them are ribbed and furrowed slightly from their umbones to their basal margins the yellow external membrane examined microscopically is marked by or rather formed of numerous growthlines crossed by longitudinal beaded ridges the tubuli are not numerous and of small diameter  scuta pl vii fig 3 a´ a triangular with the apex more or less produced according to the state of its preservation and a little curved towards the terga basal margin and in some degree the tergolateral margin arched and slightly protuberant occludent margin thickened slightly prominent with the inner edge covered by the yellow membrane like the exterior surface of the valve the upper part of the tergolateral margin overlaps a little the edge of the tergum and receives it in a furrowthe two valves being thus locked together this furrow lies in the freelyprojecting membranecovered portion and extends up to the apex it is of variable depth internally the scuta are concave and in some old specimens to a high degree in these latter the basal margin towards the tergolateral side is strongly sinuous the prominences are formed by the terminations of the external longitudinal ridges and correspond to the interspaces between the valves of the lower whorl these ridges which are interesting from throwing light on similar ridges in some fossil species are present both on old and young specimens and run from the apex of the valve in a slightly curved line to the tergolateral half of the basal margin where as we have just seen they sometimes form prominences they consist of three or even four obscure almost confluent ridges of which the middle one is generally but not always the smallest together they cover the whole of that part of the scutum which is not overlapped along the basal margin by the rostrum and large upper latus and they seem evidently due to the growth of the shell in this interspace having been freer so again the three or four small confluent component ridges have the same relation to the interspaces between the small latera of the lower whorl  terga large foursided with the internal growing surface fig 3 a´ b almost diamondshaped basal angle blunt rounded exteriorly from the apex to the basal angle there is a rather broad very slight prominence which bears the same relation to the carina and upper latus as do the compound ridges on the scuta to the rostrum and upper latus the upper part of the scutal margin forms a slightlyprojecting rounded shoulder though variable in its degree of prominence in relation to the variable depth of the recipient furrow in the scuta externally parallel to the occludent margin and close below the prominent shoulder just mentioned there is a slight and variable depression extending up to the apex of the valve this depression is due to the prominence variable in degree of the tergal edge of the recipient furrow in the scuta  carina triangular strong inwardly bowed generally with a large upper portion freely projecting exteriorly with a narrow sharp central ridge or keel which is solid the interior concavity not reaching so deep inner growing surface fig 3 b´ b deeply concave triangular basal margin squarethat is transverse to the longer axis of the carina or it even rises as is best seen in the growthridges a little towards the exterior keel on each side of the central exterior keel there is a narrow longitudinal ridge corresponding with the interspace between the subcarina and the nextbutone latus of the lower whorl the latus next to the subcarina is very small and overlies the ridge itself in a very large specimen these lateral longitudinal ridges formed as they likewise did on the rostrum slight prominences on the basal margin in one specimen the carina was straight  rostrum closely similar in almost every respect to the carina even to the exterior lateral longitudinal ridges and in their relation to the interspaces in the lower whorl the valve is generally not so long but rather wider more inwardly bowed and with the exterior solid keel less prominent than in the carina the inner growing surface fig 3 b´ d is less acuminated at its upper end  upper pair of laterathese are much larger than the remaining valves of the lower whorl they are straight triangular and much acuminated with their apices when well preserved extending far up for fully three fourths of the height of the scuta they nearly equal in length the carina the growing surface fig 3 b´ a is flat triangular in wellpreserved specimens forming only a third or a quarter of the entire length of the valve in the middle of the basal margin there is a very slight prominence corresponding with a slight external central ridge formed as heretofore by the overlapping of two of the valves of the lower whorl basal margin nearly on a level with that of the scuta and with the basal points of the terga the foregoing eight larger valves form the main cavity in which the body of the animal is lodged  valves of the lower whorlthese seen externally seem to belong to more than one whorl but internally their basal margins stand on a level they vary in number as already stated from 22 to 26 i have seen an individual with a valve more on one side than on the other they are of unequal sizes but they are rather variable in this respect the largest are not above half the size of the upper latera three or four pairs together with the subrostrum e and subcarina c are always larger than the others these two latter valves differ from the others only in being more concave seen externally all these valves project considerably and curl a little inwards with their apices generally worn and truncated viewed internally fig 3 b´ whilst the valves are in their proper places the inner and growing surfaces of the smallest are seen to be triangularof the larger some are rhomboidal and others quadrilateral with the upper side much longer than the lower these latter valves overlap the upper parts of the little valves on both sides of them the rhomboidal valves overlap a valve on one side and are overlapped on the other the triangular valves are overlapped on both sides  the corium lining the capitulum is produced into narrow purple crests which enter the interstices between the valves more especially along the line separating the upper and lower whorls there is also a distinct flattened tapering free projection of corium which enters between the carina and subcarina and another between the rostrum and subrostrum  peduncle much compressed short rarely as long as the capitulum in one very large specimen it was extremely short barely one fifth of the length of the capitulum the attached portion which is moderately pointed in young specimens becomes extremely broad in old specimens the calcified scales sometimes differ a little in size in specimens of the same age they are always compactly and symmetrically arranged in old specimens they are much larger than in young ones each scale has at first a transversely elliptic growing base which ultimately becomes nearly circular exteriorly the tips of the scales are always disintegrated they are sometimes clubshaped owing to the scales having been readded to after a period of reduced growth the scales are fringed with brown disintegrating membrane  attachmentat the base of the peduncle the two cementducts running together twist about in a singular manner and at their bends pour forth cement according to the age of the specimen the ducts vary in diameter from 12000th to 52000ths of an inch the two cement glands are small and difficult to find they are retortshaped with two ovarian tubes entering each they lie close together in nearly the centre of the peduncle and less than halfway down it this proximity of the two cementglands and their position low down the peduncle are of interest in relation to the position of these

halfway up the upper segment of the pedicel of the sixth cirrus lower segments flattened the upper tapering and cylindrical all have their upper margins furnished with stiff little spines in a young

narrow ovigerous frænum with a straight edge lying on each side under the line of junction between the scutum and upper latus  affinitiesthis species differs from all the others of the genus in the third cirrus resembling exactly the three posterior pairs in most of its charactersnamely in the symmetrical arrangement of the scales on the peduncle in the considerable size of the valves of the lower whorl in the general approximation of the valves in the multiarticulated caudal appendages in the form of the outer maxillæ in the prominent olfactory orifices in the basal segments of the anterior ramus alone of the second cirrus being paved with bristles there is more affinity to p cornucopia p elegans and p polymerus than to p sertus and p spinosus  in the scuta and terga being articulated together in the union of all the valves by stiff membrane in the peculiar manner in which the valves of the lower whorl overlap each other in the corium entering between some of the valves in filiformed appendages in the near equality of size of the rostrum and carina in the shortness of the peduncle in old specimens in the position of the cementglands and lastly in the characters of the third pair of cirri this species presents a closer affinity to the sessile cirripedes more especially to the chthamalinæ than does any other species of any other genus amongst the lepadidæ the movements however of the four opercular valves are not at all more independent of the other valves than in the other pedunculated cirripedes and the peduncle is furnished with all its characteristic

small  affinitiesthis species makes a very close approach in the general form and relative sizes of all the valves and in the variability of the number of the whorls to p spinosus there is a still closer and more important resemblance in the inequality and manner of growth of the calcareous scales on the peduncle these species differ in the colour of the membrane covering the valves and in the greater development of both rostrum and subrostrum in p sertus the rostrum of the latter is longer than half the length of the carina and its inner surface is more than twice as high as wide and the subrostrum is twice as large as any of the lateraall points of difference from p spinosus  in the characters of the mandibles and more especially of the outer maxillæ in the length of the first pair of cirri in both rami of the second and third cirri having their basal segments brushlike with pectinated spines and in the shape of the caudal appendages there is a close relationship to p spinosus and through this species to scalpellum villosum in the little prominence of the olfactory orifices p sertus differs from most of the allied forms excepting p spinosus in the maxillæ having two prominences bearing fine tufts of bristles in the roughened knobs on the prosoma and in the presence in some individuals of two or three whorls of valves under the carina and rostrum there is a marked

within the tropics  descriptionthe capitulum is not much compressed a horizontal section giving an oval figure it is placed obliquely on the peduncle the scuta descending lower than the terga and carina there are eight valves of which the scuta terga and carina are large the rostrum and a pair of latera are very small and often rudimentary these three latter valves are essentially distinguished from the scales of the peduncle the upper ones of which they sometimes hardly exceed in size by not being moulted at each period of exuviation the latera overlie the carinal half of the terga i presume that they are homologous with the carinal latera in scalpellum each successive layer of shell forming the valves is thick and extends over nearly the whole inner surface hence the carina and terga and to a certain extent the scuta either actually do project freely much beyond the sack or would have done so had not their upper ends been removed for the upper and old layers of shell in most of the species either scale off or disintegrate and wear away a rectangularly projecting rim serrated by small teeth is formed at the bottom of each fresh layer of growth along the external surfaces of each valve see upper part of fig 1 b´ pl viii this structure as well as that of the crenated scales on the peduncle is important for by this means the animal as we shall presently see forms and enlarges the cavity in the rock or shell in which it is imbedded  the scutum overlaps either about one third or even one half of the entire width of the tergum and abuts against a prominent longitudinal ridge on its exterior surface in l truncata and l valentiana this ridge on the tergum being folded over towards the scutum forms a conspicuous furrow receiving the tergal margin of the latter in l valentiana there is a second furrow on the carinal side of the tergum receiving the upper end of the coriumcovered or growing surface of the carina besides these provisions for holding together the valves there are apparently others for a similar purpose thus in each scutum under the rostral angle there is a roughened knoblike tooth which touches the under side of the little rostrum and no doubt serves to give attachment to the membrane uniting the three valves together in some species the adjoining basal margins of the scuta and terga where touching each other are inflected and roughened again in l rhodiopus the carinal angles of the terga are produced into points and in l truncata and l valentiana into prominent roughened knobs which touch two corresponding small knobs on the upper part of the growing surface of the carina moreover considerable portions of the inner surfaces of the scuta and terga are roughened with minute sharp imbricated points apparently for the firmer attachment of the corium the roughened knobs at the rostral angles of the scuta no doubt are homologous with the teeth in a similar position on one or both scuta in lepas and in some fossil species of pollicipes as in p validus the other projections and roughened surfaces are peculiar to lithotrya the growth of all the valves is as in pollicipes simply downwards  the scuta are triangular with their umbones or centres of growth at the apex the tergal margin as seen from within is either nearly straight or much hollowed out accordingly as the scuta simply overlap the terga or are received in a furrow in some of the species there is a distinct pit for the adductor muscle and in others this cannot be distinguished  tergathese present great differences in shape but all appear to be modifications as seen internally of a rhomboidal figure which seems to be the normal form of the terga in the lepadidæ of the lower part of the valve the whole exterior surface with the exception of a narrow ridge running from the apex down to the basal angle is hidden by the overlapping of the scuta latera and carina  the carina in outline is triangular with the basal margin in some species extremely protuberant in the first four species the internal surface is concave in l truncata and l valentiana it is convex with a central raised ridge and consequently the upper freelyprojecting portion of the valve has a prominent central crest or ridge in l nicobarica and l rhodiopus there is only a trace of this ridge the rostrum as before stated is always very small it as well as the latera are most developed in l nicobarica and least in l truncata and l valentiana generally only a few zones of growth are preserved and from their being enlarged at their basal serrated rims the rostrum sometimes appears like a few beads of a necklace strung together  the latera are remarkable from being placed over the carinal half of the terga in an oblique position parallel to the lower carinal margin of the terga a section parallel to the growth layers varies in the different species from elliptic to broadly oval and in l nicobarica it is triangular only a few layers of growth are ever preserved in l truncata where the latera are represented by mere stiles like strings of beads and are even less in width than the rostrum they are imperfectly calcified  microscopical structure of the valvesthe shelly layers are white and generally separate easily so that in l dorsalis it is rare to find a specimen with the upper part of the valves perfect the valves are so translucent that in the thin margins even the tubuli could be sometimes distinguished the valves are coated by strong yellow membrane which after the shelly matter in l dorsalis had been dissolved in acid separated into broad slips answering to each zone of growth on the lower margin of each slip there is a row of closely approximate spines generally slightly hooked pointed 1650th of an inch in length and 110000th of an inch in diameter they arise out of a little fold all are furnished with tubuli of the same diameter with themselves running through the whole thickness of the shelly layers and attached apparently by their apices to the underlying corium as the spines are very numerous so are the parallel rows of tubuli after the shelly layers had been dissolved there was left in l dorsalis well seen in the latera an extraordinary confervalike mass of branching jointed excessively thin tubes sometimes slightly enlarged at the articulations and appearing to contain brown granular matter other portions of the valves instead of this appearance exhibited membranes or films with similar branching articulated tubes or vessels attached to them i have not seen this appearance in any other cirripede the yellow exterior enveloping membrane with its spines is present in all the species of the genus in l rhodiopus these spines are much larger than in l dorsalis and on the inner sides of the carina they are trifid and quadrifid and large enough to be conspicuous with a lens of weak power  pedunclethe most remarkable fact concerning this part is that the outer tunic together with the calcareous scales with which it is covered is moulted at each successive period of exuviation and growth i demonstrated this fact in l dorsalis and l truncata by removing the old tunic and finding a new membrane with perfect calcified scales beneath and as these two species i obtained also pretty good evidence in l nicobarica are at the opposite extremes of the genus no doubt this fact is common to the whole genus i know of no other instance amongst cirripedia in which calcified valves or scales are moulted i am not certain that the whole skin of the peduncle is thrown off in a single piece though this almost certainly is the case with the uppermost and lowest portions the animals body is partly lodged within the peduncle which is generally from one to three times as long as the capitulum and in the upper part is fully as broad as it the scales with which it is clothed extend up in the triangular interspaces between the basal margins of the valves the scales of the upper whorl or of the two or three upper whorls pl viii figs 1 b´ and 3 d are larger than those below and these latter rapidly decrease in size so as to become low down on the peduncle almost or quite invisible to the naked eye the scales in each whorl are placed alternately with those in the whorls above and below all the upper scales are packed rather closely together those in the uppermost row are generally nearly quadrilateral those in the few next succeeding whorls are triangular with their basal margins protuberant and arched the scales low down on the peduncle stand some way apart from each other and generally consist of simple rounded calcareous beads of which some of the smallest in l dorsalis were only 1400th of an inch in diameter in the lowest part of the peduncle these scales after each fresh exuviation are apparently soon worn entirely away by the friction against the sides of the cavity hence in most specimens this part of the peduncle is quite naked this same part however is furnished with nail or rather starheaded little projections of hard yellow horny chitine fig 3 e the star on the summit seems generally to have about five irregular points one star which i measured was 76000th of an inch in total width the footstalk being only 26000th of an inch in diameter the whole projected 106000ths of an inch above the surface of the peduncle from the footstalk a fine tubulus runs through the membrane to the underlying corium these starheaded little points are often much worn down in one specimen which was on the point of exuviation there remained in the lower part close above the basal calcareous cup only some hard smooth yellow little discs on a level with the general surface of the membranethese being the intersected or worn down footstalks with every trace of the calcareous beads gone but in this same specimen under the old peduncular membrane there was a new one studded with the usual circular calcareous beads slightly unequal in size generally about 1400th of an inch in diameter and each furnished with a tubulus but as yet none of the starheaded points of chitine had been formed i believe that these latter are developed from the tubuli leading to the calcified beads and therefore are formed directly under them in l cauta the lowest scales on the peduncle are a little larger than in l dorsalis giving a frosted appearance to it and all of them are serrated fig 3 d round their entire margins generally only the scales in the uppermost or in the three or four upper rows are serrated and this only on their arched and protuberant lower margins the state of the serrated edge varies extremely in the same species from elongated conical teeth to mere notches according to the amount of wear and tear the individual has suffered since the last period of exuviation so also do the teeth or serrated margins on the valves of the capitulum each scale has a fine tubulus passing from the corium through the membrane of the peduncle to its bluntlypointed imbedded fang or base the membrane is transparent thin and tender to a degree i have not seen equalled in the other lepadidæ except perhaps in ibla it is much wrinkled transversely  muscles of the pedunclethese consist of the usual interior and longitudinalexterior and transverseand oblique fasciæ the former are unusually strong downwards they are attached to the basal calcareous cup or disc and upwards they extend all round to the lower curved margins of the valves they are as usual without transverse striæ besides these there are at least in l dorsalis and l nicobarica two little fans of striæless muscles which occur in no other pedunculated cirripede they are attached on each side of the central line of the carina near its base they extend transversely and a little upwards and each fan converges to a point where the lower margins of the carina and terga touch of these muscles the upper fasciæ are the longest their action i conceive must be either to draw slightly together the basal points of the terga and so serve to open their occludent margins or to draw inwards the base of the carina these muscles apparently first shadow forth the posterior or carinal transverselystriated opercular muscles of sessile cirripedes  basal calcareous cup or discsi have seen this part in all the species except l valentiana and in this it probably occurs considering its very close alliance with l truncata the size form and conditions of the cup or disc varies infinitely according to the age size and position of the individual specimen we will commence with a fullsized animal which has ceased to burrow downwards into the rock in which case the discs usually grow into a cup and become largely developed in l dorsalis alone i have seen many specimens so that the following description and remarks though applicable i believe to all the species are drawn up from that alone the cup pl viii fig 1 a´ 1 c´ is hardly ever regular in outline and is either slightly or very deeply concave i have seen one half an inch in diameter it is formed of several thick layers of dirty white translucent calcareous matter with sinuous margins externally the surface is very irregular and is coated by yellow membrane presently to be described the innermost and lastformed layer sometimes covers the whole inside of the cup and extends a little beyond its margin all round but more generally it projects beyond only one side leaving the other sides deserted i have seen a single new layer extending beyond the underlying old layers as much as one sixth of an inch and again i have seen a part of the cup as much as a quarter of an inch in width deserted and covered with serpulæ so irregular however is the growth that after a period an old deserted portion will occasionally be again covered by a new layer though of course without organic adhesion again it sometimes happens that the lastformed layer remaining central is very much less than the older layers in one such instance the innermost and lastformed layer fig 1 a´ had a diameter of only a quarter of that of the whole cup in the middle of which it was placed the cup thus tends to become filled up in the middle the cup in its fully developed condition is seated at the very bottom of the cavity in the rock from the aggregate thickness of the several component layers forming the cup the old and mature animal rises a little in its burrow for instance the bottom of the cup in one specimen which i measured was 410ths of an inch in thickness  in a younger condition before the animal has bored down to the full depth and whilst the cavity is only of moderate diameter the lower part of the peduncle instead of being attached to the inside of a cup adheres to small irregular nearly flat calcareous discs overlapping each other like tiles figs 1 2 a´ they are placed one below the other generally in a straight line and are attached firmly to one side of the burrow the discs are oval or rounded or irregular and are commonly from 120th to 110th of an inch across they usually form a quite straight ribbon widening a little downwards each little disc overlaps and extends beyond the one last formed fully half its own diameter i have seen one row of discs an inch in length but the upper discs are always worn away by the friction of the calcified serrated scales on the peduncle it is very important to observe that the lowest disc is not fixed as was the case with the cup at the very bottom of the burrow but on one side just above the bottom which latter part is occupied by the blunt basal end of the peduncle  in a valuable paper on l nicobarica by reinhardt presently to be referred to the disc is said to be attached on the carinal side see fig 2 of the peduncle and this i believe is general i have seen one instance in which during the excavation of a new burrow an old burrow was met with and the row of discs turned down it making with their previous course nearly a rightangle in another similar instance the discs instead of turning down became very large and broad and so fairly formed a bridge across the old burrow fig 1becoming narrow again as soon as the animal recommenced burrowing into the solid rock sometimes as it appears the animal whilst still small from some unknown cause stops burrowing downwards and then a cup is formed at the bottom of the hole as soon as the animal has got to its full depth the burrow increases only in diameter and during this process the linear row of discs is ground away and lost a cup is then formed the little discs can be deposited or formed only at each fresh exuviation and as some of the burrows are above two inches in depth and as on an average each disc does not extend beyond the underlying disc more than 115th of an inch an animal which has bored two inches in depth must have moulted at least thirty times i may here remark that i have reason to believe from some interesting observations made by mr w thompson of belfast that some sessile cirripedes moult about every fortnight  internal structure of the cupwhen the cup is dissolved in acid each shelly layer is represented by a rather tough palebrown membrane itself composed of numerous fine laminæ which under a oneeighth of an inch object glass exhibit generally only the appearance of a mezzotinto drawing but there often were layers of branching vessels like mossagate less than the 110000th of an inch in diameter and of a darkish colour these vessels are not articulated but otherwise resemble the same peculiar structure in the valves of the capitulum the exterior yellow membrane is marked or rather composed of successive narrow rims which in fact are the lines of termination of the laminæ of membrane which in a calcified state form the cup itself in most parts both on the borders and under the centre of the cup but not everywhere there are imbedded in the yellow membrane elongated irregular topshaped masses of bright yellow chitine each furnished with a tubulus which penetrating the calcareous laminæ leads to the corium the little apertures thus formed are clearly visible in the layers of membrane left after exposure to acid in l nicobarica the innermost shelly layer of the cup was punctured like the surface of the shell in chthamalus and many other sessile cirripedes by the internal orifices of these tubuli the topshaped masses often have starshaped summits and they differ in no essential respects from those on the lower part of the peduncle excepting that they are quite imbedded in the membrane covering the under surface of the cup whereas those on the peduncle project freely i found these topshaped bodies in the outer membrane of the cups in l dorsalis l cauta and l rhodiopus which alone i was enabled to dissolve in acid and i mention this fact as indicating the probable presence of the more important starheaded projections on the lower parts of the peduncle in these same species the basal calcareous cup resembles in essential structure the valves of the capitulum the chief difference being that in the former there is a larger proportion of animal matter or membranous layers  after the dissolution of the cups in l dorsalis and l rhodiopus i most distinctly traced the two cementducts they included the usual darker chord of cellular matter they were of rather small diameter namely 23000th of an inch the two in l dorsalis ran in a very irregular course not parallel to each other making the most abrupt bends they passed through the membranous layers as seen after dissolution and running for short spaces parallel to the component laminæ were attached to them in their irregular course these cementducts resemble those of pollicipes mitella but i could not perceive that any cement had been poured out at the abrupt bends in one specimen of a basal cup which i was enabled to examine whilst still attached to the rock i found under the very centre and of course outside the yellow membrane a very small area of dark brown cement of the usual appearance in several specimens of fullsized cups i was not able to perceive any cement on the external surfaces of the upper and laterformed layers hence i believe that the cup is cemented to the bottom of the hole only during the early stages of its formation and this considering its protected situation would no doubt be sufficient to affix the animal this probably accounts for the small size of the cementducts and for the facility with which as it appears the cups can be removed in an unbroken condition from the rock in the case however of the small flat calcareous discs which are formed whilst the animal is burrowing into the rock these are attached firmly to the sides of the holes in the usual manner by cement in this cirripede it would be useless to look for the prehensile antennæ of the larva under the cup for the animal during the formation of the successive discs must have travelled some distance from the spot on which the larva first attached itself  the membrane of the peduncle is continuous with the yellow membrane coating the external surface of the cup and this latter membrane is continuous with those delicate laminæ which in a calcified condition form the layers of the cup itself in an exactly similar manner in this and other cirripedes the membrane of the peduncle at the top is continuous with that coating the valves and is attached to the lower exterior edge of the lastformed layer of shell when a new shelly layer is formed both under the valves of the capitulum and inside the basal calcareous cup it projects beyond the old layer and is included within the old as yet not moulted membrane of the peduncle within the cup of l nicobarica i found a latelyformed layer of shell projecting 110th of an inch on one side of the cup and by its protuberance distinguishable even through the old coat of the peduncle which was nearly ready to be moulted in an analogous manner in the capitulum of l dorsalis and l truncata i have found a new peduncular membrane bearing the usual but then sharp calcified scales attached to the lower projecting edge of the lastformed shelly layer lying under the old peduncular membrane which was attached to the penultimate layer of shell and with its worn scales was just ready to be moulted  the final cause of the moulting of the calcified scales together with the membrane of the peduncle to which they are attacheda case confined to lithotryai have scarcely any doubt is the reproduction of a succession of scales sharply serrated for the purpose of enlarging the cavity in which the animal is lodged the extreme thinness of the membrane of the peduncle has been noticed this may be partly related to its protected condition but partly i think to the necessity of its being formed in a very extensible condition for the new coat owing to the projection of the new shelly layers under the valves and within the basal cup is by so much shorter than the old peduncle yet after exuviation it has to stretch to a greater length than the old membrane to allow of the growth of the cirripede owing to the thinness and fragility of this membrane the basal attachment of the cirripede is no doubt chiefly effected by the unusually strong longitudinal muscles and the necessity of a surface of attachment for these muscles stronger than the external membrane of the peduncle probably is one of the final causes of the basal calcareous disc and cup and likewise for the unusual manner in which the valves of the capitulum are locked together by folds and small roughened projections the basal discs and cup however apparently serve for several other purposes namely for raising the animal a little in its burrow which is narrow and pointed at the bottom at that period of growth when it has ceased to burrow downwards but still increases in diameter also for carrying the animal as over a bridge across any preexisting cavity in the rock and lastly perhaps for removing lower down in the intervals of exuviation the point of attachment for the longitudinal peduncular muscles  position of the animal in the rock and its power of excavationa specimen of rock two or three inches square in mr cumings possession is full of lithotryas the cavities extend in every possible direction and several were parallel but with the animals in reversed positions the same thing is apparent in some specimens of mr stutchburys and it was evident that the positions occupied by the animals were entirely due to chance in mr cumings specimen of rock a considerable portion of the external surface is preserved and here it can be seen that many of the specimens have their capitulums directed from the external surface directly inwards these individuals which were of full size must have preyed on infusoria inhabiting the cavities of the porous calcareous rock on the other hand i have seen some young specimens of l dorsalis with their valves not at all rubbed and others of full size with uninjured balani and corallines on the tips of the valves and again a specimen of l truncata with minute palegreen seaweed on the summit of the capitulumall which appearances induce me to believe that in these cases the valves had projected freely beyond the cavity in which their peduncles were lodged i may here also mention that in mr cumings specimen above alluded to the basal cups of five specimens touched and adhered to each other i was not able to make out whether there had originally existed separate burrows as i think is most probable and that the walls had been wholly worn away or whether the five specimens had fixed themselves on one side of a large preexisting common cavity young specimens seem to burrow to the full depth before nearly acquiring the diameter which they ultimately attain i measured one burrow 12 of an inch in depth which at its mouth or widest part was only 17 in diameter  the several species occur imbedded in soft calcareous rocks in massive corals and in the shells of mollusca and of cirripedes it has been doubted by several naturalists whether the basal calcareous cup at all belongs to the lithotrya but after the foregoing microscopical observations on its structure it is useless to discuss this point so again it has been doubted whether the cavity is formed by the cirripede itself but there is so obvious a relation between the diameters of specimens of various sizes and the holes occupied by them that i can entertain no doubt on this head the holes moreover are not quite cylindrical but broadly oval like the section of the animal the simple fact that in this genus alone each fresh shelly layer round the bases of the valves and therefore at the widest part of the capitulum are sharply toothed and secondly that in this genus alone a succession of sharply serrated scales on the upper and widest part of the peduncle are periodically formed at each exuviation and that consequently the teeth on the valves and scales are sharp and fit for wearing soft stone at that very period when the animal has to increase in size would alone render the view probable that the lithotrya makes or at least enlarges the cavities in which it is imbedded  although it may be admitted that lithotrya has the power of enlarging its cavity how does it first bore down into the rock it is quite certain that the basal cup is absolutely fixed and that neither in form nor state of surface it is at all fitted for boring66 i was quite unable to answer the foregoing question until seeing the admirable figures by reinhardt67 pl viii figs 2 and 2 a´ of l nicobarica still attached in its cavity subsequently i obtained from mr stutchbury several pieces of rock completely drilled with holes many of small diameter by l dorsalis and in these i found numerous instances of the linear rows of little discs like those of l nicobarica showing in the plainest manner that each time a new disc is formed that is at each exuviation the animal moves a short step downwards and as the lowest of these little discs in none of the burrows was placed at the very bottom we see that the lowest point of the peduncle must be the wearing agent in the peduncle of an individual of l dorsalis nearly ready to moult i found it may be remembered beneath and round the basal disc under the old membrane of the peduncle a new membrane studded with calcified beads but with the horny starheaded spines not yet developed whilst on the old outer coat these latter had been worn down quite smooth and the calcified beads worn entirely away here then we have an excellent rasping surface with respect to the power of movement necessary for the boring action the peduncle is amply furnished with transverse oblique and longitudinal striæless musclesthe latter attached to the basal disc in all the pedunculata i have reason to believe that these muscles are in constant slight involuntary action this being the case i conceive that the small blunt spurlike portion of the peduncle descending beneath the basal rim of the lowest disc would inevitably partake slightly of the movements of the whole distended animal as soon as the lithotrya has reached that depth which its instinct points out as most suitable to its habits the discs are converted into an irregularly growing cup and the animal then only increases in diameter enlarging its cavity by the action of the serrated scales on the peduncle and of the serrated lower edges of the valves of the capitulum with respect to those reversed individuals attached with their capitulums downwards i suppose that the larvæ had crept into some deep cavity perhaps made originally by a lithotrya of which the rock in the specimen in question was quite full and had there attached themselves finally it appears that in lithotrya the burrowing is simply a mechanical action it is effected by each layer of shell in the basal attached discs overlapping in a straight line the lastformed layerby the membrane of the peduncle and the valves of the capitulum having excellent and often renewed rasping surfacesand lastly by the end of the peduncle that is homologically the front of the head thus roughened extending beyond the surface of attachment and possessing the power of slight movement     66 mr hancock in his admirable account of his burrowing    cirripede alcippe lampas annals of nat hist nov 1849    p 313 came to this conclusion regarding the cup of lithotrya    and hence was led to think that this genus did not form its own    burrows but inhabited preexisting cavities i am much indebted    to this gentleman who has been so eminently successful in his    researches on the boring powers of marine animals for giving me    his opinion on several points connected with the present    discussion     67 i owe to the great kindness of prof steenstrup the sight of    this plate published in the scientific communications from the    union of natural history copenhagen january 30 1850 no i    since this sheet has been set up in type i have received from    prof steenstrup the memoir in danish belonging to the figures    in question and the greater part of this has been translated to    me by the kindness of a friend my account of the means of    burrowing is essentially the same as that published by reinhardt    but the moulting of the scales on the peduncle the presence of    scales and of points of a different nature the method of    attachment by cement the conversion of the discs into a cup    c seem not to have been known to this naturalist reinhardt    states that the points on the peduncle will scratch iceland spar    and that apparently they are formed of phosphate of lime in    the case of the closelyallied l dorsalis i must believe that    the scales or beads on the peduncle are formed of carbonate of    lime for they were quickly dissolved with effervescence in    acetic acid and the starheaded points which are subsequently    developed under the calcareous scales appeared to me under the    compound microscope to be formed of a horn or chitine substance    reinhardt states that the basal point of the peduncle is arched a    little under the lowest disc and there forms for itself a slight    furrow as represented in the lateral view pl viii fig 2    but in the burrows examined by me this furrow or depression did    not really exist the appearance resulting from the basal margin    of the lowest disc projecting beyond the wall of the cavity by    the amount of its own slight thickness                                       we will now proceed with our generic description  animals bodythis as already stated is partially lodged within the peduncle the prosoma is rather largely developed  the mouth is placed at a moderate distance from the adductor muscle  the labrum is moderately bullate with a row of blunt beadlike teeth mingled with fine bristles on the crest which in the middle part is generally somewhat flattened  the palpi are blunt and even squarely truncated at their ends they are of large size so that if they had been half as large again or even less their tips would have met  mandibles pl x fig 2 with three nearly equal large teeth and the inferior angle produced broad and strongly pectinated in the interspaces between these teeth there are in all the species some very fine teeth or pectinations which are seated a little on one side of the medial line the mandibles are somewhat singular from the size of the transparent flexible apodemes a a to which the muscles are attached these are oval and constricted at their origins in l dorsalis they are roughened with little points in l cauta and l truncata they are large of the same shape but smooth  maxillæthese are larger compared to the mandibles than is usual with pedunculated cirripedes they differ in shape in the different species being either nearly straight on their edge and notched or not fig 10 or notched with the inferior part forming a double prominence fig 12 the spines on the inferior angle which is sometimes slightly produced are always crowded together into a brush and are finer than those on the upper parts the apodemes are less straight than is usual and at their origin take in all the species a rather abrupt bend their extremity is enlarged into a little disc which in l dorsalis is covered with strong points but in the other species is as usual smooth  outer maxillæthe inner margin is slightly concave and in l truncata alone the bristles are hardly continuous being interrupted in the middle part the olfactory orifices are only very slightly prominent the spines on all the trophi are more or less doubly serrated  cirrithe three posterior pair are elongated with their anterior surfaces not at all protuberant the segments bear from three to five pair of spines with a row of three or four small intermediate spines there are as usual some little lateral upper rim spines the dorsal tufts contain some thick and thin spines mingled first cirrus is short and placed not quite close to the second pair the basal segments are broad and thickly paved with bristles the second pair is rather short compared with the third pair a varying number of the basal segments in both rami of both these cirri are protuberant and are thickly paved with bristles such segments are more numerous and are broader on the anterior rami than on the posterior rami in l cauta alone none of the basal segments in the posterior rami of the second and third cirri are thickly paved with bristles the pedicels of the first three pair are irregularly covered with spines those of the three posterior pair have the spines arranged in a regular double line most of the spines are doubly serrated  caudal appendages pl x fig 23 and 24 multiarticulate with thin elongated segments fringed with short spines in length generally exceeding the pedicel of the sixth cirrus

seminales extending into the prosoma i noticed the ovigerous fræna only in l truncata here they were large with an almost bilobed outline the margin and whole lateral surface being covered with elongated cylinders finely pointed but not enlarged at their extremities as are the glands observed in most of the other genera  coloursthe posterior thoracic segments the pedicels the anterior and dorsal surfaces of the segments of the cirri the caudal appendages and the outer sides of the trophi are in most of the species more or less mottled with dark purple parts of the interior surfaces of the valves in some of the species are coloured fine purple  geographical distributionthe species are found all round the world in the tropical seas this fact may have some connection with the presence of soft coralreef limestone and of massive corals in these seas the presence however of l cauta on the shores of new south wales shows that the genus is not strictly tropical  affinitieslithotrya is a wellpronounced distinct genus although there is a considerable difference in the shape of the valves between l dorsalis and l valentiana at the opposite extremes of the genus the strict uniformity of the internal characters shows that there are no grounds whatever for any generic separation moreover l rhodiopus neatly blends together these extreme forms indeed it is not easy to imagine a better marked series of transitional forms than those presented by the terga in passing from l dorsalis through l nicobarica l rhodiopus and l truncata to l valentiana lithotrya has most affinity to scalpellum villosum or to pollicipes spinosus and p sertus though the affinity is far from close in these two species of pollicipes we have seen that large irregular calcified spines are formed at the base of the peduncle whereas in the other pedunculata the scales or spines are formed exclusively round the upper margin of the peduncle lithotrya as has been remarked by sowerby and other authors exhibits some affinity to the sessile cirripedes as shown by the calcareous basisby the manner in which the scuta and terga are locked togetherby the two little fans of muscle attached to near the basal points of the tergaand perhaps by some of the characters of the trophi nevertheless this affinity is far from being wellmarked and i think is hardly so plain as in pollicipes mitella   1

arched and protuberant with a slight fold above the knob on the carinal margin just mentioned this fold is caused by the protuberance of the central internal ridge of the carina but is so small that

the margin of the scuta this fold as seen on the inner coriumcovered surface fig 5 a descends below the roughened knob at the upper angle of the carinal margin which is not the case with the slight fold in the same place in l truncata its presence seems caused by the edge of the central internal crest in the upper part of the carina being square instead of round as in l truncata and thus more

above two authors are described as small and the a villosa was suspected by brugière to be young the a hirsuta is said by conrad to have the valves minutely striated granulated and covered by a strong hirsute epidermis the scuta compared with the other valves are very large the entire length of this specimen was a quarter of an inch the a villosa is described as having smooth valves and apparently the peduncle alone is hirsute now in young individuals of lepas australis the peduncle is hairy whilst in fullgrown specimens it is quite smooth again in some varieties of l fascicularis the thorax prosoma and cirri are hirsute whereas they are generally quite smooth hence i am inclined to suspect that a villosa is the young in a state of variation of l anatifera and that a hirsuta bears a similar relation to l anserifera in lamarcks animaux sans vertèbres pollicipes villosus of sowerby is quite incorrectly given as a synonym to the above a villosa     69 the anatifa hirsuta of quoy and

to decide whether to place it in lepas or pæcilasma it is briefly described and pretty well figured in the above work it was procured at new zealand but it is not stated to what object it was attached the capitulum is much elongated and one inch in length the peduncle is from six to eight lines long the carina is said to be very narrow it is not stated whether it terminates downwards in a fork or disc judging from the figure it extends some way up between the terga the basal ends of which are bluntly pointed the scuta are almost quadrilateral the peduncle is short yellow and tuberculated the general appearance of the drawing makes me suspect that it is a pæcilasma     clyptra leach zoological journal vol ii p 208 july         1825  leach has most briefly characterised a specimen in savignys museum from the red sea under the above name of clyptra it has only four valves and its peduncle is smooth by the latter character it is distinguished from ibla apparently this is a distinct

stipite lamellosâ it is found attached to gorgonia placomus in the north sea i suspect that this is the common scalpellum vulgare and that stroem counted the valves only on one side overlooking the
