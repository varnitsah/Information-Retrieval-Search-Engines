34010745	handbook to the new goldfields by rm ballantyne    this book was one of several books written by ballantyne in or about 1858 for nelson the publishers  from a literary point of view it does not rank very high because it was a potboiler and not one of ballantynes dashing and spirited books for teenagers  there were three other books in this category and we do not rate very high our chances of finding any of them and adding it to our collection  much of the book consists of long quotes from the times correspondent i am not sure but i think that should really be read as the new york times correspondent  there are also long letters from the governor of the area a british colony to the british government and their answers  of course there were long intervals between these letters and their replies because they had to cross the north american continent and then the atlantic by sailing vessel  this book turned up in the early canadiana online collection of early books about canada and the scans of the pages to be found on the canadiana website were acquired using the very new 2005 screen grabbing tool created by abbyy  canadiana publish their scans at five different scales of which we used the middle one except for the appendix where we used the largest size and ocred it in the usual manner  the reason for this was that the font size used by nelsons for the appendix was much smaller than that used for the bodytext of the book  the rest of the work was done using our athelstane editing programs just as we do all other books  so doing it was something of a technical feat    handbook to the new goldfields by rm ballantyne    introduction  handbook to the new eldorado  the problem of colonisation in the northwestern portion of british america is fast working itself out  the same destiny which pushed forward anglosaxon energy and intelligence into the rich plains of mexico and which has peopled australia is now turning the current of emigration to another of the wasteplaces of the earth  the discovery of extensive goldfields in the extreme west of the territories now occupied by the hudsons bay company is a great fact  it no longer comes to us as the report of interested adventurers or the exaggeration of a few sanguine diggers but with wellauthenticated resultslarge quantities of gold received at san francisco and a consequent rush of all nations from the gold regions of california as well as from the united states and canada  the thirst for gold is as it always has been the most attractive the strongest the most unappeasable of appetitesthe impulse that builds up or pulls down empires and floods the wilderness with a sudden population  in those wild regions of the far west men are pouring in one vast goldsearching tide of thousands and tens of thousands into the comparatively unknown territory beyond the rocky mountains for which our legislature has just manufactured a government  how strange is the comparison instituted by the times between the rush to fraser river and the mediaeval crusades which carried so large a portion of the population of europe to die on the burning plains of palestine  at clermont ferrand peter the hermit has concluded his discourse cries are heard in every quarter it is the will of god  it is the will of god every one assumes the cross and the crowd disperses to prepare for conquering under the walls of the earthly a sure passage to the heavenly jerusalem  what elevation of motive what faith what enthusiasm  compare with this the picture presented by san francisco harbour  a steamer calculated to carry 600 persons is laden with 1600  there is hardly standing room on the deck it is almost impossible to clear a passage from one part of the vessel to the other  the passengers are not knights and barons but tradesmen jobbers tenants and workmen of all the known varieties  their object in of the earth earthywealth in its rawest and rudest form gold the one thing for which they bear to live or dare to die although in the comparison the crusades may have the superiority in many points yet so little have ideal romantic and sentimental considerations to do with the current of human affairs that while the crusades remain a monument of abortive and objectless folly fatal to those who embarked in them and leaving as their chief result a tinge of asiatic ferocity on european barbarism the exodus of san francisco notwithstanding the material end it has in view is sure to work out the progress of happiness and civilisation and add another to the many conquests over nature which the present age has witnessed  in a year more than ordinarily productive of remarkable events one of the most noteworthy and that which is likely to leave a lasting impression on the world is this discovery of gold on the coasts of the pacific  the importance of the new region as a centre for new ramifications of english relations with the rest of the world cannot well be exaggerated either in a political or a commercial point of view it will be the first really important point we shall have ever commanded on that side of the pacific ocean and it cannot but be of inestimable value in developing our relations with america china japan and eastern russia  this new discovery must also tend to make the western shore of the american continent increasingly attractive from frasers river down to peru the rivers all bear down treasures of a wealth perfectly inestimable  emigration must necessarily continue to flow and increase gold digging is soon learned and there will be an immense demand for every kind of labour at almost fabulous prices  it is further valuable as tending to open up a direct communication from the atlantic to the pacific and from europe across the continent of america to india and china  this is a grand idea and the colonial minister who carries it out will accomplish a greater thing than any of his predecessors for he will open up the means of carrying english civilisation to the whole of that vast continent and to the eastern world  the pioneers in this movement will conquer the territory not with arms in their hands but with the goldrocker the plough the loom and the anvil the steamboat the railway and the telegraph  commerce and agriculture disenthralled by the influences of free institutions will cause the new empire to spring into life full armed like minerva from the brain of jupiter  its pacific ports will be thronged with ships of all nations its rich valleys will blossom with natures choicest products while its grand rivers will bear to the sea the fruits of free and honest labour  great as have been our achievements in the planting of colonies we have never entered upon a more magnificent work than the one now before us in which the united energies of the two great branches of the anglosaxon race will be engaged heart and hand  while the present volume is intended chiefly for those desiring information on the subject of the gold discoveries it also addresses itself to the general public for the condition and character of the country and its inhabitants cannot fail to be a subject of inquiry with all who can appreciate the importance of its situation  the book lays claim to no merit but that of careful collation  little information is given but what is derived from sources of general access but it does profess to set forth the truth as far as that could be obtained from the conflicting statements of different parties  while the following pages will be found to contain ample proof as to the extent and richness of the gold fields as well as the salubrity of the climate it is satisfactory to be able to state here that the country is proved to be easily accessible both for english and american merchandise  the public have now certain though unofficial news of the journey of the governor of vancouvers island as far as fort hope about one hundred miles above the mouth of the fraser river and seventy above fort langley  this voyage has established the extremely important fact that the river is navigable for steamers at least up to this point where the mines are now known to be of extraordinary wealth although it is reported that their yield regularly increases as the stream is ascended  it is now proved that these districts are actually within from fifteen to twentythree hours steam of victoria the principal town of the vancouvers island colony  it is difficult to exaggerate the importance of this fact  it is true that the same voyage which the steamer carrying the governor of vancouvers island successfully performed was attempted without success by another steamer about the same timea fact which probably indicates that the river will be navigable only for vessels of small draught and possibly perhaps not equally navigable at all seasons for we must remember that in the early part of june when this attempt was successfully made the waters of the river had already begun to rise in consequence of the melting of the snow from the rocky mountains from which it springs  but they were then by no means at their full height and even if the river be only navigable by vessels of small draught that is a fact of very little importance as compared with the certainty that it is navigable at all to so considerable a height  fort hope is as we have said about one hundred miles up the riverthat is to say about one hundred and ninety from victoria in vancouvers island the voyage across the gulf of georgia being about ninety miles  the rich diggings between fort yale and fort hope are therefore not so far from the fertile land of vancouvers island as london from hull and the distance from victoria to the mouth of the river where gold is at present found inconsiderable quantities is not so great as the distance from liverpool to dublin now as almost all the importance of a mining district depends on easy communication with a provision marketand the very richest will be rendered comparatively insignificant if provisions can only be carried thither at enormous cost and labourno fact has yet been established of more importance than the easy navigability of the fraser river immediately above fort yale which is twelve miles higher up the river than the point reached by the steamer a succession of cataracts begin which of course interrupt all navigation but thence even to the forks or junction between the fraser and thompson rivers there is certainly not more than one hundred miles of road which as we learn from the government map are mostly practicable for loaded waggons hence it is evident that the new gold district will be easily accessible both for english merchandise from england and for the provision market of vancouvers island  in explanation and refutation of the prejudice which almost universally exists against the climate and soil of north america generally but especially of the divisions included in the hudsons bay companys territories we cannot do better than quote the following just remarks from the reverend mr nicolays treatise on oregon  he says  a predisposition towards one opinion or bias to one side of an argument too often warps both the judgment and the understanding and one man in consequence sees fertile plains where another could see only arid wastes on which even the lizards appear starving while the other looks forward to their being covered with countless flocks and herds at no very distant period of time  both cook and vancouver having previously made up their minds against the existence of a river near parallel 46 degrees passed the columbia without perceiving it and the former even declared most decidedly that the strait seen by juan de fuca had its origin only in the fertility of the pilots brain  as they were discovered to be in error so it is not impossible that others not less positive in their assertions may be convicted of the same carelessness of examination as those navigators so remarkable in all other respects for their accuracy and so indefatigable and minute in their researches that little has been left to their successors but to check their work  with respect however to the attributed barrenness of great part of the territory so peremptorily insisted on by many there is some excuse for the earlier travellers from whom that opinion is derived  ignorant of the best routes and frequently famishing in the immediate neighbourhood of plenty they most justly reflect back to others the impressions they received but in so doing though they speak truth they give very erroneous ideas of the country they think themselves to be describing most accurately and of this very pregnant examples are found in the travels of lewis and clarke and the party who came overland to astoria both struck the head waters of the saptin both continued its course to its junction with the main stream both sufferedthe latter party intensely but had they by the fertile bottoms of bear and rosseaux rivers found access to the valley between the cascade and blue mountainsor keeping still further west crossed the former range into that of the wallamette they would have found game been banished from their pages and the oregon would have appeared in her holiday attire  a nymph of healthiest hue  and the depth of ravines and the elevation of rocks and precipices would have been changed into the unerring evidences of fertility and luxuriance of vegetation afforded by the dense forests and gigantic pinetrees of the coast district  we can scarce estimate the transition of feeling and change which would have been produced in their estimate of the country if they could have been suddenly transported from their meagre horsesteakcut from an animal so jaded with travel as to be in all probability only saved from death by starvation and fatigue by being put to death to save overwearied men from famine and this cooked at a fire of bois de vache with only the shelter of an overhanging rockto the fat venison and savoury wildfowl of the woods and lakes broiled on the glowing hardwood embers under the comfortable roof of sheltering bark or the leafy shade of the monarch of the forest while the cheerful whinny of their wellfed beasts would have given joyful token that nature in her bounty had been forgetful of nothing which her dependent children could desire  while such and so great is the power of circumstances to vary the impressions made upon the senses some hesitation must be used in their reception until fully confirmed or they must be limited by other accounts as unbiassed judgment may direct especially as the temperament of individuals may serve to heighten the colouring whether sombre or sunny in which circumstances may have depicted the landscape it is not every traveller who can with mackenzie expatiate on the beauty of scenery while in fear of treachery from fickle and bloody savages or like fremont though dripping from the recent flood and uncertain of the means of existence even for the day his arms clothes provisions instruments deep in the whirlpools of the foaming platte stop to gaze with admiration on the fantastic ruins nature has piled among her mountain fastnesses while from his bare and bleeding feet he draws the sharp spines of the hostile cacti  truth from travellers is consequently for the most part relative  abstractedly with reference to any country it must be derived from the combined accounts and different phases of truth afforded by many    chapter one  richness and extent of the gold fields  destiny which has lately riveted our attention on the burning plains of the extreme east says the times of 9th july now claims our solicitude for the auriferous mountains and rushing rivers of the far west and the shores of the remote pacific  what most of us know of these ultraoccidental regions may be summed up in a very few words  we have most of us read washington irvings charming narrative of astoria sympathised with the untimely fate of captain thorn and his crew and read with breathless interest the wanderings of the pilgrims to the head waters of the columbia  after thirty years the curtain rises again on the stormy period of the ashburton treaty when the patriots were bent upon whipping the britishers out of every acre of land on the western side of the rocky mountains  and now for the third time we are recalled to the same territory no longer as the goal of the adventurous trader or the battle ground of the political agitator but as a land of promisea new el dorado to which men are rushing with all the avidity that the presence of the one thing which all men in all times and in all places insatiably desire is sure to create  this el dorado lies between the rocky mountains and the pacific it is bounded on the south by the american frontier line 49 degrees of latitude and may be considered to extend to the sources of fraser river in latitude 55 degrees  it is therefore about 420 miles long in a straight line its average breadth from 250 to 300 miles  taken from corner to corner its greatest length would be however 805 milesand its greatest breadth 400 miles mr arrowsmith computes its area of square miles including queen charlottes island at somewhat more than 200000 miles  of its two goldbearing rivers one the fraser rises in the northern boundary and flowing south falls into the sea at the southwestern extremity of the territory opposite the southern end of vancouvers island and within a few miles of the american boundary the other the thompson river which rises in the rocky mountains and flowing westward joins the fraser about 150 miles from the coast  it is on these two rivers and chiefly at their confluence that the gold discoveries have been made  fraser river is about as famous a point as there is today on the earths surfaceas famous as were the californian diggings in 1848 or the australian gold mines in 1853  it is now the centre of attraction for the adventurous of all countries  the excitement throughout the canadas and northern states of america is universal  in fact the whole interior of north america is quite in a fermentthe entire floating population being either on the move or preparing to start while traders cattledealers contractors and all the enterprising persons in business who can manage to leave are maturing arrangements to join the general exodus  persons travelling in the mining regions reckon that in three months 50000 souls will have left the state of california alone  the rapidity and extent of this emigration has never been paralleled  it is now established that the district of british columbia holding a relation to pugets sound similar to that of sacramento valley to the bay of san francisco contains rich and extensive gold beds  the fraser river mines have already been mentioned in the british parliament as not less valuable and important than the gold fields in australia geologists have anticipated such a discovery and governor stevens in his last message to the legislative assembly of washington territory claims that the district south of the international boundary is equally auriferous  the special correspondent of the san francisco bulletin a reliable authority writes from fort langley twentyfive miles up the fraser under date the 25th may that he had just come down from fort yale where he found sixty men and two hundred indians with their squaws at work on a bar of about five hundred yards in lengthcalled hills bar one mile below fort yale and fifteen miles from fort hope all trading posts of the hudsons bay company  the morning i arrived two men kerrison and company cleaned up five and ahalf ounces from the rocker the product of half a days work  kerrison and company the next day cleaned up ten and ahalf ounces from two rockers which i saw myself weighed  this bar is acknowledged to be one of the richest ever seen and well it may be for here is a product of fifteen and ahalf ounces of gold worth 247 and a half dollars or 50 pounds sterling from it in a day and ahalf to the labour of two rockers  old californian miners say they never saw such rich diggings  the average result per day to the man was fully 20 dollars some much more  the gold is very fine so much so that it was impossible to save more than twothirds of what went through the rockers  this defect in the rocker must be remedied by the use of quicksilver to amalgamate the finer particles of gold  this remedy is at hand for california produces quicksilver sufficient for the consumption of the whole world in her mountains of cinnabar  supplies are going on by every vessel  at sailor diggings above fort yale they are doing very well averaging from 8 to 25 dollars per day to the man  i am told that the gold is much coarser on thompson river than it is in fraser river  i saw yesterday about 250 dollars of coarse gold from thompson river in pieces averaging 5 dollars each  some of the pieces had quartz among them  hill who was the first miner on the bar bearing his name just above spoken of with his partner has made some 600 dollars on it in almost sixteen days work  three men just arrived from sailor diggings have brought down 670 dollars in dust the result of twelve days work gold very fine  rising of the river driving the miners off for a time  correspondents from several places on the sound both on the british and american territories men of various nationalities have since written that the country on the fraser river is rich in gold and equal to any discoveries ever made in california  the times correspondent writing from vancouvers island on 10th june says the gold exists from the mouth of fraser river for at least 200 miles up and most likely much further but it has not been explored hitherto any one working on its banks has been able to obtain gold in abundance and without extraordinary labour the gold at present obtained has been within a foot of the surface and is supposed to have averaged about ten dollars per diem to each man engaged in mining  of course some obtain more some less but all get gold  thompson river is quite as rich in gold as fraser river  the land about thompson river consists of extensive sandy prairies which are loaded with gold also in fact the whole country about fraser and thompson rivers are mere beds of gold so abundant as to make it quite disgusting  i have already seen pounds and pounds of it and hope before long to feast my eyes upon tons of the precious metal  and the same high authority writes on 17th junethere is no longer room to doubt that all the country bordering on fraser river is one continuous gold bed  miners abandoning the partially exhausted placers of california are thronging to this new dorado and the heretofore tranquil precincts of victoria are now the scene of an excitement such as was witnessed at san francisco in 1849 or since in melbourne  land has run up to prices fabulously high and patches that six months ago were perhaps grudgingly purchased at the colonial price of 20 shillings the acre are reselling daily at a hundred times that amount  the small number of steam ships hitherto found sufficient for the commerce between san francisco and these vicinities no longer suffices to convey a tithe of the eager applicants for passage  an opening for the enterprise of british capitalists such as was not anticipated has thus suddenly arisen and the opportunity will of course be seized with alacrity  lest i should appear too sanguine in my representations i will cite one instance to illustrate the richness of these newly discovered diggings  three men returned for provisions lately after an absence of seven days they had during this interval extracted 179 ounces of gold i state this fact on the authority of governor douglas who has just returned from the mining regions whither he went with the view of establishing certain regulations for the maintenance of order  in short all who have visited the mines are impressed with the conviction that their richness far excels that of california in its palmiest days  and again the correspondent of the new york times in a letter dated 21st june gives the following corroborative testimonythe gold is found everywhere and even during the extreme height of the river parties are averaging from ten to twenty dollars per day digging in the banks or on the upper edge of the bars nearly all of which are overflowed  big strikes of from fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars are frequently reported  nearly all the work at present is carried on between forts langley and yale and for some twenty or thirty miles above the latter an entire distance along the river of about a hundred miles  some few are digging on harrison river and other tributaries where the gold is found in larger particles  those who were engaged in mining on the forks of thompson river shew still richer yields but have been compelled to leave on account of the high stage of the water the want of provisions and the opposition of the indians  the gold where the most men are located upon the bars of the river is found in very minute particles like sand  no quicksilver has been used as yet but when that is attainable their yield is sure to be greatly augmented at hills bar those at work had averaged fifty dollars per day the whole time they had been there  the indians all have gold and are as much excited as the whites  it is of no use to cite various reports of individual successes in this or that locality  the impression of all who have gone is unanimous and conclusive as to the great facts of new gold fields now being explored equal to any ever yet developed in california or elsewhere  no steamer has yet returned with more than twelve or fifteen passengers and nearly every one of these had come down to obtain supplies for himself or his party left behind in the diggings  they all say they are going back in a few weeks  the following personal testimony may also be citedon sunday says the san francisco globe we received a visit from messrs edward campbell and joseph blanch both boatmen well known in this city who have just returned from the mines on fraser river  they mined for ten days on the bar until compelled to desist from the rise in the river in which time they took out 1340 dollars  they used but one rocker and have no doubt that they could have done much better with proper appliances  there were from sixty to seventy white men at work on hills bar and from four to five hundred indians men women and children  the indians are divided in opinion with regard to americans the more numerous party headed by pollock a chief are disposed to receive them favourably because they obtain more money for their labour from the bostons than from king georges men as they style the english  they have learned the full value of their labour and instead of one dollar aday or an old shirt for guiding and helping to work a boat up the river they now charge from five to eight dollars per day  another portion of the indians are in favour of driving off the bostons being fearful of having their country overrun by them  the proprietor of the san francisco news letter had determined to be at the centre of the present excitement in the el dorado and to judge for himself or rather to solve the problem of how much gold how many indians and how much humbug went on board the pacific mail steamship cortes captain horner and made the passage to victoria 840 miles in five days  although nine hundred persons were on board yet no actual inconvenience was felt by the highpressure packing the greatest good humour and accommodating spirit prevailing controlled by the gentlemanly conduct of captain jb horner and his officers  on the day of arrival the operations of the government land office at the fort in victoria was 26000 dollars  the importance of the amount can best be realised by comparing it with the prices viz 100 dollars per lot 60 by 100 feet unsurveyed  some of these lots have been sold at 200 to 1000 dollars  lots at first sale surveyed price 50 dollars lots second and last sale 100 dollars each are now being sold from 500 to 1000 dollars each  six lots together in the principal street are valued at 10000 dollars  the figures at esquimault harbour and lots in that vicinity assume a bolder character as to value from the fact that the harbour is a granitebound basin similar to victoria with an entrance now wide and deep enough to admit the leviathan  victoria has a bar which must be dredged dug or blown away  we noted at victoria that the most valuable lot with a flat granite level with thirty feet of water sufficient for any ship to unload without jetty is now covered by a large building constructed of logs belonging to samuel price and company  a ship was unloading lumber at this wharf at 35 dollars per m which was the ruling price  at victoria on the 21st june a frenchman landed from the steamer surprise who came on board at fort langley with twentyseven pounds weight of gold on his person which we saw and lifted  another passenger whom we know states that there are six hundred persons within eight miles of fort hope who are averaging per man an ounce and a half of gold per day minimum to six and a half ounces per day maximum  the largest sums seem to be taken out at sailors bar five miles above fort hope  the lowest depth as yet reached by miners is fifteen inches these mere surface scratches producing often 200 dollars per day  at fort hope potatoes were selling at 6 dollars per bag bacon 75 cents per pound crackers 30 cents  from fort hope to fort thompson the road is good with the exception of twenty miles  for 20 dollars the steamers will take miners from victoria to the diggings at fort hope and for three or four dollars more an indian will accompany you to fort yale  bowen steward of the surprise says that about a hundred indians usually ran after him to obtain little sweet cakes which he traded off four or five for 1 dollar in gold dust sugar at fort langley 1 dollar 50 cents per pound lumber 1 dollar 50 cents per foot tea and coffee 1 dollar per pound pierced iron for rockers 8 dollars plain sheets 2 dollars each five pounds of quicksilver sold for 40 dollars10 dollars per pound was the ordinary price  the actual ground prospected and ascertained to be highly auriferous extends to three hundred and fifty miles from the mouth of fraser river  one hundred miles of thompson river has been prospected and found to be rich southeast of fraser river  the same will apply to all the tributaries of thompson river  a large extent of auriferous quartz has been discovered ten miles from fort hope  exceedingly rich quartz veins have been found on harrison river  the most astounding facts have yet to be divulged  a river emptying into the gulf of georgia not a hundred miles north of fraser river hitherto supposed to contain no gold has proved fabulously rich  an indian arrived at victoria from this locality having twentythree pounds weight of pure gold obtained solely by his own labour in less than twenty days  in confirmation of our figures and being short of space we append the following statistics derived from an official and authentic source of the strictest reliability  we deem the above facts sufficient to cause an exodus of a far more alarming character and of higher proportions as to number than any hitherto known in history suffice it to say that the present furore is well founded that it holds out busy times high prices speculations contracts and employments of a thousand kinds  fountains diggings fraser river

sends the following from san francisco under date 5th july  the emigration for fraser river has gone on for months with no signs of growing less  the best means of judging what grounds there are for the belief in the existence of gold in large quantities on its banks is by letters received from persons who are engaged in mining  it is worthy of note that there is no discrepancy between the accounts given by different individuals all their statements agreeing  the mines are reported to be exceedingly rich and yielding large returns to those engaged in digging  the river is very high and miners have been driven from several of the most lucrative bars until the water subsides  mr hill from whom hills bar took its name is mining some distance above that point  he and six hands were making from an ounce to an ounce and ahalf of gold dust a day to each man  for three weeks prior to the freshet mr hill and one man averaged one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars a day  the freshet however drove him off for the time being  mr er collins who has spent some time in the fraser river gold region and who brought down last week a quantity of dust has communicated the following intelligence to the alta california  mr collins is a trustworthy gentleman  he left san francisco in march last and was at olympia when the excitement first broke out  he then in company with three others proceeded to point roberts from whence they proceeded up fraser river to the mouth of harrison river about twentyfive miles above fort langley  this portion of the journey they performed without guides or assistance from the natives  the current was moderate and occasionally beautiful islands were discovered with heavy timber which presented a beautiful appearance  from fort hope to fort yale a distance of fifteen miles the river runs narrow and the current running about seven miles per hour though in some places it might be set down at ten or twelve  at fort yale the first mining bar was reached  it extended out from the left bank a distance of some thirty yards and was about half a mile long  twenty or thirty squaws were at work with baskets and wooden trays while near by large numbers of male indians stood listlessly looking on  here some of mr collins companions who had now increased to twenty proposed to stop and try their luck but the majority resolved to go on having informed themselves satisfactorily that further up the big chunks were in abundance  after resting a while therefore the party went ahead  two miles from fort yale they entered upon the commencement of the real difficulties and dangers of navigation on fraser river the water for a distance of thirtyfive or forty miles passing through deep gloomy canons and over high masses of rock  at this time the river had attained only a few feet above its usual height so that by perseverance and the skill of the native boatman they were enabled to make slow progress  numerous portages were madeone of them the last being four miles long  these portages could not be avoided the cliffs rising perpendicularly on either side of the river sometimes to a height of fifty or sixty feet affording not the slightest footpath on which to tow  at other places the whirls and rocks partly submerged rendered a water passage utterly impracticable  at every bar and shallow spot prospected in these wild localities gold was obtained in paying quantities all of very fine qualityrather difficult to save without the use of quicksilver  from the head of the canons to the forks of thompsons river thirtyfive miles more the current and general appearance of the river seemed about the same as from fort hope to fort yale gold also being found where there was an opportunity for a fair prospect  at the forks the party were told by travill a french trader whom they met by accident that the richest and best diggings were up thompsons but that river being navigable but a few miles up it was thought best to keep on up fraser which they did for a distance of forty miles encountering no serious obstacles beyond a few rapids and they were passed by towing  five miles above the forks some twenty white men were at work making with common rockers from ten to sixteen dollars per day  arriving at a bar about ten miles below where white men were congregating in numbers considered sufficient for mutual protection they took up a claim and commenced digging  they worked here steady twentyfour days averaging fifteen dollars per day to each man  the greatest days work of one man was thirtyone dollars  these figures it is thought would apply to all the miners  our latest news from the new mines reach to the beginning of july  at that time there were immense numbers of miners on the banks of fraser river waiting for the stream to fall and enable them to go to work on the bars which are said to be fabulously rich  some dry diggings had also been discovered in the neighbourhood of the river but owing to the presence of a large number of indians not of the most friendly disposition the miners dared not then extend their researches far from the stream where the bulk of the whites were congregated  the town of victoria on vancouvers island has sprung rapidly into importance great advances have been made on real estate there  lots which a few months ago were sold by the hudsons bay company at twelve pounds ten shillings are now selling at over 250 pounds  a newspaper called the victoria gazette has been started there and an american steamer the surprise is also running regularly between victoria and fort hope which is one hundred miles above the mouth of fraser river  in the last week of june the arrivals by steamers and vessels at the various ports of british columbia reached the large daily average of one thousand while those who have lately travelled through the mountains say that the principal roads in the interior present an appearance similar to the retreat of a routed army  stages express waggons and vehicles of every character are called into requisition for the immediate emergency and all are crammed while whole battalions are pressing forward on horse or mule back and on foot  of course the shipments of merchandise from san francisco and other ports are very large to keep pace with this almost instantaneous emigration of thousands to a region totally unsupplied with the commodities necessary for their use and sustenance  up to the present no outbreak or disturbance has occurred and a certain degree of order has already been established in the mining region through the judicious measures adopted by the governor justices of the peace and other officials have been appointed and a system protective of the territorial interests organised  licences on the principle of those granted in australia are issued the price five dollars per month to be exacted from every miner  there was a good deal of talk as to the right or propriety of levying this tax when it was first proposed and some of the francisco papers were load in their denunciations others took a calmer view  it is satisfactory to add that little difficulty has so far been experienced on this head  as a body the miners are reported to be a steady set of men well conducted and respectful of the law    chapter two  climate productions and soil  next to the extent and richness of the gold mines the most important inquiry is as to the character of the climate and soil  and in this respect the fraser river settlement does not lose any of its attractions for though seven hundred miles north of san francisco it is still one or two degrees south of the latitude of london and apparently with a climate of a mildness equal to that of the southern shores of england being free from all extremes both of heat and cold one hundred and fifty miles back from the pacific indeed there lies a range of mountains reaching up to the regions of perpetual snow  but between that and the coast the average temperature is fiftyfour degrees for the year round  snow seldom lies more than three days  fruit trees blossom early in april and salad goes to head by the middle of may on vancouvers island  in parts of this region wheat yields twenty to thirty bushels to the acre  apples pears pease and grains of all kinds do well  the trees are of gigantic growth  iron and copper abound as does also coal in vancouvers island so that altogether it bids fair to realise in a short time the description applied to it by the colonial secretary sir eb lytton of a magnificent abode for the human race  when introducing the government of new caledonia bill on 9th july the colonial secretary said in his place in the house of commonsthe thompson river district is described as one of the finest countries in the british dominions with a climate far superior to that of countries in the same latitude on the other side of the mountains  mr cooper who gave valuable evidence before our committee on this district with which he is thoroughly acquainted recently addressed to me a letter in which he states that its fisheries are most valuable its timber the finest in the world for marine purposes it abounds with bituminous coal well fitted for the generation of steam from thompson river and colville districts to the rocky mountains and from the 49th parallel some 350 miles north a more beautiful country does not exist  it is in every way suitable for colonisation  therefore apart from the gold fields this country affords every promise of a flourishing and important colony  the times special correspondent in a letter from vancouvers island published on 10th august says productive fisheries prolific whaling waters extensive coalfields a country well timbered in some parts susceptible of every agricultural improvement in ethers with rich gold fields on the very bordersthese are some of the many advantages enjoyed by the colony of vancouvers island and its fortunate possessors  when i add that the island boasts a climate of great salubrity with a winter temperature resembling that of england and a summer little inferior to that of paris i need say no more lest my picture be suspected of sharing too deeply of couleur de rose  of the southern part of this district lieutenant wilkes who commanded the late exploring expedition under the united states government says few portions of the globe are so rich in soil so diversified in surface or so capable of being rendered the happy homes of an industrious and civilised community  for beauty of scenery and salubrity of climate it cannot be surpassed  it is peculiarly adapted for an agricultural and pastoral people and no portion of the world beyond the tropics can be found that will yield so readily with moderate labour to the wants of man  perhaps the fullest account of the country yet given is that contained in the narrative of a residence of six years on the western slopes of the rocky mountains by ross cox one of the earliest explorers of british north america  he says the district of new caledonia extends from 51 degrees 30 minutes north latitude to about 56 degrees  its extreme western boundary is 124 degrees 10 minutes  its principal trading post is called alexandria after the celebrated traveller sir alexander mackenzie  it is built on the banks of fraser river in about latitude 53 degrees north  the country in its immediate vicinity presents a beautiful and picturesque appearance  the banks of the river are rather low but a little distance inland some rising grounds are visible partially diversified by groves of fir and poplar  this country is full of small lakes rivers and marshes  it extends about ten days march in a north and northeast direction  to the south and southeast the atnah or chin indian country extends about one hundred miles on the east there is a chain of lakes and the mountains bordering thompson river while to the westward and northwest lie the lands of the naskotins and clinches  the lakes are numerous and some of them tolerably large one two and even three days are at times required to cross some of them  they abound in a plentiful variety of fish such as trout sucker etcetera and the natives assert that white fish is sometimes taken  these lakes are generally fed by mountain streams and many of them spread out and are lost in the surrounding marshes  on the banks of the river and in the interior the trees consist of poplar cypress alder cedar birch and different species of fir spruce and willow  there is not the same variety of wild fruit as on the columbia and this year 1827 the berries generally failed service berries chokecherries gooseberries strawberries and red whortleberries are gathered but among the indians the serviceberry is the great favourite  there are various kinds of roots which the natives preserve and dry for periods of scarcity  there is only one kind which we can eat  it is called tzachin has a bitter taste but when eaten with salmon imparts an agreeable zest and effectually destroys the disagreeable smell of that fish when smokedried  saint johns wort is very common and has been successfully applied as a fomentation in topical inflammations  a kind of weed which the natives convert into a species of flax is in general demand  an evergreen similar to that we found at the mouth of the columbia with small berries growing in clusters like grapes also flourishes in this district  sarsaparilla and bearroot are found in abundance  white earth abounds in the vicinity of the fort and one description of it mixed with oil and lime might be converted into excellent soap  coal in considerable quantities has been discovered and in many places we observed a species of red earth much resembling lava and which appeared to be of volcanic origin  we also found in different parts of new caledonia quartz rock crystal cobalt talc iron marcasites of a gold colour granite fullers earth some beautiful specimens of black marble and limestone in small quantities which appeared to have been forced down the beds of the rivers from the mountains  the jumpingdeer or chevreuil together with the rein and reddeer frequent the vicinity of the mountains in considerable numbers and in the summer season they oftentimes descend to the banks of the rivers and the adjacent flat country  the marmot and woodrat also abound the flesh of the former is exquisite and capital robes are made out of its skin but the latter is a very destructive animal  their dogs are of diminutive size and strongly resemble those of the esquimaux with the curled up tail small ears and pointed nose  we purchased numbers of them for the kettle their flesh constituting the chief article of food in our holiday feasts for christmas and new year  the furbearing animals consist of beavers bears black brown and grizzly otters fishers lynxes martins foxes red cross and silver minks musquash wolverines and ermines  rabbits also are so numerous that the natives manage to subsist on them during the periods that salmon is scarce  under the head of ornithology we have the bustard or canadian outarde wild goose swans ducks of various descriptions hawks plovers cranes whiteheaded eagles magpies crows vultures woodthrush redbreasted thrush or robin woodpeckers gulls pelicans hawks partridges pheasants and snowbirds  the spring commences in april when the wild flowers begin to bud and from thence to the latter end of may the weather is delightful  in june it rains incessantly with strong southerly and easterly winds  during the months of july and august the heat is intolerable and in september the fogs are so dense that it is quite impossible to distinguish the opposite side of the river any morning before ten oclock  colds and rheumatisms are prevalent among the natives during this period nor are our people exempt from them  in october the falling of the leaves and occasional frost announce the beginning of winter  the lakes and parts of the rivers are frozen in november  the snow seldoms exceeds twentyfour inches in depth  the mercury in fahrenheits thermometer falls in january to 15 degrees below zero but this does not continue many days in general i may say the climate is neither unhealthy nor unpleasant and if the natives used common prudence they would undoubtedly live to an advanced age  the salmon fishery commences about the middle of july and ceases in october  this is a busy period for the natives for upon their industry in saving a sufficiency of salmon for the winter depends their chief support  jub suckers trout and whitefish are caught in the lakes and in the month of october towards the close of the salmonfishery we catch trout of a most exquisite flavour  largesized sturgeon are occasionally taken in the vorveaux but they are not relished by the natives  mr dunn in his valuable history of the oregon territory thus describes the country and climateafter the columbia the river next in importance is fraser river  it takes its rise in the rocky mountains near the source of canoe river taking a northwest course of eighty miles  it then turns to the southward receiving stuarts river which rises in a chain of lakes in the northern boundary of the territory  it then pursues a southerly course and after receiving many tributaries breaks through the cascade range of hills in a series of falls and rapids and after a westerly course of seventy miles empties itself into the gulf of georgia in latitude 49 degrees 7 minutes north this latter portion is navigable for vessels that can pass its bar drawing ten feet of water  its whole length is 350 miles  there are numerous lakes scattered through the several sections  the country is all well watered and there are but four places where an abundance of water cannot be obtained either from lakes rivers or springs  the climate of the western division is mild throughout the year neither the cold of winter nor the heat of summer predominating  the mean temperature is about 50 degrees fahrenheit  the prevailing winds in summer are from the northward and westward and in winter from the west south and southeast  the winter lasts from about november till march generally speaking  during that time there are frequent falls of rain but not heavy  snow seldoms lies longer than a week on the ground  there are frosts so early as september but they are not severe and do not continue long  the easterly winds are the coldest as they come from across the mountains but they are not frequent fruit trees blossom early in april in the neighbourhood of nasqually and vancouver and in the middle of may pease are a foot high and strawberries in full blossom indeed all fruits and vegetables are as early there as in england  the hills though of great declivity have a sward to their tops  lieutenant wilkes says that out of 106 days 67 were fair 19 cloudy and 11 rainy  the middle section is subject to droughts  during summer the atmosphere is drier and warmer and in winter colder than in the western section its extremes of heat and cold being greater and more frequent  however the air is fine and healthy the atmosphere in summer being cooled by the breezes that blow from the pacific  the soil of the western section varies from a deep black vegetable loam to a light brown loamy earth  the bills are generally basalt stone and slate  the surface is generally undulating well watered well wooded and well adapted for agriculture and pasturage  the timber consists of pine fir spruce oaks white and red ash arbutus cedar arborvitae poplar maple willow cherry tew with underwoods of hazel and roses  all kinds of grain wheat rice barley oats and pease can be procured there in abundance  various fruits such as pears apples etcetera succeed there admirably and the different vegetables produced in england yield there most abundant crops  the middle section which is about 1000 feet above the level of the western is not so well wooded or fertile yet in the southern parts of it where the missionaries have established settlements they have raised excellent crops and reared large stocks of cattle notwithstanding the occasional cold their cattle are not housed nor is provender laid in for them in any quantity the country being sufficiently supplied with fodder in the natural hay that is everywhere abundant in the prairies which the cattle prefer  mr wilkes says in comparison with the united states i would say that the labour necessary in this territory to acquire wealth or subsistence is in the proportion of one to three or in other words a man must work throughout the year three times as much in the united states to gain the like competency  the care of stock which requires so much time with us requires no attention there and on the increase only a man might find support  he further says there will be also a demand for the timber of this country at high prices throughout the pacific  the oak is well adapted for ship timber and abundance of ash cedar cypress and arborvitae may be had for other purposes building fuel fencing etcetera  he also adds no part of the world affords finer inland sounds or a greater number of harbours than are found within the straits of juan de fuca capable of receiving the highest class of vessels and without a danger in them which is not viable from the rise and fall of the tides eighteen feet every facility is afforded for the erection of works for a great maritime nation  the country also affords as many sites for maritime power as any other  on the northern coast there are a number of islands which belong to the territory  the largest are vancouvers island and queen charlotte island both of which enjoy a mild and salubrious climate with a soil well adapted to agriculture  they have also an abundance of fine fish in their waters  coal of a very good quality is found there close by the surface and they also contain numerous veins of valuable minerals  all the rivers abound in salmon of the finest quality which run twice a year beginning in may and october and appear inexhaustible  in fraser river the salmon are very numerous  the bays and inlets abound with several kinds of salmon sturgeon cod carp sole flounders perch herring and eels also with shellfishcrabs oysters etcetera whales and sea otters in numbers are found along the coast and are frequently captured by indians in and at the mouth of the straits of juan de fuca  game abounds in the western section such as elk deer antelopes bears wolves foxes muskrats martins  and in the spring and fall the rivers are covered with geese ducks and other waterfowl  towards the rocky mountains buffaloes are found in great numbers  from the advantages this country possesses it bids fair to have an extensive commerce on advantageous terms with most parts of the pacific  it is well calculated to produce the following staple commoditiesfurs salted beef and pork grain flour wool hides tallow timber and coals  and in return for thesesugars coffee and other tropical productions may be obtained at the sandwich islands advantages that in time must become of immense importance  those districts of british america west of the lakes which by soil and climate are suitable for settlement may be thus enumerated  vancouvers island 16200 square miles  fraser and thomson rivers 60000 ditto  sources of the upper columbia 20000 ditto  athabasca district 50000 ditto  saskatchewan red river assineboin etcetera 360000 ditto  506200  under these geographical divisions we propose to give the results of a parliamentary investigation just published into the affairs of the hudsons bay company so far as they are descriptive of the foregoing districts  vancouvers island  this island is fertile well timbered finely diversified by intersecting mountain ranges and small prairies with extensive coal fields compared by one witness to the west riding of yorkshire coal and fortunate in its harbours  esquimault harbour on which victoria is situated is equal to san francisco  the salmon and other fisheries are excellent but this advantage is shared by every stream and inlet of the adjacent coast  the climate is frequently compared with england except that it is even warmer  the winter is stormy with heavy rains in november and december frosts occur in the lowlands in january but seldom interrupt agriculture vegetation starts in february rapidly progressing in march and fostered by alternate warm showers and sunshine in april and maywhile intense heat and drought are often experienced during june july and august  as already remarked the island has an area of 16200 square miles  fraser and thompson rivers  northward of vancouvers island the coast range of mountains trends so near the pacific as to obstruct intercourse with the interior but inside in the language of a witness it is a fine open country this is the valley of fraser river  ascending this river near fort langley a large tract of land is represented as adapted to colonists while of thomson river the same witness says that it is one of the most beautiful countries in the worldclimate capable of producing all the crops of england and much milder than canada  the sources of fraser river in latitude 55 degrees are separated from those of peace river which flows through the rocky mountains eastward into the athabasca by the distance of only 317 yards  sources of the columbia  a glance at the map will shew how considerable a district of british oregon is watered by the upper columbia and its tributary the mcgillivray or flat bow river  it is estimated above at 20000 square miles and has been described in enthusiastic terms by the bishop of oregonde smetin his oregon missions  the territory of the kootonais indians would seem from his glowing description to be divided in favourable proportion between forests and prairies  of timber he names birch pine of different species cedar and cypress he remarked specimens of coal and great quantities of lead apparently mixed with silver  the source of the columbia seemed to impress him as a very important point  he observes that the climate is delightfulthat the extremes of heat and cold are seldom known the snow disappearing as it falls  he reiterates the opinion that the advantages nature seemed to have bestowed on the columbia will render its geographical position very important at some future day and that the hand of civilised man would transform it into a terrestrial paradise  it is an interesting coincidence that bishop de smet published in a saint louis paper a few months since a similar description of this region adding that it could be reached from salt lake city along the western base of the rocky mountains with waggons and that brigham young proposed to lead his next mormon exodus to the sources of the columbia river  such a movement is not improbable and would exhibit far greater sagacity than an emigration to sonora  the athabasca district  the valleys of the peace and athabasca rivers which occupy the eastern base of the rocky mountains from latitudes 55 degrees to 59 degrees share the pacific climate in a remarkable degree  the rocky mountains are greatly reduced in breadth and mean elevation and through the numerous passes between their lofty peaks the winds of the pacific reach the district in question  hence it is that sir alexander mackenzie under date of 10th may mentions the exuberant verdure of the whole countrytrees about to blossom and buffalo attended by their young during the late parliamentary investigation similar statements were elicited  dr richard king who accompanied an expedition in search of sir john ross as surgeon and naturalist was asked what portion of the country he saw was available for the purpose of settlement  in reply he described as a very fertile valley a square piece of country bounded on the south by cumberland house and by the athabasca lake on the north  his own words are as followsthe sources of the athabasca and the sources of the saskatchewan include an enormous area of country it is in fact a vast piece of land surrounded by water when i heard dr livingstones description of that splendid country which he found in the interior of africa within the equator it appeared to me to be precisely the kind of country which i am now describing  it is a rich soil interspersed with wellwooded country there being growth of every kind and the whole vegetable kingdom alive  when asked concerning mineral productions his reply wasi do not know of any other mineral except limestone this is apparent in all directions  the birch the beech and the maple are in abundance and there is every sort of fruit  when questioned further as to the growth of trees dr king replied by a comparison with the magnificent trees round kensington park in london  he described a farm near cumberland house under very successful cultivationluxuriant wheatpotatoes barley pigs cows and horses  saskatchewan assineboin and red river district  the area of this continent northwest of minnesota and known as the saskatchewan district is estimated by english authorities to comprise 368000 square miles  northwest from otter tail lake the geographical centre of minnesota extends a vast silurian formation bounded on the west along the eastern base of the rocky mountains by coal measures such a predominance of limestone implies fertility of soil as in the northwestern states and the speedy colonisation of saskatchewan would be assured if the current objection to the severity of climate was removed  on this point a few facts will be presented  the sea of azof which empties into the black sea forming the eastern border of the crimean peninsula freezes about the beginning of november and is seldom open before the beginning of april  a point less than one hundred miles north but far down in southern russia namely catherineoslay has been found from the observation of many years to be identical in summer and winter climate with fort spelling ninetenths of european russia therefore the main seat of population and resources is further north than saint paul  in fact pembina is the climatic equivalent of moscow and for that of saint petersburg which is 60 degrees north we may reasonably go to latitude 55 degrees on the american continent  like european russia also the saskatchewan district has a climate of extremesthe thermometer having a wide range but it is well understood that the growth of the cereals and of the most useful vegetables depends chiefly on the intensity and duration of the summer heats and is comparatively little influenced by the severity of winter cold or the lowness of the mean temperature during the year  therefore it is important to observe that the northern shore of lake huron has the mean summer heat of bordeaux in southern france or 70 degrees fahrenheit while cumberland house in latitude 54 degrees longitude 102 degrees on the saskatchewan exceeds in this respect brussels and paris  the united states army meteorological register has ascertained that the line of 70 degrees mean summer heat crosses the hudson river at west point thence descends to the latitude of pittsburg but westward is traced through sandusky chicago fort snelling and fort union near latitude 49 degrees into british america  the average annual heat at quebec is experienced as far north as latitude 52 degrees in the saskatchewan country  mr blodget states that not only all the vicinity of the south branch of the saskatchewan is as mild in climate as saint paul but that the north branch of that river is almost equally favourable and that the ameliorating influence of the pacific through the gorges of the rocky mountains is so far felt on mackenzies river that wheat may be grown in its valley nearly to the 65th parallel  in the foregoing account of the districts of the interior we have given faithfully as in duty bound the fact that have been elicited in the various investigations public and otherwise that have taken place  at the same time we think it but fair to state that large portions of these fine districts especially the athabasca and saskatchewan are at present very far beyond the reach of any civilised market and overrun by hordes of warlike indians  we have thus given a brief survey of the position and resources of the territory surrounding the new el dorado  one observation we may be permitted to hazard  perhaps there is no more striking illustration of the wisdom of that providence which presides over the management of our affairs than in the fact that emigration was first led to the eastern coast rather than to the slopes or plains of the west  had the latter been first occupied it is doubtful whether the rocks and lagoons of the seaboard would ever have been settled  no man would have turned from the prairie sward of the pacific to the seamed elopes of the atlantic edge  as it is we have the energy and patience which the difficult soil of the east generates with that magnificent sweep of western territory which had it been opened to us first might from its very luxuriousness have generated among those occupying it an ignoble love of ease    chapter three  routes etcetera  for some time to come the great line of route to the new el dorado will likely be by water from the different settlements along the coast of the pacific  steam communication has long been established between panama and san francisco and a line of vessels is now regularly plying between the latter port and vancouvers island from whence easy access is had to the diggings by means of small steamers  the steamers at present running on the coast make the voyage from panama to vancouvers island in fourteen or fifteen days  the following statistics of fares and freights are supplied by the times correspondent  the rates of passage at present from san francisco to new york are steerage 150 dollars second cabin 250 dollars first cabin 300 dollars per berth for each passenger  an entire stateroom is the price of two passengers600 dollars  from new york to san francisco the fares are the same  san francisco to panama sometimes the same as to new york and sometimes onethird less  freight on specie 1 per cent to new york  and three quarters per cent to panama with a slight discount to shippers of large amounts  freight on merchandise from panama 2 dollars 10 cents per foot  the quantity of freight is considerable in french silks cloths and light goods but the bulk is in havannah cigars nearly all the supply for this market coming via panama  the fares up by the steamers from san francisco to victoria aresteerage 30 dollars cabin 60 dollars  this route besides being at present the most direct and expeditious presents another great advantage  passing along the coast of california it gives passengers an opportunity of either settling there or continuing their journey to british columbia  that this is no unimportant advantage will be at once conceded when it is borne in mind that it is not the goldproducing country on the fraser river alone that offers strong inducements to emigrants  in a letter published on 4th august the times correspondent remarksin a few weeks with a continuance of the present drain upon our mining mechanical and labouring population generally as good a field for labour of every kind will again be open in california as there was from 1849 to 1851 when the country became flooded with immigrants in fact the openings now being made in the mines and in labour of all sorts and the rise of wages in consequence of the exodus hence offer greater inducements to emigrants than existed in the first years of our organisation  then there was little besides mining that a man could turn his hand to  now the gradual development of the resources of the country has opened many avenues for labour of various kinds and mining claims which pay well and in which a competency would be realised in a moderate space of time are abandoned because they do not produce gold in bushels as their owners hope to find the new mines to yield  and in another letter the same authority saysthe excitement in the interior is universal  i was up the country this week and returned only last night so that i had an opportunity of judging for myself from every point of the compass squads of miners were to be seen making for san francisco to ship themselves off and i heard of arrangements having been completed for driving stock overland to meet the demands of the new population congregating in the puget sound country  one man had purchased a drove of mules and another had speculated in 200 californian horses to supply the demand for packing  these two ventures were to proceed overland in two days hence  the speculator in horses had been at fraser river and returned convinced of the judiciousness of his spec  he spoke of the overland trip with enthusiasm plenty of game and of grass a fine climate and no molestation from indians  as a natural result of all this emigration business in the interior is becoming much deranged  the operations of the country merchants are checked rents and the value of property in the interior towns are diminishing  some of the merchants are liquidating and some have already moved their business to san francisco to take advantage of the business which must spring up between that port and the northwest  all the movements made in consequence of the new gold discovery have tended to benefit san francisco and she will no doubt continue to derive great advantages from the change  the increase of business will bring an increase of immigration to the city for there is every reason to believe judging from past experience that a considerable proportion of the emigration from europe the atlantic states and australia will rest here that the city will increase rapidly and that an advance in the value of property must ensue in consequence  the fact is that there is now in california so extensive an association of capital and labour engaged in mining successfully that happen what may in other countries the yield here most continue to be very great  companies of men who have large amounts of money invested in mining of a variety of sorts such as tunnelling sluicing and quartz crushing on a large scale are not going to abandon welldeveloped properties which produce profitable returns  we have no fear of having to suffer any inconvenience from a scarcity of gold in california in consequence of the removal from the country of so many miners  i make these statements for the information of parties abroad engaged in business with this country  the following is the journal of a traveller who lately proceeded on this route  left san francisco on thursday the 24th of june at 4 and a half pm and arrived in esquimault harbour near victoria on the following tuesday at six in the morningdistance 800 miles  the steamer was so crowded with goldhunters speculators merchants tradesmen and adventurers of all sorts that exercise even on the quarterdeck could only be coaxed by the general forbearance and goodhumour of the crowd before starting there were stories to the prejudice of the steamer the oregon belonging to the pacific mail company rife enough to damp the courage of the timid but she behaved well and beat another boat that had five hours start of her  the fact is we had a model captain a welleducated gentlemanly man formerly a lieutenant in the united states navy whose intelligence vigour and conduct inspired full confidence in all  with captain patterson i would have gone to sea in a tub  whatever may be the sins of the company as monopolists of the carrying trade on this coast justice must award them the merit of having selected a staff of commanders who atone for many shortcomings  the voyage from san francisco to vancouvers island which in a steamer is made all the way within sight of the coast is one of the most agreeable when the voyager is favoured with fine weather  i know none other so picturesque out of the mediterranean  the navigation is so simple that a schoolboy could sail a steamer for a series of eighteen headlands which jut out into the ocean all along the coasts of california oregon and washington territory served as landmarks to direct the mariner in his course  all he has to do is to steer from one to another from point reyes outside the golden gate to point arena the next in succession and so on till he comes to cape flattery upon rounding which he enters the straits of fuca towards the end of his voyage  the northern portion of the coast of california and the whole length of the coasts of oregon and washington are thickly wooded  in fact this vast stretch of country is one continuous pine forest  from the shore where the trees dip into the sea back to the verge of the distant horizon over hills down valleys across ravines and on and around the sides and tops of mountains it is one great waving panorama of forest scenery  timberenough to supply the wants of the world for ages one would think  yet the broken character of the country relieves the scene from monotony and it fully realises the idea of the grand and the beautiful combined  one spot in particular made an impression upon me which i wish i had the power to convey by words  between cape mendocina and humboldt bay on the northern limits of california a grand collection of hills and mountains of every variety of size shape and form occurs  this grand group recedes in a gentle sweep from the coast far inland where it terminates in a high conical mountain overtopping the entire mass of pinnacles which cluster around it  the whole is well clothed with trees of that feathery and graceful foliage peculiar to the spruce and larch and interspersed with huge round clumps of evergreens with alternations of long glades and great open patches of lawn covered with rich grass of that bright emerald green peculiar to california this woodland scene viewed of an early morning sparkling with dewdrops under the rising sun which slowly lifted the veil of mist hanging over it surpassed in beauty anything i have seen on this continent  here everything in nature is on a grand scale  all her works are magnificent to a degree unknown in europe  a trip to these regions will pay the migratory englishman in search of novelty to his hearts content and i will bear the blame if he is not well pleased with his journey  california alone should satisfy a traveller of moderate desires  here he will find combined the beauty and loveliness of english landscape with the bolder and grander features of the scenery of the western continenta combination perhaps unequalled in any other country  on this the northern coast the bold and the picturesque predominate over the tamer parklike scenery of the interior valleys which so nearly resemble the fine old places of england  another route which it is proposed to open on the other side of the country from minnesota to the fraser river gold mines would appear to be very feasible  from saint anthony the mississippi is navigable for large steamers as far as the sauk rapids  thence to breckenridge at the head of the navigation of the red river of the north is a distance of 125 miles  this part of the journey must be made overland but already this district is being fast occupied by settlers and a good road may easily be constructed  at breckenridge a settlement has also been established  here commences the fertile valley of the red river and from this point as appears from captain popes survey the river which runs due north is navigable for steamers all the way to its mouth at the southern extremity of lake winnepeg  it begins with four feet of water and gradually deepens to fifteen feet lake winnepeg which is long narrow and deep receives near its northern end the saskatchewan flowing from the west and having its sources in the rocky mountains  the river and the country on its banks have recently attracted attention as well fitted for colonisation  taking the climate of the eastern portion of the continent and of the region round hudsons bay as a standard it was long supposed that all the interior of north america beyond the 48th or 49th degree of north latitude was too cold to produce grain crops and unfit therefore for the habitation of civilised men  recent investigations however have fully established the curious and very important fact that west of the western end of lake superior at about the 100th degree of west longitude a remarkable change begins to take place in the climate to such an extent that as we proceed westward the limit of vegetable growth and of the production of grain is extended far to the north so as to include the whole valley of the saskatchewan which is represented as in other respects well fitted for settlement  the saskatchewan is a river larger and longer than the red river of the north and according to governor simpson of the hudsons bay companys service in his notes on its exploration it is navigable by its northern branch with only one rapid to obstruct navigation for seven hundred miles in a direct line to the foot of the rocky mountains  how serious an obstruction this may be does not clearly appear  it can hardly be a perpendicular fall since according to governor simpson canoes and flatboats pass over it in safety  from the head of navigation it is only about two hundred miles across the rocky mountains of which the elevation here is much less than in oregon and california to the thompson and fraser rivers  the distance from breckenridge to the mouth of the red river is estimated at 450 miles  thence through lake winnepeg to the mouth of saskatchewan is 200 miles  allowing for windings the navigation by that river may be set down at 1000 miles  add 125 miles of land carriage at one end of the route and 200 at the other making in the whole a distance of about 2000 miles from the starting point on the mississippi  so fully impressed are some enterprising people of minnesota with the practicability and advantage of this route that measures have been already taken for building a steamer at breckenridge designed to navigate the waters of the red river lake winnepeg and saskatchewan and to be ready for that purpose by the opening of next spring meantime as the greater part of the route is within the territories of the hudsons bay company steps have been taken to open a communication with the governor of that company and with other persons likely to assist in putting a line of steamers on these waters  at present various measures are being taken by the canadians to shorten this last route and apparently with much success  they are making arrangements for passing around the headwaters of lake superior and thus saving the detour in minnesota  in a very short time it is said that an easy and inexpensive means of communication will be formed between canada and the goldfields but for the present the panama route is decidedly the preferable one for british emigrants    chapter four  description of coasts harbours etcetera  the pacific coast extends from panama westward and northward without any remarkable irregularity in its outline to the tropic of cancer almost immediately under which is the entrance of the great gulf of california separating the peninsula of california from the main continent on the east  from the southern extremity of this peninsula the coast runs generally northwestward to mount saint elias a lofty volcanic peak rising from the shore of the ocean under the 60th parallel beyond which the continent stretches far westward between the pacific on the south and the arctic sea on the north to its termination at cape prince of wales in behrings straits the passage separating america from asia  the part of the coast south of the 49th degree of latitude the american boundary presents few indentations and the islands in its vicinity are neither numerous nor large  north of the 49th degree on the contrary the mainland is everywhere penetrated by inlets and bays and near it are thousands of islands many of them extensive lying singly or in groups separated from each other and from the continent by narrow channels  from the mouth of the columbia fortyfive miles of unbroken coast reaches whidbeys bay called by the americans bulfinches harbour and not unfrequently grays bay which with an entrance of scarce two miles and ahalf spreads seven miles long and nine broad forming two deep bays like the columbia  here there is secure anchorage behind point hanson to the south and point brown to the north but the capacity of the bay is lessened to onethird of its size by the sand banks which encroach on it in every direction  like the columbia its mouth is obstructed by a bar which has not more than four fathoms water and as it stretches some three miles to seaward with breakers on each side extending the whole way to the shore the difficulty of entrance is increased  it lies nearly east and west and receives from the east the waters of the river chikelis having its rise at the base of the mountains which stretching from mount olympus in the north divide the coast from pugets sound  from whidbeys bay to cape flattery about eighty miles but two streams and those unimportant break the iron wall of the coast which rising gradually into lofty mountains is crowned in hoary grandeur by the snowclad peaks of mount olympus  cape flattery called also cape classet is a conspicuous promontory in latitude 48 degrees 27 minutes beyond it distant one mile lies tatouches island a large flat rock with perpendicular sides producing a few trees surrounded by rocky islets it is one mile in length joined to the shore by a reef of rocks and a mile further leaving a clear passage between them is a reef named ducans rock  here commences in latitude 48 degrees 30 minutes that mighty arm of the sea which has been justly named from its first discoverer the strait of juan de fuca and which captain cook passed without perceiving  the entrance of this strait is about ten miles in width and varies from that to twenty with the indentations of its shores of which the northern stretching to the northwest and southeast across the entrance gives an appearance of continuity to its line on the pacific running in a southeasterly direction for upwards of one hundred miles its further progress is suddenly stopped by a range of snowclad mountain at the base of which spreading abroad its mighty arms to the north and south it gives to the continent the appearance of a vast archipelago  of the straits of fuca and surrounding shores the latest and fullest information we possess is that contained in the letter of the times special correspondent published on 27th august  he says  we have now rounded cape flattery and are in the straits of fuca running up between two shores of great beauty  on the left is the longlookedfor island of vancouver an irregular aggregation of hills shewing a sharp angular outline as they become visible in the early dawn covered with the eternal pines saving only occasional sunny patches of open greensward very pretty and picturesque but the hills not lofty enough to be very striking  the entire island property speaking is a forest  on the right we have a long massive chain of lofty mountains covered with snow called the olympian rangevery grand quite alpine in aspect  this is the peninsula composed of a series of mountains running for many miles in one unbroken line which divides the straits of fuca from puget sound  it belongs to america in the territory of washington is uninhabited and like its opposite neighbour has a covering of pines far up towards the summit  the tops of these mountains are seldom free from snow  the height is unknown perhaps 15000 feet  we ran up through this scenery early in the morning biting cold for about forty miles to esquimault harbourthe harbourwhich confers upon vancouvers island its preeminence  from the information of old miners who pointed out some of the localities on the northern coast of california and indicated the position of places in oregon in which they had dug for gold i had a strong corroboration of an opinion which i stated in one of my late lettersthat the fraser river diggings were a continuation of the great goldfield of california  the same miners had a theory that these northern mines would be richer than any yet discovered because the more northern portions of california are richer than the central and southern portions  the harbour of esquimault is a circular bay or rather a basin hollowed by nature out of the solids rock  we slid in through the narrow entrance between two low rocky promontories and found ourselves suddenly transported from the open sea and its heavy roll and swell into a highland lake placid as the face of a mirror in the recesses of a pine forest  the transition was startling  from the peculiar shape of the bay and the deep indentations its various coves make into the shore one sees but a small portion of the harbour at a glance from the point we brought up at  we therefore thought it ridiculously small after our expectations had been so highly wrought in san francisco  the whole scenery is of the highland character  the rocky shores the pine trees running down to the edge of the lake their dark foliage trembling over the glittering surface which reflected them the surrounding hills and the deathlike silence  i was both delighted and disappointeddelighted with the richness of the scenery but disappointed at the smallness of the harbour  can this little loch imprisoned within natural ramparts of rocks buried in the solitude of a forest be the place which i hoped would become so famous the great destiny of which has been prognosticated by statesmen and publicists and the possession of which is bitterly envied us by neighbouring nations this the place where england is to centre a naval force hitherto unknown in the pacific whence her fleets are to issue for the protection of her increasing interests in the western world this the seaport of the singapore of the pacific the modern tyre into which the riches of the east are to flow and be distributed to the western nations the terminus of railway communication which is to connect the atlantic with the pacific  victoria is distant from esquimault by land about three miles round by sea double the distance  the intervening ground is an irregular promontory having the waters of the straits of fuca on the south the bay of victoria on the east and the victoria arm encircling it on the north  the promontory contains three farms reclaimed from the forest of pines oaks alders willows and evergreens  the soil is good and produces fair crops of the ordinary cereals oats barley and wheat and good grass turnips and potatoes  i came the first time to victoria round by water  the rowing of our boat was much impeded by kelp  the shore is irregular somewhat bold and rockytwo more facts which confirmed the resemblance of the scenery to that of the western coast of scotland  the bay of victoria runs in a zigzag shapetwo long sharp promontories on the southward hiding the town from view until we get quite close up to it  a long low sandspit juts out into it which makes the entrance hazardous for large vessels at some little distance below the town and higher up the anchorage is shallow  twice at low tides i saw two or three ugly islands revealed where ships would have to anchor  in short victoria is not a good harbour for a fleet  for small vessels and traders on the coast it will answer well enough  victoria stands nobly on a fine eminence a beautiful plateau on the rocky shore of the bay of the same name  generations yet to come will pay grateful tribute to the sagacity and good taste of the man who selected it  there is no finer site for a city in the world  the plateau drains itself on every side by the natural depressions which intersect it and there is space enough to build a paris on  the views are also good  across the straits you have the olympian range washed by the sea towards the interior picturesque views of wooded hills opposite the fine woodland scenery of the country intervening between it and esquimault the victoria arm glimpses of which as seen through the foliage look like a series of inland lakes while in front just at ones feet is the bay itself and its tributaries or arms rather jamess bay etcetera always beautiful and behind towards the southeast end of the island is a view of great beauty and grandeura cluster of small islands san juan and others water in different channels straits and creeks and two enormous mountains in the far distance covered from base to summit with perpetual snow  these are mounts baker and rainier in washington territory  such are a fewand i am quite serious when i say only a fewof the beauties which surround victoria  as to the prospects of vancouvers island as a colony i would say that if it shall turn out that there is an extensive and rich goldfield on the mainland in british territory as there is every reason to believe the island will become a profitable field for all trades industries and labour  the population will soon increase from canada whence an immigration of many thousands is already spoken of from australia south america the atlantic statesand no doubt from europe also if this happens the tradesman and the labourer will find employment and the farmer will find a ready market at good prices for his produce  should the gold suddenly disappear the island will have benefited by the impulse just given to immigration for no doubt many who came to mine will remain to cultivate the soil and to engage in other pursuits if this be the termination of the present fever then to the farmer who is satisfied with a competencyfull garners and good larder who loves retirement is not ambitious of wealth is fond of a mild agreeable and healthy climate and a most lovely country to live inthe island offers every attraction  its resources are plenty of timber towards the northern portion producing spars of unequalled quality which are becoming of great value in england and will soon be demanded in france now that the forests of norway and of maine are becoming exhausted limestone in abundance which burns into good lime for building and for agricultural purposes coal in plenty now worked at nanaimo on the northern side of the island by the hudsons bay companythe quality is quite good judging from the specimens i saw burningit answers well for steam purposes and would have found a ready sale in san francisco were it not subject to a heavy duty of 30 per cent i think under the american tariff iron copper gold and potters clay  i have no doubt that a goldfield will be discovered on the island as it gets opened up to enterprising explorers  a friend of mine brought down some sand from the seabeach near victoria and assayed it the other day  it produced gold in minute quantity and i have heard of gold washings on the island  the copper is undeveloped  the potters clay has been tested in england and found to be very good  the character of the soil is favourable to agriculture  it is composed of a black vegetable mould of a foot to two feet in depth overlaying a hard yellow clay  the surface earth is very fine pulverised and sandy quite black and no doubt of good quality when sharpened with sheepfeeding it produces heavy crops  the fallen trees which are very numerous shew that the substratum of clay is too hard to produce anything  the roots of the pine never penetrate it  in some places the spontaneous vegetation testifies to the richness of the soilsuch as wild pease or vetches and wild clover which ihave seen reach up to my horses bellyand a most luxuriant growth of underwood brambles fern etcetera  i visited seven farms within short distances of victoria  the crops were oats barley wheat pease potatoes turnips garden herbs and vegetables fruits and flowers no clover the natural grass supplying sufficient food for the cattle and sheep  the crops were all healthy but not heavy  the wheat was not thick on the ground nor had it a large head  it was such a crop as would be an average only in a rich wellcultivated district of england or scotland far lighter than you would see in the rich counties of england and in the carse of gowrie  i was informed that the ground was very badly prepared by indian labour merely scratched over the surface  i believe that with efficient labour and skilful treatment the crops could be nearly doubled  the oats and barley were very good crops and the potatoes looked quite healthy and i doubt not will turn out the best crop of all  the peas were decidedly an abundant crop  vegetables thrive well and all the ordinary fruits apples currants etcetera are excessively abundant some of the currantbushes breaking down with the weight of their fruit  flowers of the ordinary sorts do well but delicate plants dont thrive owing to the coldness of the nights  sheep thrive admirably  i saw some very fine pure southdowns  the rams were selling at 100 dollars each 20 pounds to california sheep farmers  other breedshybrids of southdowns merinos and other stockwere also in good condition and fair in size  black cattle do well also  the breed is a mixture of english and american which makes very good beef  the horses are little indian breeds and some crosses with american stock all very clean limbed sound active hardy and full of endurance and high spirit until they get into liverystables  during my stay the climate was charming the weather perfectionwarm during the day but free of glare and not oppressive cool in the evenings with generally a gentle sea breeze  the long daysthe protracted daylight eking out the day to nine oclock at nightthe lingering sunset and the ample gloaming all so different from what i had been accustomed to in more southern latitudes again reminded me of scotland in the summer season  so far as i wanderedabout ten miles round victoriathe landscape is totted with extensive croppings of rock which interfere with the labours of the husbandman  few cornfields are without a lot of boulders or a ridge or two of rocks rising up above the surface of the ground  consequently the cultivated fields are small and were sneered at by my californian neighbours who are accustomed to vast open prairies under crop  i have seen one field of 1000 acres all under wheat in california  but then no other country is so favoured as this is for all the interests of agriculture  the scenery of the inland country around victoria is a mixture of english and scotch  where the pine they are all douglass pines prevails you have the good soil broken into patches by the croppings of rock producing ferns ryegrass and some thistles but very few  this is the scottish side of the picture  then you come to the oak region and here you have clumps open glades rows single trees of umbrageous form presenting an exact copy of english park scenery  there is no running water unfortunately but the meadows and little prairies that lie ensconced within the woods shew no signs of suffering from lack of water  the nights bring heavy dews and there are occasional rains which keep them fresh and green  i am told that in september rains fall which renew the face of nature so suddenly that it assumes the garb of spring the flowers even coming out  the winter is a little cold but never severe  i have heard it complained of as being rather wet and muggy  frost and snow fall but do not endure long  the climate is usually represented as resembling that of england  in some respects the parallel may hold good but there is no question that vancouver has more steady fine weather is far less changeable and is on the whole milder  two marked differences i remarkedthe heat was never sweltering as is sometimes the case in england and the wind never stings as it too often does in the mother country  the climate is unquestionably superior in vancouver  to resume our description of the coast the southern shore of the strait of juan de fuca is described by vancouver as being composed of sandy cliffs of moderate height falling perpendicularly into the sea from the top of which the land takes a further gentle ascent where it is entirely covered with trees chiefly of the pine tribe until the forest reaches a range of high craggy mountains which seem to rise from the woodland in a very abrupt manner with a few scattered trees on their sterile sides and their tops covered with snow  on the north the shore is not so high the ascent more gradual from thence to the tops of the mountains which are less covered with snow than those to the south they have from the strait the appearance of a compact range  proceeding up the strait about seventy miles a long low sandy point attracted vancouvers attention from its resemblance to dungeness on the coast of kent he named it new dungeness and found within it good anchorage in from ten to three fathoms beyond this the coast forms a deep bay about nine miles across and three miles from its eastern point lies protection island so named from the position it occupies at the entrance of port discovery  vancouver landed on it on the 1st of may 1792 and thus describes its appearanceon landing on the west end and ascending its eminence which was a nearly perpendicular cliff our attention was immediately called to a landscape almost as enchantingly beautiful as the most elegantly finished pleasuregrounds in europe the summit of this island presented nearly a horizontal surface interspersed with some inequalities of ground which produced a beautiful variety on an extensive lawn covered with luxuriant grass and diversified with abundance of flowers  to the northwestward was a coppice of pine trees and shrubs of various sorts that seemed as if it had been planted for the purpose of protecting from the northwest winds this delightful meadow over which were promiscuously scattered a few clumps of trees that would have puzzled the most ingenious designer of pleasuregrounds to have arranged more agreeably  while we stopped to contemplate these several beauties of nature in a prospect no less pleasing than unexpected we gathered some gooseberries and roses in a state of considerable forwardness  from this island lying at the entrance of port discovery commences the maritime importance of the territory with says vancouver as fine a harbour as any in the world though subsequently he awards the palm to its neighbour port hudson  its shores and scenery have been thus described by vancouver  the delightful serenity of the weather greatly aided the beautiful scenery that was now presented the surface of the sea was perfectly smooth and the country before us presented all that bounteous nature could be expected to draw into one point of view  as we had no reason to imagine that this country had ever been indebted for any of its decorations to the hand of man i could not possibly believe that any uncultivated country had ever been discovered exhibiting so rich a picture  the land which interrupted the horizon below the northwest and north quarters seemed to be much broken from whence its eastern extent round to southeast was bounded by a ridge of snowy mountains appearing to lie nearly in a north and south direction on which mount baker rose conspicuously remarkable for its height and the snowy mountains that stretch from its base to the north and south  between us and this snowy range the land which on the seashore terminated like that we had lately passed in low perpendicular cliffs or on beaches of sand or stone rose here in a very gentle ascent and was well covered with a variety of stately forest trees these however did not conceal the whole face of the country in one uninterrupted wilderness but pleasantly clothed its eminences and chequered the valleys presenting in many directions extensive spaces that wore the appearance of having been cleared by art like the beautiful island we had visited the day before  a picture so pleasing could not fail to call to our remembrance certain delightful and beloved situations in old england  both the approaches to this port round the extremities of protection island are perfectly free from obstruction and about a league in breadth  separated from port discovery only by a narrow slip of land from a mile and ahalf to two miles broad which trending to the east protects it from the north and west is port hudson having its entrance at the extremity of the point on the east side but little more than one mile broad from which the harbour extends in a semicircular form for about four miles westward and then trending for about six more affords excellent shelter and anchorage for vessels in from ten to twenty fathoms with an even bottom of mud  in latitude 48 degrees 16 minutes the waters of the strait are divided by a high white sandy cliff with verdant lawns on each side this was named by vancouver point partridge  it forms the western extremity of an island long low verdant and wellwooded lying close to the coast and having its south end at the mouth of a river rising in those mountains which here form a barrier to the further progress of the sea the snowcovered peak of the most lofty of these is visible soon after entering the strait  vancouver named it mount baker from the officer of his ship by whom it was first seen  this mountain with mount olympus and another further to the south named by the same navigator mount rainier form nearly an equilateral triangle and tower over the rest the giant wardens of the land  from point partridge he southern branch extends about fifteen miles below the island before mentioned this vancouver named admiralty inlet  here the tides begin to be sufficiently rapid to afford obstruction to navigation and hence it parts in two arms one named hoods canal taking a southwest course and the other continuing a south course for forty miles and then also bending to the west terminates in a broad sound studded with islands called by him pugets sound  on the east coast of admiralty inlet there is a broad sound with very deep water and rapid tides but affording good anchorage in the mouth of the river  here vancouver landed and took formal possession of the country on monday the 4th of june with the usual solemnities and under a royal salute from the ships in the name of his britannic majesty king george the third and for his heirs and successorsthat day being his majestys birthdayfrom latitude 39 degrees 20 minutes to the entrance of this inlet supposed to be the strait of juan de fuca as well the northern as the southern shores together with those situated in the interior sea extending from the said strait in various directions between the northwest northeast and south quarters  this interior sea he named the gulf of georgia and the continent bounding the said gulf and extending southward to the 45th degree of north latitude new georgia in honour of his majesty george the third  the sound he named from this incident possession sound  of the country round the sound he thus writesour eastern view was now bounded by the range of snowy mountains from mount baker bearing by compass north to mount rainier bearing north 54 degrees east  this mountain was hid by the more elevated parts of the low land and the intermediate snowy mountains in various rugged and grotesque shapes were seen just to rear their heads above the lofty pine trees which appeared to compose an uninterrupted forest between us and the snowy range presenting a most pleasing landscape nor was our west view destitute of similar diversification  the ridge of mountains on which mount olympus is situated whose rugged summits were seen no less fancifully towering over the forest than those of the east side bounded to a considerable extent our western horizon on these however not one conspicuous eminence arose nor could we now distinguish that which on the seacoast appeared to be centrally situated forming an elegant biforked mountain from the south extremity of these ridges of mountains there seemed to be an extensive tract of land moderately elevated and beautifully diversified by pleasing inequalities of surface enriched with every appearance of fertility  the narrow channel from possession sound at the back of the long island lying at its mouth which vancouver named whidbeys island affords some small but convenient harbours its northern entrance is so choked with rocks as to be scarcely practicable for vessels but its southern is wide and the navigation unimpeded  the northern arm of the straits commences in an archipelago of small islands well wooded and fertile but generally without water in one of them however vancouver found good anchorage though exposed to the south having wood water and every necessary this he named strawberry cove from that fruit having been found there in great abundance and the island from the trees which covered it cypress island  about this part the continental shore is high and rocky though covered with wood and it may be remarked generally that the northern shore of the gulf becomes more rocky and sterile shewing gradually a less and less variety of trees until those of the pine tribe alone are found  above the archipelago the straits widen swelling out to the east in a double bay affording good anchorage beyond which the shores become low and sandy and a wide bank of sand extends along them about one or two miles closely approaching the opposite side of the gulf leaving a narrow but clear channel  this bank affording large sturgeon was named by vancouver after that fish and keeping to the south around it he did not observe that here the gulf receives the waters of fraser river from the north  here the gulf is open and the navigation unimpeded except by a few islands on the north shore one of them named by the spaniards de feveda deserves notice it is parallel with the shore narrow and about thirty miles long  among the natural features of this part of the north shore of the gulf must not be omitted on account of their singularity the small saltwater lakes which are found divided from the sea only by a narrow ledge of rock having a depth over it of four feet at highwater  they are consequently replenished by the sea every tide and form saltwater cascades during the ebb and rise of of the tides some of them divided into several branches run through a low swampy woodland country  here also are streams of water so warm as to be unpleasant to the hand and every feature of this district evidences the violent effort of nature in its production  except the coast and canals nothing is known of it but its mineral riches are scarcely problematical  the channels between the several islands which here obstruct the gulf are narrow deep and much impeded by the strength of the tide which is sufficient in some places to stop the progress of a steamvessel as has been frequently experienced by the hudsons bay companys steamboat beaver yet vancouver found no difficulty in working his vessels through johnstones strait the passage between these islands and the southern shore against a headwind being compelled as he says to perform a complete traverse from shore to shore through its whole length and without meeting the least obstruction from rocks or shoals  he adds the great depth of water not only here but that which is generally found washing the shores of this very broken and divided country must ever be considered a peculiar circumstance and a great inconvenience to its navigation we however found a sufficient number of stoppingplaces to answer all our purposes and in general without going far out of our way  from this archipelago extending about sixty miles the strait widens into a broad expanse which swells to the north in a deep sound filled with islands called broughtons archipelago  this part was named by vancouver queen charlottes sound and is here fifteen miles broad exclusive of the archipelago but it contracts immediately to less than ten and sixty miles from johnstone straits joins the pacific its northern boundary  cape caution being in latitude 51 degrees 10 minutes  the entrance to the sound is choked with rocks and shoals  here between broughtons archipelago and cape caution another mountain called mount stephen conspicuous from its irregular form and great elevation and worthy to be named with those to the south seems to mount guard over the northern entrance to the straits  from cape caution off which are several groups of rocks to latitude 54 degrees 40 minutes where the russian territory commences the coast has much the same character as that already described between the gulf of georgia and the sea but that its harsher features are occasionally much softened and its navigation less impeded  throughout its whole length it is cut up by long and deep canals which form various archipelagos of islands and penetrate deeply and circuitously into the land which is high but not so precipitous as about desolation sound and generally covered with trees  the islands lying close to the shore follow its sinuosities and through the narrow channels thus formed the currents are rapid those more detached are more fertile they are all the resort of the natives during the fishing season  their formation is granite the prevailing rock north of latitude 49 degrees  distant thirty miles at its nearest and ninety at its furthest point from the line of islands which cover this coast and under parallels 52 degrees and 54 degrees lies queen charlottes island called by the americans washington  it is in form triangular about 150 miles long and above sixty at its greatest breadth and contains upwards of 4000 square miles  possessed of an excellent harbour on its east coast in latitude 53 degrees 3 minutes and another on the north at hancocks river the port entrada of the spaniards it is a favourite resort of traders  the climate and soil are excellent hills lofty and well wooded and its coast especially on the west side deeply indented by arms of the sea among which may be named englefield bay and cartwrights sound  coal and some metals are said to have been found on this island  on the whole the character of this coast seems to be well expressed by lieutenant wilkes when he saysnothing can exceed the beauty of these waters and their safety not a shoal exists within the straits of juan de fuca admiralty inlet pugets sound or hoods canal that can in any way interrupt their navigation by a 74 gun ship  i venture nothing in saying there is no country in the world that possesses waters equal to these    chapter five  native tribes  mr nicolay in his treatise on the oregon territory gives a minute and graphic account of the aboriginal inhabitants of this district from which we purpose making some extracts to enrich our pages  the principal indian tribes commencing from the south are the callapuyas shaste klamet umqua rogues river and chinooks between the californian boundary and columbia to the west of the cascade mountains the shoshones or snake and nezperces tribes about the southern branch of the columbia and cascade indians on the river of that name between the columbia and the strait of fuca the tatouche or classet tribe and the clalams about port discovery the sachet about possession sound the wallawalla flathead flatbow indians and cour daleine or pointed heart about the rivers of the same names the chunnapuns and chanwappans between the cascade range and the north branch of the columbia the kootanie to the east between it and the rocky mountains and to the north about okanagan various branches of the carrier tribe  of those on the coast to the north and on vancouver island not much is known  their numbers may be stated at a rough estimate as   on the coast below the columbia            2500  about the cascades                         1500  on the snake river and its tributary       2500  between the columbia and strait of de fuca 3000  about fort vancouver                       1500  wallawalla                                1500  flathead etcetera                        1200  okanagan                                     750  northward                                  2500  vancouvers and queen charlottes island   5000  possession sound                             650  fraser river                                 500  on the coast of the gulf of georgia          500  total                                     23500   this is however 6000 less than was reported to the congress of the united states and 4000 more than mr wilkes calculation  that there are errors in this there can be no doubt and it is probable that some smaller tribes may be omitted in the above calculation the number therefore between parallels 42 degrees and 54 degrees 40 minutes may be roughly estimated at 30000  through the care of the hudsons bay company and the semicivilised habits they have adopted the number of indians to the north of the columbia is not on the decrease to the south it is and the total must be very considerably less than it was before the settlement was made among them  the indian nations in oregon may be divided into three classes differing in habits and character according to their locality and means of sustenancethe indians of the coast the mountains and the plains the first feed mostly on fish and weave cloth for clothing from the wool or hair of the native sheep having to a great extent settled residences though these last characteristics are rapidly disappearing the second trappers and hunters wandering for the most part in pursuit of game and the third the equestrian tribes who on the great plains about the waters of the rivers chase on their fleet horses the gigantic bison whose flesh supplies them with food and whose hide covers them the former bear some resemblance to the native inhabitants of the islands of the pacific  the two latter are in every respect red men those on the coast were first known and when visited by the early voyagers had the characteristics which from contiguity to white men have deteriorated in the south but which have been retained in the northhigh courage determination and great ingenuity but joined to cruelty and faithlessness and as in the south destruction island obtained its name from their savage cruelty so does the coast throughout its length afford the same testimony  cook who first discovered them says they were thieves in the strictest sense of the word for they pilfered nothing from us but what they knew could be converted to the purposes of utility and had a real value according to their estimation of things  their form is thick and clumsy but they are not deficient in strength or activity when young their colour is not dark nor their features hard but exposure to the weather want of mental culture and their dirty habits soon reduce them all to the same dark complexion and dull phlegmatic want of expression which is strongly marked in all of them  in cooks time and till the white men settled among them their dress was a flaxen mantle ornamented with fur above and tassels and fringes which passing under the left arm is tied over the right shoulder leaving the right side open this is fastened round the waist by a girdle above this which reaches below the knee a circular cape perforated in the centre to admit the head made of the same substance and also fringed in the lower part is worn it covers the arms to the elbows  their head is covered with a cap conical but truncated made of fine matting ornamented at the top with a knot or tassels  besides the above dress common to both sexes the men frequently throw over their garments the skin of a bear wolf or seaotter with the fur outwards they wear the hair loose unless tied up in the scalpinglock they cover themselves with paint and swarm with vermin upon the paint they strew mica to make it glitter  they perforate the nose and ears and put various ornaments into them  but besides these common habits they have official and ceremonious occasions on which they wear beautiful furs and theatrical dresses and disguises including large masks and their wardress formed of a thick doubled leathern mantle of elk or buffalo skin frequently with a cloak over it on which the hoofs of horses were strung makes an almost impervious cuirass  their love for music general lively dispositions except from provocation but determination in avenging insult or wrong is testified by all  cook also gives a full description of their houses and manner of life of the former he says they are made of split boards and large enough for several families who occupy small pens on each side of the interior  they have benches and boxes and many of their utensils such as pipes etcetera are frequently carved as are also gigantic human faces on large trunks of trees which they set up for posts to their dwellings  in their persons and houses they were filthy in the extreme in their habits lazy but the women were modest and industrious  their principal food was fish but they had edible roots and game from the land  a favourite article of food was also the roe of herrings dried on pine branches or seaweed  their weapons were spears arrows slings and clubs similar to the new zealanders also an axe not dissimilar to the north american tomahawk the handle of which is usually carved  they made garments of pinebark beaten fine these were made by hand with plaited thread and woollen so closely wove as to resemble cloth and frequently had worked on them figures of men and animals on one was the whole process of the whale fishery  their aptitude for the imitative arts was very great  their canoes were rather elegantly formed out of trees with rising prow frequently carved in figures they differ from those of the pacific generally in having neither sails nor outriggers they had harpoons and spears for whalefishing vancouver when at port discovery saw some long poles placed upright on the beach at equal distances the object of which he could not discover and it was not till the last voyage of discovery despatched from the united states under commodore wilkes that they were ascertained to have been used for hanging nets upon to catch wildfowl by night their ingenuity in this and in netting salmon is very remarkable  they have two nets the drawing and casting net made of a silky grass found on the banks of the columbia or the fibres of the roots of trees or of the inner bark of the white cedar  the salmonfishing on the columbia commences in june the main body according to the habit of this fish dividing at the mouth of the tributary streams to ascend then to their sources  at the rapids and falls the work of destruction commences with a bagnet not unlike to an european fishermans landingnet on a pole thirty feet long the indians take their stand on the rocks or on platforms erected for the purpose and throwing their nets into the river above their standingplaces let them float down the rapids to meet the fish as they ascend  by this means many are caught they have also stakenets and lines with stones for leads they also catch many with hook and line and sometimes now they have firearms shoot them their mode of fishing for sturgeon is also peculiar  the line made of twisted fibres of the roots of trees is attached to a large wooden hook and let down over the side of a canoe those used for this purpose are small having only one or two men at most in them having hooked a fish they haul him gently up till he floats on the water then with a heavy mallet with one blow on the head they kill him with singular dexterity they contrive to jerk a fish of three hundred pounds over the lowered side of the canoe by a single effort  they catch whales also by means of harpoons with bladders attached  the oil is sold to the hudsons bay company  it has been said that their houses were made of boards but some constructive art is displayed in their erection as was much ingenuity in procuring the materials before axes were introduced among them for they contrived to fell trees with a rough chisel and mallet the houses are made of centreposts about eighteen feet high upon which a long pole rests forming the ridge of the roof from whence rafters descend to another like it but not more than five feet from the ground to these again cross poles are attached and against these are placed boards upright and the lower end fixed in the ground across these again poles are placed and tied with cords of cedar bark to those inside of the roof which are similarly disposed the planks are double these houses are divided on each side into stalls and pens occupied as sleeping places during the night and the rafters serve to suspend the fish which are dried by the smoke in its lengthened course through the interstices of the roof and walls  in their superstitions theatricals dances and songs they have much similarity to the natives of polynesia debased now and degraded even beneath their former portraitfast fading away before the more genial sun of the fortunes of the white manthe indians on the southern coast are no longer free and warlike and being in subjection to the hudsons bay company english manufactures are substituted for the efforts of their native industry  the mode of burial practised among the tribes on the coast is very peculiar  the corpse is placed sometimes in a canoe raised a few feet from the ground with arms and other necessaries beside it  these are not unfrequently spoiled beforehand to prevent their being stolen as if they thought they might like their owner be restored to their former state in the new world  sometimes they are put in upright boxes like sentryboxessometimes in small enclosuresbut usually kept neat and those of the chiefs frequently painted  mount coffin at the mouth of the cowelitz seems to have been appropriated to the burial of persons of importance it is about seven hundred feet high and quite isolated on it were to be seen the canoecoffins of the natives in every stage of decay they were hung between the trees about five feet from the ground  this cemetery of the columbia is however destroyed for the american sailors under wilkes neglecting to put out their cookingfire it spread over the whole mountain and continued to rage through the night till all was burnt  a few small presents appeased the indians who but a few years before could only have drowned the remembrance of such a national disgrace in the blood of those who caused it  among the tribes about the lower part of the columbia the singular custom of flattening the head still prevails though not to the extent it did formerly mr dunn thus describes the operation  immediately after the birth the infant is laid in an oblong wooden trough by way of cradle with moss under the head the end on which the head reposes is raised higher than the rest a padding is then placed on the infants forehead with a piece of cedarbark over it it is pressed down by cords which pass through holes on each side of the trough  as the tightening of the padding and pressure of the head is gradual the process is said not to be attended with much pain  the appearance of the infant however while under it is shockingits little black eyes seem ready to start from their sockets the mouth exhibits all the appearance of internal convulsion and it clearly appears that the face is undergoing a process of unnatural configuration  about a years pressure is sufficient to produce the desired effect the head is ever after completely flattened and as slaves are always left to nature this deformity is consequently a mark of free birth  the indians on the north coast possess the characteristics of the southern but harsher and more boldly definedthey are of fiercer and more treacherous dispositions  indeed those of the south have a disposition to merriment and lighthearted good humour  their mechanical ingenuity is more remarkably displayed in the carving on their pipes and especially in working iron and steel  the indians of the coast are doubtless all from the same stock modified by circumstances and locality  those however to the south of the columbia about the waters of the rivers klamet and umqua partake largely of the characteristics of the indians of the plains their country having prairies and themselves possessing horses they are remarkable for nothing but their determined hostility towards the whites  idleness and filth are inveterate among all three but among the indians of the plains there is a marked difference there their food consist of fish indeed and dried for winter but not entirely being more varied by venison than on the coast and in the winter by roots which they dig up and lay by in store  they live more in moveable tents and to the south their great wealth is their horses they are not like the coast indians of small stature and inelegantly made but remarkable for comeliness of person and elegance of carriage they are equestrian in their habits and shew to great advantage on horseback  the principal tribes are the shoshones and wallawalla between whom as between the former and the blackfeet there has been continual war  the shoshones dwell between the rocky and blue mountain ranges the wallawalla about the river of that fame the blackfeet at the foot of the rocky mountains principally but not entirely on the eastern side  warlike and independent the blackfeet had for a long time the advantage having been earlier introduced to the use of firearms but by the instrumentality of the hudsons bay company they have been of late years more on an equality they are friendly to the whites but the blackfeet their mortal enemies and their hillforts overhanging the passes of the rocky mountains make the future safety of the journey to the united states depend on the temper of this fickle and bloodthirsty nation who have been well termed the arabs of the west for truly their hand is against every man and every mans hand against them and though seriously lessened in number by war and disease they still dwell in the presence of all their brethren  the shoshones feed frequently on horseflesh and have also large quantities of edible roots which stand them in great stead during the winter  when the men are fishing for salmon the women are employed in digging and preserving the roots  there is indeed one tribe inhabiting the country of the salt lakes and springs to the south of the headwaters of the snake or saptin river who have no wish beyond these roots living in the most bestial manner possible these from their single occupation have been named diggers  above the wallawalla also there is a tribe called the basket people from their using a basket in fishing for salmon  the apparatus consists of a large wicker basket supported by long poles inserted into it and fixed in the rocks to the basket is joined a long frame spreading above against which the fish in attempting to leap the falls strike and fall into the basket it is taken up three times a day and at each haul not unfrequently contains three hundred fine fish the flatheads dwelling about the river of that name are the most northern of the equestrian tribes their characteristics are intelligence and aptitude for civilisation yet in the early history of the country their fierceness and barbarity in war could not be exceeded especially in their retaliation on the blackfeet of which ross cox gives a horrible account  the usual dress of these tribes is a shirt leggings and mocassins of deerskin frequently much ornamented with fringes of beads and formerly in the braves with scalps a cap of handkerchief generally covers the head but the shoshones twist their long black hair into a natural helmet more useful as a protection than many artificial defences in winter a buffalo robe is added to the usual clothing  horses abound among them and they are usually well armed through the influence of the hudsons bay company these tribes are beaming amalgamated by intermarriage and will doubtless from their pliability of disposition readiness of perception and capability for improvement generally no less than their friendship for the whites and devotion to the company gradually lose their identity in acquired habits and knowledge and become the peaceful proprietors of a country rich in flocks and herds even very much cattle  the more northern indians inhabiting the mountainous country round the headwaters of oregon river and the branches of the columbia evidence an origin similar to the chippewayan tribes on the east of the rocky mountains mackenzie found but little difference when travelling from one to the other and his guides were generally well understood like them they have exchanged their shirts and robes of skins for european manufactures and their bows and spears for firearms  among them the greater part of the furs exported by the hudsons bay company are procured and the return of the traffic supplies all their wants they differ however in manners and habits for among them is found the tribe of carriers whose filthiness and bestiality cannot be exceeded whose dainties are of putrid flesh and are eaten up with disease nevertheless they are a tall wellformed goodlooking race and not wanting in ingenuity  their houses are well formed of logs of small trees buttressed up internally frequently above seventy feet long and fifteen high but unlike those of the coast the roof is of bark their winter habitations are smaller and often covered over with grass and earth some even dwell in excavations of the ground which have only an aperture at the top and serves alike for door and chimney  salmon deer bears and wildfowl are their principal food of the latter they procure large quantities  their mode of taking salmon is curious  they build a weir across the stream having an opening only in one place at which they fix a basket three feet in diameter with the mouth made something like an eeltrap through which alone the fish can find a passage  on the side of this basket is a hole to which is attached a smaller basket into which the fish pass from the large one and cannot return or escape  this when filled is taken up without disturbing the larger one  of the religion and superstitions of the indians little need be said the features of polytheism being everywhere as similar as its effects impudent conjurers are their priests and teachers and exerted once unlimited sway but under the satisfactory proofs of the value of scientific medical practice and the tuition of the missionaries it is to be hoped both their claims to respect will be negatived and as they have evinced great aptitude to embrace and profit by instruction it may perhaps happen that secular knowledge may combine with religious to save them from the apparent necessary result  in closing this brief account of the goldfields of new caledonia we cannot avoid adverting to the great event which has been we may say contemporaneous with these discoveriesthe laying down of the atlantic telegraph  the sources of an apparently boundless and dazzling wealth have been opened up in the far west of america and a mighty stream of thought has begun its perpetual flow backwards and forwards between her eastern shores and england  we hail the coincidence as an assurance that friendly communication and peace and goodwill shall go hand and hand with the getting of gold in and the civilising of these far off regions and we believe that god will use both these new and mighty engines for the advancement of the blessed gospel of our lord jesus christ in the british possessions of north america    appendix  correspondence relative to the discovery of gold in the fraser river district in british north america  presented to both houses of parliament by command of her majesty july 2 1858  number 1  governor douglas to the right hon henry labouchere mp  victoria vancouvers island april 16 1856  siri hasten to communicate for the information of her majestys government a discovery of much importance made known to me by mr angus mcdonald clerk in charge of fort colville one of the hudsons bay companys trading posts on the upper columbia district  that gentleman reports in a letter dated on the 1st of march last that gold has been found in considerable quantities within the british territory on the upper columbia and that he is moreover of opinion that valuable deposits of gold will be found in many other parts of that country he also states that the daily earnings of persons then employed in digging gold were ranging from 2 pounds to 8 pounds for each man  such is the substance of his report on that subject and i have requested him to continue his communications in respect to any further discoveries made  i do not know if her majestys government will consider it expedient to raise a revenue in that quarter by taxing all persons engaged in gold digging but i may remark that it will be impossible to levy such a tax without the aid of a military force and the expense in that case would probably exceed the income derived from the mines  i will not fail to keep you well informed in respect to the extent and value of the gold discoveries made and circumstances will probably be the best indication of the course which it may be expedient to take that is in respect to imposing a tax or leaving the field free and open to any persons who may choose to dig for gold  several interesting experiments in goldwashing have been lately made in this colony with a degree of success that will no doubt lead to further attempts for the discovery of the precious metal  the quantity of gold found is sufficient to prove the existence of the metal and the parties engaged in the enterprise entertain sanguine hopes of discovering rich and productive beds  i have etcetera signed james douglas governor  the right hon henry labouchere etcetera etcetera

discovery of gold within the british territory of the upper columbia river district  in the absence of all effective machinery of government i perceive that it would be quite abortive to attempt to raise a revenue from licences to dig for gold in that region  indeed as her majestys government do not at present look for a revenue from this distant quarter of the british dominions so neither are they prepared to incur any expense on account of it  i must therefore leave it to your discretion to determine the best means of preserving order in the event of any considerable increase of population flocking into this new gold district and i shall rely on your furnishing me with full and regular accounts of any event of interest or importance which may occur in consequence of this discovery  i have etcetera signed h labouchere  to governor douglas etcetera etcetera  no  iii  governor douglas to the right hon henry labouchere mp  victoria vancouvers island october 29 1856  sir1  i have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch number 14 of the 4th of august communicating the arrival of my despatch number 10 of the 16th april last in which was reported the discovery of gold within the british territory in the upper columbia river district  2  i have since the date of that letter received several other communications from my correspondent in that part of the country who however scarcely makes any allusion to the gold discovery but i have heard through other almost equally reliable sources of information that the number of persons engaged in gold digging is yet extremely limited in consequence of the threatening attitude of the native tribes who being hostile to the americans have uniformly opposed the entrance of american citizens into their country  3  the people from american oregon are therefore excluded from the gold district except such as resorting to the artifice of denying their country succeed in passing for british subjects  the persons at present engaged in the search of gold are chiefly of british origin and retired servants of the hudsons bay company who being well acquainted with the natives and connected by old acquaintanceship and the ties of friendship are more disposed to aid and assist each other in their common pursuits than to commit injuries against persons or property  4  they appear to pursue their toilsome occupation in peace and without molestation from the natives and there is no reason to suppose that any criminal act has been lately committed in that part of the country  5  it is reported that gold is found in considerable quantities and that several persons have accumulated large sums by their labour and traffic but i cannot vouch for the accuracy of these reports though on the other hand there is no reason to discredit them as about 220 ounces of gold dust have been brought to vancouvers island direct from the upper columbia a proof that the country is at least auriferous  from the successful result of experiments made in washing gold from the sands of the tributary streams of fraser river there is reason to suppose that the gold region is extensive and i entertain sanguine hopes that future researches will develop stores of wealth perhaps equal to the gold fields of california  the geological formations observed in the sierra nevada of california being similar in character to the structure of the corresponding range of mountains in this latitude it is not unreasonable to suppose that the resemblance will be found to include auriferous deposits  6  i shall not fail to furnish you with full and regular accounts of every event of interest connected with the gold district which may from time to time occur  i have etcetera signed james douglas governor  the right hon h labouchere etcetera etcetera etcetera  no  v  governor douglas to the right hon henry labouchere mp  victoria vancouvers island july 15 1857  received september 18 1857  sir1  i have the honour of communicating for your information the substance of advices which i have lately received from the interior of the continent north of the 49th parallel of latitude corroborating the former accounts from that quarter respecting the auriferous character of certain districts of the country on the right bank of the columbia river and of the extensive table land which divides it from fraser river  2  there is however as yet a degree of uncertainty respecting the productiveness of those gold fields for reports vary so much on that point some parties representing the deposits as exceedingly rich while others are of opinion that they will not repay the labour and outlay of working that i feel it would be premature for me to give a decided opinion on the subject  3  it is however certain that gold has been found in many places by washing the soil of the river beds and also of the mountainsides but on the other hand the quantities hitherto collected are inconsiderable and do not lend much support to the opinion entertained of the richness of these deposits so that the question as to their ultimate value remains thus undetermined and will probably not be decided until more extensive researches are made  4  a new element of difficulty in exploring the gold country has been interposed through the opposition of the native indian tribes of thompson river who have lately taken the highhanded though probably not unwise course of expelling all the parties of golddiggers composed chiefly of persons from the american territories who had forced an entrance into their country  they have also openly expressed a determination to resist all attempts at working gold in any of the streams flowing into thompson river both from a desire to monopolise the precious metal for their own benefit and from a wellfounded impression that the shoals of salmon which annually ascend those rivers and furnish the principal food of the inhabitants will be driven off and prevented from making their annual migrations from the sea  5  the officers in command of the hudsons bay companys posts in that quarter have received orders carefully to respect the feelings of the natives in that matter and not to employ any of the companys servants in washing out gold without their full approbation and consent  there is therefore nothing to apprehend on the part of the hudsons bay companys servants but there is much reason to fear that serious affrays may take place between the natives and the motley adventurers who will be attracted by the reputed wealth of the country from the united states possessions in oregon and may probably attempt to overpower the opposition of the natives by force of arms and thus endanger the peace of the country  6  i beg to submit if in that case it may not become a question whether the natives are not entitled to the protection of her majestys government and if an officer invested with the requisite authority should not without delay be appointed for that purpose  i have etcetera signed james douglas governor  the right hon h labouchere etcetera etcetera etcetera  no  vi  extract of a despatch from governor douglas to the right hon henry labouchere mp dated victoria vancouvers island december 29 1857  received march 2 1858  since i had the honour of addressing you on the 15th july last concerning the gold fields in the interior of the country north of the 49th parallel of latitude which for the sake of brevity i will hereafter speak of as the couteau mines so named after the tribe of indians who inhabit the country i have received farther intelligence from my correspondents in that quarter  it appears from their reports that the auriferous character of the country is becoming daily more extensively developed through the exertions of the native indian tribes who having tasted the sweets of gold finding are devoting much of their time and attention to that pursuit  they are however at present almost destitute of tools for moving the soil and of washing implements for separating the gold from the earthy matrix and have therefore to pick it out with their knives or to use their fingers for that purpose a circumstance which in some measure accounts for the small products of gold up to the present time the export being only about 300 ounces since the 6th of last october  the same circumstance will also serve to reconcile the opinion now generally entertained of the richness of the gold deposits by the few experienced miners who have seen the couteau country with the present paucity of production  the reputed wealth of the couteau mines is causing much excitement among the population of the united states territories of washington and oregon and i have no doubt that a great number of people from those territories will be attracted thither with the return of the fine weather in spring  in that case difficulties between the natives and whites will be of frequent occurrence and unless measures of prevention are taken the country will soon become the scene of lawless misrule  in my letter of the 15th of july i took the liberty of suggesting the appointment of an officer invested with authority to protect the natives from violence and generally so far as possible to maintain the peace of the country  presuming that you will approve of that suggestion i have as a preparatory step towards the proposed measure for the preservation of peace and order this day issued a proclamation declaring the rights of the crown in respect to gold found in its natural place of deposit within the limits of fraser river and thompson river districts within which are situated the couteau mines and forbidding all persons to dig or disturb the soil in search of gold until authorised on that behalf by her majestys government  i herewith forward a copy of that proclamation and also of the regulations since published setting forth the terms on which licences will be issued to legalise the search for gold on payment of a fee of ten shillings amonth payable in advance  when mining becomes a remunerative employment and there is a proof of the extent and productiveness of the gold deposits i would propose that the licence fee be gradually increased in such a manner however as not to be higher than the persons engaged in mining can readily pay  my authority for issuing that proclamation seeing that it refers to certain districts of continental america which are not strictly speaking within the jurisdiction of this government may perhaps be called in question but i trust that the motives which have influenced me on this occasion and the fact of my being invested with the authority over the premises of the hudsons bay company and the only authority commissioned by her majesty within reach will plead my excuse  moreover should her majestys government not deem it advisable to enforce the rights of the crown as set forth in the proclamation it may be allowed to fall to the ground and to become a mere dead letter  if you think it expedient that i should visit the couteau mines in course of the coming spring or summer for the purpose of inquiring into the state of the country and authorise me to do so if i can for a time conveniently leave this colony i freely place my services at the disposal of her majestys government

regulations legalising the search for gold in the districts of fraser river and thompson river transmitted with my despatch number 35 of the 29th of december last i have now the honour to communicate for your information that we have since that date raised the licence fee from ten shillings to twentyone shillings amonth payable in advance which is the present charge for gold licences  2  we are induced to make that change through a desire to place a large amount of revenue at the disposal of government to meet the expense of giving protection to life and property in those countries and at the same time from a wellfounded conviction that persons really bent upon visiting the gold district will as readily pay the increased as the lower rate of charge  i have etcetera signed james douglas governor  to the right hon henry labouchere etcetera etcetera etcetera  no  viii  governor douglas to the right hon h labouchere mp  victoria vancouvers island april 6 1858  sir1  since i had last the honour of addressing you in my despatch number 35 on the 29th of december last in reference to the discovery of gold in the couteau or thompson river district we have had much communication with persons who have since visited that part of the country  2  the search for gold and prospecting of the country had up to the last dates from the interior been carried on almost exclusively by the native indian population who have discovered the productive beds and put out almost all the gold about eight hundred ounces which has been hitherto exported from the country and who are moreover extremely jealous of the whites and strongly opposed to their digging the soil for gold  3  the few white men who passed the winter at the diggingschiefly retired servants of the hudsons bay companythough well acquainted with indian character were obstructed by the natives in their attempts to search for gold  they were on all occasions narrowly watched and in every instance when they did succeed in removing the surface and excavating to the depth of the auriferous stratum they were quietly hustled and crowded by the natives who having by that means obtained possession of the spot then proceeded to reap the fruits of their labours  4  such conduct was unwarrantable and exceedingly trying to the temper of spirited men but the savages were far too numerous for resistance and they had to submit to their dictation  it is however worthy of remark and a circumstance highly honourable to the character of those savages that they have on all occasions scrupulously respected the persons and property of their white visitors at the same that they have expressed a determination to reserve the gold for their own benefit  5  such being the purpose of the natives affrays and collisions with the whites will surely follow the accession of numbers which the latter are now receiving by the influx of adventurers from vancouvers island and the united states territories in oregon and there is no doubt in my mind that sooner or later the intervention of her majestys government will be required to restore and maintain the peace  up to the present time however the country continues quiet but simply i believe because the whites have not attempted to resist the impositions of the natives  i will however make it a part of my duty to keep you well informed in respect to the state of the gold country  6  the extent of the gold region is yet but imperfectly known and i have therefore not arrived at any decided opinion as to its ultimate value as a goldproducing country  the boundaries of the gold district have been however greatly extended since ay former report  7  in addition to the diggings before known on thompson river and its tributary streams a valuable deposit has been recently found by the natives on a bank of fraser river about fifty miles beyond its confluence with the thompson and gold in small quantities has been found in the possession of the natives as far as the great falls of fraser river about eighty miles above the forks  the small quantity of gold hitherto producedabout eight hundred ouncesby the large native population of the country is however unaccountable in a rich goldproducing country unless we assume that the want of skill industry and proper mining tools on the part of the natives sufficiently account for the fact  8  on the contrary the vein rocks and its other geological features as described by an experienced gold miner encourage the belief that the country is highly auriferous  9  the miner in question clearly described the older slate formations thrown up and pierced by beds of quartz granite porphyry and other igneous rocks the vast accumulations of sand gravel and shingle extending from the roots of the mountains to the banks of fraser river and its affluents which are peculiar characteristics of the gold districts of california and other countries  we therefore hope and are preparing for a rich harvest of trade which will greatly redound to the advantage of this colony  10  i have further to communicate for your information that the proclamation issued by me asserting the rights of the crown to all gold in its natural place of deposit and forbidding all persons to dig for gold without a licence has been published in the newspapers of oregon and washington territories and that notwithstanding some seventy or eighty adventurers from the american side have gone by the way of fraser river to the couteau mines without taking out licences  11  i did not as i might have done attempt to enforce those rights by means of a detachment of seamen and marines from the satellite without being assured that such a proceeding would meet with the approval of her majestys government but the moment your instructions on the subject are received i will take measures to carry them into effect  i have etcetera signed james douglas governor  the right hon henry labouchere mp etcetera etcetera etcetera  no  x  governor douglas to the right hon henry labouchere mp  victoria vancouvers island may 8 1858  since i had the honour of addressing you on the 6th of april last on the subject of the couteau gold mines they have become more than ever a source of attraction to the people of washington and oregon territories and it is evident from the accounts published in the latest san francisco papers that intense excitement prevails among the inhabitants of that stirring city on the same subject  the couteau country is there represented and supposed to be in point of mineral wealth a second california or australia and those impressions are sustained by the false and exaggerated statements of steamboat owners and other interested parties who benefit by the current of emigration which is now setting strongly towards this quarter  boats canoes and every species of small craft are continually employed in pouring their cargoes of human beings into fraser river and it is supposed that not less than one thousand whites are already at work and on the way to the gold districts  many accidents have happened in the dangerous rapids of that river a great number of canoes have been dashed to pieces and their cargoes swept away by the impetuous stream while of the illfated adventurers who accompanied them many have been swept into eternity  the others nothing daunted by the spectacle of ruin and buoyed up by the hope of amassing wealth still keep pressing onward towards the coveted goal of their most ardent wishes  on the 25th of last month the american steamer commodore arrived in this port direct from san francisco with 450 passengers on board the chief part of whom are gold miners for the couteau country  nearly 400 of those men were landed at this place and have since left in boats and canoes for fraser river  i ascertained from inquiries on the subject that those men are all well provided with mining tools and that there was no dearth of capital or intelligence among them  about sixty british subjects with an equal number of native born americans the rest being chiefly germans with a smaller proportion of frenchmen and italians composed this body of adventurers  they are represented as being with some exceptions a specimen of the worst of the population of san francisco the very dregs in fact of society  their conduct while here would have led me to form a very different conclusion as our little town though crowded to excess with this sudden influx of people and though there was a temporary scarcity of food and dearth of house accommodation the police few in number and many temptations to excess in the way of drink yet quiet and order prevailed and there was not a single committal for rioting drunkenness or other offences during their stay here  the merchants and other business classes of victoria are rejoicing in the advent of so large a body of the people in the colony and are strongly in favour of making this port a stopping point between san francisco and the gold mines converting the latter as it were into a feeder and dependency of this colony  victoria would thus become a depot and centre of trade for the gold districts and the natural consequence would be an immediate increase in the wealth and population of the colony  to effect that object it will be requisite to facilitate by every possible means the transport of passengers and goods to the furthest navigable point on fraser river and the obvious means of accomplishing that end is to employ light steamers in plying between and connecting this port victoria with the falls of fraser river distant 130 miles from the discharge of that river into the gulf of georgia those falls being generally believed to be at the commencement of the remunerative gold diggings and from thence the miners would readily make their way on foot or after the summer freshets by the river into the interior of the country  by that means also the whole trade of the gold regions would pass through fraser river and be retained within the british territory forming a valuable outlet for british manufactured goods and at once creating a lucrative trade between the mother country and vancouvers island  taking a view of the subject simply in its relations to trade and commerce apart from considerations of national policy such perhaps would be the course most likely to promote the interests of this colony but on the contrary if the country be thrown open to indiscriminate immigration the interests of the empire may suffer from the introduction of a foreign population whose sympathies may be decidedly antibritish  taking this view of the question it assumes an alarming aspect and suggests a doubt as to the policy of permitting the free entrance of foreigners into the british territory for residence without in the first place requiring them to take the oath of allegiance and otherwise to give such security for their conduct as the government of the country may deem it proper and necessary to require at their hands  the opinion which i have formed on the subject leads me to think that in the event of the diggings proving remunerative it will now be found impossible to check the course of immigration even by closing fraser river as the miners would then force a passage into the gold district by way of the columbia river and the valuable trade of the country in that case be driven from its natural course into a foreign channel and entirely lost to this country  on the contrary should the diggings prove to be unremunerative a question which as yet remains undecided the existing excitement we may suppose will die away of itself and the miners having no longer the prospect of large gains will naturally abandon a country which no longer holds out any inducement for them to remain  until the value of the country as a goldproducing region be established on clearer evidence than can now be adduced in its favourand the point will no doubt be decided before the close of the present yeari would simply recommend that a small naval or military force should be placed at the disposal of this government to enable us to maintain the peace and to enforce obedience to the laws  the system of granting licences for digging gold has not yet come into operation  perhaps a similar method of raising a revenue would be to impose a customs duty on imports to be levied on all supplies brought into the country whether by fraser or the columbia river  the export of gold from the country is still inconsiderable not exceeding 600 ounces since i last addressed you  the principal diggings are reported to be at present and will probably continue flooded for several months to come so that unless other diggings apart from the river beds are discovered the production of gold will not increase until the summer freshets are over which will probably happen about the middle of august next  in the meantime the illprovided adventurers who have gone hither and thither will consume their stock of provisions and probably have to retire from the country until a more favourable season  i shall be most happy to receive your instructions on the subject in this letter  no  xii  copy of a better from the secretary of the admiralty to herman merivale esquire  admiralty june 26 1858  siri am commanded by my lords commissioners of the admiralty to send you herewith for the information of secretary sir e bulwer lytton a copy of a letter from captain prevost of hm ship satellite dated at vancouvers island 7th may 1858 respecting the discovery of gold on fraser and thompson rivers near to the 51st parallel of north latitude in north america  the newspaper and specimen of gold dust referred to in captain prevosts letter are also enclosed  i am etcetera signed h corby  herman merivale esquire colonial office  enclosures number 12  hms satellite esquimault vancouvers island may 7 1858  i have the honour to report to you that considerable excitement has been occasioned recently in this neighbourhood by the discovery of gold on fraser and thompson rivers at about the position of the juncture of the latter with the former river near to 51st parallel of north latitude  the reports concerning these new gold diggings are so contradictory that i am unable to furnish you with any information upon which i can depend that gold exists is certain and that it will be found in abundance seems to be the opinion of all those who are capable of forming a judgment upon the subject but it is so obviously to the advantage of the surrounding community to circulate exaggerated if not altogether false reports for the purpose of stimulating trade or creating monopolies that it is most difficult to arrive at any correct conclusion or to obtain any reliable information  i have every reason to believe that the indians have traded some quantity of gold with the officers of the hudsons bay company and i am satisfied that individuals from this immediate neighbourhood who started off to the diggings upon the first intelligence of their existence have come back with gold dust in their possession and which they assert was washed by themselves but whether such be really the case or whether it was traded from the indians i am unable to determine  these persons all declare that at the present moment although the yield is good yet there is too much water in the rivers to admit of digging and washing to be carried on with facility but that when the water falls somewhat as the summer advances that the yield will be abundant  i am inclined to think that this information is not far from the truth for these persons after obtaining a fresh stock of provision have all returned to the diggings  the excitement in vancouvers island itself is quite insignificant compared to that in washington and oregon territories and in california and which of course is increased by every possible means by interested parties  the result has been that several hundred persons from american territory have already flocked to the newly reported auriferous regions and by the last accounts fresh steamers and even sailing vessels were being chartered to convey passengers to puget sound or to vancouvers island whence they have to find their way to the diggings principally by canoes  i have heard that all the crews of the ships in puget sound have deserted and have gone to the diggings i am happy to say that as yet i have not lost a single man from the satellite since the information was received and i have every reason to hope that i may not be unfortunate in this respect although doubtless soon the temptations to desert will be of no ordinary character  no  xiii  secretary sir e bulwer lytton to governor douglas  downing street july 1 1858  siri have to acknowledge your despatch of the 8th ult in continuation of former despatches informing the secretary of state from time to time of the progress of the gold discoveries on fraser river and the measures which you had taken in consequence  i am anxious not to let the opportunity of the present mail pass without informing you that her majestys government have under their consideration the pressing necessity for taking some steps to establish public order and government in that locality and that i hope very soon to be able to communicate to you the result  in the meantime her majestys government approve of the course which you have adopted in asserting both the dominion of the crown over this region and the right of the crown over the precious metals  they think however that you acted judiciously in waiting for further instructions before you endeavoured to compel the taking out of licences by causing any force to be despatched for that purpose from vancouvers island  they wish you to continue your vigilance and to apply for instructions on any point on which you may require them  they are however in addition particularly anxious to impress on you that while her majestys government are determined on preserving the rights both of government and of commerce which belong to this country and while they have it in contemplation to furnish you with such a force as they may be able to detach for your assistance and support in the preservation of law and order it is no part of their policy to exclude americans and other foreigners from the gold fields  on the contrary you are distinctly instructed to oppose no obstacle whatever to their resort thither for the purpose of digging in those fields so long as they submit themselves in common with the subjects of her majesty to the recognition of her authority and conform to such rules of police as you may have thought proper to establish  the national right to navigate fraser river is of course a separate question and one which her majestys government must reserve  under the circumstance of so large an immigration of americans into english territory i need hardly impress upon you the importance of caution and delicacy in dealing with those manifold cases of international relationship and feeling which are certain to arise and which but for the exercise of temper and discretion might easily lead to serious complications between two neighbouring and powerful states  it is impossible by this mail to furnish you with any instructions of a more definite character  her majestys government must leave much to your discretion on this most important subject and they rely upon your exercising whatever influence and powers you may possess in the manner which from local knowledge and experience you conceive to be best calculated to give development to the new country and to advance imperial interests  i have etcetera signed e bulwer lytton  governor douglas etcetera etcetera

its dependencies and viceadmiral of the same etcetera etcetera  whereas it is commonly reported that certain boats and other vessels have entered fraser river for trade and whereas there is reason to apprehend that other persons are preparing and fitting out boats and vessels for the same purpose  now therefore i have issued this my proclamation warning all persona that such acts are contrary to law and infringements upon the rights of the hudsons bay company who are legally entitled to trade with the indians in the british possessions on the northwest coast of america to the exclusion of all other persons whether british or foreign  and also that after fourteen days from the date of this my proclamation all ships boats and vessels together with the goods laden on board found in fraser

officer of the customs at victoria shall be liable to forfeiture and will be seized and condemned according to law  given under my hand and seal at government house victoria this eighth day of may in

licence and permit from the government at vancouvers island  4  that the said owner also binds himself not to trade with indians  advantages possessed by british columbia over australia as a field for emigration  from the times correspondent  from australia too the emigration will be large  in that country the cream has already been skimmed off the placers  the efflorescence of gold near the surface has been dug out hence the results of individual exertions are becoming less promising and the miner is a restless excitable creature whose love of freedom and independence indisposes him to associate himself in enterprises requiring an aggregation of capital and labour  he prefers to work on his own hook or with one or two chums at most  this is the feeling in this country  there is another cause which will bring vast numbers of miners from australia and that is the great scarcity of watera desideratum of the first importance  this first necessary for mining operations exists in abundance at all seasons in the new el dorado and this fact alone will attract additional miners to it from every mining country and locality in which water is scarce  another great objection to australia is the impossibility of acquiring land in fee in small parcels at or near to the mines  many men take to mining as a means of making sufficient money to buy farming implements and stock with  as soon as this object is accomplished they abandon mining for farming  did not california afford the means of gratifying this wish thousands of our miners would have left the country  as it is with abundance of good land to be had cheap i have found that a large proportion of the farms in the interior of this country are owned by farmers who bought them with the produce of their labour in the mines  the same advantages can be obtained in the new gold country there being plenty of good land in the british territory in the neighbourhood and on vancouvers island  it is to be hoped the government will make the price reasonable  prices of provisions etcetera at the gold fields  the following tariff of charges collected by the times correspondent is now only valuable in a historical point of view as under the healthy competition of the californian merchants prices have already found their own level  canoes are very scarce the price has risen from 50 dollars and 80 dollars to 100 dollars each  many parties have built light boats for themselves but they did not answer  we have got up but we had a hard time coming  jordan is a hard road to travel lost all our outfit except flour our canoe was capsized in the falls and was broken to pieces  six other canoes capsized and smashed the same day near the same place poor whites and two indians belonging to these six canoes drowned  provisions high up the river are exorbitant of course as they can only be brought up in canoes requiring long portages  heres the tariff at sailors bar and other barsflour 100 dollars abarrel worth in san francisco 11 to 12 dollars molasses 6 dollars agallon pork 1 dollar per pound ham 1 dollar 25 cents per pound tea at one place 1 dollar per pound but at another 4 dollars sugar 2 dollars per pound beans 1 dollar per pound picks 6 dollars and shovels 2 dollars each there were no fresh provisions  i should have been greatly surprised to hear that there had been  at fort hope there was nothing to be had but dried salmon  at fort langley plenty of black flour at 9 dollars ahundred and salt salmon four for 1 dollar  what lively visions of scurvy these provisions conjure up  the acme of extravagance was not arrived at however until the poor miner came to purchase auxiliaries to his rocker  at sailors bar rocker irons were at an ounce of gold each 16 dollars and at hills bar 30 dollars each  this iron is simply a plate of thin sheetiron measuring 18 inches by 20 inches perforated with round holes to let the loose dirt pass through  i priced one of them out of curiosity at a carpenters shop in san francisco this morning2 and a half dollars  in england this thing would be worth 2 shillings  at sailors bar it would be worth 3 pounds 4 shillings and at hills bar it would fetch 6 pounds  quicksilver was also outrageously high but not being of such prime necessity as rocker irons didnt come up to their standard of value  at one place it was sold at 10 dollars per pound but at fort langley a man bought one pound paying 15 dollars for it and had to carry it a great distance the price in san francisco is 60 cents the pound halfacrown and on frasers river 3 pounds  nails brought from 1 dollar to 1 dollar 50 cents per pound  one lot of a dozen pounds brought 3 dollars or two bits anail which being interpreted into queens english means 1 shilling anail  these are some of the outgoings which tax the miners earnings in a new unpeopled country but these are not his only drawbacks  there being no boards to be had we had perforce to go in the woods and fell and hew out our lumber to make a rocker causing much loss of time  then came the hunt for nails and for the indispensable perforated iron which cost so much  but worst of all the ills of the miners life in new caledonia are the jealousy and audacious thieving of the indians who are nowise particular in seizing on the dirt of the miners  the whites being in the minority and the indians being a fierce athletic set of rascals suffered much annoyance and insult without retaliating  what a trial to the temper of oregon men who used to shoot all indians who came within range of their rifle as vermin in california in 1848 and 1849  the difficulties of access to the mines will soon be ameliorated as small steamers are to be put on the river to ply as far up as the rapids will permit them but as to the indian difficulties it is much to be feared they will increase until a military force is sent into the country to overawe them  the prices of provisions and of mining tools and other necessaries will soon be regulated by the competition of the san francisco merchants and the miners will not be long subjected to exorbitant rates  they have a vast advantage in the proximity of san francisco abounding as it does in supplies for all their wants  when i recall our early troubles and victimisings i almost cease to pity the victims of the rocker irons at 6 pounds aplate  in 1849 i paid 1 dollar 50 cents for the simple luxury of a fresh egg  i might have had one laid on the atlantic board or in chile or the sandwich islands for less it is true but these required french cookery to disguise their true state and condition and i being then fresh myself was somewhat particular  even this did not cap the climax for i paid a sum in american currency equal to 16 pounds sterling for a pair of boots the day i was burnt out by the first firein the same year  and such a pair  they were navvys boots and worth in england about 15 shillings the new caledonians must not complain for we have endured more and survived it too than they are likely to suffer  table of distances from victoria vancouvers island to the lower portion of the mines  the estimates may be relied upon as very nearly correct                                                      miles    to mouth of fraser river across the gulf of georgia      90  to fort langley hbc posts on fraser river        25 to 30  to

thirtyfirst day of december one thousand eight hundred and sixtytwo for the government of new caledonia  whereas divers of her majestys subjects and others have by the licence and consent of her majesty resorted to and settled on certain wild and unoccupied territories on the northwest coast of north america commonly known by the designation of new caledonia and the islands adjacent for mining and other purposes and it is desirable to make some temporary provision for the civil government of such territories until permanent settlements shall be thereupon established and the number of colonists increased be it therefore enacted by the queens most excellent majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present parliament assembled and by the authority of the same as follows  i  new caledonia shall for the purposes of this act be held to comprise all such territories within the dominions of her majesty as are bounded to the south by the frontier of the united states of america to the east by the watershed between the streams which flow into the pacific ocean and those which flow into the atlantic and icy oceans to the north by the 55th parallel of north latitude and to the west by the pacific ocean and shall include queen charlottes island and all other islands adjacent to the said territories except as hereinafter excepted  ii  it shall be lawful for her majesty by any order or orders to be by her from time to time made with the advice of her privy council to make ordain or establish and subject to such conditions or restrictions as to her shall seem meet to authorise and empower such officer as she may from time to time appoint to administer the government of new caledonia to make provision for the administration of justice therein and generally to make ordain and establish all such laws institutions and ordinances as may be necessary for the peace order and good government of her majestys subjects and others therein provided that all such orders in council and all laws and ordinances so to be made as aforesaid shall be laid before both houses of parliament as soon as conveniently may be after the making and enactment thereof respectively  iii  provided always that it shall be lawful for her majesty so soon as she may deem it convenient by any such order in council as aforesaid to constitute or authorise and empower such officer to constitute a legislature to make laws for the peace order and good government of new caledonia such legislature to consist of the governor and a council or council and assembly to be composed of such and so many persons and to be appointed or elected such manner and in for such periods and subject to such regulations as to her majesty may seem expedient  iv  and whereas an act was passed in the fortythird year of king george the third entitled an act for extending the jurisdiction of the courts of justice in the provinces of lower and upper canada to the trial and punishment of persons guilty of crimes and offences within certain parts of north america adjoining to the said provinces and whereas by an act passed in the second year of king george the fourth entitled an act for regulating the fur trade and establishing a criminal and civil jurisdiction within certain parts of north america it was enacted that from and after the passing of that act the courts of judicature then existing or which might be thereafter established in the province of upper canada should have the same civil jurisdiction power and authority within the indian territories and other parts of america not within the limits of either of the provinces of lower or upper canada or any civil government of the united states as the said courts had or were invested with within the limits of the said provinces of upper or lower canada respectively and that every contract agreement debt liability and demand made entered into incurred or arising within the said indian territories and other parts of america and every wrong and injury to the person or to property committed or done within the same should be and be deemed to be of the same nature and be cognisable and be tried in the same manner and subject to the same consequences in all respects as if the same had been made entered into incurred arisen committed or done within the said province of upper canada and in the same acts are contained provisions for giving force authority and effect within the said indian territories and other parts of america to the process and acts of the said courts of upper canada and it was thereby also enacted that it should be lawful for his majesty if he should deem it convenient so to do to issue a commission or commissions to any person or persons to be and act as justices of the peace within such parts of america as aforesaid as well within any territories theretofore granted to the company of adventurers of england trading to the hudsons bay as within the indian territories of such other parts of america as aforesaid and it was further enacted that it should be lawful for his majesty from time to time by any commission under the great seal to authorise and empower any such persons so appointed justices of the peace as aforesaid to sit and hold courts of record for the trial of criminal offences and misdemeanours and also of civil causes and it should be lawful for his majesty to order direct and authorise the appointment of proper officers to act in aid of such courts and justices within the jurisdiction assigned to such courts and justices in any such commission provided that such courts should not try any offender upon any charge or indictment for any felony made the subject of capital punishment or for any offence or passing sentence affecting the life of any offender or adjudge or cause any offender to suffer capital punishment or transportation or take cognisance of or try any civil action or suit in which the cause of such suit or action should exceed in value the amount or sum of two hundred pounds and in every case of any offence subjecting the person committing the same to capital punishment or transportation the court or any judge of any such court or any justice or justices of the peace before whom any such offender should be brought should commit such offender to safe custody and cause such offender to be sent in such custody for trial in the court of the province of upper canada  from and after the proclamation of this act in new caledonia the said act of the fortythird year of king george the third and the said recited provisions of the said act of the second year of king george the fourth and the provisions contained in such act for giving force authority and effect within the indian territories and other parts of america to the process and acts of the said courts of upper canada shall cease to have force in and to be applicable to new caledonia  v  provided always that all judgments given in any civil suit in new caledonia shall be subject to appeal to her majesty in council in the manner and subject to the regulations in and subject to which appeals are now brought from the civil courts of canada and to such further or other regulations as her majesty with the advice of her privy council shall from time to time appoint  vi  no part of the colony of vancouvers

continuance of this act a joint address from the two houses of the legislature of vancouvers island praying for the incorporation of that island with new caledonia by order to be made as aforesaid with the advice of her privy council to annex the said island to new caledonia subject to such conditions and regulations as to her majesty shall seem expedient and thereupon and from the date of the publication of such order in the said island or such other date as may be fixed in such order the provisions of this act shall be held to apply to vancouvers island  vii  in the construction of this act the term governor shall mean the person for the time being lawfully administering the government of new caledonia  viii  this act shall continue in force until the thirtyfirst day of december one
