26081403	the lady of the aroostook  by w d howells    the lady of the aroostook     i   in the best room of a farmhouse on the skirts of a village in the hills of northern massachusetts there sat one morning in august three people who were not strangers to the house but who had apparently assembled in the parlor as the place most in accord with an unaccustomed finery in their dress one was an elderly woman with a plain honest face as kindly in expression as she could be perfectly sure she felt and no more she rocked herself softly in the haircloth armchair and addressed as father the old man who sat at one end of the table between the windows and drubbed noiselessly upon it with his stubbed fingers while his lips puckered to a whistle emitted no sound his face had that distinctly freshshaven effect which once a week is the advantage of shaving no oftener here and there in the deeper wrinkles a frosty stubble had escaped the razor he wore an oldfashioned low black satin stock over the top of which the linen of his unstarched collar contrived with difficulty to make itself seen his highcrowned leadcolored straw hat lay on the table before him at the other end of the table sat a young girl who leaned upon it with one arm propping her averted face on her hand the window was open beside her and she was staring out upon the dooryard where the hens were burrowing for coolness in the soft earth under the lilac bushes from time to time she put her handkerchief to her eyes  i dont like this part of it father said the elderly woman lyddys seeming to feel about it the way she does right at the last moment as you may say the old man made a noise in his throat as if he might speak but he only unpuckered his mouth and stayed his fingers while the other continued i dont want her to go now no more than ever i did i aint one to think that eatin up everything on your plate keeps it from wastin and i never was and i say that even if you couldnt get the money back it would cost no more to have her stay than to have her go  i dont suppose said the old man in a high husky treble but what i could get some of it back from the captain may be all he didnt seem any ways graspin i dont want lyddy should feel any more than you do maria that were glad to have her go but what i look at is this as long as she has this ideawell its like this i dknow as i can express it either he relapsed into the comfort people find in giving up a difficult thing  oh i know returned the woman i understand its an opportunity you might call it a leadin almost that it would be flyin in the face of providence to refuse i presume her gifts were given her for improvement and it would be the same as buryin them in the ground for her to stay up here but i do say that i want lyddy should feel just so about goin or not go at all it aint like goin among strangers though if it is in a strange land theyre her fathers own kin and if theyre any ways like him theyre warmhearted enough if thats all you want i guess theyll do whats right by lyddy when she gets there and i try to look at it this way that long before that maple by the gate is red shell be with her fathers own sister and i for one dont mean to let it worry me she made search for her handkerchief and wiped away the tears that fell down her cheeks  yes returned the old man and before the leaves are on the ground we shall moren have got our first letter from her i declare fort he added after a tremulous pause i was goin to say how lyddy would enjoy readin it to us i dont seem to get it rightly into my head that shes goin away  it aint as if lyddy was leavin any life behind her thats over and above pleasant resumed the woman shes a good girl and i never want to see a more uncomplainin but i know its duller and duller here all the while for her with us two old folks and no young company and i dknow as its been any better the two winters shes taught in the mill village thats what reconciles me on lyddys account as much as anything i aint one to set much store on worldly ambition and i never was and i dknow as i care for lyddys advancement as you may call it i believe that as far forth as true happiness goes shed be as well off here as there but i dont say but what she would be more satisfied in the end and as long as you cant have happiness in this world i say youd better have satisfaction is that josiah whitmans hearse goin past she asked rising from her chair and craning forward to bring her eyes on a level with the window while she suspended the agitation of the palmleaf fan which she had not ceased to ply during her talk she remained a moment with the quiescent fan pressed against her bosom and then she stepped out of the door and down the walk to the gate josiah she called while the old man looked and listened at the window who you ben buryin  the man halted his hearse and answered briefly mirandy holcomb  why i thought the funeral want to be till tomorrow well i declare said the woman as she reëntered the room and sat down again in her rockingchair i didnt ask him whether it was mr goodlow or mr baldwin preached the sermon i was so put out hearin it was mirandy you might say i forgot to ask him anything mirandy was always a well woman till they moved down to the mill village and began takin the hands to boardso many of em when i think of lyddys teachin there another winterwell i could almost rejoice that she was goin away she aint a mite too strong as it is  here the woman paused and the old man struck in with his quaint treble while she fanned herself in silence i do suppose the voyage is goin to be everything for her health shell be from a month to six weeks gettin to tryeast and thatll be a complete change of air mr goodlow says and she wont have a care on her mind the whole way out itll be a season of rest and quiet i did wish just for the joke of the thing as you may say that the ship had ben goin straight to venus and lyddy could a walked right in on em at breakfast some morning i should liked it to ben a surprise but there want any ship at boston loadin for venus and they didnt much believe id find one at new york so i just took up with the captain of the aroostooks offer he says she can telegraph to her folks at venus as soon as she gets to tryeast and shes welcome to stay on the ship till they come for her i didnt think of their havin our modn improvements out there but he says they have telegraphs and railroads everywheres the same as we do and theyre real kind and polite when you get used to em the captain hes as nice a man as i ever see his wifes ben two or three voyages with him in the aroostook and hell know just how to have lyddys comfort looked after he showed me the stateroom shes goin to have well it aint over and above large but its pretty as a pink all clean white paint with a solid mahogany edge to the berth and a mahoganyframed lookinglass on one side and little winders at the top and white lace curtains to the bed he says he had it fixed up for his wife and he lets lyddy have it all for her own she can set there and do her mendin when she dont feel like comin into the cabin the cabinwell i wish you could see that cabin maria the first mate is a fineappearing man too some of the sailors looked pretty rough but i guess it was as much their clothes as anything and i dknow as lyddyd have a great deal to do with them any way the old mans treble ceased and at the same moment the shrilling of a locust in one of the dooryard maples died away both voices arid nasal and high lapsed as one into a common silence  the woman stirred impatiently in her chair as if both voices had been repeating something heard many times before they seemed to renew her discontent yes i know i know all that father but it aint the mahogany i think of its the childs gettin there safe and well  well said the old man i asked the captain about the seasickness and he says she aint nigh so likely to be sick as she would on the steamer the motions more regular and she wont have the smell of the machinery thats what he said and he said the seasickness would do her good any way im sure i dont want her to be sick any more than you do maria he added this like one who has been unjustly put upon his defense  they now both remained silent the woman rocking herself and fanning and the old man holding his fingers suspended from their drubbing upon the table and looking miserably from the woman in the rockingchair to the girl at the window as if a strict inquiry into the present situation might convict him of it in spite of his innocence the girl still sat with her face turned from them and still from time to time she put her handkerchief to her eyes and wiped away the tears the locust in the maple began again and shrilled inexorably suddenly the girl leaped to her feet  theres the stage she cried with a tumult in her voice and manner and a kind of choking sob she showed now that she stood upright the slim and elegant shape which is the divine right of american girlhood clothed with the stylishness that instinctive taste may evoke even in a hill town from study of paper patterns harpers bazar and the costume of summer boarders her dress was carried with spirit and effect  lydia blood cried the other woman springing responsively to her feet also and starting toward the girl dont you go a step without you feel just like it take off your things this minute and stay if you wouldnt jus as lives go its hard enough to have you go child without seemin to force you  oh aunt maria answered the girl piteously it almost kills me to go but im doing it not you i know how youd like to have me stay but dont say it again or i couldnt bear up and im going now if i have to be carried  the old man had risen with the others he was shorter than either and as he looked at them he seemed half awed half bewildered by so much drama yet it was comparatively very little the girl did not offer to cast herself upon her aunts neck and her aunt did not offer her an embrace it was only their hearts that clung together as they simply shook hands and kissed each other lydia whirled away for her last look at herself in the glass over the table and her aunt tremulously began to put to rights some slight disorder in the girls hat  father she said sharply are lyddys things all ready there by the door sos not to keep ezra perkins waitin you know he always grumbles so and then he gets you to the cars sot you have to wait half an hour before they start she continued to pin and pull at details of lydias dress to which she descended from her hat it sets real nice on you lyddy i guess youll think of the time we had gettin it made up when you wear it out there miss maria latham laughed nervously  with a harsh banging and rattling a yellow concord coach drew up at the gate where miss maria had stopped the hearse the driver got down and without a word put lydias boxes and bags into the boot and left two or three light parcels for her to take into the coach with her  miss maria went down to the gate with her father and niece take the back seat father she said as the old man offered to take the middle place let them that come later have whats left youll be home tonight father ill set up for you goodby again lyddy she did not kiss the girl again or touch her hand their decent and sparing adieux had been made in the house as miss maria returned to the door the hens cowering consciencestricken under the lilacs sprang up at sight of her with a screech of guilty alarm and flew out over the fence  well i vow soliloquized miss maria from where she set lyddy must have seen them pests under the lilacs the whole time and never said a word she pushed the loosened soil into place with the side of her ample slipper and then went into the house where she kindled a fire in the kitchen stove and made herself a cup of japan tea a variety of the herb which our country people prefer apparently because it affords the same stimulus with none of the pleasure given by the chinese leaf     ii   lydia and her grandfather reached boston at four oclock and the old man made a bargain as he fancied with an expressman to carry her baggage across the city to the wharf at which the aroostook lay the expressman civilly offered to take their small parcels without charge and deliver them with the trunk and large bag but as he could not check them all her grandfather judged it safest not to part with them and he and lydia crowded into the horsecar with their arms and hands full the conductor obliged him to give up the largest of these burdens and hung the oldfashioned oilcloth sack on the handle of the brake behind where mr latham with keen anxiety and lydia with shame watched it as it swayed back and forth with the motion of the car and threatened to break loose from its handstraps and dash its bloated bulk to the ground the old man called out to the conductor to be sure and stop in scollays square and the people who had already stared uncomfortably at lydias bundles all smiled her grandfather was going to repeat his direction as the conductor made no sign of having heard it when his neighbor said kindly the car always stops in scollays square  then why couldnt he say so retorted the old man in his high nasal key and now the people laughed outright he had the nervous restlessness of age when out of its wonted place he could not remain quiet in the car for counting and securing his parcels when they reached scollays square and were to change cars he ran to the car they were to take though there was abundant time and sat down breathless from his effort he was eager then that they should not be carried too far and was constantly turning to look out of the window to ascertain their whereabouts his vigilance ended in their getting aboard the east boston ferryboat in the car and hardly getting ashore before the boat started they now gathered up their burdens once more and walked toward the wharf they were seeking past those squalid streets which open upon the docks at the corners they entangled themselves in knots of truckteams and hucksters wagons and horsecars once they brought the traffic of the neighborhood to a standstill by the thoroughness of their inability and confusion they wandered down the wrong wharf amidst the slime cast up by the fishing craft moored in the dock below and made their way over heaps of chains and cordage and through the handcarts pushed hither and thither with their loads of fish and so struggled back to the avenue which ran along the top of all the wharves the water of the docks was of a livid turbidity which teemed with the gelatinous globes of the sunfish and people were rowing about there in pleasureboats and sailors on floats were painting the hulls of the black ships the faces of the men they met were red and sunburned mostlynot with the sunburn of the fields but of the sea these men lurched in their gait with an uncouth heaviness yet gave them way kindly enough but certain dulleyed frowzyheaded women seemed to push purposely against her grandfather and one of them swore at lydia for taking up all the sidewalk with her bundles there were such dull eyes and slattern heads at the open windows of the shabby houses and there were gaunt boldfaced young girls who strolled up and down the pavements bonnetless and hatless and chatted into the windows and joked with other such girls whom they met suddenly a wild outcry rose from the swarming children up one of the intersecting streets where a woman was beating a small boy over the head with a heavy stick the boy fell howling and writhing to the ground and the cruel blows still rained upon him till another woman darted from an open door and caught the child up with one hand and with the other wrenched the stick away and flung it into the street no words passed and there was nothing to show whose child the victim was the first woman walked off and while the boy rubbed his head and arms and screamed with the pain the other children whose sports had been scarcely interrupted were shouting and laughing all about him again  grandfather said lydia faintly let us go down here and rest a moment in the shade im almost worn out she pointed to the open and quiet space at the side of the lofty granite warehouse which they had reached  well i guess ill set down a minute too said her grandfather lyddy he added as they released their aching arms from their bags and bundles and sank upon the broad threshold of a door which seemed to have been shut ever since the decay of the india trade i dont believe but what it would have ben about as cheap in the end to come down in a hack but i acted for what i thought was the best i supposed wed ben there before now and the idea of givin a dollar for ridin about ten minutes did seem sinful i aint noways afraid the ship will sail without you dont you fret any i dont seem to know rightly just where i am but after weve rested a spell ill leave you here and inquire round its a real quiet place and i guess your things will be safe  he took off his straw hat and fanned his face with it while lydia leaned her head against the door frame and closed her eyes presently she heard the trampling of feet going by but she did not open her eyes till the feet paused in a hesitating way and a voice asked her grandfather in the firm neat tone which she had heard summer boarders from boston use is the young lady ill she now looked up and blushed like fire to see two handsome young men regarding her with frank compassion  no said her grandfather a little beat out thats all weve been trying to find lucas wharf and we dont seem somehow just to hit on it  this is lucas wharf said the young man he made an instinctive gesture of salutation toward his hat with the hand in which he held a cigar he put the cigar into his mouth as he turned from them and the smoke drifted fragrantly back to lydia as he tramped steadily and strongly on down the wharf shoulder to shoulder with his companion  well i declare fort so it is said her grandfather getting stiffly to his feet and retiring a few paces to gain a view of the building at the base of which they had been sitting why i might known it by this buildin but wheres the aroostook if this is lucas wharf he looked wistfully in the direction the young men had taken but they were already too far to call after  grandfather said the girl do i look pale  well you dont now answered the old man simply youve got a good color now  what right had he she demanded to speak to you about me  i dknow but what you did look rather pale as you set there with your head leaned back i dknow as i noticed much  he took us for two beggarstwo tramps she exclaimed sitting here with our bundles scattered round us  the old man did not respond to this conjecture it probably involved matters beyond his emotional reach though he might have understood them when he was younger he stood a moment with his mouth puckered to a whistle but made no sound and retired a step or two farther from the building and looked up at it again then he went toward the dock and looked down into its turbid waters and returned again with a face of hopeless perplexity this is lucas wharf and no mistake he said i know the place firstrate now but what i cant make out is whats got the aroostook  a man turned the corner of the warehouse from the street above and came briskly down towards them with his hat off and rubbing his head and face with a circular application of a red silk handkerchief he was dressed in a suit of blue flannel very neat and shapely and across his ample waistcoat stretched a gold watch chain in his left hand he carried a white panama hat he was short and stout his round florid face was full of a sort of prompt kindness his small blue eyes twinkled under shaggy brows whose sandy color had not yet taken the grizzled tone of his closeclipped hair and beard from his clean wristbands his hands came out plump and large stiff wiry hairs stood up on their backs and under these various designs in tattooing showed their purple  lydias grandfather stepped out to meet and halt this stranger as he drew near glancing quickly from the girl to the old man and then at their bundles can you tell me where a ship named the aroostook is that was layin at this wharflucas wharfa fortnight ago and better  well i guess i can mr latham answered the stranger with a quizzical smile offering one of his stout hands to lydias grandfather you dont seem to remember your friends very well do you  the old man gave a kind of crow expressive of an otherwise unutterable relief and comfort well if it aint captain jenness i ben so turned about i declare fort i dont believe id ever known you if you hadnt spoke up lyddy he cried with a childlike joy this is captain jenness  captain jenness having put on his hat changed mr lathams hand into his left while he stretched his great right hand across it and took lydias long slim fingers in its grasp and looked keenly into her face glad to see you glad to see you miss blood you see ive got your name down on my papers hope youre well ever been a seavoyage before little homesick eh he asked as she put her handkerchief to her eyes he kept pressing lydias hand in the friendliest way well thats natural and youre excited thats natural too but were not going to have any homesickness on the aroostook because were going to make her home to you at this speech all the girls gathering forlornness broke in a sob thats right said captain jenness bless you ive got a girl just about your age up at deer isle myself he dropped her hand and put his arm across her shoulders good land i know what girls are i hope these your things he caught up the greater part of them into his capacious hands and started off down the wharf talking back at lydia and her grandfather as they followed him with the light parcels he had left them i hauled away from the wharf as soon as id stowed my cargo and im at anchor out there in the stream now waiting till i can finish up a few matters of business with the agents and get my passengers on board when you get used to the strangeness he said to lydia you wont be a bit lonesome bless your heart my wifes been with me many a voyage and the last time i was out to messina i had both my daughters  at the end of the wharf captain jenness stopped and suddenly calling out here began as she thought to hurl lydias things into the water but when she reached the same point she found they had all been caught and deposited in a neat pile in a boat which lay below where two sailors stood waiting the captains further orders he keenly measured the distance to the boat with his eye and then he bade the men work round outside a schooner which lay near and jumping on board this vessel he helped lydia and her grandfather down and easily transferred them to the small boat the men bent to their oars and pulled swiftly out toward a ship that lay at anchor a little way off a light breeze crept along the water which was here blue and clear and the grateful coolness and pleasant motion brought light into the girls cheeks and eyes without knowing it she smiled thats right cried captain jenness who had applauded her sob in the same terms youll like it firstrate look at that ship thats the aroostook is she a beauty or aint she  the stately vessel stood high from the water for captain jennesss cargo was light and he was going out chiefly for a return freight sharp jibs and staysails cut their white outlines keenly against the afternoon blue of the summer heaven the topsails and courses dripped halffurled from the yards stretching across the yellow masts that sprang so far aloft the hull glistened black with new paint when lydia mounted to the deck she found it as clean scrubbed as her aunts kitchen floor her glance of admiration was not lost upon captain jenness yes miss blood said he one difference between an american ship and any other sort is dirt i wish i could take you aboard an english vessel so you could appreciate the aroostook but i guess you dont need it he added with a proud satisfaction in his laugh the aroostook aint in order yet wait till weve been a few days at sea the captain swept the deck with a loving eye it was spacious and handsome with a stretch of some forty or fifty feet between the house at the stern and the forecastle which rose considerably higher a low bulwark was surmounted by a heavy rail supported upon turned posts painted white everything in spite of the captains boastful detraction was in perfect trim at least to landfolks eyes now come into the cabin said the captain he gave lydias traps as he called them in charge of a boy while he led the way below by a narrow stairway warning lydia and her grandfather to look out for their heads as they followed there he said when they had safely arrived inviting their inspection of the place with a general glance of his own  what did i tell you lyddy asked her grandfather with simple joy in the splendors about them solid mahogany trimmins everywhere there was also a great deal of milkwhite paint with some modest touches of gilding here and there the cabin was pleasantly lit by the long low windows which its roof rose just high enough to lift above the deck and the fresh air entered with the slanting sun made fast to the floor was a heavy table over which hung from the ceiling a swinging shelf around the little saloon ran lockers cushioned with red plush at either end were four or five narrow doors which gave into as many tiny staterooms the boy came with lydias things and set them inside one of these doors and when he came out again the captain pushed it open and called them in here said he heres where my girls made themselves at home the last voyage and i expect youll find it pretty comfortable they say you dont feel the motion so muchi dont know anything about the motionand in smooth weather you can have that window open sometimes and change the air its light and its large well i had it fitted up for my wife but shes got kind of on now you know and she dont feel much like going any more and so i always give it to my nicest passenger this was an unmistakable compliment and lydia blushed to the captains entire content thats a rug she hooked he continued touching with his toe the carpet rich in its artless domestic dyes as some persian fabric that lay before the berth these gimcracks belong to my girls they left em he pointed to various slight structures of cardboard worked with crewel which were tacked to the walls pretty snug eh  yes said lydia its nicer than i thought it could be even after what grandfather said  well thats right exclaimed the captain i like your way of speaking up i wish you could know my girls how old are you now  im nineteen said lydia  why youre just between my girls cried the captain sally is twentyone and persis is eighteen well now miss blood he said as they returned to the cabin you cant begin to make yourself at home too soon for me i used to sail to cadiz and malaga a good deal and when i went to see any of them spaniards hed say this house is yours well thats what i say this ship is yours as long as you stay in her and i mean it and thats more than they did captain jenness laughed mightily took some of lydias fingers in his left hand and squeezed them and clapped her grandfather on the shoulder with his right then he slipped his hand down the old mans bony arm to the elbow and held it while he dropped his head towards lydia and said we shall be glad to have him stay to supper and as much longer as he likes heh  oh no said lydia grandfather must go back on the six oclock train my aunt expects him her voice fell and her face suddenly clouded  good cried the captain then he pulled out his watch and held it as far away as the chain would stretch frowning at it with his head aslant well he burst out he hasnt got any too much time on his hands the old man gave a nervous start and the girl trembled hold on yes theres time its only fifteen minutes after five  oh but we were more than half an hour getting down here said lydia anxiously and grandfather doesnt know the way back hell be sure to get lost i wish wed come in a carriage  couldnt a kept the carriage waitin on expense lyddy retorted her grandfather but i tell you he added with something like resolution if i could find a carriage anywheres near that wharf id take it just as sure i wouldnt miss that train for moren half a dollar it would cost more than that at a hotel tonight let alone how your aunt mariad feel  why look here said captain jenness naturally appealing to the girl let me get your grandfather back ive got to go up town again any way for some last things with an express wagon and we can ride right to the depot in that which depot is it  fitchburg said the old man eagerly  thats right commented the captain get you there in plenty of time if we dont lose any now and ill tell you what my little girl he added turning to lydia if itll be a comfort to you to ride up with us and see your grandfather off why come along my girls went with me the last time on an express wagon  no answered lydia i want to but it wouldnt be any comfort i thought that out before i left home and im going to say goodby to grandfather here  firstrate said captain jenness bustling towards the gangway so as to leave them alone a sharp cry from the old man arrested him  lyddy wheres your trunks  why said the girl catching her breath in dismay where can they be i forgot all about them  i got the checks fast enough said the old man and i shant give em up without i get the trunks theyd ought to had em down here long ago and now if ive got to pester round after em im sure to miss the train  what shall we do asked lydia  lets see your checks said the captain with an evident ease of mind that reassured her when her grandfather had brought them with difficulty from the pocket visited last in the order of his search and laid them in the captains waiting palm the latter endeavored to get them in focus what does it say on em he asked handing them to lydia my eyes never did amount to anything on shore she read aloud the name of the express stamped on them the captain gathered them back into his hand and slipped them into his pocket with a nod and wink full of comfort ill see to it he said at any rate this ship aint agoing to sail without them if she waits a week now then mr latham  the old man who waited when not directly addressed or concerned in a sort of blank patience suddenly started out of his daze and following the captain too alertly up the gangway stairs drove his hat against the hatchwith a force that sent him back into lydias arms  oh grandfather are you hurt she piteously asked trying to pull up the hat that was jammed down over his forehead  not a bit but i guess my hats about done forwithout i can get it pressed over and i dknow as this kind of straw doos press  firstrate called the captain from above never mind the hat but the girl continued fondly trying to reshape it while the old man fidgeted anxiously and protested that he would be sure to be left it was like a halfshut accordion when she took it from his head when she put it back it was like an accordion pulled out  all ready shouted captain jenness from the gap in the bulwark where he stood waiting to descend into the small boat the old man ran towards him in his senile haste and stooped to get over the side into the boat below  why grandfather cried the girl in a breaking voice full of keen yet tender reproach  i declare fort he said scrambling back to the deck i most forgot i ben so put about he took lydias hand loosely into his own and bent forward to kiss her she threw her arms round him and while he remained looking over her shoulder with a face of grotesque perplexity and saying dont cry lyddy dont cry she pressed her face tighter into his withered neck and tried to muffle her homesick sobs the sympathies as well as the sensibilities often seem dulled by age they have both perhaps been wrought upon too much in the course of the years and can no longer respond to the appeal or distress which they can only dimly realize even the heart grows old dont you dont you lyddy repeated the old man you mustnt the captains waitin and the carswell every minute i lose makes it riskier and riskier and your aunt maria shes always so uneasy you know  the girl was not hurt by his anxiety about himself she was more anxious about him than about anything else she quickly lifted her head and drying her eyes kissed him forcing her lips into the smile that is more heartbreaking to see than weeping she looked over the side as her grandfather was handed carefully down to a seat by the two sailors in the boat and the captain noted her resolute counterfeit of cheerfulness thats right he shouted up to her just like my girls when their mother left em but bless you they soon got over it and soll you give way men he said in a lower voice and the boat shot from the ships side toward the wharf he turned and waved his handkerchief to lydia and stimulated apparently by this her grandfather felt in his pockets for his handkerchief he ended after a vain search by taking off his hat and waving that  when he put it on again it relapsed into that likeness of a halfshut accordion from which lydia had rescued it but she only saw the face under it  as the boat reached the wharf an express wagon drove down and lydia saw the sarcastic parley which she could not hear between the captain and the driver about the belated baggage which the latter put off then she saw the captain help her grandfather to the seat between himself and the driver and the wagon rattled swiftly out of sight one of the sailors lifted lydias baggage over the side of the wharf to the other in the boat and they pulled off to the ship with it     iii   lydia went back to the cabin and presently the boy who had taken charge of her lighter luggage came dragging her trunk and bag down the gangway stairs neither was very large and even a boy of fourteen who was small for his age might easily manage them  you can stow away whats in em in the drawers said the boy i suppose you didnt notice the drawers he added at her look of inquiry he went into her room and pushing aside the valance of the lower berth showed four deep drawers below the bed the charming snugness of the arrangement brought a light of housewifely joy to the girls face  why its as good as a bureau they will hold everything  yes exulted the boy theyre for two persons things the captains daughters they both had this room pretty good sized too a good deal the captains build you wont find a better stateroom than this on a steamer ive been on em the boy climbed up on the edge of the upper drawer and pulled open the window at the top of the wall give you a little air i guess if you want i should the captain said i was to bear a hand helping you to stow away what was in your trunks  no said lydia quickly id just as soon do it alone  all right said the boy if i was you id do it now i dont know just when the captain means to sail but after we get outside it might be rough and its better to have everything pretty snug by that time ill haul away the trunks when youve got em empty if i shouldnt happen to be here you can just call me at the top of the gangway and ill come my names thomas he said he regarded lydia inquiringly a moment before he added if youd just as lives i rather youd call me thomas and not steward they said youd call me steward he explained in a blushing deprecating confidence and as long as ive not got my growth it kind of makes them laugh you knowespecially the second officer  i will call you thomas said lydia  thank you the boy glanced up at the round clock screwed to the cabin wall i guess you wont have to call me anything unless you hurry i shall be down here laying the table for supper before youre done the captain said i was to lay it for you and him and if he didnt get back in time you was to go to eating any way guess you wont think captain jenness is going to starve anybody  have you been many voyages with captain jenness before this asked lydia as she set open her trunk and began to lay her dresses out on the locker homesickness like all grief attacks in paroxysms one gust of passionate regret had swept over the girl before another came she could occupy herself almost cheerfully with the details of unpacking  only one before said the boy the last one when his daughters went out i guess it was their coaxing got mother to let me go my father was killed in the war  was he asked lydia sympathetically  yes i didnt know much about it at the time so little both your parents living  no said lydia theyre both dead they died a long while ago ive always lived with my aunt and grandfather  i thought there must be something the matteryour coming with your grandfather said the boy i dont see why you dont let me carry in some of those dresses for you im used to helping about  well you may answered lydia if you want a native tranquil kindness showed itself in her voice and manner but something of the habitual authority of a schoolmistress mingled with it you must be careful not to rumple them if i let you  i guess not ive got older sisters at home they hated to have me leave but i looked at it this way if i was ever going to seaand i wasi couldnt get such another captain as captain jenness nor such another crew all the men from down our way and i dont mind the second mates jokes much he doesnt mean anything by them likes to plague thats all hes a firstrate sailor  lydia was kneeling before one of the trunks and the boy was stooping over it with a hand on either knee she had drawn out her only black silk dress and was finding it rather crumpled i shouldnt have thought it would have got so much jammed coming fifty miles she soliloquized but they seemed to take a pleasure in seeing how much they could bang the trunks she rose to her feet and shook out the dress and drew the skirt several times over her left arm  the boys eyes glistened goodness he said just new aint it going to wear it any on board  sundays perhaps answered lydia thoughtfully still smoothing and shaping the dress which she regarded at armslength from time to time with her head aslant  i suppose its the latest style pursued the boy  yes it is said lydia we sent to boston for the pattern i hate to pack it into one of those drawers she mused  you neednt replied thomas theres a whole row of hooks  i want to know cried lydia she followed thomas into her state room well well they do seem to have thought of everything  i should say so exulted the boy look here he showed her a little niche near the head of the berth strongly framed with glass in which a lamp was made fast light up you know when you want to read or feel kind of lonesome lydia clasped her hands in pleasure and amaze oh i tell you captain jenness meant to have things about right the other staterooms dont begin to come up to this he dashed out in his zeal and opened their doors that she might triumph in the superiority of her accommodations without delay these rooms were cramped together on one side lydias was in a comparatively ample corner by itself  she went on unpacking her trunk and the boy again took his place near her in the same attitude as before i tell you he said i shall like to see you with that silk on have you got any other nice ones  no only this im wearing answered lydia half amused and half honest in her sympathy with his ardor about her finery they said not to bring many clothes they would be cheaper over there she had now reached the bottom of her trunk she knew by the clock that her grandfather could hardly have left the city on his journey home but the interval of time since she had parted with him seemed vast it was as if she had started to boston in a former life the history of the choosing and cutting and making of these clothes was like a dream of preëxistence she had never had so many things new at once and it had been a great outlay but her aunt maria had made the money go as far as possible and had spent it with that native taste that genius for dress which sometimes strikes the summer boarder in the sempstresses of the new england hills miss lathams gift was quaintly unrelated to herself in dress as in person and manner she was uncompromisingly plain and stiff all the more lavishly therefore had it been devoted to the grace and beauty of her sisters child who ever since she came to find a home in her grandfathers house had been more stylishly dressed than any other girl in the village the summer boarders whom the keen eye of miss latham studied with unerring sense of the best new effects in costume wondered at lydias elegance as she sat beside her aunt in the family pew a triumph of that grim artists skill lydia knew that she was well dressed but she knew that after all she was only the expression of her aunts inspirations her own gift was of another sort her father was a musicteacher whose failing health had obliged him to give up his profession and who had taken the traveling agency of a parlor organ manufactory for the sake of the outdoor life his business had brought him to south bradfield where he sold an organ to deacon lathams church and fell in love with his younger daughter he died a few years after his marriage of an ancestral consumption his sole heritage from the good new england stock of which he came his skill as a pianist which was considerable had not descended to his daughter but her mother had bequeathed her a peculiarly rich and flexible voice with a joy in singing which was as yet a passion little affected by culture it was this voice which when lydia rose to join in the terrible hymning of the congregation at south bradfield took the thoughts of people off her style and beauty and it was this which enchanted her fathers sister when the summer before the date of which we write that lady had come to america on a brief visit and heard lydia sing at her parlor organ in the old homestead  mrs erwin had lived many years abroad chiefly in italy for the sake of the climate she was of delicate health and constantly threatened by the hereditary disease that had left her the last of her generation and she had the fastidiousness of an invalid she was full of generous impulses which she mistook for virtues but the presence of some object at once charming and worthy was necessary to rouse these impulses she had been prosperously married when very young and as a pretty american widow she had wedded in second marriage at naples one of those englishmen who have money enough to live at ease in latin countries he was very fond of her and petted her having no children she might long before have thought definitely of poor henrys little girl as she called lydia but she had lived very comfortably indefinite in regard to her ever since the fathers death now and then she had sent the child a handsome present or a sum of money she had it on her conscience not to let her be wholly a burden to her grandfather but often her conscience drowsed when she came to south bradfield she won the hearts of the simple family which had been rather hardened against her and she professed an enthusiasm for lydia she called her pretty names in italian which she did not pronounce well she babbled a great deal about what ought to be done for her and went away without doing anything so that when a letter finally came directing lydia to be sent out to her in venice they were all surprised in the disappointment to which they had resigned themselves  mrs erwin wrote an epistolary style exasperatingly vacuous and diffuse and like many women of that sort she used pencil instead of ink always apologizing for it as due now to her weak eyes and now to her weak wrist and again to her not being able to find the ink her hand was full of foolish curves and dashes and there were no spaces between the words at times under these conditions it was no light labor to get at her meaning but the sum of her letter was that she wished lydia to come out to her at once and she suggested that as they could have few opportunities or none to send her with people going to europe they had better let her come the whole way by sea mrs erwin rememberedin the space of a page and a halfthat nothing had ever done her so much good as a long sea voyage and it would be excellent for lydia who though she looked so strong probably needed all the bracing up she could get she had made inquiriesor what was the same thing mr erwin had for herand she found that vessels from american ports seldom came to venice but they often came to trieste which was only a few hours away and if mr latham would get lydia a ship for trieste at boston she could come very safely and comfortably in a few weeks she gave the name of a boston house engaged in the mediterranean trade to which mr latham could apply for passage if they were not sending any ship themselves they could probably recommend one to him  this was what happened when deacon latham called at their office a few days after mrs erwins letter came they directed him to the firm dispatching the aroostook and captain jenness was at their place when the deacon appeared there the captain took cordial possession of the old man at once and carried him down to the wharf to look at the ship and her accommodations the matter was quickly settled between them at that time captain jenness did not know but he might have other passengers out at any rate he would look after the little girl as deacon latham always said in speaking of lydia the same as if she were his own child  lydia knelt before her trunk thinking of the remote events the extinct associations of a few minutes and hours and days ago she held some cuffs and collars in her hand and something that her aunt maria had said recurred to her she looked up into the intensely interested face of the boy and then laughed bowing her forehead on the back of the hand that held these bits of linen  the boy blushed what are you laughing at he asked half piteously half indignantly like a boy used to being badgered  oh nothing said lydia my aunt told me if any of these things should happen to want doing up i had better get the stewardess to help me she looked at the boy in a dreadfully teasing way softly biting her lip  oh if youre going to begin that way he cried in affliction  im not she answered promptly i like boys ive taught school two winters and i like boys firstrate  thomas was impersonally interested again time you taught school  why not  you look pretty young for a schoolteacher  now youre making fun of me said lydia astutely  the boy thought he must have been and was consoled well you began it he said  i oughtnt to have done so she replied with humility and i wont any more there she said im not going to open my bag now you can take away the trunk when you want thomas  yes maam said the boy the idea of a schoolmistress was perhaps beginning to awe him a little put your bag in your stateroom first he did this and when he came back from carrying away her trunk he began to set the table it was a pretty table when set and made the little cabin much cosier when the boy brought the dishes from the cooks galley it was a barbarously abundant table there was cold boiled ham ham and eggs fried fish baked potatoes buttered toast tea cake pickles and watermelon nothing was wanting i tell you said thomas noticing lydias admiration the captain lives well laydays  laydays echoed lydia  the days were in port the boy explained  well i should think as much she ate with the hunger that tranquillity bestows upon youth after the swift succession of strange events and the conflict of many emotions the captain had not returned in time and she ate alone  after a while she ventured to the top of the gangway stairs and stood there looking at the novel sights of the harbor in the red sunset light which rose slowly from the hulls and lower spars of the shipping and kindled the tips of the highshooting masts with a quickly fading splendor a delicate flush responded in the east and rose to meet the denser crimson of the west a few clouds incomparably light and diaphanous bathed themselves in the glow it was a summer sunset portending for the land a morrow of great heat but cool airs crept along the water and the ferryboats thrust shuttlewise back and forth between either shore made a refreshing sound as they crushed a broad course to foam with their paddles people were pulling about in small boats from some the gay cries and laughter of young girls struck sharply along the tide the noise of the quiescent city came off in a sort of dull moan the lamps began to twinkle in the windows and the streets on shore the lanterns of the ships at anchor in the stream showed redder and redder as the twilight fell the homesickness began to mount from lydias heart in a choking lump to her throat for one must be very happy to endure the sights and sounds of the summer evening anywhere she had to shield her eyes from the brilliancy of the kerosene when she went below into the cabin     iv   lydia did not know when the captain came on board once talking in the cabin made itself felt through her dreams but the dense sleep of weary youth closed over her again and she did not fairly wake till morning then she thought she heard the crowing of a cock and the cackle of hens and fancied herself in her room at home the illusion passed with a pang the ship was moving with a tug at her side the violent respirations of which were mingled with the sound of the swift rush of the vessels through the water the noise of feet on the deck and of orders hoarsely shouted  the girl came out into the cabin where thomas was already busy with the breakfast table and climbed to the deck it was four oclock of the summers morning the sun had not yet reddened the east but the stars were extinct or glimmered faint points immeasurably withdrawn in the vast gray of the sky at that hour there is a hovering dimness over all but the light on things near at hand is wonderfully keen and clear and the air has an intense yet delicate freshness that seems to breathe from the remotest spaces of the universea waft from distances beyond the sun on the land the leaves and grass are soaked with dew the densely interwoven songs of the birds are like a fabric that you might see and touch but here save for the immediate noises on the ship which had already left her anchorage far behind the shouting of the tugs escapepipes and the huge swirling gushes from her powerful wheel a sort of spectacular silence prevailed and the sounds were like a part of this silence here and there a small fishing schooner came lagging slowly in as if belated with scarce wind enough to fill her sails now and then they met a steamboat towering white and high a manylatticed bulk with no one to be seen on board but the pilot at his wheel and a few sleepy passengers on the forward promenade the city so beautiful and stately from the bay was dropping and sinking away behind they passed green islands some of which were fortified the black guns looked out over the neatly shaven glacis the sentinel paced the rampart  well well shouted captain jenness catching sight of lydia where she lingered at the cabin door you are an early bird glad to see you up hope you rested well saw your grandfather off all right and kept him from taking the wrong train with my own hand hes terribly excitable well i suppose i shall be just so at his age here the captain caught up a stool and set it near the bulwark for her there you make yourself comfortable wherever you like youre at home you know he was off again in a moment lydia cast her eye over at the tug on the deck near the pilothouse stood the young man who had stopped the afternoon before while she sat at the warehouse door and asked her grandfather if she were not ill at his feet was a substantial valise and over his arm hung a shawl he was smoking and seated near him on another valise was his companion of the day before also smoking in the instant that lydia caught sight of them she perceived that they both recognized her and exchanged as it were a start of surprise but they remained as before except that he who was seated drew out a fresh cigarette and without looking up reached to the other for a light they were both men of good height and they looked fresh and strong with something very alert in their slight movementssudden turns of the head and brisk nods which were not nervously quick lydia wondered at their presence there in an ignorance which could not even conjecture she knew too little to know that they could not have any destination on the tug and that they would not be making a pleasureexcursion at that hour in the morning their having their valises with them deepened the mystery which was not solved till the tugs engines fell silent and at an unnoticed order a space in the bulwark not far from lydia was opened and steps were let down the side of the ship then the young men who had remained to all appearance perfectly unconcerned caught up their valises and climbed to the deck of the aroostook they did not give her more than a glance out of the corners of their eyes but the surprise of their coming on board was so great a shock that she did not observe that the tug casting loose from the ship was describing a curt and foamy semicircle for her return to the city and that the aroostook with a cloud of snowy canvas filling overhead was moving over the level sea with the light ease of a bird that half swims half flies along the water a sudden dismay which was somehow not fear so much as an overpowering sense of isolation fell upon the girl she caught at thomas going forward with some dishes in his hand with a pathetic appeal  where are you going thomas  im going to the cooks galley to help dish up the breakfast  whats the cooks galley  dont you know the kitchen  let me go with you i should like to see the kitchen she trembled with eagerness arrived at the door of the narrow passage that ran across the deck aft of the forecastle she looked in and saw amid a haze of frying and broiling the short stocky figure of a negro bowlegged and unnaturally erect from the waist up at sight of lydia he made a respectful duck forward with his uncouth body why are you the cook she almost screamed in response to this obeisance  yes miss said the man humbly with a turn of the pleading black eyes of the negro  lydia grew more peremptory whywhyi thought the cook was a woman  very sorry miss began the negro with a deprecatory smile in a slow mild voice  thomas burst into a boys yelling laugh well if that aint the best joke on gabriel hell never hear the last of it when i tell it to the second officer  thomas cried lydia terribly you shall not she stamped her foot do you hear me  the boy checked his laugh abruptly yes maam he said submissively  well then returned lydia she stalked proudly back to the cabin gangway and descending shut herself into her stateroom     v   a few hours later deacon latham came into the house with a milkpan full of pease he set this down on one end of the kitchen table with his straw hat beside it and then took a chair at the other end and fell into the attitude of the day before when he sat in the parlor with lydia and miss maria waiting for the stage his mouth was puckered to a whistle and his fingers were held above the board in act to drub it miss maria turned the pease out on the table and took the pan into her lap she shelled at the pease in silence till the sound of their pelting as they were dropped on the tin was lost in their multitude then she said with a sharp querulous pathetic impatience well father i suppose youre thinkin about lyddy  yes maria i be returned her father with uncommon plumpness as if here now were something he had made up his mind to stand to i been thinkin that lyddys a woman grown as you may say  yes admitted miss maria shes a woman as far forth as that goes what put it into your head  well i dknow as i know but its just like this i got to thinkin whether she mightnt get to feelin rather lonely on the voyage without any other woman to talk to  i guess said miss maria tranquilly shes goin to feel lonely enough at times any way poor thing but i told her if she wanted advice or help about anything just to go to the stewardess that mrs bland that spent the summer at the parkers last year was always tellin how they went to the stewardess for most everything and she give her five dollars in gold when they got into boston i shouldnt want lyddy should give so much as that but i should want she should give something as longs its the custom  they dont have em on sailin vessels captain jenness said they only have em on steamers said deacon latham  have what asked miss maria sharply  stewardesses theyve got a cabinboy  miss maria desisted a moment from her work then she answered with a gruff shortness peculiar to her well then she can go to the cook i suppose it wouldnt matter which she went to i presume  deacon latham looked up with the air of confessing to sin before the whole congregation the cooks a mana black man he said  miss maria dropped a handful of pods into the pan and sent a handful of peas rattling across the table on to the floor well who in timethe expression was strong but she used it without hesitation and was never known to repent it will she go to then  i declare fort said her father i dont know i dknow as i ever thought it out fairly before but just now when i was pickin the pease for you my mind got to dwellin on lyddy and then it come to me all at once there she was the only one among a whole shipful and ii didnt know but what she might think it rather of a strange position for her  oh exclaimed miss maria petulantly i guess lyddyd know how to conduct herself wherever she was shes a born lady if ever there was one but what i think is miss maria paused and did not say what she thought but it was evidently not the social aspect of the matter which was uppermost in her mind in fact she had never been at all afraid of men whom she regarded as a more inefficient and feeblerminded kind of women  the only thingt makes me feel easier is what the captain said about the young men said deacon latham  what young men asked miss maria  why i told you about em retorted the old man with some exasperation  you told me about two young men that stopped on the wharf and pitied lyddys wornout looks  didnt i tell you the rest i declare fort i dont believe i did i ben so put about well as we was drivin up to the depot we met the same two young men and the captain asked em are you goin or not agoinjust that way and they said were goin and he said when you comin aboard and he told em he was goin to haul out this mornin at three oclock and they asked what tug and he told em and they fixed it up between em all then that they was to come aboard from the tug when shed got the ship outside and thats what i suppose they did the captain he said to me he hadnt mentioned it before because he want suret theyd go till that minute he give em a firstrate of a character  miss maria said nothing for a long while the subject seemed one with which she did not feel herself able to grapple she looked all about the kitchen for inspiration and even cast a searching glance into the woodshed suddenly she jumped from her chair and ran to the open window mr goodlow mr goodlow i wish youd come in here a minute  she hurried to meet the minister at the front door her father lagging after her with the infantile walk of an old man  mr goodlow took off his straw hat as he mounted the stone step to the threshold and said goodmorning they did not shake hands he wore a black alpaca coat and waistcoat of farmers satin his hat was dark straw like deacon lathams but it was lowcrowned and a line of ornamental openwork ran round it near the top  come into the settinroom said miss maria its cooler in there she lost no time in laying the case before the minister she ended by saying father he dont feel just right about it and i dknow as im quite clear in my own mind  the minister considered a while in silence before he said i think lydias influence upon those around her will be beneficial whatever her situation in life may be  there father cried miss maria in reproachful relief  youre right maria youre right assented the old man and they both waited for the minister to continue  i rejoiced with you he said when this opportunity for lydias improvement offered and i am not disposed to feel anxious as to the ways and means lydia is no fool i have observed in her a dignity a sort of authority very remarkable in one of her years  i guess the boys at the school down to the mill village found out she had authority enough said miss maria promptly materializing the idea  precisely said mr goodlow  thats what i told father in the first place said miss maria i guess lyddyd know how to conduct herself wherever she wasjust the words i used  i dont deny it maria i dont deny it shrilly piped the old man i aint afraid of any harm comin to lyddy any moren what you be but what i said was wouldnt she feel kind of strange sort of lost as you may say among so many and she the only one  she will know how to adapt herself to circumstances said mr goodlow i was conversing last summer with that mrs bland who boarded at mr parkers and she told me that girls in europe are brought up with no habits of selfreliance whatever and that young ladies are never seen on the streets alone in france and italy  dont you think asked miss maria hesitating to accept this ridiculous statement that mrs bland exaggerated some  she talked a great deal admitted mr goodlow i should be sorry if lydia ever lost anything of that native confidence of hers in her own judgment and her ability to take care of herself under any circumstances and i do not think she will she never seemed conceited to me but she was the most selfreliant girl i ever saw  youve hit it there mr goodlow such a spirit as she always had sighed miss maria it was just so from the first it used to go to my heart to see that little thing lookin after herself every way and not askin anybodys help but just as quiet and proud about it shes her mother all over and yestday when she set here waitin for the stage and it did seem as if i should have to give up hearin her sob sob sobwhy mr goodlow she hadnt any more idea of backin out thanthan miss maria relinquished the search for a comparison and went into another room for a handkerchief i dont believe she cared over and above about goin from the start said miss maria returning but when once shed made up her mind to it there she was i dknow as she took much of a fancy to her aunt but you couldnt told from anything that lyddy said now if i have anything on my mind i have to blat it right out as you may say i cant seem to bear it a minute but lyddys different well concluded miss maria i guess there aint goin to any harm come to her but it did give me a kind of start first off when father up and got to feelin sort of bad about it i dknow as i should thought much about it if he hadnt seemed to i dknow as i should ever thought about anything except her not havin any one to advise with about her clothes its the only thing she aint handy with she wont know what to wear im afraid shell spoil her silk i dknow but what fathers been hasty in not lookin into things carefuller first he most always does repent afterwards  couldnt repent beforehand retorted deacon latham and i tell you maria i never saw a much finer man than captain jenness and the cabins everything i said it was and more lyddy reglarly went off over it n i guess as mr goodlow says shell influence em for good dont you fret about her clothes any you fitted her out in applepie order and shell soon be there t aint but a little ways to tryeast any way to what it is some of them india voyages captain jenness said he had his own daughters out the last voyage n i guess he can tell lyddy when its weather to wear her silk i dknow as id better said anything about what i was thinkin i dont want to be noways rash and yet i thought i couldnt be too particlar  for a silent moment miss maria looked sourly uncertain as to the usefulness of scruples that came so long after the fact then she said abruptly to mr goodlow was it you or mr baldwin preached mirandy holcombs funel sermon     vi   one of the advantages of the negative part assigned to women in life is that they are seldom forced to commit themselves they can if they choose remain perfectly passive while a great many things take place in regard to them they need not account for what they do not do from time to time a man must show his hand but save for one supreme exigency a woman need never show hers she moves in mystery as long as she likes and mere reticence in her if she is young and fair interprets itself as good sense and good taste  lydia was by convention as well as by instinct mistress of the situation when she came out to breakfast and confronted the young men again with collected nerves and a reserve which was perhaps a little too proud the captain was there to introduce them and presented first mr dunham the gentleman who had spoken to her grandfather on the wharf and then mr staniford his friend and senior by some four or five years they were both of the fair new england complexion but dunhams eyes were blue and stanifords dark gray their mustaches were blonde but dunhams curled jauntily outward at the corners and his light hair waved over either temple from the parting in the middle stanifords mustache was cut short his hair was clipped tight to his shapely head and not parted at all he had a slightly aquiline nose with sensitive nostrils showing the cartilage his face was darkly freckled they were both handsome fellows and fittingly dressed in rough blue which they wore like men with the habit of good clothes they made lydia such bows as she had never seen before then the captain introduced mr watterson the first officer to all and sat down saying to thomas with a sort of guilty and embarrassed growl aint he out yet well we wont wait and with but little change of tone asked a blessing for captain jenness in his way was a religious man  there was a sixth plate laid but the captain made no further mention of the person who was not out yet till shortly after the coffee was poured when the absentee appeared hastily closing his stateroom door behind him and then waiting on foot with a halfimpudent halfintimidated air while captain jenness with a sort of elaborate repressiveness presented him as mr hicks he was a short and slight young man with a small sandy mustache curling tightly in over his lip floating reddishblue eyes and a deep dimple in his weak slightly retreating chin he had an air at once amiable and baddish with an expression curiously blended of monkeylike humor and spaniellike apprehensiveness he did not look well and till he had swallowed two cups of coffee his hand shook the captain watched him furtively from under his bushy eyebrows and was evidently troubled and preoccupied addressing a word now and then to mr watterson who by virtue of what was apparently the ships discipline spoke only when he was spoken to and then answered with prompt acquiescence dunham and staniford exchanged not so much a glance as a consciousness in regard to him which seemed to recognize and class him they talked to each other and sometimes to the captain once they spoke to lydia mr dunham for example said missahblood dont you think we are uncommonly fortunate in having such lovely weather for a startoff  i dont know said lydia  mr dunham arrested himself in the use of his fork i beg your pardon he smiled  it seemed to be a question and after a moments doubt lydia answered i didnt know it was strange to have fine weather at the start  oh but i can assure you it is said dunham with a certain ladylike sweetness of manner which he had according to precedent we ought to be all deathly seasick  not at this time of year said captain jenness  not at this time of year repeated mr watterson as if the remark were an order to the crew  dunham referred the matter with a look to his friend who refused to take part in it and then he let it drop but presently staniford himself attempted the civility of some conversation with lydia he asked her gravely and somewhat severely if she had suffered much from the heat of the day before  yes said lydia it was very hot  im told it was the hottest day of the summer so far continued staniford with the same severity  i want to know cried lydia  the young man did not say anything more  as dunham lit his cigar at stanifords on deck the former said significantly what a very american thing  what a bore answered the other  dunham had never been abroad as one might imagine from his calling lydias presence a very american thing but he had always consorted with people who had lived in europe he read the revue des deux mondes habitually and the london weekly newspapers and this gave him the foreign standpoint from which he was fond of viewing his native world its incredible he added who in the world can she be  oh i dont know returned staniford with a cold disgust i should object to the society of such a young person for a month or six weeks under the most favorable circumstances and with frequent respites but to be imprisoned on the same ship with her and to have her on ones mind and in ones way the whole time is more than i bargained for captain jenness should have told us though i suppose he thought that if she could stand it we might theres that point of view but it takes all ease and comfort out of the prospect here comes that blackguard staniford turned his back towards mr hicks who was approaching but dunham could not quite do this though he waited for the other to speak first  will youwould you oblige me with a light mr hicks asked taking a cigar from his case  certainly said dunham with the comradery of the smoker  mr hicks seemed to gather courage from his cigar you didnt expect to find a lady passenger on board did you his poor disagreeable little face was lit up with unpleasant enjoyment of the anomaly dunham hesitated for an answer  one never can know what ones fellow passengers are going to be said staniford turning about and looking not at mr hickss face but his feet with an effect of being upon the whole disappointed not to find them cloven he added to put the man down rather than from an exact belief in his own suggestion shes probably some relation of the captains  why thats the joke of it said hicks fluttered with his superior knowledge ive been pumping the cabinboy and he says the captain never saw her till yesterday shes an upcountry schoolmarm and she came down here with her grandfather yesterday shes going out to meet friends of hers in venice the little man pulled at his cigar and coughed and chuckled and waited confidently for the impression  dunham said staniford did i hand you that sketchblock of mine to put in your bag when we were packing last night  yes ive got it  im glad of that did you see murray yesterday  no he was at cambridge  i thought he was to have met you at parkers the conversation no longer included mr hicks or the subject he had introduced after a moments hesitation he walked away to another part of the ship as soon as he was beyond earshot staniford again spoke dunham this girl is plainly one of those cases of supernatural innocence on the part of herself and her friends which as you suggested wouldnt occur among any other people in the world but ours  youre a good fellow staniford cried dunham  not at all i call myself simply a human being with the elemental instincts of a gentleman as far as concerns this matter the girl has been placed in a position which could be made very painful to her it seems to me its our part to prevent it from being so i doubt if she finds it at all anomalous and if we choose she need never do so till after weve parted with her i fancy we can preserve her unconsciousness intact  staniford this is like you said his friend with glistening eyes i had some wild notion of the kind myself but im so glad you spoke of it first  well never mind responded staniford we must make her feel that there is nothing irregular or uncommon in her being here as she is i dont know how the matters to be managed exactly it must be a negative benevolence for the most part but it can be done the first thing is to cow that nuisance yonder pumping the cabinboy the little sot look here dunham its such a satisfaction to me to think of putting that fellow under foot that ill leave you all the credit of saving the young ladys feelings i should like to begin stamping on him at once  i think you have made a beginning already i confess i wish you hadnt such heavy nails in your boots  oh theyll do him good confound him said staniford  i should have liked it better if her name hadnt been blood remarked dunham presently  it doesnt matter what a girls surname is besides blood is very frequent in some parts of the state  shes very pretty isnt she dunham suggested  oh pretty enough yes replied staniford nothing is so common as the pretty girl of our nation her beauty is part of the general tiresomeness of the whole situation  dont you think ventured his friend further that she has rather a ladylike air  she wanted to know said staniford with a laugh  dunham was silent a while before he asked what do you suppose her first name is  jerusha probably  oh impossible  well thenlurella you have no idea of the grotesqueness of these peoples minds i used to see a great deal of their intimate life when i went on my tramps and chanced it among them for bed and board wherever i happened to be we cultivated yankees and the raw material seem hardly of the same race where the puritanism has gone out of the people in spots theres the rankest growth of all sorts of crazy heresies and the old scriptural nomenclature has given place to something compounded of the fancifulness of storypaper romance and the gibberish of spiritualism they make up their names sometimes and call a child by what sounds pretty to them i wonder how the captain picked up that scoundrel  the turn of stanifords thought to hicks was suggested by the appearance of captain jenness who now issued from the cabin gangway and came toward them with the shadow of unwonted trouble in his face the captain too was smoking  well gentlemen he began with the obvious indirectness of a man not used to diplomacy how do you like your accommodations  staniford silently acquiesced in dunhams reply that they found them excellent but you dont mean to say dunham added that youre going to give us beefsteak and all the vegetables of the season the whole way over  no said the captain we shall put you on seafare soon enough but youll like it you dont want the same things at sea that you do on shore your appetite chops round into a different quarter altogether and you want salt beef but youll get it good your rooms pretty snug he suggested  oh its big enough said staniford to whom he had turned as perhaps more in authority than dunham while were well we only sleep in it and if were seasick it doesnt matter where we are  the captain knocked the ash from his cigar with the tip of his fat little finger and looked down i was in hopes i could have let you had a room apiece but i had another passenger jumped on me at the last minute i suppose you see whats the matter with mr hicks he looked up from one to another and they replied with a glance of perfect intelligence i dont generally talk my passengers over with one another but i thought id better speak to you about him i found him yesterday evening at my agents with his father hes just been on a spree a regular two weeks tear and the old gentleman didnt know what to do with him on shore any longer he thought hed send him to sea a voyage and see what would come of it and he plead hard with me to take him i didnt want to take him but he worked away at me till i couldnt say no i argued in my own mind that he couldnt get anything to drink on my ship and that hed behave himself well enough as long as he was sober the captain added ruefully he looks worse this morning than he did last night he looks bad i told the old gentleman that if he got into any trouble at tryeast or any of the ports where we touched he shouldnt set foot on my ship again but i guess hell keep pretty straight he hasnt got any money for one thing  staniford laughed he stops drinking for obvious reasons if for no others like artemus wards destitute inebriate did you think only of us in deciding whether you should take him  the captain looked up quickly at the young men as if touched in a sore place well there again i didnt seem to get my bearings just right i suppose you mean the young lady staniford motionlessly and silently assented well shes more of a young lady than i thought she was when her grandfather first come down here and talked of sending her over with me he was always speaking about his little girl you know and i got the idea that she was about thirteen or eleven may be i thought the child might be some bother on the voyage but thinks i im used to children and i guess i can manage bless your soul when i first see her on the wharf yesterday it most knocked me down i never believed she was half so tall nor half so goodlooking staniford smiled at this expression of the captains despair but the captain did not smile why she was as pretty as a bird well there i was it was no time then to back out the old man wouldnt understood besides there was the young lady herself and she seemed so forlorn and helpless that i kind of pitied her i thought what if it was one of my own girls and i made up my mind that she shouldnt know from anything i said or did that she wasnt just as much at home and just as much in place on my ship as she would be in my house i suppose what made me feel easier about it and took the queerness off some was my having my own girls along last voyage to be sure it aint quite the same thing said the captain interrogatively  not quite assented staniford  if there was two of them said the captain i dont suppose i should feel so bad about it but thinks i a ladys a lady the world over and a gentlemans a gentleman the captain looked significantly at the young men as for that other fellow added captain jenness if i cant take care of him i think id better stop going to sea altogether and go into the coasting trade  he resumed his cigar with defiance and was about turning away when staniford spoke captain jenness my friend and i had been talking this little matter over just before you came up will you let me say that im rather proud of having reasoned in much the same direction as yourself  this was spoken with that air which gave staniford a peculiar distinction and made him the despair and adoration of his friend it endowed the subject with seriousness and conveyed a sentiment of grave and noble sincerity the captain held out a hand to each of the young men crossing his wrists in what seemed a favorite fashion with him good he cried heartily i thought i knew you     vii   staniford and dunham drew stools to the rail and sat down with their cigars after the captain left them the second mate passed by and cast a friendly glance at them he had whimsical brown eyes that twinkled under his cappeak while a lurking smile played under his heavy mustache but he did not speak staniford said there was a pleasant fellow and he should like to sketch him he was only an amateur artist and he had been only an amateur in life otherwise so far but he did not pretend to have been anything else  then youre not sorry you came staniford asked dunham putting his hand on his friends knee he characteristically assumed the responsibility although the voyage by sailingvessel rather than steamer was their common whim and it had been stanifords preference that decided them for trieste rather than any nearer port  no im not sorryif you call it come already i think a bit of europe will be a very good thing for the present or as long as im in this irresolute mood if i understand it europe is the place for american irresolution when ive made up my mind ill come home again i still think colorado is the thing though i havent abandoned california altogether its a question of cattlerange and sheepranch  youll decide against both said dunham  how would you like west virginia they cattlerange in west virginia too they may sheepranch too for all i knowno thats in old virginia the trouble is that the virginias otherwise irreproachable are not paying fields for such enterprises they say that one is a sure thing in california and the other is a sure thing in colorado they give you the figures staniford lit another cigar  but why shouldnt you stay where you are staniford youve money enough left after all  yes money enough for one but theres something ignoble in living on a small stated income unless you have some object in view besides living and i havent you know its a duty i owe to the general frame of things to make more money  if you turned your mind to any one thing im sure youd succeed where you are dunham urged  thats just the trouble retorted his friend i cant turn my mind to any one thingim too universally gifted i paint a little i model a little i play a very little indeed i can write a book notice the ladies praise my art and the editors keep my literature a long time before they print it this doesnt seem the highest aim of being i have the noble earthhunger i must get upon the land thats why ive got upon the water staniford laughed again and pulled comfortably at his cigar now you he added after a pause in which dunham did not reply you have not had losses you still have everything comfortable about you du hast alles was menschen begehr even to the schönsten augen of the divine miss hibbard  yes staniford thats it i hate your going out there all alone now if you were taking some nice girl with you dunham said with a lovers fond desire that his friend should be in love too  to those wilds to a redwood shanty in california or a turf hovel in colorado what nice girl would go i will take some savage woman she shall rear my dusky race  i dont like to have you take any risks of degenerating began dunham  with what you know to be my natural tendencies your prophetic eye prefigures my pantaloons in the tops of my boots well there is time yet to turn back from the brutality of a patriarchal life you must allow that ive taken the longest way round in going west in italy there are many chances and besides you know i like to talk  it seemed to be an old subject between them and they discussed it languidly like some abstract topic rather than a reality  if you only had some tie to bind you to the east i should feel pretty safe about you said dunham presently  i have you answered his friend demurely  oh im nothing said dunham with sincerity  well i may form some tie in italy art may fall in love with me there how would you like to have me settle in florence and set up a studio instead of a ranchchoose between sculpture and painting instead of cattle and sheep after all it does grind me to have lost that money if i had only been swindled out of it i shouldnt have cared but when you go and make a bad thing of it yourself with your eyes open theres a reluctance to place the responsibility where it belongs that doesnt occur in the other case dunham do you think it altogether ridiculous that i should feel there was something sacred in the money when i remember how hard my poor old father worked to get it together it seems wicked that i should have stupidly wasted it on the venture i did i want to get it back i want to make money and so im going out to italy with you to waste more i dont respect myself as i should if i were on a pullman palace car speeding westward ill own i like this better  oh its all right staniford said his friend the voyage will do you good and youll have time to think everything over and start fairer when you get back  that girl observed staniford with characteristic abruptness is a type that is commoner than we imagine in new england we fair people fancy we are the only genuine yankees i guess thats a mistake there must have been a good many dark puritans in fact we always think of puritans as dark dont we  i believe we do assented dunham perhaps on account of their black clothes  perhaps said staniford at any rate im so tired of the blonde type in fiction that i rather like the other thing in life every novelist runs a blonde heroine i wonder why this girl has the clear southern pallor shes of the olive hue and her eyes are black as sloesnot that i know what sloes are did she remind you of anything in particular  yes a little of faeds evangeline as she sat in the doorway of the warehouse yesterday  exactly i wish the picture were more of a picture but i dont know that it matters shes more of a picture  pretty as a bird the captain said  bird isnt bad but the bird is in her manner theres something tranquilly alert in her manner thats like a bird like a bird that lingers on its perch looking at you over its shoulder if you come up behind that trick of the heavily lifted half lifted eyelidsi wonder if its a trick the long lashes cant be she cant make them curl up at the edges bloodlurella blood and she wants to know stanifords voice fell thoughtful  shes more slender than faeds evangeline faed painted rather too fat a sufferer on that tombstone lurella blood has a very pretty figure lurella why lurella  oh come staniford cried dunham it isnt fair to call the girl by that jingle without some ground for it  im sure her names lurella for she wanted to know besides theres as much sense in it as there is in any name it sounds very well lurella it is mere prejudice that condemns the novel collocation of syllables  i wonder what shes thinking of nowwhats passing in her mind mused dunham aloud  you want to know too do you mocked his friend ill tell you what processions of young men so long that they are an hour getting by a given point thats whats passing in every girls mind when shes thinking its perfectly right processsions of young girls are similarly passing in our stately and spacious intellects its the chief business of the youth of one sex to think of the youth of the other sex  oh yes i know assented dunham and i believe in it too  of course you do you wicked wretch you abandoned lovelace you bruiser of ladies hearts you hope the procession is composed entirely of yourself what would the divine hibbard say to your goingson  oh dont staniford it isnt fair pleaded dunham with the flattered laugh which the best of men give when falsely attainted of gallantry i was wondering whether she was feeling homesick or strange or  i will go below and ask her said staniford i know she will tell me the exact truth they always do or if you will take a guess of mine instead of her word for it i will hazard the surmise that she is not at all homesick what has a pretty young girl to regret in such a life as she has left its the most arid and joyless existence under the sun she has never known anything like society in the country with us the social side must always have been somewhat paralyzed but there are monumental evidences of pleasures in other days that are quite extinct now you see big dusty ballrooms in the old taverns ballrooms that have had no dancing in them for half a century and where they give you a bed sometimes there used to be academies too in the hill towns where they furnished a rude but serviceable article of real learning and where the local octogenarian remembers seeing something famous in the way of theatricals on examinationday but neither his children nor his grandchildren have seen the like theres a decay of the religious sentiment and the church is no longer a social centre with merry meetings among the tombstones between the morning and the afternoon service superficial humanitarianism of one kind or another has killed the good old orthodoxy as the railroads have killed the turnpikes and the country taverns and the common schools have killed the academies why i dont suppose this girl ever saw anything livelier than a township cattle show or a sundayschool picnic in her life they dont pay visits in the country except at rare intervals and their evening parties when they have any are something to strike you dead with pity they used to clear away the cornhusks and pumpkins on the barn floor and dance by the light of tin lanterns at least thats the traditional thing the actual thing is sitting around four sides of the room giggling whispering looking at photograph albums and coaxing somebody to play on the piano the banquet is passed in the form of apples and water i have assisted at some rural festivals where the apples were omitted upon the whole i wonder our country people dont all go mad they do go mad a great many of them and manage to get a little glimpse of society in the insane asylums staniford ended his tirade with a laugh in which he vented his humorous sense and his fundamental pity of the conditions he had caricatured  but how demanded dunham breaking rebelliously from the silence in which he had listened do you account for her good manner  she probably was born with a genius for it some people are born with a genius for one thing and some with a genius for another i for example am an artistic genius forced to be an amateur by the delusive possession of early wealth and now burning with a creative instinct in the direction of the sheep or cattle business you have the gift of universal optimism lurella blood has the genius of good society give that girl a winter among nice people in boston and you would never know that she was not born on beacon hill  oh i doubt that said dunham  you doubt it pessimist  but you implied just now that she had no sensibility pursued dunham  so i did cried staniford cheerfully social genius and sensibility are two very different things the cynic might contend they were incompatible but i wont insist so far i dare say she may regret the natal spot most of us have a dumb brutish attachment to the cari luoghi but if she knows anything she hates its surroundings and must be glad to get out into the world i should like mightily to know how the world strikes her as far as shes gone but i doubt if shes one to betray her own counsel in any way she looks deep lurella does staniford laughed again at the pain which his insistence upon the name brought into dunhams face     viii   after dinner nature avenged herself in the young men for their vigils of the night before when they had stayed up so late parting with friends that they had found themselves early risers without having been abed they both slept so long that dunham leaving staniford to a still unfinished nap came on deck between five and six oclock  lydia was there wrapped against the freshening breeze in a red knit shawl and seated on a stool in the waist of the ship in the evangeline attitude and with the wistful evangeline look in her face as she gazed out over the farweltering sealine from which all trace of the shore had vanished she seemed to the young man very interesting and he approached her with that kindness for all other women in his heart which the lover feels in absence from his beloved and with a formless sense that some retribution was due her from him for the roughness with which staniford had surmised her natural history women had always been dear and sacred to him he liked beyond most young men to be with them he was forever calling upon them getting introduced to them waiting upon them inventing little services for them corresponding with them and wearing himself out in their interest it is said that women do not value men of this sort so much as men of some other sorts it was long at any rate before dunhamwhom people always called charley dunhamfound the woman who thought him more lovely than every other woman pronounced him and naturally miss hibbard was the most exacting of her sex she required all those offices which dunham delighted to render and many besides being an invalid she needed devotion she had refused dunham before going out to europe with her mother and she had written to take him back after she got there he was now on his way to join her in dresden where he hoped that he might marry her and be perfectly sacrificed to her ailments she only lacked poverty in order to be thoroughly displeasing to most men but dunham had no misgiving save in regard to her money he wished she had no money  a good deal more motion isnt there he said to lydia smiling sunnily as he spoke and holding his hat with one hand do you find it unpleasant  no she answered not at all i like it  oh there isnt enough swell to make it uncomfortable yet asserted dunham looking about to see if there were not something he could do for her and you may turn out a good sailor were you ever at sea before  no this is the first time i was ever on a ship  is it possible cried dunham he was now fairly at sea for the first time himself though by virtue of his european associations he seemed to have made many voyages it appeared to him that if there was nothing else he could do for lydia it was his duty to talk to her he found another stool and drew it up within easier conversational distance then youve never been out of sight of land before  no said lydia  thats very curiousi beg your pardon i mean you must find it a great novelty  yes its very strange said the girl seriously it looks like the flood it seems as if all the rest of the world was drowned  dunham glanced round the vast horizon it is like the flood and it has that quality which ive often noticed in sublime things of seeming to be for this occasion only  yes said lydia  why dont you know it seems as if it must be like a fine sunset and would pass in a few minutes perhaps we feel that we cant endure sublimity long and want it to pass  i could look at it forever replied lydia  dunham turned to see if this were youngladyish rapture but perceived that she was affecting nothing he liked seriousness for he was with a great deal of affectation for social purposes a very sincere person his heart warmed more and more to the lonely girl to be talking to her seemed after all to be doing very little for her and he longed to be of service have you explored our little wooden world yet he asked after a pause  lydia paused too the ship she asked presently no ive only been in the cabin and here and this morning she added conscientiously thomas showed me the cooks galleythe kitchen  youve seen more than i have said dunham wouldnt you like to go forward to the bow and see how it looks there  yes thank you answered lydia i would  she tottered a little in gaining her feet and the wind drifted her slightness a step or two aside wont you take my arm perhaps suggested dunham  thank you said lydia i think i can get along but after a few paces a lurch of the ship flung her against dunhams side he caught her hand and passed it through his arm without protest from her  isnt it grand he asked triumphantly as they stood at the prow and rose and sank with the vessels careering plunges it was no gale but only a fair wind the water foamed along the ships sides and as her bows descended shot forward in hissing jets of spray away on every hand flocked the white caps you had better keep my arm here lydia did so resting her disengaged hand on the bulwarks as she bent over a little on that side to watch the rush of the sea it really seems as if there were more of a view here  it does somehow admitted lydia  look back at the ships sails said dunham the swell and press of the white canvas seemed like the clouds of heaven swooping down upon them from all the airy heights the sweet wind beat in their faces and they laughed in sympathy as they fronted it perhaps the motion is a little too strong for you here he asked  oh not at all cried the girl  he had done something for her by bringing her here and he hoped to do something more by taking her away he was discomfited for he was at a loss what other attention to offer just at that moment a sound made itself heard above the whistling of the cordage and the wash of the sea which caused lydia to start and look round  didnt you think she asked that you heard hens  why yes said dunham what could it have been let us investigate  he led the way back past the forecastle and the cooks galley and there in dangerous proximity to the pots and frying pans they found a coop with some dozen querulous and meditative fowl in it  i heard them this morning said lydia they seemed to wake me with their crowing and i thoughti was at home  im very sorry said dunham sympathetically he wished staniford were there to take shame to himself for denying sensibility to this girl  the cook smoking a pipe at the door of his galley said dey wont trouble you much miss dey dont genly last us long and ill kill de roosters first  oh come now protested dunham i wouldnt say that the cook and lydia stared at him in equal surprise  well answered the cook ill kill the hens first den it dont make any difference to me which i kill i dunno but de hens is tenderer he smoked in a bland indifference  oh hold on exclaimed dunham in repetition of his helpless protest  lydia stooped down to make closer acquaintance with the devoted birds they huddled themselves away from her in one corner of their prison and talked together in low tones of grave mistrust poor things she said as a country girl used to the practical ends of poultry she knew as well as the cook that it was the fit and simple destiny of chickens to be eaten sooner or later and it must have been less in commiseration of their fate than in selfpity and regret for the scenes they recalled that she sighed the hens that burrowed yesterday under the lilacs in the dooryard the cock that her aunt so often drove insulted and exclamatory at the head of his harem out of forbidden garden bounds the social groups that scratched and descanted lazily about the wide sunny barn doors the anxious companies seeking their favorite perches with alarming outcries in the dusk of summer evenings the sentinels answering each other from farm to farm before winter dawns when all the hills were drowned in snow were of kindred with these hapless prisoners  dunham was touched at lydias compassion would you likewould you like to feed them he asked by a happy inspiration he turned to the cook with his gentle politeness theres no objection to our feeding them i suppose  laws no said the cook fats em up he went inside and reappeared with a pan full of scraps of meat and crusts of bread  oh i say cried dunham havent you got some grain you know of some sort some seeds dont you know  they will like this said lydia while the cook stared in perplexity she took the pan and opening the little door of the coop flung the provision inside but the fowls were either too depressed in spirit to eat anything or they were not hungry they remained in their corner and merely fell silent as if a new suspicion had been roused in their unhappy breasts  deyll come to it observed the cook  dunham felt far from content and regarded the poultry with silent disappointment are you fond of pets he asked after a while  yes i used to have pet chickens when i was a little thing  you ought to adopt one of these suggested dunham that white one is a pretty creature  yes said lydia he looks as if he were leghorn leghorn breed she added in reply to dunhams look of inquiry hes a beauty  let me get him out for you a moment cried the young man in his amiable zeal before lydia could protest or the cook interfere he had opened the coopdoor and plunged his arm into the tumult which his manoeuvre created within he secured the cockerel and drawing it forth was about to offer it to lydia when in its struggles to escape it drove one of its spurs into his hand dunham suddenly released it and then ensued a wild chase for its recapture up and down the ship in which it had every advantage of the young man at last it sprang upon the rail he put out his hand to seize it when it rose with a desperate screech and flew far out over the sea they watched the suicide till it sank exhausted into a distant whitecap  dats gone said the cook philosophically dunham looked round half the ships company alarmed by his steeplechase over the deck were there silently agrin  lydia did not laugh when he asked still with his habitual sweetness but entirely at random shall weahgo below she did not answer definitely and did not go at the same time she ceased to be so timidly intangible and aloof in manner she began to talk to dunham instead of letting him talk to her she asked him questions and listened with deference to what he said on such matters as the probable length of the voyage and the sort of weather they were likely to have she did not take note of his keeping his handkerchief wound round his hand nor of his attempts to recur to the subject of his mortifying adventure when they were again quite alone the cooks respect having been won back through his ethnic susceptibility to silver she remembered that she must go to her room  in other words said staniford after dunham had reported the whole case to him she treated your hurt vanity as if you had been her pet schoolboy she lured you away from yourself and got you to talking and thinking of other things lurella is deep i tell you what consummate tacticians the least of women are its a pity that they have to work so often in such dull material as men they ought always to have women to operate on the youngest of them has more wisdom in human nature than the sages of our sex i must say lurella is magnanimous too she might have taken her revenge on you for pitying her yesterday when she sat in that warehouse door on the wharf it was rather fine in lurella not to do it what did she say dunham what did she talk about did she want to know  no shouted dunham she talked very well like any young lady  oh all young ladies talk well of course but what did this one say what did she do except suffer a visible pang of homesickness at the sight of unattainable poultry come you have represented the interview with miss blood as one of great brilliancy  i havent said dunham i have done nothing of the kind her talk was like any pleasant talk it was refined and simple and unobtrusive  that is it was in no way remarkable observed staniford with a laugh i expected something better of lurella i expected something salient well never mind shes behaved well by you seeing what a goose you had made of yourself she behaved like a lady and ive noticed that she eats with her fork it often happens in the country that you find the women practicing some of the arts of civilization while their men folk are still sunk in barbaric uses lurella i see is a social creature she was born for society as you were and i suppose you will be thrown a good deal together were all likely to be associated rather familiarly under the circumstances but i wish you would note down in your mind some points of her conversation im really curious to know what a girl of her traditions thinks about the world when she first sees it her mind must be in most respects an unbroken wilderness shes had schooling of course and she knows her grammar and algebra but she cant have had any cultivation if she were of an earlier generation one would expect to find something biblical in her but you cant count upon a puritanic culture now among our country folks  if you are so curious said dunham why dont you study her mind yourself  no no that wouldnt do staniford answered the light of your innocence upon hers is invaluable i can understand her better through you you must go on i will undertake to make your peace with miss hibbard  the young men talked as they walked the deck and smoked in the starlight they were wakeful after their long nap in the afternoon and they walked and talked late with the silences that old friends can permit themselves staniford recurred to his loss of money and his western projects which took more definite form now that he had placed so much distance between himself and their fulfillment with half a year in italy before him he decided upon a cattlerange in colorado then i should like to know he said after one of the pauses how two young men of our form strike that girls fancy i havent any personal curiosity about her impressions but i should like to know as an observer of the human race if my conjectures are right shes never met people of our sort before  what sort of men has she been associated with asked dunham  well im not quite prepared to say i take it that it isnt exactly the hobbledehoy sort she has probably looked highas far up as the clerk in the store he has taken her to drive in a buggy saturday afternoons when he put on his readymade suitand looked very well in it too and theyve been at picnics together or may be as shes in the schoolteaching line shes taken some highbrowed hollow cheeked highschool principal for her ideal or it is possible that she has never had attention from any one that is apt to happen to selfrespectful girls in rural communities and their beauty doesnt save them fellows as they call themselves like girls that have what they call go that make up to them lurella doesnt seem of that kind and i should not be surprised if you were the first gentleman who had ever offered her his arm i wonder what she thought of you shes acquainted by sight with the ordinary summer boarder of north america they penetrate everywhere now but i doubt if shes talked with them much if at all she must be ignorant of our world beyond anything we can imagine  but how do you account for her being so well dressed  oh thats instinct you find it everywhere in every little village there is some girl who knows how to outpreen all the others i wonder added staniford in a more deeply musing tone if she kept from laughing at you out of good feeling or if she was merely overawed by your splendor  she didnt laugh dunham answered because she saw that it would have added to my annoyance my splendor had nothing to do with it  oh dont underrate your splendor my dear fellow cried staniford with a caressing ridicule that he often used with dunham of course i know what a simple and humble fellow you are but youve no idea how that exterior of yours might impose upon the agricultural imagination it has its effect upon me in my pastoral moods dunham made a gesture of protest and staniford went on country people have queer ideas of us sometimes possibly lurella was afraid of you think of that dunhamhaving a woman afraid of you for once in your life well hurry up your acquaintance with her dunham or i shall wear myself out in mere speculative analysis i havent the aplomb for studying the sensibilities of a young lady and catching chickens for her so as to produce a novel play of emotions i thought this voyage was going to be a season of mental quiet but having a young lady on board seems to forbid that kind of repose i shouldnt mind a half dozen but one is altogether too many poor little thing i say dunham theres something rather pretty about having her with us after all isnt there it gives a certain distinction to our voyage we shall not degenerate we shall shave every day wind and weather permitting and wear our best things they talked of other matters and again staniford recurred to lydia if she has any regrets for her mountain homethough i dont see why she should havei hope they havent kept her awake my faraway cot on the plains is not going to interfere with my slumbers  staniford stepped to the ships side and flung the end of his cigarette overboard it struck a red spark amidst the lurid phosphorescence of the bubbles that swept backward from the vessels prow     ix   the weather held fine the sun shone and the friendly winds blew out of a cloudless heaven by night the moon ruled a firmament powdered with stars of multitudinous splendor the conditions inspired dunham with a restless fertility of invention in lydias behalf he had heard of the game of shuffleboard that blind and dumb croquet with which the jaded passengers on the steamers appease their terrible leisure and with the help of the ships carpenter he organized this pastime and played it with her hour after hour while staniford looked on and smoked in grave observance and hicks lurked at a distance till dunham felt it on his kind heart and tender conscience to invite him to a share in the diversion as his nerves recovered their tone hicks showed himself a man of some qualities that staniford would have liked in another man he was amiable and he was droll though apt to turn sulky if staniford addressed him which did not often happen he knew more than dunham of shuffleboard as well as of tossing rings of rope over a peg set up a certain space off in the decka game which they eagerly took up in the afternoon after pushing about the flat wooden disks all the morning most of the talk at the table was of the varying fortunes of the players and the yarn of the storyteller in the forecastle remained halfspun while the sailors off watch gathered to look on and to bet upon lydias skill it puzzled staniford to make out whether she felt any strangeness in the situation which she accepted with so much apparent serenity sometimes in his frequently recurring talks with dunham he questioned whether their delicate precautions for saving her feelings were not perhaps thrown away upon a young person who played shuffle board and ringtoss on the deck of the aroostook with as much self possession as she would have played croquet on her native turf at south bradfield  their ideal of propriety up country is very different from ours he said beginning one of his long comments i dont say that it concerns the conscience more than ours does but they think evil of different things were getting europeanizedi dont mean you dunham in spite of your endeavors you will always remain one of the most hopelessly american of our speciesand we have our little borrowed anxieties about the free association of young people they have none whatever though they are apt to look suspiciously upon married peoples friendships with other peoples wives and husbands its quite likely that lurella with the traditions of her queer world has not imagined anything anomalous in her position she may realize certain inconveniences but she must see great advantages in it poor girl how she must be rioting on the united devotion of cabin and forecastle after the scanty gallantries of a hill town peopled by elderly unmarried women im glad of it for her sake i wonder which she really prizes most your ornate attentions or the uncouth homage of those sailors who are always running to fetch her rings and blocks when she makes a wild shot i believe i dont care and shouldnt disapprove of her preference whichever it was staniford frowned before he added but i object to hicks and his drolleries its impossible for that little wretch to think reverently of a young girl its shocking to see her treating him as if he were a gentleman hickss behavior really gave no grounds for reproach and it was only his moral mechanism as staniford called the character he constructed for him which he could blame nevertheless the thought of him gave an oblique cast to stanifords reflections which he cut short by saying this sort of worship is every womans due in girlhood but i suppose a fortnight of it will make her a pert and silly coquette what does she say to your literature dunham  dunham had already begun to lend lydia bookshis own and stanifordsin which he read aloud to her and chose passages for her admiration but he was obliged to report that she had rather a passive taste in literature she seemed to like what he said was good but not to like it very much or to care greatly for reading or else she had never had the habit of talking books he suggested this to staniford who at once philosophized it  why i rather like that you know we all read in such a literary way now we dont read simply for the joy or profit of it we expect to talk about it and say how it is this and that and ive no doubt that were subconsciously harassed all the time with an automatic process of criticism now lurella i fancy reads with the sense of the days when people read in private and not in public as we do she believes that your serious books are all true and she knows that my novels are all liesthats what some excellent christians would call the fiction even of george eliot or of hawthorne she would be ashamed to discuss the lives and loves of heroes and heroines who never existed i think thats firstrate she must wonder at your distempered interest in them if one could get at it i suppose the fresh wholesomeness of lurellas mind would be something delicious a quality like spring water  he was one of those men who cannot rest in regard to people they meet till they have made some effort to formulate them he liked to ticket them off but when he could not classify them he remained content with his mere study of them his habit was one that does not promote sympathy with ones fellow creatures he confessed even that it disposed him to wish for their less acquaintance when once he had got them generalized they became then collected specimens yet for the time being his curiosity in them gave him a specious air of sociability he lamented the insincerity which this involved but he could not help it the next novelty in character was as irresistible as the last he sat down before it till it yielded its meaning or suggested to him some analogy by which he could interpret it  with this passion for the arrangement and distribution of his neighbors it was not long before he had placed most of the people on board in what he called the psychology of the ship he did not care that they should fit exactly in their order he rather preferred that they should have idiosyncrasies which differentiated them from their species and he enjoyed lydias being a little indifferent about books for this and for other reasons if she were literary she would be like those vulgar little persons of genius in the magazine stories she would have read all sorts of impossible things up in her village she would have been discovered by some aesthetic summer boarder who had happened to identify her with the gifted daisy dawn and she would be going out on the aesthetics money for the further expansion of her spirit in europe somebody would be obliged to fall in love with her and she would sacrifice her career for a man who was her inferior as we should be subtly given to understand at the close i think its going to be as distinguished by and by not to like books as it is not to write them lurella is a prophetic soul and if theres anything comforting about her its her being so merely and stupidly pretty  she is not merely and stupidly pretty retorted dunham she never does herself justice when you are by she can talk very well and on some subjects she thinks strongly  oh im sorry for that said staniford but call me some time when shes doing herself justice  i dont mean that shes like the women we know she doesnt say witty things and she hasnt their responsive quickness but her ideas are her own no matter how old they are and what she says she seems to be saying for the first time and as if it had never been thought out before  that is what i have been contending for said staniford that is what i meant by spring water it is that thrilling freshness which charms me in lurella he laughed have you converted her to your spectacular faith yet dunham blushed you have tried continued staniford tell me about it  i will not talk with you on such matters said dunham till you know how to treat serious things seriously  i shall know how when i realize that they are serious with you well i dont object to a womans thinking strongly on religious subjects its the only safe ground for her strong thinking and even there she had better feel strongly did you succeed in convincing her that archbishop laud was a saint incompris and the good king charles a blessed martyr  dunham did not answer till he had choked down some natural resentment he had several years earlier forsaken the pale unitarian worship of his family because staniford always said he had such a feeling for color and had adopted an extreme tint of ritualism it was rumored at one time before his engagement to miss hibbard that he was going to unite with a celibate brotherhood he went regularly into retreat at certain seasons to the vast entertainment of his friend and within the bounds of good taste he was a zealous propagandist of his faith of which he had the practical virtues in high degree i hope he said presently that i know how to respect convictions even of those adhering to the church in error  staniford laughed again i see you have not converted lurella well i like that in her too i wish i could have the arguments pro and con it would have been amusing i suppose he pondered aloud that she is a calvinist of the deepest dye and would regard me as a lost spirit for being outside of her church she would look down upon me from one height as i look down upon her from another and really as far as personal satisfaction in superiority goes she might have the advantage of me thats very curious very interesting  as the first week wore away the wonted incidents of a sea voyage lent their variety to the life on board one day the ship ran into a school of whales which remained heavily thumping and lolling about in her course and blowing jets of water into the air like so many breaks in garden hose staniford suggested at another time some flyingfish came on board the sailors caught a dolphin and they promised a shark by and by all these things were turned to account for the young girls amusement as if they had happened for her the dolphin died that she might wonder and pity his beautiful death the cook fried her some of the flyingfish some one was on the lookout to detect even porpoises for her a sail in the offing won the discoverer envy when he pointed it out to her a steamer celebrity the captain ran a point out of his course to speak to a vessel that she might be able to tell what speaking a ship at sea was like  at table the stores which the young men had laid in for private use became common luxuries and she fared sumptuously every day upon dainties which she supposed were supplied by the shipdelicate jellies and canned meats and syruped fruits and if she wondered at anything she must have wondered at the scrupulous abstinence with which captain jenness seconded by mr watterson refused the luxuries which his bounty provided them and at the constancy with which staniford declined some of these dishes and hicks declined others shortly after the latter began more distinctly to be tolerated he appeared one day on deck with a steamerchair in his hand and offered it to lydias use where she sat on a stool by the bulwark after that as she reclined in this chair wrapped in her red shawl and provided with a book or some sort of becoming handiwork she was even more picturesquely than before the centre about which the ships pride and chivalrous sentiment revolved they were americans and they knew how to worship a woman  staniford did not seek occasions to please and amuse her as the others did when they met as they must three times a day at table he took his part in the talk and now and then addressed her a perfunctory civility he imagined that she disliked him and he interested himself in imagining the ignorant grounds of her dislike a woman he said must always dislike some one in company its usually another woman as theres none on board i accept her enmity with meekness dunham wished to persuade him that he was mistaken dont try to comfort me dunham he replied i find a pleasure in being detested which is inconceivable to your amiable bosom  dunham turned to go below from where they stood at the head of the cabin stairs staniford looked round and saw lydia whom they had kept from coming up she must have heard him he took his cigar from his mouth and caught up a stool which he placed near the ships side where lydia usually sat and without waiting for her concurrence got a stool for himself and sat down with her  well miss blood he said its saturday afternoon at last and were at the end of our first week has it seemed very long to you  lydias color was bright with consciousness but the glance she gave staniford showed him looking tranquilly and honestly at her yes she said it has seemed long  thats merely the strangeness of everything theres nothing like local familiarity to make the time passexcept monotony and one gets both at sea next week will go faster than this and we shall all be at trieste before we know it of course we shall have a storm or two and that will retard us in fact as well as fancy but you wouldnt feel that youd been at sea if you hadnt had a storm  he knew that his tone was patronizing but he had theorized the girl so much with a certain slight in his mind that he was not able at once to get the tone which he usually took towards women this might not indeed have pleased some women any better than patronage it mocked while it caressed all their little pretenses and artificialities he addressed them as if they must be in the joke of themselves and did not expect to be taken seriously at the same time he liked them greatly and would not on any account have had the silliest of them different from what she was he did not seek them as dunham did their society was not a matter of life or death with him but he had an elderbrotherly kindness for the whole sex  lydia waited awhile for him to say something more but he added nothing and she observed with a furtive look i presume youve seen some very severe storms at sea  no staniford answered i havent ive been over several times but ive never seen anything alarming ive experienced the ordinary seasickening tempestuousness  have youhave you ever been in italy asked lydia after another pause  yes he said twice im very fond of italy he spoke of it in a familiar tone that might well have been discouraging to one of her total unacquaintance with it presently he added of his own motion looking at her with his interest in her as a curious study youre going to venice i think mr dunham told me  yes said lydia  well i think its rather a pity that you shouldnt arrive there directly without the interposition of trieste he scanned her yet more closely but with a sort of absence in his look as if he addressed some ideal of her  why asked lydia apparently pushed to some selfassertion by this way of being looked and talked at  its the strangest place in the world said staniford and then he mused again but i suppose he did not go on and the word fell again to lydia  im going to visit my aunt who is staying there she was where i live last summer and she told us about it but i couldnt seem to understand it  no one can understand it without seeing it  ive read some descriptions of it lydia ventured  theyre of no usethe books  is trieste a strange place too  its strange as a hundred other places areand its picturesque but theres only one venice  im afraid sometimes she faltered as if his manner in regard to this peculiar place had been hopelessly exclusive that it will be almost too strange  oh thats another matter said staniford i confess i should be rather curious to know whether you liked venice i like it but i can imagine myself sympathizing with people who detested itif they said so let me see what will give you some idea of it do you know boston well  no ive only been there twice lydia acknowledged  then youve never seen the back bay by night from the long bridge well let me see  im afraid interposed lydia that ive not been about enough for you to give me an idea from other places we always go to greenfield to do our trading and ive been to keene and springfield a good many times  im sorry to say i havent said staniford but ill tell you venice looks like an inundated town if you could imagine those sunset clouds yonder turned marble you would have venice as she is at sunset you must first think of the sea when you try to realize the place if you dont find the sea too strange you wont find venice so  i wish it would ever seem half as homelike cried the girl  then you find the shipim glad you find the shiphomelike said staniford tentatively  oh yes everything is so convenient and pleasant it seems sometimes as if i had always lived here  well thats very nice assented staniford rather blankly some people feel a little queer at seain the beginning and you havent at all he could not help this leading question yet he knew its meanness and felt remorse for it  oh i did at first responded the girl but went no farther and staniford was glad of it after all why should he care to know what was in her mind  captain jenness he merely said understands making people at home  oh yes indeed assented lydia and mr watterson is very agreeable and mr mason i didnt suppose sailors were so what soft mild voices they have  thats the speech of most of the down east coast people  is it i like it better than our voices our voices are so sharp and high at home  its hard to believe that said staniford with a smile  lydia looked at him oh i wasnt born in south bradfield i was ten years old when i went there to live  where were you born miss blood he asked  in california my father had gone out for his health but he died there  oh said staniford he had a book in his hand and he began to scribble a little sketch of lydias pose on a flyleaf she looked round and saw it youve detected me he said i havent any right to keep your likeness now i must make you a present of this work of art miss blood he finished the sketch with some ironical flourishes and made as if to tear out the leaf  oh cried lydia simply you will spoil the book  then the book shall go with the picture if youll let it said staniford  do you mean to give it to me she asked with surprise  that was my munificent intention i want to write your name in it whats the initial of your first name miss blood  l thank you said lydia  staniford gave a start no he exclaimed it seemed a fatality  my name is lydia persisted the girl what letter should it begin with  ohoh i knew lydia began with an l stammered staniford but iii thought your first name was  what asked lydia sharply  i dont know lily he answered guiltily  lily blood cried the girl lydia is bad enough but lily blood they couldnt have been such fools  i beg your pardon of course not i dont know how i could have got the idea it was one of those impressionshallucinations staniford found himself in an attitude of lying excuse towards the simple girl over whom he had been lording it in satirical fancy ever since he had seen her and meekly anxious that she should not be vexed with him he began to laugh at his predicament and she smiled at his mistake what is the date he asked  the 15th she said and he wrote under the sketch lydia blood ship aroostook august 15 1874 and handed it to her with a bow surcharged with gravity  she took it and regarded the picture without comment  ah said staniford i see that you know how bad my sketch is you sketch  no i dont know how to draw replied lydia  you criticise  no  so glad said staniford he began to like this a young man must find pleasure in sitting alone near a pretty young girl and talking with her about herself and himself no matter how plain and dull her speech is and staniford though he found lydia as blankly unresponsive as might be to the flattering irony of his habit amused himself in realizing that here suddenly he was almost upon the terms of windowseat flirtation with a girl whom lately he had treated with perfect indifference and just now with fatherly patronage the situation had something more even than the usual windowseat advantages it had qualities as of a common shipwreck of their being cast away on a desolate island together he felt more than ever that he must protect this helpless loveliness since it had begun to please his imagination you dont criticise he said is that because you are so amiable im sure you could if you would  no returned lydia i dont really know but ive often wished i did know  then you didnt teach drawing in your school  how did you know i had a school asked lydia quickly  he disliked to confess his authority because he disliked the authority but he said mr hicks told us  mr hicks lydia gave a little frown as of instinctive displeasure which gratified staniford  yes the cabinboy told him you see we are dreadful gossips on the aroostookthough there are so few ladies it had slipped from him but it seemed to have no personal slant for lydia  oh yes i told thomas she said no its only a country school once i thought i should go down to the state normal school and study drawing there but i never did are youare you a painter mr staniford  he could not recollect that she had pronounced his name before he thought it came very winningly from her lips no im not a painter im not anything he hesitated then he added recklessly im a farmer  a farmer lydia looked incredulous but grave  yes im a hornyhanded son of the soil im a cattlefarmer im a sheepfarmer i dont know which one day im the one and the next day im the other lydia looked mystified and staniford continued i mean that i have no profession and that sometimes i think of going into farming out west  yes said lydia  how should i like it give me an opinion miss blood  oh i dont know answered the girl  you would never have dreamt that i was a farmer would you  no i shouldnt said lydia honestly its very hard work  and i dont look fond of hard work  i didnt say that  and ive no right to press you for your meaning  what i meant wasi meanperhaps if you had never tried it you didnt know what very hard work it was some of the summer boarders used to think our farmers had easy times  i never was a summer boarder of that description i know that farming is hard work and im going into it because i dislike it what do you think of that as a form of selfsacrifice  i dont see why any one should sacrifice himself uselessly  you dont you have very little conception of martyrdom do you like teaching school  no said lydia promptly  why do you teach then staniford had blundered he knew why she taught and he felt instantly that he had hurt her pride more sensitive than that of a more sophisticated person who would have had no scruple in saying that she did it because she was poor he tried to retrieve himself of course i understand that schoolteaching is useful selfsacrifice he trembled lest she should invent some pretext for leaving him he could not afford to be left at a disadvantage but do you know i would no more have taken you for a teacher than you me for a farmer  yes said lydia  he could not tell whether she was appeased or not and he rather feared not you dont ask why and i asked you why at once  lydia laughed well why  oh thats a secret ill tell you one of these days he had really no reason he said this to gain time he was always honest in his talk with men but not always with women  i suppose i look very young said lydia i used to be afraid of the big boys  if the boys were big enough interposed staniford they must have been afraid of you  lydia said as if she had not understood i had hard work to get my certificate but i was older than i looked  that is much better remarked staniford than being younger than you look i am twentyeight and people take me for thirtyfour im a prematurely middleaged man i wish you would tell me miss blood a little about south bradfield ive been trying to make out whether i was ever there i tramped nearly everywhere when i was a student what sort of people are they there  oh they are very nice people said lydia  do you like them  i never thought whether i did they are nearly all old their children have gone away they dont seem to live they are just staying when i first came there i was a little girl one day i went into the graveyard and counted the stones there were three times as many as there were living persons in the village  i think i know the kind of place said staniford i suppose youre not very homesick  not for the place answered lydia evasively  of course staniford hastened to add you miss your own family circle to this she made no reply it is the habit of people bred like her to remain silent for want of some sort of formulated comment upon remarks to which they assent  staniford fell into a musing mood which was without visible embarrassment to the young girl who must have been inured to much severer silences in the society of south bradfield he remained staring at her throughout his reverie which in fact related to her he was thinking what sort of an old maid she would have become if she had remained in that village he fancied elements of hardness and sharpness in her which would have asserted themselves as the joyless years went on like the bony structure of her face as the softness of youth left it she was saved from that whatever was to be her destiny in italy from south bradfield to venicewhat a prodigious transition it seemed as if it must transfigure her miss blood he exclaimed i wish i could be with you when you first see venice  yes said lydia  even the interrogative comment with the rising inflection could not chill his enthusiasm it is really the greatest sight in the world  lydia had apparently no comment to make on this fact she waited tranquilly a while before she said my father used to talk about italy to me when i was little he wanted to go my mother said afterwardsafter she had come home with me to south bradfieldthat she always believed he would have lived if he had gone there he had consumption  oh said staniford softly then he added with the tact of his sex miss blood you mustnt take cold sitting here with me this wind is chilly shall i go below and get you some more wraps  no thank you said lydia i believe i will go down now  she went below to her room and then came out into the cabin with some sewing at which she sat and stitched by the lamp the captain was writing in his logbook dunham and hicks were playing checkers together staniford from a corner of a locker looked musingly upon this curious family circle it was not the first time that its occupations had struck him oddly sometimes when they were all there together dunham read aloud hicks knew tricks of legerdemain which he played cleverly the captain told some very good stories and led off in the laugh lydia always sewed and listened she did not seem to find herself strangely placed and her presence characterized all that was said and done with a charming innocence as a bit of life it was as pretty as it was quaint  really staniford said to dunham as they turned in that night she has domesticated us  yes assented dunham with enthusiasm isnt she a nice girl  shes intolerably passive or not passive either she says what she thinks but she doesnt seem to have thought of many things did she ever tell you about her father  no said dunham  i mean about his dying of consumption  no she never spoke of him to me was he  um it appears that we have been upon terms of confidence then staniford paused with one boot in his hand i should never have thought it  what was her father asked dunham  upon my word i dont know i didnt seem to get beyond elemental statements of intimate fact with her he died in california where she was born and he always had a longing to go to italy that was rather pretty  its very touching i think  yes of course we might fancy this about lurella that she has a sort of piety in visiting the scenes that her father wished to visit and thatwell anything is predicable of a girl who says so little and looks so much shes certainly very handsome and im bound to say that her room could not have been better than her company so far    x  the dress that lydia habitually wore was one which her aunt maria studied from the costume of a summer boarder who had spent a preceding summer at the seashore and who found her yachtingdress perfectly adapted to tramping over the south bradfield hills thus reverting to its original use on shipboard the costume looked far prettier on lydia than it had on the summer boarder from whose unconscious person it had been plagiarized it was of the darkest blue flannel and was fitly set off with those bright ribbons at the throat which women know how to dispose there according to their complexions one day the bow was scarlet and another crimson staniford did not know which was better and disputed the point in vain with dunham they all grew to have a taste in such matters captain jenness praised her dress outright and said that he should tell his girls about it lydia who had always supposed it was a walking costume remained discreetly silent when the young men recognized its nautical character she enjoyed its success she made some little changes in the hat she wore with it which met the approval of the cabin family and she tranquilly kept her black silk in reserve for sunday she came out to breakfast in it and it swept the narrow spaces as she emerged from her stateroom with so rich and deep a murmur that every one looked up she sustained their united glance with something tenderly deprecatory and appealingly conscious in her manner much as a very sensitive girl in some new finery meets the eyes of her brothers when she does not know whether to cry or laugh at what they will say thomas almost dropped a plate goodness he said helplessly expressing the public sentiment in regard to a garment of which he alone had been in the secret no doubt it passed his fondest dreams of its splendor it fitted her as the sheath of the flower fits the flower  captain jenness looked hard at her but waited a decent season after saying grace before offering his compliment which he did in drawing the carvingknife slowly across the steel well miss blood thats right lydia blushed richly and the young men made their obeisances across the table  the flushes and pallors chased each other over her face and the sight of her pleasure in being beautiful charmed staniford if she were used to worship she would have taken our adoration more arrogantly he said to his friend when they went on deck after breakfast i can place her but ones circumstance doesnt always account for one in america and i cant make out yet whether shes ever been praised for being pretty some of our hillcountry people would have felt like hushing up her beauty as almost sinful and some would have gone down before it like greeks i cant tell whether she knows it all or not but if you suppose her unconscious till now its pathetic and black silks must be too rare in her life not to be celebrated by a high tumult of inner satisfaction im glad we bowed down to the new dress  yes assented dunham with an uneasy absence butstaniford i should like to propose to captain jenness our having service this morning it is the eleventh sunday after  ah yes said staniford it is sunday isnt it i thought we had breakfast rather later than usual all over the christian world on land and sea there is this abstruse relation between a late breakfast and religious observances  dunham looked troubled i wish you wouldnt talk that way staniford and i hope you wont say anything  to interfere with your proposition my dear fellow i am at least a gentleman  i beg your pardon said dunham gratefully  staniford even went himself to the captain with dunhams wish it is true the latter assumed the more disagreeable part of proposing the matter to hicks who gave a humorous assent as one might to a joke of doubtful feasibility  dunham gratified both his love for social management and his zeal for his church in this organization of worship and when all hands were called aft and stood round in decorous silence he read the lesson for the day and conducted the service with a gravity astonishing to the sailors who had taken him for a mere dandy staniford bore his part in the responses from the same prayerbook with captain jenness who kept up a devout inarticulate undergrowl and came out strong on particular words when he got his bearings through his spectacles hicks and the first officer silently shared another prayerbook and lydia offered half hers to mr mason  when the hymn was given out she waited while an experimental search for the tune took place among the rest they were about to abandon the attempt when she lifted her voice and began to sing she sang as she did in the meetinghouse at south bradfield and her voice seemed to fill all the hollow height and distance it rang far off like a mermaids singing on high like an angels it called with the same deep appeal to sense and soul alike the sailors stood rapt dunham kept up a show of singing for the churchs sake the others made no pretense of looking at the words they looked at her and she began to falter hearing herself alone then staniford struck in again wildly and the seavoices lent their powerful discord while the girls contralto thrilled through all  well miss blood said the captain when the service had ended in that subordination of the spiritual to the artistic interest which marks the process and the close of so much public worship in our day youve given us a surprise i guess we shall keep you pretty busy with our calls for music after this  she is a genius observed staniford at his first opportunity with dunham i knew there must be something the matter of course shes going out to school her voice and she hasnt strained it in idle babble about her own affairs i must say that lumiss bloods power of holding her tongue commands my homage was it her little coup to wait till we got into that hopeless hobble before she struck in  coup for shame staniford coup at such a time  well well i dont say so but for the theatre one cant begin practicing these effects too soon really that voice puts a new complexion on miss blood i have a theory to reconstruct i have been philosophizing her as a simple country girl i must begin on an operatic novice i liked the other better it gave value to the black silk as a singer shell wear silk as habitually as a cocoon she will have to take some stage name translate blood into italian we shall know her hereafter as la sanguinelli and when she comes to boston we shall make our modest brags about going out to europe with her i dont know i think i preferred the idyllic flavor i was beginning to find in the presence of the ordinary futureless young girl voyaging under the chaperonage of her own innocencethe little sister of the whole ship but this crepusculant prima donnano i dont like it though it explains some things these splendid creatures are never sent half equipped into the world i fancy that where theres an operatic voice theres an operatic soul to go with it well la sanguinelli will wear me out yet suggest some new topic dunham talk of something else for heavens sake  do you suppose asked dunham that she would like to help get up some musicales to pass away the time  oh do you call that talking of something else what an insatiate organizer you are you organize shuffleboard you organize public worship you want to organize musicales she would have to do all your music for you  i think she would like to go in for it said dunham it must be a pleasure to exercise such a gift as that and now that its come out in the way it has it would be rather awkward for us not to recognize it  staniford refused pointblank to be a party to the new enterprise and left dunham to his own devices at dinner where he proposed the matter  if you had my persis here now observed captain jenness with her parlor organ you could get along  i wish miss jenness was here said dunham politely but we must try to get on as it is with miss bloods voice to start with nothing ought to discourage us dunham had a thin and gentle pipe of his own and a fairish style in singing but with his natural modesty he would not offer himself as a performer except in default of all others dont you sing mr hicks  anything to oblige a friend returned hicks but i dont sing before miss blood  miss blood said staniford listening in ironic safety you overawe us all i never did sing but i think i should want to make an effort if you were not by  but dont youdont you play something anything persisted dunham in desperate appeal to hicks  well yes the latter admitted i play the flute a little  flutes on water said staniford hicks looked at him in sulky dislike but as if resolved not to be put down by him  and have you got your flute with you demanded dunham joyously  yes i have replied hicks  then we are all right i think i can carry a part and if you will play to miss bloods singing  try it this evening if you like said the other  well ahi dont know perhapswe hadnt better begin this evening  staniford laughed at dunhams embarrassment you might have a sacred concert and mr hicks could represent the shawms and cymbals with his flute  dunham looked sorry for stanifords saying this captain jenness stared at him as if his taking the names of these scriptural instruments in vain were a kind of blasphemy and lydia seemed puzzled and a little troubled  i didnt think of its being sunday said hicks with what staniford felt to be a cunning assumption of manly frankness or any more sunday than usual seems as if we had had a month of sundays already since we sailed im not much on religion myself but i shouldnt like to interfere with other peoples principles  staniford was vexed with himself for his scornful pleasantry and vexed with the others for taking it so seriously and heavily and putting him so unnecessarily in the wrong he was angry with dunham and he said to hicks very just sentiments  i am glad you like them replied hicks with sullen apprehension of the offensive tone  staniford turned to lydia i suppose that in south bradfield your sabbath is over at sundown on sunday evening  that used to be the custom answered the girl ive heard my grandfather tell of it  oh yes interposed captain jenness they used to keep saturday night down our way too i can remember when i was a boy it came pretty hard to begin so soon but it seemed to kind of break it after all having a night in  the captain did not know what staniford began to laugh at our puritan ancestors knew just how much human nature could stand after all we did not have an uninterrupted sabbath till the sabbath had become much milder is that it  the captain had probably no very clear notion of what this meant but simply felt it to be a critical edge of some sort i dont know as you can have too much religion he remarked ive seen some pretty rough customers in the church but i always thought what would they be out of it  very true said staniford smiling he wanted to laugh again but he liked the captain too well to do that and then he began to rage in his heart at the general stupidity which had placed him in the attitude of mocking at religion a thing he would have loathed to do it seemed to him that dunham was answerable for his false position but we shall not see the right sort of sabbath till mr dunham gets his catholic church fully going he added  they all started and looked at dunham as good protestants must when some one whom they would never have suspected of catholicism turns out to be a catholic dunham cast a reproachful glance at his friend but said simply i am a catholicthat is true but i do not admit the pretensions of the bishop of rome  the rest of the company apparently could not follow him in making this distinction perhaps some of them did not quite know who the bishop of rome was lydia continued to look at him in fascination hicks seemed disposed to whistle if such a thing were allowable mr watterson devoutly waited for the captain well observed the captain at last with the air of giving the devil his due ive seen some very good people among the catholics  thats so captain jenness said the first officer  i dont see said lydia without relaxing her gaze why if you are a catholic you read the service of a protestant church  it is not a protestant church answered dunham gently as i have tried to explain to you  the episcopalian demanded captain jenness  the episcopalian sweetly reiterated dunham  i should like to know what kind of a church it is then said captain jenness triumphantly  an apostolic church  captain jenness rubbed his nose as if this were a new kind of church to him  founded by saint henry viii himself interjected staniford  no staniford said dunham with a soft repressiveness and now a threatening light of zeal began to burn in his kindly eyes these souls had plainly been given into his hands for ecclesiastical enlightenment if our friends will allow me i will explain  stanifords shaft had recoiled upon his own head o lord he cried getting up from the table i cant stand that the others regarded him as he felt even to that weasel of a hicks as a sheep of uncommon blackness he went on deck and smoked a cigar without relief he still heard the girls voice in singing and he still felt in his nerves the quality of latent passion in it which had thrilled him when she sang his thought ran formlessly upon her future and upon what sort of being was already fated to waken her to those possibilities of intense suffering and joy which he imagined in her a wound at his heart received long before hurt vaguely and he felt old     xi   no one said anything more of the musicales and the afternoon and evening wore away without general talk each seemed willing to keep apart from the rest dunham suffered lydia to come on deck alone after tea and staniford found her there in her usual place when he went up some time later he approached her at once and said smiling down into her face to which the moonlight gave a pale mystery miss blood did you think i was very wicked today at dinner  lydia looked away and waited a moment before she spoke i dont know she said then impulsively did you she asked  no honestly i dont think i was answered staniford but i seemed to leave that impression on the company i felt a little nasty that was all and i tried to hurt mr dunhams feelings but i shall make it right with him before i sleep he knows that hes used to having me repent at leisure do you ever walk sunday night  yes sometimes said lydia interrogatively  im glad of that then i shall not offend against your scruples if i ask you to join me in a little ramble and you will refuse from purely personal considerations will you walk with me  yes lydia rose  and will you take my arm asked staniford a little surprised at her readiness  thank you  she put her hand upon his arm confidently enough and they began to walk up and down the stretch of open deck together  well said staniford did mr dunham convince you all  i think he talks beautifully about it replied lydia with quaint stiffness  i am glad you see what a very good fellow he is i have a real affection for dunham  oh yes hes good at first it surprised me i mean  no no staniford quickly interrupted why did it surprise you to find dunham good  i dont know you dont expect a person to be serious who is soso  handsome  nosoi dont know just how to say it fashionable  staniford laughed why miss blood youre fashionably dressed yourself not to go any farther and youre serious  its different with a man the girl explained  well then how about me asked staniford am i too well dressed to be expected to be serious  mr dunham always seems in earnest lydia answered evasively  and you think one cant be in earnest without being serious lydia suffered one of those silences to ensue in which staniford had already found himself helpless he knew that he should be forced to break it and he said with a little spiteful mocking i suppose the young men of south bradfield are both serious and earnest  how asked lydia  the young men of south bradfield  i told you that there were none they all go away  well then the young men of springfield of keene of greenfield  i cant tell i am not acquainted there  staniford had begun to have a disagreeable suspicion that her ready consent to walk up and down with a young man in the moonlight might have come from a habit of the kind but it appeared that her fearlessness was like that of wild birds in those desert islands where man has never come the discovery gave him pleasure out of proportion to its importance and he paced back and forth in a silence that no longer chafed lydia walked very well and kept his step with rhythmic unison as if they were walking to music together thats the time in her pulses he thought and then he said then you dont have a great deal of social excitement i supposedancing and that kind of thing though perhaps you dont approve of dancing  oh yes i like it sometimes the summer boarders get up little dances at the hotel  oh the summer boarders staniford had overlooked them the young men get them up and invite the ladies he pursued  there are no young men generally among the summer boarders the ladies dance together most of the gentlemen are old or else invalids  oh said staniford  at the mill village where ive taught two winters they have dances sometimesthe mill hands do  and do you go  no they are nearly all french canadians and irish people  then you like dancing because there are no gentlemen to dance with  there are gentlemen at the picnics  the picnics  the teachers picnics they have them every summer in a grove by the pond  there was then a highbrowed dyspeptic highschool principal and the desertisland theory was probably all wrong it vexed staniford when he had so nearly got the compass of her social life to find this unexplored corner in it  and i suppose you are leaving very agreeable friends among the teachers  some of them are pleasant but i dont know them very well ive only been to one of the picnics  staniford drew a long silent breath after all he knew everything he mechanically dropped a little the arm on which her hand rested that it might slip farther within her timid remoteness had its charm and he fell to thinking with amusement how she who was so subordinate to him was in the dimly known sphere in which he had been groping to find her probably a person of authority and consequence it satisfied a certain domineering quality in him to have reduced her to this humble attitude while it increased the protecting tenderness he was beginning to have for her his mind went off further upon this matter of ones different attitudes toward different persons he thought of men and women too before whom he should instantly feel like a boy if he could be confronted with them even in his present lordliness of mood in a fashion of his when he convicted himself of anything he laughed aloud lydia shrank a little from him in question i beg your pardon he said i was laughing at something i happened to think of do you ever find yourself struggling very hard to be what you think people think you are  oh yes replied lydia but i thought no one else did  everybody does the thing that we think no one else does said staniford sententiously  i dont know whether i quite like it said lydia it seems like hypocrisy it used to worry me sometimes i wondered if i had any real self i seemed to be just what people made me and a different person to each  im glad to hear it miss blood we are companions in hypocrisy as we are such nonentities we shall not affect each other at all lydia laughed dont you think so what are you laughing at i told you what i was laughing at  but i didnt ask you  you wished to know  yes i did  then you ought to tell me what i wish to know  its nothing said lydia i thought you were mistaken in what you said  oh then you believe that theres enough of you to affect me  no  the other way then  she did not answer  im delighted exclaimed staniford i hope i dont exert an uncomfortable influence i should be very unhappy to think so lydia stooped sidewise away from him to get a fresh hold of her skirt which she was carrying in her right hand and she hung a little more heavily upon his arm i hope i make you think better of yourself very selfsatisfied very conceited even  no said lydia  you pique my curiosity beyond endurance tell me how i make you feel  she looked quickly round at him as if to see whether he was in earnest why its nothing she said you made me feel as if you were laughing at everybody  it flatters a man to be accused of sarcasm by the other sex and staniford was not superior to the soft pleasure of the reproach do you think i make other people feel so too  mr dunham said  oh mr dunham has been talking me over with you has he what did he tell you of me there is nobody like a true friend for dealing an underhand blow at ones reputation wait till you hear my account of dunham what did he say  he said that was only your way of laughing at yourself  the traitor what did you say  i dont know that i said anything  you were reserving your opinion for my own hearing  no  why dont you tell me what you thought it might be of great use to me im in earnest now im serious will you tell me  yes some time said lydia who was both amused and mystified at this persistence  when tomorrow  oh thats too soon when i get to venice  ah thats a subterfuge you know we shall part in trieste  i thought said lydia you were coming to venice too  oh yes but i shouldnt be able to see you there  why not  why not why because he was near telling the young girl who hung upon his arm and walked up and down with him in the moonlight that in the wicked old world towards which they were sailing young people could not meet save in the sight and hearing of their elders and that a confidential analysis of character would be impossible between them there the wonder of her being where she was as she was returned upon him with a freshness that it had been losing in the custom of the week past because you will be so much taken up with your friends he said lamely he added quickly theres one thing i should like to know miss blood did you hear what mr dunham and i were saying last night when we stood in the gangway and kept you from coming up  lydia waited a moment then she said yes i couldnt help hearing it  thats all right i dont care for your hearing what i said but i hope it wasnt true  i couldnt understand what you meant by it she answered evasively but rather faintly  thanks said staniford i didnt mean anything it was merely the guilty consciousness of a generally disagreeable person they walked up and down many turns without saying anything she could not have made any direct protest and it pleased him that she could not frame any flourishing generalities yes staniford resumed i will try to see you as i pass through venice and i will come to hear you sing when you come out at milan  come out at milan  why yes you are going to study at the conservatory in milan  how did you know that demanded lydia  from hearing you today may i tell you how much i liked your singing  my aunt thought i ought to cultivate my voice but i would never go upon the stage i would rather sing in a church i should like that better than teaching  i think youre quite right said staniford gravely its certainly much better to sing in a church than to sing in a theatre though i believe the theatre pays best  oh i dont care for that all i should want would be to make a living  the reference to her poverty touched him it was a confidence coming from one so reticent that was of value he waited a moment and said its surprising how well we keep our footing here isnt it theres hardly any swell but the ship pitches i think we walk better together than alone  yes answered lydia i think we do  you mustnt let me tire you im indefatigable  oh im not tired i like itwalking  do you walk much at home  not much its a pretty good walk to the schoolhouse  oh then you like walking at sea better than you do on shore  it isnt the custom much if there were any one else i should have liked it there but its rather dull going by yourself  yes i understand how that is said staniford dropping his teasing tone its stupid and i suppose its pretty lonesome at south bradfield every way  it iswinters admitted lydia in the summer you see people at any rate but in winter there are days and days when hardly any one passes the snow is banked up everywhere  he felt her give an involuntary shiver and he began to talk to her about the climate to which she was going it was all stranger to her than he could have realized and less intelligible she remembered california very dimly and she had no experience by which she could compare and adjust his facts he made her walk up and down more and more swiftly as he lost himself in the comfort of his own talking and of her listening and he failed to note the little falterings with which she expressed her weariness  all at once he halted and said why youre out of breath i beg your pardon you should have stopped me let us sit down he wished to walk across the deck to where the seats were but she just perceptibly withstood his motion and he forbore  i think i wont sit down she said i will go downstairs she began withdrawing her hand from his arm he put his right hand upon hers and when it came out of his arm it remained in his hand  im afraid you wont walk with me again said staniford ive tired you shamefully  oh not at all  and you will  yes  thanks youre very amiable he still held her hand he pressed it the pressure was not returned but her hand seemed to quiver and throb in his like a bird held there for the time neither of them spoke and it seemed a long time staniford found himself carrying her hand towards his lips and she was helplessly trustingly letting him  he dropped her hand and said abruptly goodnight  goodnight she answered and ceased from his side like a ghost     xii   staniford sat in the moonlight and tried to think what the steps were that had brought him to this point but there were no steps of which he was sensible he remembered thinking the night before that the conditions were those of flirtation tonight this had not occurred to him the talk had been of the dullest commonplaces yet he had pressed her hand and kept it in his and had been about to kiss it he bitterly considered the disparity between his present attitude and the stand he had taken when he declared to dunham that it rested with them to guard her peculiar isolation from anything that she could remember with pain or humiliation when she grew wiser in the world he recalled his rage with hicks and the insulting condemnation of his bearing towards him ever since and could hicks have done worse he had done better he had kept away from her he had let her alone  that night staniford slept badly and woke with a restless longing to see the girl and to read in her face whatever her thought of him had been but lydia did not come out to breakfast thomas reported that she had a headache and that he had already carried her the tea and toast she wanted well it seems kind of lonesome without her said the captain it dont seem as if we could get along  it seemed desolate to staniford who let the talk flag and fail round him without an effort to rescue it all the morning he lurked about keeping out of dunhams way and fighting hard through a dozen pages of a book to which he struggled to nail his wandering mind a headache was a little matter but it might be even less than a headache he belated himself purposely at dinner and entered the cabin just as lydia issued from her stateroom door  she was pale and looked heavyeyed as she lifted her glance to him she blushed and he felt the answering red stain his face when she sat down the captain patted her on the shoulder with his burly right hand and said he could not navigate the ship if she got sick he pressed her to eat of this and that and when she would not he said well there was no use trying to force an appetite and that she would be better all the sooner for dieting hicks went to his stateroom and came out with a box of guava jelly from his private stores and won a triumph enviable in all eyes when lydia consented to like it with the chicken dunham plundered his own and stanifords common stock of dainties for her dessert the first officer agreed and applauded right and left staniford alone sat taciturn and inoperative watching her face furtively once her eyes wandered to the side of the table where he and dunham sat then she colored and dropped her glance  he took his book again after dinner and with his finger between the leaves at the lastread unintelligible page he went out to the bow and crouched down there to renew the conflict of the morning it was not long before dunham followed he stooped over to lay a hand on either of stanifords shoulders  what makes you avoid me old man he demanded looking into stanifords face with his frank kind eyes  and i avoid you asked staniford  yes why  because i feel rather shabby i suppose i knew i felt shabby but i didnt know i was avoiding you  well no matter if you feel shabby its all right but i hate to have you feel shabby he got his left hand down into stanifords right and a tacit reconciliation was transacted between them dunham looked about for a seat and found a stool which he planted in front of staniford wasnt it pleasant to have our little lady back at table again  very said staniford  i couldnt help thinking how droll it was that a person whom we all considered a sort of incumbrance and superfluity at first should really turn out an object of prime importance to us all isnt it amusing  very droll  why we were quite lost without her at breakfast i couldnt have imagined her taking such a hold upon us all in so short a time but shes a pretty creature and as good as shes pretty  i remember agreeing with you on those points before staniford feigned to suppress fatigue  dunham observed him i know you dont take so much interest in her asas the rest of us do and i wish you did you dont know what a lovely nature she is  no  no and im sure youd like her  is it important that i should like her dont let your enthusiasm for the sex carry you beyond bounds dunham  no no not important but very pleasant and i think acquaintance with such a girl would give you some new ideas of women  oh my old ones are good enough look here dunham said staniford sharply what are you after  what makes you think im after anything  because youre not a humbug and because i am my depraved spirit instantly recognized the dawning duplicity of yours but youd better be honest you cant make the other thing work what do you want  i want your advice i want your help staniford  i thought so coming and forgiving me in thatapostolic manner  dont  well what do you want my help for what have you been doing staniford paused and suddenly added have you been making love to lurella he said this in his ironical manner but his smile was rather ghastly  for shame staniford cried dunham but he reddened violently  then it isnt with miss hibbard that you want my help im glad of that it would have been awkward im a little afraid of miss hibbard it isnt every one has your courage my dear fellow  i havent been making love to her said dunham buti  but you what demanded staniford sharply again there had been less tension of voice in his joking about miss hibbard  staniford said his friend i dont know whether you noticed her at dinner when she looked across to our own side  what did she do  did you notice that shewell that she blushed a little  staniford waited a while before he answered after a gulp yes i noticed that  well i dont know how to put it exactly but im afraid that i have unwittingly wronged this young girl  wronged her what the devil do you mean dunham cried staniford with bitter impatience  im afraidim afraidwhy its simply this that in trying to amuse her and make the time pass agreeably and relieve her mind and all that dont you know ive given her the impression that im wellinterested in her and that she may have allowed herself insensibly you knowto look upon me in that light and that she may have begun to thinkthat she may have become  interested in you interrupted staniford rudely  wellahwell that isahwellyes cried dunham bracing himself to sustain a shout of ridicule but staniford did not laugh and dunham had courage to go on of course it sounds rather conceited to say so but the circumstances are so peculiar that i think we ought to recognize even any possibilities of that sort  oh yes said staniford gravely most women i believe are so innocent as to think a man in love when he behaves like a lover and this one he added ruefully seems more than commonly ignorant of our waysof our infernal shillyshallying purposeless nomindedness she couldnt imagine a mana gentlemandevoting himself to her by the hour and trying by every art to show his interest and pleasure in her society without imagining that he wished her to like himlove him theres no halfway about it she couldnt suppose him the shallow dawdling soulless senseless ape he really was staniford was quite in a heat by this time and dunham listened in open astonishment  you are hard upon me he said of course i have been to blame i know that i acknowledge it but my motive as you know well enough was never to amuse myself with her but to contribute in any way i could to her enjoyment and happiness i  you cried staniford what are you talking about  what are you talking about demanded dunham in his turn  staniford recollected himself i was speaking of abstract flirtation i was firing into the air  in my case i dont choose to call it flirtation returned dunham my purpose i am bound to say was thoroughly unselfish and kindly  my dear fellow said staniford with a bitter smile there can be no unselfishness and no kindliness between us and young girls unless we mean businesslovemaking you may be sure that they feel it so if they dont understand it so  i dont agree with you i dont believe it my own experience is that the sweetest and most generous friendships may exist between us without a thought of anything else and as to making love i must beg you to remember that my love has been made once for all i never dreamt of showing miss blood anything but polite attention  then what are you troubled about  i am troubled dunham stopped helplessly and staniford laughed in a challenging disagreeable way so that the former perforce resumed  im troubled aboutabout her possible misinterpretation  oh then in this case of sweet and generous friendship the party of the second part may have construed the sentiment quite differently well what do you want me to do do you want me to take the contract off your hands  you put it grossly said dunham  and you put it offensively cried the other my regard for the young lady is as reverent as yours you have no right to miscolor my words  staniford you are too bad said dunham hurt even more than angered if ive come to you in the wrong momentif you are vexed at anything ill go away and beg your pardon for boring you  staniford was touched he looked cordially into his friends face i was vexed at something but you never can come to me at the wrong moment old fellow i beg your pardon i see your difficulty plainly enough and i think youre quite right in proposing to hold upfor thats what you mean i take it  yes said dunham it is and i dont know how she will like it she will be puzzled and grieved by it i hadnt thought seriously about the matter till this morning when she didnt come to breakfast you know ive been in the habit of asking her to walk with me every night after tea but saturday evening you were with her and last night i felt sore about the affairs of the day and rather dull and i didnt ask her i think she noticed it i think she was hurt  you think so said staniford peculiarly  i might not have thought so continued dunham merely because she did not come to breakfast but her blushing when she looked across at dinner really made me uneasy  very possibly youre right staniford mused a while before he spoke again well what do you wish me to do  i must hold up as you say and of course she will feel the difference i wishi wish at least you wouldnt avoid her staniford thats all any little attention from youi know it bores youwould not only break the loneliness but it would explain thatthat myattentions didntahhadnt meant anything  oh  yes that its common to offer them and shes a girl of so much force of character that when she sees the affair in its true lighti suppose im to blame yes i ought to have told her at the beginning that i was engaged but you cant force a fact of that sort upon a new acquaintance it looks silly dunham hung his head in selfreproach  well asked staniford  well thats all no it isnt all either theres something else troubles me our poor little friend is a blackguard i suppose  hicks  yes  you have invited him to be the leader of your orchestra havent you  oh dont staniford cried dunham in his helplessness i should hate to see her dependent in any degree upon that little cad for society cad was the last english word which dunham had got himself used to that was why i hoped that you wouldnt altogether neglect her shes here and shes no choice but to remain we cant leave her to herself without the danger of leaving her to hicks you see  well said staniford gloomily im not sure that you couldnt leave her to a worse cad than hicks dunham looked up in question to me for example  oh hallo cried dunham  i dont see how im to be of any use continued the other im not a squire of dames i should merely make a mess of it  youre mistaken stanifordim sure you arein supposing that she dislikes you urged his friend  oh very likely  i know that shes simply afraid of you  dont flatter dunham why should i care whether she fears me or affects me no my dear fellow this is irretrievably your own affair i should be glad to help you out if i knew how but i dont in the mean time your duty is plain whatever happens you cant overdo the sweet and the generous in this wicked world without paying the penalty  staniford smiled at the distress in which dunham went his way he understood very well that it was not vanity but the liveliness of a sensitive conscience that had made dunham search his conduct for the offense against the young girls peace of heart which he believed he had committed and it was the more amusing because he was so guiltless of harm staniford knew who was to blame for the headache and the blush he knew that dunham had never gone so far that his chivalrous pleasure in her society might continue for years free from flirtation but in spite of this conviction a little poignant doubt made itself felt and suddenly became his whole consciousness confound him he mused i wonder if she really could care anything for him he shut his book and rose to his feet with such a burning in his heart that he could not have believed himself capable of the greater rage he felt at what he just then saw it was lydia and hicks seated together in the place where he had sat with her she leaned with one arm upon the rail in an attitude that brought all her slim young grace into evidence she seemed on very good terms with him and he was talking and making her laugh as staniford had never heard her laugh beforeso freely so heartily     xiii   the atoms that had been tending in stanifords being toward a certain form suddenly arrested and shaped themselves anew at the vibration imparted by this laughter he no longer felt himself hickss possible inferior but vastly better in every way and out of the turmoil of his feelings in regard to lydia was evolved the distinct sense of having been trifled with somehow an advantage had been taken of his sympathies and purposes and his forbearance had been treated with contempt  the conviction was neither increased nor diminished by the events of the evening when lydia brought out some music from her stateroom and hicks appeared flute in hand from his and they began practicing one of the pieces together it was a pretty enough sight hicks had been gradually growing a betterlooking fellow he had an undeniable picturesqueness as he bowed his head over the music towards hers and she as she held the sheet with one hand for him to see while she noiselessly accompanied herself on the table with the fingers of the other and tentatively sang now this passage and now that was divine the picture seemed pleasing to neither staniford nor dunham they went on deck together and sat down to their cigarettes in their wonted place they did not talk of lydia or of any of the things that had formed the basis of their conversation hitherto but staniford returned to his colorado scheme and explained at length the nature of his purposes and expectations he had discussed these matters before but he had never gone into them so fully nor with such cheerful earnestness he said he should never marryhe had made up his mind to that but he hoped to make money enough to take care of his sisters boy jim handsomely as the little chap had been named for him he had been thinking the matter over and he believed that he should get back by rail and steamer as soon as he could after they reached trieste he was not sorry he had come but he could not afford to throw away too much time on italy just then  dunham on his part talked a great deal of miss hibbard and of some curious psychological characteristics of her dyspepsia he asked staniford whether he had ever shown him the photograph of miss hibbard taken by sarony when she was on to new york the last time it was a threequarters view and dunham thought it the best she had had done he spoke of her generous qualities and of the interest she had always had in the diet kitchen to which as an invalid her attention had been particularly directed and he said that in her last letter she had mentioned a project for establishing diet kitchens in europe on the boston plan when their talk grew more impersonal and took a wider range they gathered suggestion from the situation and remarked upon the immense solitude of the sea they agreed that there was something weird in the long continuance of fine weather and that the moon had a strange look they spoke of the uncertainty of life dunham regretted as he had often regretted before that his friend had no fixed religious belief and staniford gently accepted his solicitude and said that he had at least a conviction if not a creed he then begged dunhams pardon in set terms for trying to wound his feelings the day before and in the silent handclasp that followed they renewed all the cordiality of their friendship from time to time as they talked the music from below came up fitfully and once they had to pause as lydia sang through the song that she and hicks were practicing  as the days passed their common interest in the art brought hicks and the young girl almost constantly together and the sound of their concerting often filled the ship the musicales less formal than dunham had intended and perhaps for that reason a source of rapidly diminishing interest with him superseded both ringtoss and shuffle board and seemed even more acceptable to the ships company as an entertainment one evening when the performers had been giving a piece of rather more than usual excellence and difficulty one of the sailors deputed by his mates came aft with many clumsy shows of deference and asked them to give marching through georgia hicks found this out of his repertory but lydia sang it then the group at the forecastle shouted with one voice for tramp tramp tramp the boys are marching and so beguiled her through the whole list of warsongs she ended with one unknown to her listeners but better than all the rest in its pathetic words and music and when she had sung the flags come back to tennessee the spokesman of the sailors came aft again to thank her for his mates and to say they would not spoil that last song by asking for anything else it was a charming little triumph for her as she sat surrounded by her usual court the captain was there to countenance the freedom the sailors had taken and dunham and staniford stood near but hicks at her right hand held the place of honor  the next night staniford found her alone in the waist of the ship and drew up a stool beside the rail where she sat  we all enjoyed your singing so much last night miss blood i think mr hicks plays charmingly but i believe i prefer to hear your voice alone  thank you said lydia looking down demurely  it must be a great satisfaction to feel that you can give so much pleasure  i dont know she said passing the palm of one hand over the back of the other  when you are a prima donna you mustnt forget your old friends of the aroostook we shall all take vast pride in you  it was not a question and lydia answered nothing staniford who had rather obliged himself to this advance with some dim purpose of showing that nothing had occurred to alienate them since the evening of their promenade without having proved to himself that it was necessary to do this felt that he was growing angry it irritated him to have her sit as unmoved after his words as if he had not spoken  miss blood he said i envy you your gift of snubbing people  lydia looked at him snubbing people she echoed  yes your power of remaining silent when you wish to put down some one who has been wittingly or unwittingly impertinent  i dont know what you mean she said in a sort of breathless way  and you didnt intend to mark your displeasure at my planning your future  no we had talked of that i  and you were not vexed with me for anything i have been afraid that ithat you staniford found that he was himself getting short of breath he had begun with the intention of mystifying her but matters had suddenly taken another course and he was really anxious to know whether any disagreeable associations with that night lingered in her mind with this longing came a natural inability to find the right word i was afraid he repeated and then he stopped again clearly he could not tell her that he was afraid he had gone too far but this was what he meant you dont walk with me any more miss blood he concluded with an air of burlesque reproach  you havent asked mesince she said  he felt a singular value and significance in this word since it showed that her thoughts had been running parallel with his own it permitted if it did not signify that he should resume the mood of that time where their parting had interrupted it he enjoyed the fact to the utmost but he was not sure that he wished to do what he was permitted then i didnt tire you he merely asked he was not sure now he came to think of it that he liked her willingness to recur to that time he liked it but not quite in the way he would have liked to like it  no she said  the fact is he went on aimlessly that i thought i had rather abused your kindness besides he added veering off i was afraid i should be an interruption to the musical exercises  oh no said lydia mr dunham hasnt arranged anything yet staniford thought this uncandid it was fighting shy of hicks who was the person in his own mind and it reawakened a suspicion which was lurking there mr dunham seems to have lost his interest  this struck staniford as an expression of pique it reawakened quite another suspicion it was evident that she was hurt at the cessation of dunhams attentions he was greatly minded to say that dunham was a fool but he ended by saying with sarcasm i suppose he saw that he was superseded  mr hicks plays well said lydia judicially but he doesnt really know so much of music as mr dunham  no responded staniford with irony i will tell dunham no doubt hes been suffering the pangs of professional jealousy that must be the reason why he keeps away  keeps away asked lydia  now ive made an ass of myself thought staniford you said that he seemed to have lost his interest he answered her  oh yes assented lydia and then she remained rather distraught pulling at the ruffling of her dress  dunham is a very accomplished man said staniford finding the usual satisfaction in pressing his breast against the thorn hes a great favorite in society hes up to no end of things staniford uttered these praises in a curiously bitter tone hes a capital talker dont you think he talks well  i dont know i suppose i havent seen enough people to be a good judge  well youve seen enough people to know that hes very good looking  yes  you dont mean to say you dont think him good looking  nooh no i meanthat isi dont know anything about his looks but he resembles a lady who used to come from boston summers i thought he must be her brother  oh then you think he looks effeminate cried staniford with inner joy i assure you he added with solemnity dunham is one of the manliest fellows in the world  yes said lydia  staniford rose he was smiling gayly as he looked over the broad stretch of empty deck and down into lydias eyes wouldnt you like to take a turn now  yes she said promptly rising and arranging her wrap across her shoulders so as to leave her hands free she laid one hand in his arm and gathered her skirt with the other and they swept round together for the start and confronted hicks  oh cried lydia with what seemed dismay i promised mr hicks to practice a song with him she did not try to release her hand from stanifords arm but was letting it linger there irresolutely  staniford dropped his arm and let her hand fall he bowed with icy stiffness and said with a courtesy so fierce that mr hicks on whom he glared as he spoke quailed before it i yield to your prior engagement     xiv   it was nothing to staniford that she should have promised hicks to practice a song with him and no process of reasoning could have made it otherwise the imaginary opponent with whom he scornfully argued the matter had not a word for himself neither could the young girl answer anything to the cutting speeches which he mentally made her as he sat alone chewing the end of his cigar and he was not moved by the imploring looks which his fancy painted in her face when he made believe that she had meekly returned to offer him some sort of reparation why should she excuse herself he asked it was he who ought to excuse himself for having been in the way the dialogue went on at length with every advantage to the inventor  he was finally aware of some one standing near and looking down at him it was the second mate who supported himself in a conversational posture by the hand which he stretched to the shrouds above their heads are you a good sailor mr staniford he inquired he and staniford were friends in their way and had talked together before this  do you mean seasickness why staniford looked up at the mates face  well were going to get it i guess before long we shall soon be off the spanish coast weve had a great run so far  if it comes we must stand it but i make it a rule never to be seasick beforehand  well i aint one to borrow trouble either it dont run in the family most of us like to chance things i chanced it for the whole war and i come out all right sometimes it dont work so well  ah said staniford who knew that this was a leading remark but forbore as he knew mason wished to follow it up directly  one of us chanced it once too often and of course it was a woman  the risk  not the risk my oldest sister tried tamin a tiger ninetynine times out of a hundred a tiger wont tame worth a cent but her pet was such a lamb most the while that she guessed shed chance it it didnt work shes at home with mother nowthree children of courseand hes in hell i spose he was killed longside o me at gettysburg ike was a good fellow when he was sober but my souls the life he led that poor girl yes when a mans got that tiger in him there ought to be some quiet little war round for puttin him out of his misery staniford listened silently waiting for the mate to make the application of his grim allegory i spose im prejudiced but i do hate a drunkard and when i see one of em makin up to a girl i want to go to her and tell her shed better take a real tiger out the show at once  the idea which these words suggested sent a thrill to stanifords heart but he continued silent and the mate went on with the queer smile which could be inferred rather than seen working under his mustache and the humorous twinkle of his eyes evanescently evident under his cap peak  i dont go round criticisn my superior officers and i dont say anything about the responsibility the old man took the old mans all right accordin to his lights he aint had a tiger in the family but if that chap was to fall overboardwell i dont know how long it would take to lower a boat if i was to listen to my conscience there aint really any help for him hes begun too young ever to get over it he wont be ashore at tryeast an hour before hes drunk if our men had any spirits amongst em that could be begged bought or borrowed hed be drunk now right along well im off watch said the mate at the tap of bells guess well get our little gale pretty soon  goodnight said staniford who remained pondering he presently rose and walked up and down the deck he could hear lydia and hicks trying that song now the voice and now the flute then both together and presently a burst of laughter he began to be angry with her ignorance and inexperience it became intolerable to him that a woman should be going about with no more knowledge of the world than a child and entangling herself in relations with all sorts of people it was shocking to think of that little sot who had now made his infirmity known for all the ships company admitted to association with her which looked to common eyes like courtship from the mates insinuation that she ought to be warned it was evident that they thought her interested in hicks and the mate had come like dunham to leave the responsibility with staniford it only wanted now that captain jenness should appear with his appeal direct or indirect  while staniford walked up and down and scorned and raged at the idea that he had anything to do with the matter the singing and fluting came to a pause in the cabin and at the end of the next tune which brought him to the head of the gangway stairs he met lydia emerging he stopped and spoke to her having instantly resolved at sight of her not to do so  have you come up for breath like a mermaid he asked not that im sure mermaids do  oh no said lydia i think i dropped my handkerchief where we were sitting  staniford suspected with a sudden return to a theory of her which he had already entertained that she had not done so but she went lightly by him where he stood stolid and picked it up and now he suspected that she had dropped it there on purpose  you have come back to walk with me  no said the girl indignantly i have not come back to walk with you she waited a moment then she burst out with how dare you say such a thing to me what right have you to speak to me so what have i done to make you think that i would come back to  the fierce vibration in her voice made him know that her eyes were burning upon him and her lips trembling he shrank before her passion as a man must before the justly provoked wrath of a woman or even of a small girl  i stated a hope not a fact he said in meek uncandor dont you think you ought to have done so  i donti dont understand you panted lydia confusedly arresting her bolts in midcourse  staniford pursued his guilty advantage it was his only chance i gave way to mr hicks when you had an engagement with me i thought you would come back to keep your engagement he was still very meek  excuse me she said with selfreproach that would have melted the heart of any one but a man who was in the wrong and was trying to get out of it at all hazards i didnt know what you meanti  if i had meant what you thought interrupted staniford nobly for he could now afford to be generous i should have deserved much more than you said but i hope you wont punish my awkwardness by refusing to walk with me  he knew that she regarded him earnestly before she said i must get my shawl and hat  let me go he entreated  you couldnt find them she answered as she vanished past him she returned and promptly laid her hand in his proffered arm it was as if she were eager to make him amends for her harshness  staniford took her hand out and held it while he bowed low toward her i declare myself satisfied  i dont understand said lydia in alarm and mortification  when a subject has been personally aggrieved by his sovereign his honor is restored if they merely cross swords  the girl laughed her delight in the extravagance she must have been more or less than woman not to have found his flattery delicious but we are republicans she said in evasion  to be sure we are republicans well then miss blood answer your free and equal one thing is it a case of conscience  how she asked and staniford did not recoil at the rusticity this how for what and the interrogative yes still remained since their first walk she had not wanted to know in however great surprise she found herself  are you going to walk with me because you had promised  why of course faltered lydia  that isnt enough  not enough  not enough you must walk with me because you like to do so  lydia was silent  do you like to do so  i cant answer you she said releasing her hand from him  it was not fair to ask you what i wish to do is to restore the original status you have kept your engagement to walk with me and your conscience is clear now miss blood may i have your company for a little stroll over the deck of the aroostook he made her another very low bow  what must i say asked lydia joyously  that depends upon whether you consent if you consent you must say i shall be very glad  and if i dont  oh i cant put any such decision into words  lydia mused a moment i shall be very glad she said and put her hand again into the arm he offered  as happens after such a passage they were at first silent while they walked up and down  if this fine weather holds said staniford and you continue as obliging as you are tonight you can say when people ask you how you went to europe that you walked the greater part of the way shall you continue so obliging will you walk with me every fine night pursued staniford  do you think id better say so she asked with the joy still in her voice  oh i cant decide for you i merely formulate your decisions after you reach themif theyre favorable  well then what is this one  is it favorable  you said you would formulate it she laughed again and staniford started as one does when a nebulous association crystallizes into a distinctly remembered fact  what a curious laugh you have he said its like a nuns laugh once in france i lodged near the garden of a convent where the nuns kept a girls school and i used to hear them laugh you never happened to be a nun miss blood  no indeed cried lydia as if scandalized  oh i merely meant in some previous existence of course i didnt suppose there was a convent in south bradfield he felt that the girl did not quite like the little slight his irony cast upon south bradfield or rather upon her for never having been anywhere else he hastened to say im sure that in the life before this you were of the south somewhere  yes said lydia interested and pleased again as one must be in romantic talk about ones self why do you think so  he bent a little over toward her so as to look into the face she instinctively averted while she could not help glancing at him from the corner of her eye you have the color and the light of the south he said when you get to italy you will live in a perpetual mystification you will go about in a dream of some self of yours that was native there in other days you will find yourself retrospectively related to the olive faces and the dark eyes you meet you will recognize sisters and cousins in the patrician ladies when you see their portraits in the palaces where you used to live in such state  staniford spiced his flatteries with open burlesque the girl entered into his fantastic humor but if i was a nun she asked gayly  oh i forgot you were a nun there was a nun in venice once about two hundred years ago when you lived there and a young english lord who was passing through the town was taken to the convent to hear her sing for she was not only of an admirable beauty as he says but sang extremely well she sang to him through the grating of the convent and when she stopped he said die whensoever you will you need to change neither voice nor face to be an angel do you think do you dimly recollect anything that makes you thinkit might consider carefully the singing extremely well and he leant over again and looked up into her face which again she could not wholly withdraw  no no she said still in his mood  well you must allow it was a pretty speech  perhaps said lydia with sudden gravity in which there seemed to staniford a tender insinuation of reproach he was laughing at her  if he was he was properly punished he went on to rome and when he came back to venice the beautiful nun was dead he thought that his words seemed fatal do you suppose it would kill you now to be jested with  i dont think people like it generally  why miss blood you are intense  i dont know what you mean by that said lydia  you like to take things seriously you cant bear to think that people are not the least in earnest even when they least seem so  yes said the girl thoughtfully perhaps thats true should you like to be made fun of yourself  i shouldnt mind it i fancy though it would depend a great deal upon who made fun of me i suppose that women always laugh at menat their clumsiness their want of tact the fit of their clothes  i dont know i should not do that with any one i  you liked oh none of them do cried staniford  i was not going to say that faltered the girl  what were you going to say  she waited a moment yes i was going to say that she assented with a sigh of helpless veracity what makes you laugh she asked in distress  something i like im different from you i laugh at what i like i like your truthfulnessits charming  i didnt know that truth need be charming  it had better be in women if its to keep even with the other thing lydia seemed shocked she made a faint involuntary motion to withdraw her hand but he closed his arm upon it dont condemn me for thinking that fibbing is charming i shouldnt like it at all in you should you in me  i shouldnt in any one said lydia  then what is it you dislike in me he suddenly demanded  i didnt say that i disliked anything in you  but you have made fun of something in me  no no  then it wasnt the stirring of a guilty conscience when you asked me whether i should like to be made fun of i took it for granted youd been doing it  you are very suspicious  yes and what else  oh you like to know just what every one thinks and feels  go on cried staniford analyze me formulate me  thats all  all i come to  all i have to say  thats very little now ill begin on you you dont care what people think or feel  oh yes i do i care too much  do you care what i think  yes  then i think youre too unsuspicious  ought i to suspect somebody she asked lightly  oh thats the way with all your sex one asks you to be suspicious and you ask whom you shall suspect you can do nothing in the abstract i should like to be suspicious for you will you let me  oh yes if you like to be  thanks i shall be terribly vigilanta perfect dragon and you really invest me with authority  yes  thats charming staniford drew a long breath after a space of musing he said i thought i should be able to begin by attacking some one else but i must commence at home and denounce myself as quite unworthy of walking to and fro and talking nonsense to you you must beware of me miss blood  why asked the girl  i am very narrowminded and prejudiced and i have violent antipathies i shouldnt be able to do justice to any one i disliked  i think thats the trouble with all of us said lydia  oh but only in degree i should not allow if i could help it a man whom i thought shabby and coarse at heart the privilege of speaking to any one i valuedto my sister for instance it would shock me to find her have any taste in common with such a man or amused by him dont you understand  yes said lydia it seemed to him as if by some infinitely subtle and unconscious affinition she relaxed toward him as they walked this was incomparably sweet and charming to stanifordtoo sweet as recognition of his protecting friendship to be questioned as anything else he felt sure that she had taken his meaning and he rested content from further trouble in regard to what it would have been impossible to express her tacit confidence touched a kindred spring in him and he began to talk to her of himself not of his character or opinionsthey had already gone over thembut of his past life and his future their strangeness to her gave certain wellworn topics novelty and the familiar project of a pastoral career in the far west invested itself with a color of romance which it had not worn before she tried to remember at his urgence something about her childhood in california and she told him a great deal more about south bradfield she described its characters and customs and from no vantageground or standpoint but her native feeling of their oddity and what seemed her sympathy with him made him see them as one might whose life had not been passed among them then they began to compare their own traits and amused themselves to find how many they had in common staniford related a singular experience of his on a former voyage to europe when he dreamed of a collision and woke to hear a great trampling and uproar on deck which afterwards turned out to have been caused by their bare escape from running into an iceberg she said that she had had strange dreams too but mostly when she was a little girl once she had had a presentiment that troubled her but it did not come true they both said they did not believe in such things and agreed that it was only peoples love of mystery that kept them noticed he permitted himself to help her with his disengaged hand to draw her shawl closer about the shoulder that was away from him he gave the action a philosophical and impersonal character by saying immediately afterwards the sea is really the only mystery left us and that will never be explored they circumnavigate the whole globe here he put the gathered shawl into the fingers which she stretched through his arm to take it and she said oh thank youbut they dont describe the sea war and plague and famine submit to the ameliorations of sciencethe closely drawn shawl pressed her against his shoulder his mind wandered he hardly knew what he was sayingbut the one utterly inexorable calamitythe same now as when the first sail was spreadis a shipwreck  yes she said with a deep inspiration and now they walked back and forth in silence broken only by a casual word or desultory phrase once staniford had thought the conditions of these promenades perilously suggestive of lovemaking another time he had blamed himself for not thinking of this now he neither thought nor blamed himself for not thinking the fact justified itself as if it had been the one perfectly right and wise thing in a world where all else might be questioned  isnt it pretty late she asked at last  if youre tired well sit down he said  what time is it she persisted  must i look he pleaded they went to a lantern and he took out his watch and sprang the case open look he said i sacrifice myself on the altar of truth they bent their heads low together over the watch it was not easy to make out the time its nine oclock said staniford  it cant be it was half past when i came up answered lydia  one hands at twelve and the other at nine he said conclusively  oh then its a quarter to twelve she caught away her hand from his arm and fled to the gangway i didnt dream it was so late  the pleasure which her confession brought to his face faded at sight of hicks who was turning the last pages of a novel by the cabin lamp as he followed lydia in it was the book that staniford had given her  hullo said hicks with companionable ease looking up at her been having quite a tramp  she did not seem troubled by the familiarity of an address that incensed staniford almost to the point of taking hicks from his seat and tossing him to the other end of the cabin oh youve finished my book she said you must tell me how you like it tomorrow  i doubt it said hicks im going to be seasick tomorrow the captains been shaking his head over the barometer and powwowing with the first officer somethings up and i guess its a gale goodby i shant see you again for a week or so  he nodded jocosely to lydia and dropped his eyes again to his book ignoring stanifords presence the latter stood a moment breathing quick then he controlled himself and went into his room his coming roused dunham who looked up from his pillow what time is it he asked stupidly  twelve said staniford  had a pleasant walk  if you still think said staniford savagely that shes painfully interested in you you can make your mind easy she doesnt care for either of us  either of us echoed dunham he roused himself  oh go to sleep go to sleep cried staniford     xv   the foreboded storm did not come so soon as had been feared but the beautiful weather which had lasted so long was lost in a thickened sky and a sullen sea the weather had changed with staniford too the morning after the events last celebrated he did not respond to the glance which lydia gave him when they met and he hardened his heart to her surprise and shunned being alone with her he would not admit to himself any reason for his attitude and he could not have explained to her the mystery that at first visibly grieved her and then seemed merely to benumb her but the moment came when he ceased to take a certain cruel pleasure in it and he approached her one morning on deck where she stood holding fast to the railing where she usually sat and said as if there had been no interval of estrangement between them but still coldly we have had our last walk for the present miss blood i hope you will grieve a little for my loss  she turned on him a look that cut him to the heart with what he fancied its reproach and its wonder she did not reply at once and then she did not reply to his hinted question  mr staniford she began it was the second time he had heard her pronounce his name he distinctly remembered the first  well he said  i want to speak to you about lending that book to mr hicks i ought to have asked you first  oh no said staniford it was yours  you gave it to me she returned  well then it was yoursto keep to lend to throw away  and you didnt mind my lending it to him she pursued i  she stopped and staniford hesitated too then he said i didnt dislike your lending it i disliked his having it i will acknowledge that  she looked up at him as if she were going to speak but checked herself and glanced away the ship was plunging heavily and the livid waves were racing before the wind the horizon was lit with a yellow brightness in the quarter to which she turned and a pallid gleam defined her profile captain jenness was walking fretfully to and fro he glanced now at the yellow glare and now cast his eye aloft at the shortened sail while staniford stood questioning whether she meant to say anything more or whether having discharged her conscience of an imagined offense she had now reached one of her final precipitous silences captain jenness suddenly approached them and said to him i guess youd better go below with miss blood  the storm that followed had its hazards but stanifords consciousness was confined to its discomforts the day came and then the dark came and both in due course went and came again where he lay in his berth and whirled and swung and rose and sank as lonely as a planetary fragment tossing in space he heard the noises of the life without amidst the straining of the ship which was like the sharp sweep of a thundershower on the deck overhead there plunged at irregular intervals the wild trample of heavilybooted feet and now and then the voices of the crew answering the shouted orders made themselves hollowly audible in the cabin there was talking and sometimes even laughing sometimes he heard the click of knives and forks the sardonic rattle of crockery after the first insane feeling that somehow he must get ashore and escape from his torment he hardened himself to it through an immense contempt equally insane for the stupidity of the sea its insensate uproar its blind and ridiculous and cruel mischievousness except for this delirious scorn he was a surface of perfect passivity  dunham after a day of prostration had risen and had perhaps shortened his anguish by his resolution he had since taken up his quarters on a locker in the cabin he looked in now and then upon staniford with a cup of tea or a suggestion of something light to eat once he even dared to boast of the sublimity of the ocean staniford stared at him with eyes of lacklustre indifference and waited for him to be gone but he lingered to say you would laugh to see what a seabird our lady is she hasnt been sick a minute and hicks youll be glad to know is behaving himself very well really i dont think weve done the fellow justice i think youve overshadowed him and that hes needed your absence to show himself to advantage  staniford disdained any comment on this except a fierce humph and dismissed dunham by turning his face to the wall he refused to think of what he had said he lay still and suffered indefinitely and no longer waited for the end of the storm there had been times when he thought with acquiescence of going to the bottom as a probable conclusion now he did not expect anything at last one night he felt by inexpressibly minute degrees something that seemed surcease of his misery it might have been the end of all things for all he cared but as the lull deepened he slept without knowing what it was and when he woke in the morning he found the aroostook at anchor in smooth water  she was lying in the roads at gibraltar and before her towered the embattled rock he crawled on deck after a while the captain was going ashore and had asked such of his passengers as liked to go with him and see the place when staniford appeared dunham was loyally refusing to leave his friend till he was fairly on foot at sight of him they suspended their question long enough to welcome him back to animation with the patronage with which well people hail a convalescent lydia looked across the estrangement of the past days with a sort of inquiry and hicks chose to come forward and accept a cold touch of the hand from him staniford saw with languid observance that lydia was very fresh and bright she was already equipped for the expedition and could never have had any doubt in her mind as to going she had on a pretty walking dress which he had not seen before and a hat with the rim struck sharply upward behind and her masses of dense dull black hair pulled up and fastened somewhere on the top of her head her eyes shyly sparkled under the abrupt descent of the hatbrim over her forehead  his contemptuous rejection of the character of invalid prevailed with dunham and staniford walked to another part of the ship to cut short the talk about himself and saw them row away  well youve had a pretty tough time they say said the second mate lounging near him i dont see any fun in seasickness myself  its a ridiculous sort of misery said staniford  i hope we shant have anything worse on board when that chap gets back the old man thinks he can keep an eye on him the mate was looking after the boat  the captain says he hasnt any money staniford remarked carelessly the mate went away without saying anything more and staniford returned to the cabin where he beheld without abhorrence the preparations for his breakfast but he had not a great appetite in spite of his long fast he found himself rather lightheaded and came on deck again after a while and stretched himself in hickss steamer chair where lydia usually sat in it he fell into a dull despairing reverie in which he blamed himself for not having been more explicit with her he had merely expressed his dislike of hicks but expressed without reasons it was a groundless dislike which she had evidently not understood or had not cared to heed and since that night now so far away when he had spoken to her he had done everything he could to harden her against himself he had treated her with a stupid cruelty which a girl like her would resent to the last he had forced her to take refuge in the politeness of a man from whom he was trying to keep her  his heart paused when he saw the boat returning in the afternoon without hicks the others reported that they had separated before dinner and that they had not seen him since though captain jenness had spent an hour trying to look him up before starting back to the ship the captain wore a look of guilty responsibility mingled with intense exasperation the two combining in as much haggardness as his cheerful visage could express if hes here by six oclock he said grimly all well and good if not the aroostook sails any way  lydia crept timidly below staniford complexly raged to see that the anxiety about hicks had blighted the joy of the day for her  how the deuce could he get about without any money he demanded of dunham as soon as they were alone  dunham vainly struggled to look him in the eye staniford he faltered with much more culpability than some criminals would confess a murder i lent him five dollars  you lent him five dollars gasped staniford  yes replied dunham miserably he got me aside and asked me for it what could i do what would you have done yourself  staniford made no answer he walked some paces away and then returned to where dunham stood helpless hes lying about there deaddrunk somewhere i suppose by heaven i could almost wish he was he couldnt come back then at any rate  the time lagged along toward the moment appointed by the captain and the preparations for the ships departure were well advanced when a boat was seen putting out from shore with two rowers and rapidly approaching the aroostook in the stern as it drew nearer the familiar figure of hicks discovered itself in the act of waving a handkerchief he scrambled up the side of the ship in excellent spirits and gave dunham a detailed account of his adventures since they had parted as always happens with such scapegraces he seemed to have had a good time however he had spoiled the pleasure of the others at tea when lydia had gone away he clapped down a sovereign near dunhams plate  your five dollars he said  why how dunham began  how did i get on without it my dear boy i sold my watch a ships time is worth no more than a setting henseh captainand why take note of it besides i always like to pay my debts promptly theres nothing mean about me im not going ashore again without my pocketbook i can tell you he winked shamelessly at captain jenness if you hadnt been along dunham i couldnt have made a raise i suppose you wouldnt have lent me five dollars captain jenness  no i wouldnt said the captain bluntly  and i believe youd have sailed without me if i hadnt got back on time  i would said the captain as before  hicks threw back his head and laughed probably no human being had ever before made so free with captain jenness at his own table but the captain must have felt that this contumacy was part of the general risk which he had taken in taking hicks and he contented himself with maintaining a silence that would have appalled a less audacious spirit hickss gayety however was not to be quelled in that way  gibraltar wouldnt be a bad place to put up at for a while he said lots of good fellows among the officers they say and fun going all the while firstclass gunning in the cork woods at st roque if it hadnt been for the res angusta domiyou know what i mean captaini should have let you get along with your old dugout as the gentleman in the water said to noah his hilarity had something alarmingly knowing in it there was a wildness in the pleasure with which he bearded the captain like that of a man in his first cups yet he had not been drinking he played round the captains knowledge of the sanative destitution in which he was making the voyage with mocking recurrence but he took himself off to bed early and the captain came through his trials with unimpaired temper dunham disappeared not long afterwards and stanifords vague hope that lydia might be going on deck to watch the lights of the town die out behind the ship as they sailed away was disappointed the second mate made a point of lounging near him where he sat alone in their wonted place  well he said he did come back sober  yes said staniford  next to not comin back at all the mate continued i suppose it was the best thing he could do he lounged away neither his voice nor his manner had that quality of disappointment which characterizes those who have mistakenly prophesied evil staniford had a mind to call him back and ask him what he meant but he refrained and he went to bed at last resolved to unburden himself of the whole hicks business once for all he felt that he had had quite enough of it both in the abstract and in its relation to lydia     xvi   hicks did not join the others at breakfast they talked of what lydia had seen at gibraltar where staniford had been on a former voyage dunham had made it a matter of conscience to know all about it beforehand from his guidebooks and had risen early that morning to correct his science by his experience in a long entry in the diary which he was keeping for miss hibbard the captain had the true seafarers ignorance and was amused at the things reported by his passengers of a place where he had been ashore so often hickss absence doubtless relieved him but he did not comment on the cabinboys announcement that he was still asleep except to order him let alone  they were seated at their one oclock dinner before the recluse made any sign then he gave note of his continued existence by bumping and thumping sounds within his stateroom as if some one were dressing there in a heavy sea  mr hicks seems to be taking his rough weather retrospectively said staniford with rather tremulous humor  the door was flung open and hicks reeled out staying himself by the doorknob even before he appeared a reek of strong waters had preceded him he must have been drinking all night his face was flushed and his eyes were bloodshot he had no collar on but he wove a cravat and otherwise he was accurately and even fastidiously dressed he balanced himself by the doorknob and measured the distance he had to make before reaching his place at the table smiling and waving a delicate handkerchief which he held in his hand spilt clogne tryin to scent my hichandkerchief makes deuced bad smelltoo much clogne smellsalcoholic thoms bear a hand s good flow no all right go on with your waitin bicbusiness bfore pleasure s feller says play it alone i guess  the boy had shrunk back in dismay and hicks contrived to reach his place by one of those precipitate dashes with which drunken men attain a point when the luck is with them he looked smilingly round the circle of faces staniford and the captain exchanged threatening looks of intelligence while mr watterson and dunham subordinately waited their motion but the advantage as in such cases was on the side of hicks he knew it with a drunkards subtlety and was at his ease  no apptite friends but thought id come out keep you from feeling lonesome he laughed and hiccuped and smiled upon them all well capn he continued covered from tigues day sterday you look bloomings usual thoms pass thepass thevictuals lively my son and fetch along coffee soon some the friends up late and want their coffee nothing like coffee carry offfees he winked to the men all round and then added to lydia sorry see you in this statei mean sorry see mecant make it that way either up stump on both routes what i mean is sorry hadnt coffee first but youre all rightall right like see anybody offer you disrespec n im around thas all  till he addressed her lydia had remained motionless first with bewilderment and then with open abhorrence she could hardly have seen in south bradfield a man who had been drinking even in haying or other sharpest stress of farmwork our farmer and his men stay themselves with nothing stronger than molasseswater or in extreme cases cider with a little corn soaked in it and the mill village where she had taught school was under the iron rule of a local vote for prohibition she stared in stupefaction at hickss heated foolish face she started at his wild movements and listened with dawning intelligence to his hiccupbroken speech with its thickened sibilants and its wandering emphasis when he turned to her and accompanied his words with a reassuring gesture she recoiled and as if breaking an ugly fascination she gave a low shuddering cry and looked at staniford  thomas he said miss blood was going to take her dessert on deck today dunham  dunham sprang to his feet and led her out of the cabin  the movement met hickss approval thas right sert on deck joy landscape and pudding togetherrhine steamer style all right be up there mself soons i get my coffee he winked again with drunken sharpness i know whas what be up there mself n a minute  if you offer to go up said staniford in a low voice as soon as lydia was out of the way ill knock you down  captain said mr watterson venturing perhaps for the first time in his whole maritime history upon a suggestion to his superior officer shall i clap him in irons  clap him in irons roared captain jenness clap him in bed look here you he turned to hicks but the latter who had been bristling at stanifords threat now relaxed in a crowing laugh  thas right captain irons no go cept in case mutiny bed perfectly legal t all times bed is good but trouble is t enforce it  wheres your bottle demanded the captain rising from the seat in which a paralysis of fury had kept him hitherto i want your bottle  oh bottles all right bottles under pillow

brandy on board under my coat nobody noticedso glad get me back prodigal sons returnfatted calf under his coat  the reprobate ended his boastful confession with another burst of hiccuping and staniford helplessly laughed  do me proud said hicks proud i sure you gentleman every time stanny know good thing when you see ithear it i mean  look here hicks said staniford choosing to make friends with the mammon of unrighteousness if any good end might be gained by it you know youre drunk and youre not fit to be about go back to bed thats a good fellow and come out again when youre all right you dont want to do anything youll be sorry for  no no no you dont stanny coffeell make me all right coffee always does coffeeheavens lash besh gift to man scovered subsesubsquently to grape see comes after claret in course of nature captain doesnt understand the lusion all right captain little learning dangerous thing he turned sharply on mr watterson who had remained inertly in his place put me in irons heh you put me in irons you old triton put me in irons will you his amiable mood was passing before one could say so it was past he was meditating means of active offense he gathered up the carvingknife and fork and held them close under mr wattersons nose smell that he said and frowned as darkly as a man of so little eyebrow could  at this senseless defiance staniford in spite of himself broke into another laugh and even captain jenness grinned mr watterson sat with his head drawn as far back as possible and with his nose wrinkled at the affront offered it captain he screamed appealing even in this extremity to his superior shall i fetch him one  no no cried staniford springing from his chair dont hit him he isnt responsible lets get him into his room  fetch me one heh said hicks rising with dignity and beginning to turn up his cuffs one itll take more than one fetch me stan up f youre man enough he was squaring at mr watterson when he detected signs of strategic approach in staniford and captain jenness he gave a wild laugh and shrank into a corner no no you dont boys he said  they continued their advance one on either side and reinforced by mr watterson hemmed him in the drunken man has the advantage of his sober brother in never seeming to be on the alert hicks apparently entered into the humor of the affair surhicsurrender he said with a smile in his heavy eyes he darted under the extended arms of captain jenness who was leading the centre of the advance and before either wing could touch him he was up the gangway and on the deck  captain jenness indulged one of those expressions very rare with him which are supposed to be forgiven to good men in moments of extreme perplexity and mr watterson profited by the precedent to unburden his heart in a paraphrase of the captains language stanifords laugh had as much cursing in it as their profanity  he mechanically followed hicks to the deck prepared to renew the attempt for his capture there but hicks had not stopped near dunham and lydia he had gone forward on the other side of the ship and was leaning quietly on the rail and looking into the sea staniford paused irresolute for a moment and then sat down beside lydia and they all tried to feign that nothing unpleasant had happened or was still impending but their talk had the wandering inconclusiveness which was inevitable and the eyes of each from time to time furtively turned toward hicks  for half an hour he hardly changed his position at the end of that time they found him looking intently at them and presently he began to work slowly back to the waist of the ship but kept to his own side he was met on the way by the second mate when nearly opposite where they sat  aint you pretty comfortable where you are they heard the mate asking guess i wouldnt go aft any further just yet  youre all right mason hicks answered going belowdown cellar s feller says go to bed  well thats a pious idea said the mate you couldnt do better than that ill lend you a hand  dont care f i do responded hicks taking the mates proffered arm but he really seemed to need it very little he walked perfectly well and he did not look across at the others again  at the head of the gangway he encountered captain jenness and mr watterson who had completed the perquisition they had remained to make in his stateroom mr watterson came up emptyhanded but the captain bore the canteen in which the common enemy had been so artfully conveyed on board he walked darkly scowling to the rail and flung the canteen into the sea hicks who had saluted his appearance with a glare as savage as his own yielded to his whimsical sense of the futility of this vengeance he gave his fleeting drunken laugh good old boy captain jenness means wellmeans well but lackslacksforecast pounds of cure but no prevention not much on bite but death on bark heh he waggled his hand offensively at the captain and disappeared loosely floundering down the cabin stairs holding hard by the handrail and fumbling round with his foot for the steps before he put it down  as soon as hes in his room mr watterson you lock him in the captain handed his officer a key and walked away forward with a hangdog look on his kindly face which he kept averted from his passengers  the sound of hickss descent had hardly ceased when clapping and knocking noises were heard again and the face of the troublesome little wretch reappeared he waved mr watterson aside with his left hand and in default of specific orders the latter allowed him to mount to the deck again hicks stayed himself a moment and lurched to where staniford and dunham sat with lydia  what i wish say miss blood is he beganwhat i wish say is peculiar circumstances make no difference with man if mans gentleman what i say is everybody specswhat i say is circumstances dont alter cases ladys a ladywhat i want do is beg you fellows pardonbeg her pardonif anything i said that firs morning  go away cried staniford beginning to whiten round the nostrils hold your tongue  hicks fell back a pace and looked at him with the odd effect of now seeing him for the first time what you want he asked what you mean slingin criticism ever since you came on this ship what you mean by it heh what you mean  staniford rose and lydia gave a start he cast an angry look at her do you think id hurt him he demanded  hicks went on sorry very sorry larm a ladyspecially lady we all respec but this particular affair touchtouches my honor you said he continued f i came on deck youd knock me down why dont you do it whas the matter with you sling criticism ever since you been on ship and fraid do it fraid you hear ficfraid i say staniford slowly walked away forward and hicks followed him threatening him with word and gesture now and then staniford thrust him aside and addressed him some expostulation and hicks laughed and submitted then after a silent excursion to the other side of the ship he would return and renew his onesided quarrel staniford seemed to forbid the interference of the crew and alternately soothed and baffled his tedious adversary who could still be heard accusing him of slinging criticism and challenging him to combat he leaned with his back to the rail and now looked quietly into hickss crazy face when the latter paused in front of him and now looked down with a worried wearied air at last he crossed to the other side and began to come aft again  mr dunham cried lydia starting up i know what mr staniford wants to do he wants to keep him away from me let me go down to the cabin i cant walk please help me her eyes were full of tears and the hand trembled that she laid on dunhams arm but she controlled her voice  he softly repressed her while he intently watched staniford no no  but he cant bear it much longer she pleaded and if he should  staniford would never strike him said dunham calmly dont be afraid look hes coming back with him hes trying to get him below theyll shut him up there thats the only chance sit down please she dropped into her seat hid her eyes for an instant and then fixed them again on the two young men  hicks had got between staniford and the rail he seized him by the arm and pulling him round suddenly struck at him it was too much for his wavering balance his feet shot from under him and he went backwards in a crooked whirl and tumble over the vessels side  staniford uttered a cry of disgust and rage oh you little brute he shouted and with what seemed a single gesture he flung off his coat and the low shoes he wore and leaped the railing after him  the cry of man overboard rang round the ship and captain jennesss order down with your helm lower a boat mr mason came quick as it was after the second mate had prepared to let go and he and two of the men were in the boat and she was sliding from her davits while the aroostook was coming up to the light wind and losing headway  when the boat touched the water two heads had appeared above the surface terribly far away hold on for gods sake well be there in a second  all right stanifords voice called back be quick the heads rose and sank with the undulation of the water the swift boat appeared to crawl  by the time it reached the place where they had been seen the heads disappeared and the men in the boat seemed to be rowing blindly about the mate stood upright suddenly he dropped and clutched at something over the boats side the people on the ship could see three hands on her gunwale a figure was pulled up into the boat and proved to be hicks then staniford seizing the gunwale with both hands swung himself in  a shout went up from the ship and staniford waved his hand lydia waited where she hung upon the rail clutching it hard with her hands till the boat was alongside then from white she turned firered and ran below and locked herself in her room     xvii   dunham followed staniford to their room and helped him off with his wet clothes he tried to say something ideally fit in recognition of his heroic act and he articulated some bald commonplaces of praise and shook stanifords clammy hand yes said the latter submitting but the difficulty about a thing of this sort is that you dont know whether you havent been an ass it has been pawed over so much by the romancers that you dont feel like a hero in real life but a hero of fiction ive a notion that hicks and i looked rather ridiculous going over the ships side i know we did coming back no man can reveal his greatness of soul in wet clothes did miss blood laugh  staniford said dunham in an accent of reproach you do her great injustice she felt what you had done in the way you would wishif you cared  what did she say asked staniford quickly  nothing but  thats an easy way of expressing ones admiration of heroic behavior i hope shell stick to that line i hope she wont feel it at all necessary to say anything in recognition of my prowess it would be extremely embarrassing ive got hicks back again but i couldnt stand any gratitude for it not that im ashamed of the performance perhaps if it had been anybody but hicks i should have waited for them to lower a boat but hicks had peculiar claims you couldnt let a man you disliked so much welter round a great while where is the poor old fellow is he clothed and in his right mind again  he seemed to be sober enough said dunham when he came on board but i dont think hes out yet  we must let thomas in to gather up this bathingsuit observed staniford what a newportish flavor it gives the place he was excited and in great gayety of spirits  he and dunham went out into the cabin where they found captain jenness pacing to and fro well sir he said taking stanifords hand and crossing his right with his left so as to include dunham in his congratulations you ought to have been a sailor then he added as if the unqualified praise might seem fulsome but if youd been a sailor you wouldnt have tried a thing like that youd have had more sense the chances were ten to one against you  staniford laughed was it so bad as that i shall begin to respect myself  the captain did not answer but his iron grip closed hard upon stanifords hand and he frowned in keen inspection of hicks who at that moment came out of his stateroom looking pale and quite sobered captain jenness surveyed him from head to foot and then from foot to head and pausing at the level of his eyes he said still holding staniford by the hand the trouble with a man aboard ship is that he cant turn a blackguard outofdoors just when he likes the aroostook puts in at messina youll be treated well till we get there and then if i find you on my vessel five minutes after she comes to anchor ill heave you overboard and ill take care that nobody jumps after you do you hear and you wont find me doing any such fool kindness as i did when i took you on board soon again  oh i say captain jenness began staniford  hes all right interrupted hicks im a blackguard i know it and i dont think i was worth fishing up but youve done it and i mustnt go back on you i suppose he lifted his poor weak bad little face and looked staniford in the eyes with a pathos that belied the slang of his speech the latter released his hand from captain jenness and gave it to hicks who wrung it as he kept looking him in the eyes while his lips twitched pitifully like a childs the captain gave a quick snort either of disgust or of sympathy and turned abruptly about and bundled himself up out of the cabin  i say exclaimed staniford a cup of coffee wouldnt be bad would it lets have some coffee thomas about as quick as the cook can make it he added as the boy came out from his stateroom with a lump of wet clothes in his hands you wanted some coffee a little while ago he said to hicks who hung his head at the joke  for the rest of the day staniford was the hero of the ship the men looked at him from a distance and talked of him together mr watterson hung about whenever captain jenness drew near him as if in the hope of overhearing some acceptable expression in which he could second his superior officer failing this and being driven to despair find the water pretty cold sir he asked at last and after that seemed to feel that he had discharged his duty as well as might be under the extraordinary circumstances  the second mate during the course of the afternoon contrived to pass near staniford why there want no need of your doing it he said in a bated tone i could ha had him out with the boat soon enough  staniford treasured up these meagre expressions of the general approbation and would not have had them different from this time within the narrow bounds that brought them all necessarily together in some sort hicks abolished himself as nearly as possible he chose often to join the second mate at meals which mr mason in accordance with the discipline of the ship took apart both from the crew and his superior officers mason treated the voluntary outcast with a sort of sarcastic compassion as a man whose fallen state was not without its points as a joke to the indifferent observer and yet might appeal to the pity of one who knew such cases through the misery they inflicted staniford heard him telling hicks about his brotherinlaw and dwelling upon the peculiar relief which the appearance of his name in the mortality list gave all concerned in him hicks listened in apathetic patience and acquiescence but staniford thought that he enjoyed as much as he could enjoy anything the second officers frankness for his own part he found that having made bold to keep this man in the world he had assumed a curious responsibility towards him it became his business to show him that he was not shunned by his fellowcreatures to hearten and cheer him up it was heavy work hicks with his joke was sometimes odious company but he was also sometimes amusing without it he was of a terribly dull conversation he accepted stanifords friendliness too meekly for good comradery he let it add apparently to his burden of gratitude rather than lessen it staniford smoked with him and told him stories he walked up and down with him and made a point of parading their good understanding but his spirits seemed to sink the lower deuce take him mused his benefactor hes in love with her but he now had the satisfaction such as it was of seeing that if he was in love he was quite without hope lydia had never relented in her abhorrence of hicks since the day of his disgrace there seemed no scorn in her condemnation but neither was there any mercy in her simple life she had kept unsophisticated the severe morality of a child and it was this that judged him that found him unpardonable and outlawed him he had never ventured to speak to her since that day and staniford never saw her look at him except when hicks was not looking and then with a repulsion which was very curious staniford could have pitied him and might have interceded so far as to set him nearer right in her eyes but he felt that she avoided him too there were no more walks on the deck no more readings in the cabin the checkerboard which professed to be the history of england in 2 vols remained a closed book the good companionship of a former time in which they had so often seemed like brothers and sister was gone hicks has smashed our happy family staniford said to dunham with little pleasure in his joke upon my word i think i had better have left him in the water lydia kept a great deal in her own room sometimes when staniford came down into the cabin he found her there talking with thomas of little things that amuse children sometimes when he went on deck in the evening she would be there in her accustomed seat and the second mate with face and figure half averted and staying himself by one hand on the shrouds would be telling her something to which she listened with lifted chin and attentive eyes the mate would go away when staniford appeared but that did not help matters for then lydia went too at table she said very little she had the effect of placing herself more and more under the protection of the captain the golden age when they had all laughed and jested so freely and fearlessly together under her pretty sovereignty was past and they seemed far dispersed in a common exile staniford imagined she grew pale and thin he asked dunham if he did not see it but dunham had not observed i think matters have taken a very desirable shape socially he said miss blood will reach her friends as fancyfree as she left home  yes staniford assented vaguely thats the great object  after a while dunham asked shes never said anything to you about your rescuing hicks  rescuing what rescuing theyd have had him out in another minute any way said staniford fretfully then he brooded angrily upon the subject but i can tell you what considering all the circumstances she might very well have said something it looks obtuse or it looks hard she must have known that it all came about through my trying to keep him away from her  oh yes she knew that said dunham she spoke of it at the time but i thought  oh she did then i think that it would be very little if she recognized the mere fact that something had happened  why you said you hoped she wouldnt you said it would be embarrassing youre hard to please staniford  i shouldnt choose to have her speak for my pleasure staniford returned but it argues a dullness and coldness in her  i dont believe shes dull i dont believe shes cold said dunham warmly  what do you believe she is  afraid  pshaw said staniford  the eve of their arrival at messina he discharged one more duty by telling hicks that he had better come on to trieste with them captain jenness asked me to speak to you about it he said he feels a little awkward and thought i could open the matter better  the captains all right answered hicks with unruffled humility but id rather stop at messina im going to get home as soon as i canstrike a beeline  look here said staniford laying his hand on his shoulder how are you going to manage for money  monte di pietà replied hicks ive been there before used to have most of my things in the care of the state when i was studying medicine in paris ive got a lot of rings and trinkets thatll carry me through with whats left of my watch  are you sure  sure  because you can draw on me if youre going to be short  thanks said hicks theres something i should like to ask you he added after a moment i see as well as you do that miss blood isnt the same as she was before i want to knowi cant always be sure afterwardswhether i did or said anything out of the way in her presence  you were drunk said staniford frankly but beyond that you were irreproachable as regarded miss blood you were even exemplary  yes i know said hicks with a joyless laugh sometimes it takes that turn i dont think i could stand it if i had shown her any disrespect shes a ladya perfect lady shes the best girl i ever saw  hicks said staniford presently i havent bored you in regard to that little foible of yours arent you going to try to do something about it  im going home to get them to shut me up somewhere answered hicks but i doubt if anything can be done ive studied the thing i am a doctoror i would be if i were not a drunkardand ive diagnosed the case pretty thoroughly for three months or four months now i shall be all right after that i shall go to the bad for a few weeks and ill have to scramble back the best way i can nobody can help me that was the mistake this last time i shouldnt have wanted anything at gibraltar if i could have had my spree out at boston but i let them take me before it was over and ship me off i thought id try it well it was like a burning fire every minute all the way i thought i should die i tried to get something from the sailors i tried to steal gabriels cookingwine when i got that brandy in gibraltar i was wild talk about heroism i tell you it was superhuman keeping that canteen corked till night i was in hopes i could get through itsleep it offand nobody be any the wiser but it wouldnt work o lord lord lord  hicks was as common a soul as could well be his conception of life was vulgar and his experience of it was probably vulgar he had a good mind enough with abundance of that humorous brightness which may hereafter be found the most national quality of the americans but his ideals were pitiful and the language of his heart was a drolling slang yet his doom lifted him above his low conditions and made him tragic his despair gave him the dignity of a mysterious expiation and set him apart with all those who suffer beyond human help without deceiving himself as to the quality of the man staniford felt awed by the darkness of his fate  cant you try somehow to stand up against it and fight it off youre so young yet it cant  the wretched creature burst into tears oh trytry you dont know what youre talking about dont you suppose ive had reasons for trying if you could see how my mother looks when i come out of one of my drunksand my father poor old man its no use i tell you its no use i shall go just so long and then i shall want it and will have it unless they shut me up for life my god i wish i was dead well he rose from the place where they had been sitting together and held out his hand to staniford im going to be off in the morning before youre out and ill say goodby now i want you to keep this chair and give it to miss blood for me when you get to trieste  i will hicks said staniford gently  i want her to know that i was ashamed of myself i think shell like to know it  i will say anything to her that you wish replied staniford  theres nothing else if ever you see a man with my complaint fall overboard again think twice before you jump after him  he wrung stanifords hand and went below leaving him with a dull remorse that he should ever have hated hicks and that he could not quite like him even now  but he did his duty by him to the last he rose at dawn and was on deck when hicks went over the side into the boat which was to row him to the steamer for naples lying at anchor not far off he presently returned to stanifords surprise and scrambled up to the deck of the aroostook the steamer sails tonight he said and perhaps i couldnt raise the money by that time i wish youd lend me ten napoleons ill send em to you from london theres my fathers address im going to telegraph to him he handed staniford a card and the latter went below for the coins thanks said hicks when he reappeared with them send em to you where  care blumenthals venice im going to be there some weeks  in the gray morning light the lurid color of tragedy had faded out of hicks he was merely a baddishlooking young fellow whom staniford had lent ten napoleons that he might not see again staniford watched the steamer uneasily both from the aroostook and from the shore where he strolled languidly about with dunham part of the day when she sailed in the evening he felt that hickss absence was worth twice the money     xviii   the young men did not come back to the ship at night but went to a hotel for the greater convenience of seeing the city they had talked of offering to show lydia about but their talk had not ended in anything vexed with himself to be vexed at such a thing staniford at the bottom of his heart still had a soreness which the constant sight of her irritated it was in vain that he said there was no occasion perhaps no opportunity for her to speak yet he was hurt that she seemed to have seen nothing uncommon in his risking his own life for that of a man like hicks he had set the action low enough in his own speech but he knew that it was not ignoble and it puzzled him that it should be so passed over she had not even said a word of congratulation upon his own escape it might be that she did not know how or did not think it was her place to speak she was curiously estranged he felt as if he had been away and she had grown from a young girl into womanhood during his absence this fantastic conceit was strongest when he met her with captain jenness one day he had found friends at the hotel as one always does in italy if ones world is at all widesome young ladies and a lady now married with whom he had once violently flirted she was willing that he should envy her husband that amused him in his embittered mood he let her drive him about and they met lydia and the captain walking together staniford started up from his lounging ease as if her limpid gaze had searched his conscience and bowed with an air which did not escape his companion  ah whos that she asked with the boldness which she made pass for eccentricity  a lady of my acquaintance said staniford at his laziest again  a lady said the other with an inflection that she saw hurt why the marine animal then she bowed very prettily she blushed prettily too  shes a very pretty girl replied staniford  charming but why blush  ive heard that there are ladies who blush for nothing  is she italian  yesin voice  oh an american prima donna staniford did not answer who is she where is she from  south bradfield mass stanifords eyes twinkled at her pursuit which he did not trouble himself to turn aside but baffled by mere impenetrability  the party at the hotel suggested that the young men should leave their ship and go on with them to naples dunham was tempted for he could have reached dresden sooner by land but staniford overruled him and at the end of four days they went back to the aroostook they said it was like getting home but in fact they felt the change from the airy heights and breadths of the hotel to the small cabin and the closets in which they slept it was not so great alleviation as captain jenness seemed to think that one of them could now have hickss stateroom but dunham took everything sweetly as his habit was and after all they were meeting their hardships voluntarily some of the ladies came with them in the boat which rowed them to the aroostook the name made them laugh that lady who wished staniford to regret her waved him her hand kerchief as the boat rowed away again she had with difficulty been kept from coming on board by the refusal of the others to come with her she had contrived to associate herself with him again in the minds of the others and this perhaps was all that she desired but the sense of her frivolityher not so much vacant mindedness as vacantheartednesswas like a stain and he painted in lydias face when they first met the reproach which was in his own breast  her greeting however was frank and cordial it was a real welcome staniford wondered if it were not more frank and cordial than he quite liked and whether she was merely relieved by hickss absence or had freed herself from that certain subjection in which she had hitherto been to himself  yet it was charming to see her again as she had been in the happiest moments of the past and to feel that hicks being out of her world her trust of everybody in it was perfect once more she treated that interval of coldness and diffidence as all women know how to treat a thing which they wish not to have been and staniford a man on whom no pleasing art of her sex was ever lost admired and gratefully accepted the effect of this he fell luxuriously into the old habits again they had still almost the time of a steamers voyage to europe before them it was as if they were newly setting sail from america the first night after they left messina staniford found her in her place in the waist of the ship and sat down beside her there and talked the next night she did not come the third she came and he asked her to walk with him the elastic touch of her hand on his arm the rhythmic movement of her steps beside him were things that seemed always to have been she told him of what she had seen and done in messina this glimpse of italy had vividly animated her she had apparently found a world within herself as well as without  with a suddenly depressing sense of loss staniford had a prevision of splendor in her when she should have wholly blossomed out in that fervid air of art and beauty he would fain have kept her still a wilding rosebud of the new england wayside he hated the officers who should wonder at her when she first came into the square of st mark with her aunt and uncle  her talk about messina went on he was thinking of her and not of her talk but he saw that she was not going to refer to their encounter you make me jealous of the objects of interest in messina he said you seem to remember seeing everything but me there  she stopped abruptly yes she said after a deep breath i saw you there and she did not offer to go on again  where were you going that morning  oh to the cathedral captain jenness left me there and i looked all through it till he came back from the consulate  left you there alone cried staniford  yes i told him i should not feel lonely and i should not stir out of it till he came back i took one of those little pine chairs and sat down when i got tired and looked at the people coming to worship and the strangers with their guidebooks  did any of them look at you  they stared a good deal it seems to be the custom in europe but i told captain jenness i should probably have to go about by myself in venice as my aunts an invalid and i had better get used to it  she paused and seemed to be referring the point to staniford  yesoh yes he said  captain jenness said it was their way over here she resumed but he guessed i had as much right in a church as anybody  the captains common sense is infallible answered staniford he was ashamed to know that the beautiful young girl was as improperly alone in church as she would have been in a café and he began to hate the european world for the fact it seemed better to him that the aroostook should put about and sail back to boston with her as she wasbetter that she should be going to her aunt in south bradfield than to her aunt in venice we shall soon be at our journeys end now he said after a while  yes the captain thinks in about eight days if we have good weather  shall you be sorry  oh i like the sea very well  but the new life you are coming todoesnt that alarm you sometimes  yes it does she admitted with a kind of reluctance  so much that you would like to turn back from it  oh no she answered quickly of course not staniford thought nothing could be worse than going back to south bradfield i keep thinking about it she added you say venice is such a very strange place is it any use my having seen messina  oh all italian cities have something in common  i presume she went on that after i get there everything will become natural but i dont like to look forward itscares me i cant form any idea of it  you neednt be afraid said staniford its only more beautiful than anything you can imagine  yesyes i know lydia answered  and do you really dread getting there  yes i dread it she said  why returned staniford lightly so do i but its for a different reason im afraid i should like such a voyage as this to go on forever now and then i think it will it seems always to have gone on can you remember when it began  a great while ago she answered humoring his fantasy but i can remember she paused a long while i dont know she said at last whether i can make you understand just how i feel but it seems to me as if i had died and this long voyage was a kind of dream that i was going to wake up from in another world i often used to think when i was a little girl that when i got to heaven it would be lonesomei dont know whether i can express it you say that italythat venice is so beautiful but if i dont know any one there she stopped as if she had gone too far  but you do know somebody there said staniford your aunt  yes said the girl and looked away  but the people in this long dreamyoure going to let some of them appear to you there he suggested  oh yes she said reflecting his lighter humor i shall want to see them or i shall not know i am the same person and i must be sure of myself at least  and you wouldnt like to go back to earthto south bradfield again he asked presently  no she answered all that seems over forever i couldnt go back there and be what i was i could have stayed there but i couldnt go back  staniford laughed i see that it isnt the other world thats got hold of you its this world i dont believe youll be unhappy in italy but its pleasant to think youve been so contented on the aroostook that you hate to leave it i dont believe theres a man on the ship that wouldnt feel personally flattered to know that you liked being here even that poor fellow who parted from us at messina was anxious that you should think as kindly of him as you could he knew that he had behaved in a way to shock you and he was very sorry he left a message with me for you he thought you would like to know that he was ashamed of himself  i pitied him said lydia succinctly it was the first time that she had referred to hicks and staniford found it in character for her to limit herself to this sparse comment evidently her compassion was a religious duty stanifords generosity came easy to him  i feel bound to say that hicks was not a bad fellow i disliked him immensely and i ought to do him justice now hes gone he deserved all your pity hes a doomed man his vice is irreparable he cant resist it lydia did not say anything women do not generalize in these matters perhaps they cannot pity the faults of those they do not love staniford only forgave hicks the more i cant say that up to the last moment i thought him anything but a poor common little creature and yet i certainly did feel a greater kindness for him afterwhat iafter what had happened he left something more than a message for you miss blood he left his steamer chair yonder for you  for me demanded lydia staniford felt her thrill and grow rigid upon his arm with refusal i will not have it he had no right to do so hehewas dreadful i will give it to you she said suddenly he ought to have given it to you you did everything for him you saved his life  it was clear that she did not sentimentalize hickss case and staniford had some doubt as to the value she set upon what he had done even now she had recognized it  he said i think you overestimate my service to him possibly i dare say the boat could have picked him up in good time  yes thats what the captain and mr watterson and mr mason all said assented lydia  staniford was nettled he would have preferred a devoted belief that but for him hicks must have perished besides what she said still gave no clew to her feeling in regard to himself he was obliged to go on but he went on as indifferently as he could however it was hardly a question for me at the time whether he could have been got out without my help if i had thought about it at allwhich i didnti suppose i should have thought that it wouldnt do to take any chances  oh no said lydia simply you couldnt have done anything less than you did  in his heart staniford had often thought that he could have done very much less than jump overboard after hicks and could very properly have left him to the ordinary lifesaving apparatus of the ship but if he had been putting the matter to some lady in society who was aggressively praising him for his action he would have said just what lydia had said for himthat he could not have done anything less he might have said it however in such a way that the lady would have pursued his retreat from her praises with still fonder applause whereas this girl seemed to think there was nothing else to be said he began to stand in awe of her heroic simplicity if she drew everyday breath in that lofty air what could she really think of him who preferred on principle the atmosphere of the valley do you know miss blood he said gravely that you pay me a very high compliment  how she asked  you rate my maximum as my mean temperature he felt that she listened inquiringly i dont think im habitually up to a thing of that kind he explained  oh no she assented quietly but when he struck at you so you had to do everything  ah you have the pitiless puritan conscience that takes the life out of us all cried staniford with sudden bitterness lydia seemed startled shocked and her hand trembled on his arm as if she had a mind to take it away i was a long time laboring up to that point i suppose you are always there  i dont understand she said turning her head round with the slow motion of her beauty and looking him full in the face  i cant explain now i will by and bywhen we get to venice he added with quick lightness  you put off everything till we get to venice she said doubtfully  i beg your pardon it was you who did it the last time  was it she laughed so it was i was thinking it was you  it consoled him a little that she should have confused them in her thought in this way what was it you were to tell me in venice he asked  i cant think now  very likely something of yourselfor myself a third person might say our conversational range was limited  do you think it is very egotistical she asked in the gay tone which gave him relief from the sense of oppressive elevation of mind in her  it is in menot in you  but i dont see the difference  i will explain sometime  when we get to venice  they both laughed it was very nonsensical but nonsense is sometimes enough  when they were serious again tell me he said what you thought of that lady in messina the other day  she did not affect not to know whom he meant she merely said i only saw her a moment  but you thought something if we only see people a second we form some opinion of them  she is very fineappearing said lydia  staniford smiled at the countrified phrase he had observed that when she spoke her mind she used an instinctive good language when she would not speak it she fell into the phraseology of the people with whom she had lived i see you dont wish to say because you think she is a friend of mine but you can speak out freely we were not friends we were enemies if anything  stanifords meaning was clear enough to himself but lydia paused as if in doubt whether he was jesting or not before she asked why were you riding with her then  i was driving with her he replied i suppose because she asked me  asked you cried the girl and he perceived her moral recoil both from himself and from a woman who could be so unseemly that lady would have found it delicious if she could have known that a girl placed like lydia was shocked at her behavior but he was not amused he was touched by the simple selfrespect that would not let her suffer from what was not wrong in itself but that made her shrink from a voluntary semblance of unwomanliness it endeared her not only to his pity but to that sense which in every man consecrates womanhood and waits for some woman to be better than all her sex again he felt the pang he had remotely known before what would she do with these ideals of hers in that depraved old worldso long past trouble for its sins as to have got a sort of sweetness and innocence in themwhere her facts would be utterly irreconcilable with her ideals and equally incomprehensible  they walked up and down a few turns without speaking again of that lady he knew that she grew momently more constrained toward him that the pleasure of the time was spoiled for her that she had lost her trust in him and this half amused half afflicted him it did not surprise him when at their third approach to the cabin gangway she withdrew her hand from his arm and said stiffly i think i will go down but she did not go at once she lingered and after a certain hesitation she said without looking at him i didnt express what i wanted to about mr hicks andwhat you did it is what i thought you would do  thanks said staniford with sincere humility he understood how she had had this in her mind and how she would not withhold justice from him because he had fallen in her esteem how rather she would be the more resolute to do him justice for that reason     xix   he could see that she avoided being alone with him the next day but he took it for a sign of relenting perhaps helpless relenting that she was in her usual place on deck in the evening he went to her and i see that you havent forgiven me he said  forgiven you she echoed  yes he said for letting that lady ask me to drive with her  i never said she began  oh no but i knew it all the same it was not such a very wicked thing as those things go but i liked your not liking it will you let me say something to you  yes she answered rather breathlessly  you must think its rather an odd thing to say as i ask leave it is and i hardly know how to say it i want to tell you that ive made bold to depend a great deal upon your good opinion for my peace of mind of late and that i cant well do without it now  she stole the quickest of her birdlike glances at him but did not speak and though she seemed to his anxious fancy poising for flight she remained and merely looked away like the bird that will not or cannot fly  you dont resent my making you my outer conscience do you and my knowing that youre not quite pleased with me  she looked down and away with one of those turns of the head so precious when one who beholds them is young and caught at the fringe of her shawl i have no right she began  oh i give you the right he cried with passionate urgence you have the right judge me she only looked more grave and he hurried on it was no great harm of her to ask me thats common enough but it was harm of me to go if i didnt quite respect herif i thought her silly and was willing to be amused with her one hasnt any right to do that i saw this when i saw you she still hung her head and looked away i want you to tell me something he pursued do you remember oncethe second time we talked togetherthat you said dunham was in earnest and you wouldnt answer when i asked you about myself do you remember  yes said the girl  i didnt care then i care very much now you dont think meyou think i can be in earnest when i will dont you and that i can regretthat i really wish he took the hand that played with the shawlfringe but she softly drew it away  ah i see he said you cant believe in me you dont believe that i can be a good manlike dunham  she answered in the same breathless murmur i think you are good her averted face drooped lower  i will tell you all about it some day he cried with joyful vehemence will you let me  yes she answered with the swift expulsion of breath that sometimes comes with tears she rose quickly and turned away he did not try to keep her from leaving him his heart beat tumultuously his brain seemed in a whirl it all meant nothing or it meant everything  what is the matter with miss blood asked dunham who joined him at this moment i just spoke to her at the foot of the gangway stairs and she wouldnt answer me  oh i dont know about miss bloodi dont know whats the matter said staniford look here dunham i want to talk with youi want to tell you somethingi want you to advise meitheres only one thing that can explain it that can excuse it theres only one thing that can justify all that ive done and said and that can not only justify it but can make it sacredly and eternally rightright for her and right for me yes its reason for all and for a thousand times more it makes it fair for me to have let her see that i thought her beautiful and charming that i delighted to be with her that idunham cried staniford im in love  dunham started at the burst in which these ravings ended staniford he faltered with grave regret i hope not  you hope not youyouwhat do you mean how else can i free myself from the selfreproach of having trifled with her of  dunham shook his head compassionately you cant do it that way your only safety is to fight it to the deathto run from it  but if i dont choose to fight it shouted stanifordif i dont choose to run from it if i  for heavens sake hush the whole ship will hear you and you oughtnt to breathe it in the desert i saw how it was going i dreaded it i knew it and i longed to speak im to blame for not speaking  i should like to know what would have authorized you to speak demanded staniford haughtily  only my regard for you only what urges me to speak now you must fight it staniford whether you choose or not think of yourselfthink of her thinkyou have always been my ideal of honor and truth and loyaltythink of her husband  her husband gasped staniford whose husband what the deuce who the deuceare you talking about dunham  mrs rivers  mrs rivers that flimsy featherheaded emptyheartedeyesmaker that frivolous ridiculouspah and did you think that i was talking of her did you think i was in love with her  why stammered dunham i supposedi thoughtat messina you know  oh staniford walked the decks length away well dunham he said as he came back youve spoilt a pretty scene with your rot about mrs rivers i was going to be romantic but perhaps id better say in ordinary newspaper english that ive just found out that im in love with miss blood  with her cried dunham springing at his hand  oh come now dont you be romantic after knocking my chance  why but staniford said dunham wringing his hand with a lovers joy in anothers love and his relief that it was not mrs rivers i never should have dreamt of such a thing  why asked staniford shortly  oh the way you talked at first you know and  i suppose even people who get married have something to take back about each other said staniford rather sheepishly however he added with an impulse of frankness i dont know that i should have dreamt of it myself and i dont blame you but its a fact nevertheless  why of course its splendid certainly its magnificent there was undoubtedly a qualification a reservation in dunhams tone he might have thought it right to bring the inequalities of the affair to stanifords mind with all his effusive kindliness of heart and manner he had a keen sense of social fitness a nice feeling for convention but a man does not easily suggest to another that the girl with whom he has just declared himself in love is his inferior what dunham finally did say was it jumps with all your ideasall your old talk about not caring to marry a society girl  society might be very glad of such a girl said staniford stiffly  yes yes certainly but i mean  oh i know what you mean its all right said staniford but it isnt a question of marrying yet i cant be sure she understood me ive been so long understanding myself and yet she must she must she must believe it by this time or else that im the most infamous scoundrel alive when i think how i have sought her out and followed her up and asked her judgment and hung upon her words i feel that i oughtnt to lose a moment in being explicit i dont care for myself she can take me or leave me as she likes but if she doesnt understand she mustnt be left in suspense as to my meaning he seemed to be speaking to dunham but he was really thinking aloud and dunham waited for some sort of question before he spoke but its a great satisfaction to have had it out with myself i havent got to pretend any more that i hang about her and look at her and go mooning round after her for this noreason and that ive got the best reason in the world for playing the foolim in love he drew a long deep breath it simplifies matters immensely to have reached the point of acknowledging that why dunham those four days at messina almost killed me they settled it when that woman was in full fascination it made me gasp i choked for a breath of fresh air for a taste of springwater forlurella it was a long time since staniford had used this name and the sound of it made him laugh its drollbut i always think of her as lurella i wish it was her name why it was like heaven to see her face when i got back to the ship after we met her that day at messina mrs rivers tried her best to get out of me who it was and where i met her but i flatter myself that i was equal to that emergency  dunham said nothing at once then staniford he faltered she got it out of me  did you tell her who luwho miss blood was  yes  and how i happened to be acquainted with her  yes  and that we were going on to trieste with her  she had it out of me before i knew said dunham i didnt realize what she was after and i didnt realize how peculiar the situation might seem  i see nothing peculiar in the situation interrupted staniford haughtily then he laughed consciously or yes i do of course i do you must know her to appreciate it though he mused a while before he added no wonder mrs rivers was determined to come aboard i wish we had let herconfound her shell think i was ashamed of it theres nothing to be ashamed of by heaven i should like to hear any one staniford broke off and laughed and then bit his lip smiling suddenly he burst out again frowning i wont view it in that light i refuse to consider it from that point of view as far as im concerned its as regular as anything else in life its the same to me as if she were in her own house and i had come there to tell her that she has my future in her hand shes such a lady by instinct that shes made it all a triumph and i thank god that i havent done or said anything to mar it even that beast of a hicks didnt its no merit ive made love to heri own it of course i have because i was in love with her and my fault has been that i havent made love to her openly but have gone on fancying that i was studying her character or some rubbish of that sort but the fault is easily repaired he turned about as if he were going to look for lydia at once and ask her to be his wife but he halted abruptly and sat down no that wont do he said that wont do at all he remained thinking and dunham unwilling to interrupt his reverie moved a few paces off dunham dont go i want your advice perhaps i dont see it in the right light  how is it you see it my dear fellow asked dunham  i dont know whether ive a right to be explicit with her here it seems like taking an advantage in a few days she will be with her friends  you must wait said dunham decisively you cant speak to her before she is in their care it wouldnt be the thing youre quite right about that  no it wouldnt be the thing groaned staniford but how is it all to go on till then he demanded desperately  why just as it has before answered dunham with easy confidence  but is that fair to her  why not you mean to say to her at the right time all that a man can till that time comes i havent the least doubt she understands you  do you think so asked staniford simply he had suddenly grown very subject and meek to dunham  yes said the other with the superiority of a betrothed lover women are very quick about those things  i suppose youre right sighed staniford with nothing of his wonted arrogant pretension in regard to womens moods and minds i suppose youre right and you would go on just as before  i would indeed how could you change without making her unhappyif shes interested in you  thats true i could imagine worse things than going on just as before i suppose he added that something more explicit has its charms but a mutual understanding is very pleasantif it is a mutual understanding he looked inquiringly at dunham  why as to that of course i dont know you ought to be the best judge of that but i dont believe your impressions would deceive you  yours did once suggested staniford in suspense  yes but i was not in love with her explained dunham  of course said staniford with a breath of relief and you think well i must wait he concluded grimly but dontdont mention this matter dunham unless i do dont keep an eye on me old fellow or yes you must you cant help it i want to tell you dunham what makes me think she may be a not wholly uninterested spectator of my sentiments he made full statement of words and looks and tones dunham listened with the patience which one lover has with another     xx   the few days that yet remained of their voyage were falling in the latter half of september and staniford tried to make the young girl see the surpassing loveliness of that season under italian skies the fierceness of the summer is then past and at night when chiefly they inspected the firmament the heaven has begun to assume something of the intense blue it wears in winter she said yes it was very beautiful but she could not see that the days were finer or the skies bluer than those of september at home and he laughed at her loyalty to the american weather dont you think so too she asked as if it pained her that he should like italian weather better  oh yesyes he said then he turned the talk on her as he did whenever he could i like your meteorological patriotism if i were a woman i should stand by america in everything  dont you as a man she pursued still anxiously  oh certainly he answered but women owe our continent a double debt of fidelity its the paradise of women its their promised land where theyve been led up out of the egyptian bondage of europe its the home of their freedom it is recognized in america that women have consciences and souls  lydia looked very grave is itis it so different with women in europe she faltered  very he replied and glanced at her halflaughingly halftenderly  after a while i wish you would tell me she said just what you mean i wish you would tell me what is the difference  oh its a long story i will tell youwhen we get to venice the wellworn jest served its purpose again she laughed and he continued by the way just when will that be the captain says that if this wind holds we shall be in trieste by friday afternoon i suppose your friends will meet you there on saturday and that youll go back with them to venice at once  yes assented lydia  well if i should come on monday would that be too soon  oh no she answered he wondered if she had been vaguely hoping that he might go directly on with her to venice they were together all day now and the long talks went on from early morning when they met before breakfast on deck until late at night when they parted there with blushed and laughed goodnights sometimes the trust she put upon his unspoken promises was terrible it seemed to condemn his reticence as fantastic and hazardous with her at least it was clear that this love was the first her living and loving were one he longed to testify the devotion which he felt to leave it unmistakable and safe past accident he thought of making his will in which he should give her everything and declare her supremely dear he could only rid himself of this by drawing up the paper in writing and then he easily tore it in pieces  they drew nearer together not only in their talk about each other but in what they said of different people in their relation to themselves but stanifords pleasure in the metaphysics of reciprocal appreciation his wonder at the quickness with which she divined characters he painfully analyzed was not greater than his joy in the pretty hitch of the shoulder with which she tucked her handkerchief into the back pocket of her sack or the picturesqueness with which she sat facing him and leant upon the rail with her elbow wrapped in her shawl and the fringe gathered in the hand which propped her cheek he scribbled his sketchbook full of her contours and poses which sometimes he caught unawares and which sometimes she sat for him to draw one day as they sat occupied in this i wonder he said if you have anything of my feeling nowadays it seems to me as if the world had gone on a pleasure excursion without taking me along and i was enjoying myself very much at home  why yes she said joyously do you have that feeling too  i wonder what it is makes us feel so he ventured  perhaps she returned the long voyage  i shall hate to have the world come back i believe he said reverting to the original figure shall you  you know i dont know much about it she answered in lithe evasion for which she more than atoned with a conscious look and one of her dark blushes yet he chose with a curious cruelty to try how far she was his  how odd it would be he said if we never should have a chance to talk up this voyage of ours when it is over  she started in a way that made his heart smite him why you said you and then she caught herself and struggled pitifully for the selfpossession she had lost she turned her head away his pulse bounded  did you think i wouldnt i am living for that he took the hand that lay in her lap she seemed to try to free it but she had not the strength or will she could only keep her face turned from him     xxi   they arrived friday afternoon in trieste and captain jenness telegraphed his arrival to lydias uncle as he went up to the consulate with his ships papers the next morning the young men sent their baggage to a hotel but they came back for a last dinner on the aroostook they all pretended to be very gay but everybody was perturbed and distraught staniford and dunham had paid their way handsomely with the sailors and they had returned with remembrances in florid scarfs and jewelry for thomas and the captain and the officers dunham had thought they ought to get something to give lydia as a souvenir of their voyage it was part of his devotion to young ladies to offer them little presents but staniford overruled him and said there should be nothing of the kind they agreed to be out of the way when her uncle came and they said goodby after dinner she came on deck to watch them ashore staniford would be the last to take leave as he looked into her eyes he saw brave trust of him but he thought a sort of troubled wonder too as if she could not understand his reticence and suffered from it there was the same latent appeal and reproach in the pose in which she watched their boat row away she stood with one hand resting on the rail and her slim grace outlined against the sky he waved his hand she answered with a little languid wave of hers then she turned away he felt as if he had forsaken her  the afternoon was very long toward nightfall he eluded dunham and wandered back to the ship in the hope that she might still be there but she was gone already everything was changed there was bustle and discomfort it seemed years since he had been there captain jenness was ashore somewhere it was the second mate who told staniford of her uncles coming  what sort of person was he he asked vaguely  oh well dum an englishman any way said mason in a tone of easy sociable explanation  the scruple to which staniford had been holding himself for the past four or five days seemed the most incredible of folliesthe most fantastic the most cruel he hurried back to the hotel when he found dunham coming out from the table dhôte he was wild  i have been the greatest fool in the world dunham he said i have let a quixotic quibble keep me from speaking when i ought to have spoken  dunham looked at him in stupefaction where have you been he inquired  down to the ship i was in hopes that she might be still there but shes gone  the aroostook gone  look here dunham cried staniford angrily this is the second time youve done that if you are merely thickwitted much can be forgiven to your infirmity but if youve a mind to joke let me tell you you choose your time badly  im not joking i dont know what youre talking about i may be thickwitted as you say or you may be scatterwitted said dunham indignantly what are you after any way  what was my reason for not being explicit with her for going away from her without one honest manly downright word for sneaking off without telling her that she was more than life to me and that if she cared for me as i cared for her i would go on with her to venice and meet her people with her  why i dont know replied dunham vaguely we agreed that there would be a sort ofthat she ought to be in their care before  then i can tell you interrupted staniford that we agreed upon the greatest piece of nonsense that ever was a man can do no more than offer himself and if he does less after hes tried everything to show that hes in love with a woman and to make her in love with him hes a scamp to refrain from a bad motive and an ass to refrain from a good one why in the name of heaven shouldnt i have spoken instead of leaving her to eat her heart out in wonder at my delay and to doubt and suspect and dreadoh he shouted in supreme selfcontempt  dunham had nothing to urge in reply he had fallen in with what he thought stanifords own mind in regard to the course he ought to take since he had now changed his mind there seemed never to have been any reason for that course  my dear fellow he said it isnt too late yet to see her i dare say let us go and find what time the trains leave for venice  do you suppose i can offer myself in the salle dattente sneered staniford but he went with dunham to the coffeeroom where they found the osservatore triestino and the timetable of the railroad the last train left for venice at ten and it was now seven the austrian lloyd steamer for venice sailed at nine  pshaw said staniford and pushed the paper away he sat brooding over the matter before the table on which the journals were scattered while dunham waited for him to speak at last he said i cant stand it i must see her i dont know whether i told her i should come on tomorrow night or not if she should be expecting me on monday morning and i should be delayeddunham will you drive round with me to the austrian lloyds wharf they may be going by the boat and if they are theyll have left their hotel well try the train later i should like to find out if they are on board i dont know that ill try to speak with them very likely not  ill go certainly answered dunham cordially  ill have some dinner first said staniford im hungry  it was quite dark when they drove on to the wharf at which the boat for venice lay when they arrived a plan had occurred to staniford through the timidity which had already succeeded the boldness of his desperation dunham he said i want you to go on board and see if shes there i dont think i could stand not finding her besides if shes cheerful and happy perhaps id better not see her you can come back and report confound it you know i should be so conscious before that infernal uncle of hers you understand  yes yes returned dunham eager to serve staniford in a case like this ill manage it  well said staniford beginning to doubt the wisdom of either going aboard do it if you think best i dont know  dont know what asked dunham pausing in the door of the fiacre  oh nothing nothing i hope were not making fools of ourselves  youre morbid old fellow said dunham gayly he disappeared in the darkness and staniford waited with set teeth till he came back he seemed a long time gone when he returned he stood holding fast to the open fiacredoor without speaking  well cried staniford with bitter impatience  well what dunham asked in a stupid voice  were they there  i dont know i cant tell  cant tell man did you go to see  i think so im not sure  a heavy sense of calamity descended upon stanifords heart but patience came with it whats the matter dunham he asked getting out tremulously  i dont know i think ive had a fall somewhere help me in  staniford got out and helped him gently to the seat and then mounted beside him giving the order for their return where is your hat he asked finding that dunham was bareheaded  i dont know it doesnt matter am i bleeding  its so dark i cant see  put your hand here he carried stanifords hand to the back of his head  theres no blood but youve had an ugly knock there  yes thats it said dunham i remember now i slipped and struck my head he lapsed away in a torpor staniford could learn nothing more from him  the hurt was not what staniford in his first anxiety had feared but the doctor whom they called at the hotel was vague and guarded as to everything but the time and care which must be given in any event staniford despaired but there was only one thing to do he sat down beside his friend to take care of him  his mind was a turmoil of regrets of anxieties of apprehensions but he had a superficial calmness that enabled him to meet the emergencies of the case he wrote a letter to lydia which he somehow knew to be rightly worded telling her of the accident in terms which conveyed to her all that he felt he said that he should not see her at the time he had hoped but promised to come to venice as soon as he could quit his friend then with a deep breath he put that affair away for the time and seemed to turn a key upon it  he called a waiter and charged him to have his letter posted at once the man said he would give it to the portier who was sending out some other letters he returned ten minutes later with a number of letters which he said the portier had found for him at the postoffice staniford glanced at them it was no time to read them then and he put them into the breast pocket of his coat     xxii   at the hotel in trieste to which lydia went with her uncle before taking the train for venice she found an elderly woman who made her a courtesy and saying something in italian startled her by kissing her hand  its our veronica her uncle explained she wants to know how she can serve you he gave veronica the wraps and parcels he had been carrying your aunt thought you might need a maid  oh no said lydia i always help myself  ah i dare say returned her uncle you american ladies are soup to snuff as you say but your aunt thought wed better have her with us in any case  and she sent her all the way from venice  yes  well i never did said lydia not lightly but with something of contemptuous severity  her uncle smiled as if she had said something peculiarly acceptable to him and asked hesitatingly when you say you never did you know what is the full phrase  lydia looked at him oh i suppose i meant i never heard of such a thing  ah thanks thanks said her uncle he was a tall slender man of fiftyfive or sixty with a straight gray mustache and not at all the typical englishman but much more englishlooking than if he had been his bearing toward lydia blended a fatherly kindness and a colonial british gallantry such as one sees in elderly canadian gentlemen attentive to quite young canadian ladies at the provincial wateringplaces he had an air of adventure and of uncommon pleasure and no small astonishment in lydias beauty they were already good friends she was at her ease with him she treated him as if he were an old gentleman at the station where veronica got into the same carriage with them lydia found the whole train very queerlooking and he made her describe its difference from an american train he said oh yesyes engine when she mentioned the locomotive and he apparently prized beyond its worth the word cowcatcher a fixture which lydia said was wanting to the european locomotive and left it very stubby he asked her if she would allow him to set it down and he entered the word in his notebook with several other idioms she had used he said that he amused himself in picking up these things from his american friends he wished to know what she called this and that and the other thing and was equally pleased whether her nomenclature agreed or disagreed with his own where it differed he recorded the fact with her leave in his book he plied her with a thousand questions about america with all parts of which he seemed to think her familiar and she explained with difficulty how very little of it she had seen he begged her not to let him bore her and to excuse the curiosity of a britisher as i suppose youd call me he added  lydia lifted her longlashed lids halfway and answered no i shouldnt call you so  ah yes he returned the americans always disown it but i dont mind it at all you know i like those native expressions where they stopped for refreshments he observed that one of the dishes which was flavored to the national taste had a pretty tall smell and seemed disappointed by lydias unresponsive blankness at a word which a countryman of hersfrom kentuckyhad applied to the odor of the venetian canals he suffered in like measure from a like effect in her when he lamented the complications that had kept him the year before from going to america with mrs erwin when she revisited her old stompingground  as they rolled along the warm night which had fallen after the beautiful day breathed through the halfdropped window in a rich soft air as strange almost as the flying landscape itself mr erwin began to drowse and at last he fell asleep but veronica kept her eyes vigilantly fixed upon lydia always smiling when she caught her glance and offering service at the stations so orderly and yet so noisy where the passengers were held in the same meek subjection as at trieste people got in and out of the carriage and there were officers at first in white coats and after they passed the italian frontier in blue who stared at lydia one of the italians a handsome young hussar spoke to her she could not know what he said but when he crossed over to her side of the carriage she rose and took her place beside veronica where she remained even after he left the carriage she was sensible of growing drowsy then she was aware of nothing till she woke up with her head on veronicas shoulder against which she had fallen and on which she had been patiently supported for hours ecco venezia cried the old woman pointing to a swarm of lights that seemed to float upon an expanse of sea lydia did not understand she thought she was again on board the aroostook and that the lights she saw were the lights of the shipping in boston harbor the illusion passed and left her heart sore she issued from the glare of the station upon the quay before it bewildered by the ghostly beauty of the scene but shivering in the chill of the dawn and stunned by the clamor of the gondoliers a tortuous course in the shadow of lofty walls more deeply darkened from time to time by the arch of a bridge and again suddenly pierced by the brilliance of a lamp that shot its red across the gloom or plunged it into the black water brought them to a palace gate at which they stopped and where after a dramatic ceremony of sliding bolts and the reluctant yielding of broad doors on a level with the water she passed through a marblepaved court and up a stately marble staircase to her uncles apartment youre at home now you know he said in a kindly way and took her hand very cold and lax in his for welcome she could not answer but made haste to follow veronica to her room whither the old woman led the way with a candle it was a gloomily spacious chamber with sombre walls and a lofty ceiling with a faded splendor of gilded paneling some tall oldfashioned mirrors and bureaus stood about with rugs before them on the stone floor in the middle of the room was a bed curtained with mosquitonetting carved chairs were pushed here and there against the wall lydia dropped into one of these too strange and heavyhearted to go to bed in that vastness and darkness in which her candle seemed only to burn a small round hole she longed forlornly to be back again in her pretty stateroom on the aroostook vanishing glimpses and echoes of the faces and voices grown so familiar in the past weeks haunted her the helpless tears ran down her cheeks  there came a tap at her door and her aunts voice called shall i come in and before she could faintly consent her aunt pushed in and caught her in her arms and kissed her and broke into a twitter of welcome and compassion you poor child did you think i was going to let you go to sleep without seeing you after youd come half round the world to see me her aunt was dark and slight like lydia but not so tall she was still a very pretty woman and she was a very effective presence now in the long white morninggown of camels hair somewhat fantastically embroidered in crimson silk in which she drifted about before lydias bewildered eyes let me see how you look are you as handsome as ever she held the candle she carried so as to throw its light full upon lydias face yes she sighed how pretty you are and at your age youll look even better by daylight i had begun to despair of you i thought you couldnt be all i remembered but you areyoure more i wish i had you in rome instead of venice there would be some use in it theres a great deal of society thereenglish society but never mind im going to take you to church with me tomorrowthe english service there are lots of english in venice now on their way south for the winter im crazy to see what dresses youve brought your aunt maria has told me how she fitted you out ive got two letters from her since you started and theyre all perfectly well dear your black silk will do nicely with bright ribbons especially i hope you havent got it spotted or anything on the way over she did not allow lydia to answer nor seem to expect it youve got your mothers eyes lydia but your father had those straight eyebrows youre very much like him poor henry and now im having you get something to eat im not going to risk coffee on you for fear it will keep you awake though you can drink it in this climate with comparative impunity veronica is warming you a bowl of bouillon and thats all youre to have till breakfast  why aunt josephine said the girl not knowing what bouillon was and abashed by the sound of it im not the least hungry you oughtnt to take the trouble  youll be hungry when you begin to eat im so impatient to hear about your voyage i am going to introduce you to some very nice people hereenglish people there are no americans living in venice and the americans in europe are so queer youve no idea how droll our customs seem here and i much prefer the english your poor uncle can never get me to ask americans i tell him im american enough and hell have to get on without others of course hes perfectly delighted to get at you youve quite taken him by storm lydia hes in raptures about your looks its what i told him before you came but i couldnt believe it till i took a look at you i couldnt have gone to sleep without it did mr erwin talk much with you  he was very pleasant he talkedas long as he was awake said lydia  i suppose he was trying to pick up americanisms from you hes always doing it i keep him away from americans as much as i can but he will get at them on the cars and at the hotels hes always asking them such ridiculous questions and i know some of them just talk nonsense to him  veronica came in with a tray and a bowl of bouillon on it and mrs erwin pulled up a light table and slid about serving her in her cabalistic dress like an oriental sorceress performing her incantations she volubly watched lydia while she ate her supper and at the end she kissed her again now you feel better she said i knew it would cheer you up more than any one thing theres nothing like something to eat when youre homesick i found that out when i was off at school  lydia was hardly kissed so much at home during a year as she had been since meeting mrs erwin her aunt maria sparely embraced her when she went and came each week from the mill village anything more than this would have come of insincerity between them but it had been agreed that mrs erwins demonstrations of affection of which she had been lavish during her visit to south bradfield might not be so false lydia accepted them submissively and she said when veronica returned for the tray i hate to give you so much trouble and sending her all the way to trieste on my accounti felt ashamed there wasn a thing for her to do  why of course not exclaimed her aunt but what did you think i was made of did you suppose i was going to have you come on a nightjourney alone with your uncle it would have been all over venice it would have been ridiculous i sent veronica along for a dragon  a dragon i dont understand faltered lydia  well you will said her aunt putting the palms of her hands against lydias and so pressing forward to kiss her we shall have breakfast at ten go to bed     xxiii   when lydia came to breakfast she found her uncle alone in the room reading galignanis messenger he put down his paper and came forward to take her hand you are all right this morning i see miss lydia he said you were quite up a stump last night as your countrymen say  at the same time hands were laid upon her shoulders from behind and she was pulled half round and pushed back and held at armslength it was mrs erwin who entering after her first scanned her face and then with one devouring glance seized every detail of her dressthe black silk which had already made its effectbefore she kissed her you are lovely my dear i shall spoil you i know but youre worth it what lashes you have child and your aunt maria made and fitted that dress shes a genius  miss lydia said mr erwin as they sat down is of the fortunate age when one rises young every morning he looked very fresh himself in his cleanshaven chin and his striking evidence of snowy wristbands and shirtbosom later in life you cant do that she looks as blooming he added gallantly as a basket of chipsas you say in america  smiling said lydia mechanically correcting him  ah it is smilingyes thanks its very good either way very characteristic it would be curious to know the origin of a saying like that i imagine it goes back to the days of the first settlers it suggests a woodchopping period is itahin general use he inquired  of course it isnt henshaw said his wife  youve been a great while out of the country my dear suggested mr erwin  not so long as not to know that your americanisms are enough to make one wish we had held our tongues ever since we were discovered or had never been discovered at all i want to ask lydia about her voyage i havent heard a word yet did your aunt maria come down to boston with you  no grandfather brought me  and you had good weather coming over mr erwin told me you were not seasick  we had one bad storm before we reached gibraltar but i wasnt seasick  were the other passengers  one was lydia reddened a little and then turned somewhat paler than at first  what is it lydia her aunt subtly demanded who was the one that was sick  oh a gentleman answered lydia  her aunt looked at her keenly and for whatever reason abruptly left the subject your silk she said will do very well for church lydia  oh i say now cried her husband youre not going to make her go to church today  yes i am there will be more people there today than any other time this fall she must go  but shes tired to deathquite tuckered you know  oh im rested now said lydia i shouldnt like to miss going to church  your silk continued her aunt will be quite the thing for church she looked hard at the dress as if it were not quite the thing for breakfast mrs erwin herself wore a morningdress of becoming delicacy and an airy french cap she had a light fall of powder on her face what kind of overthing have you got she asked  theres a sack goes with this said the girl suggestively  thats nice what is your bonnet  i havent any bonnet but my best hat is nice i could  no one goes to church in a hat you cant do it its simply impossible  why my dear said her husband i saw some very pretty american girls in hats at church last sunday  yes and everybody knew they were americans by their hats retorted mrs erwin  i knew they were americans by their good looks said mr erwin and what you call their stylishness  oh its all well enough for you to talk youre an englishman and you could wear a hat if you liked it would be set down to character but in an american it would be set down to greenness if you were an american you would have to wear a bonnet  im glad then im not an american said her husband i dont think i should look well in a bonnet  oh stuff henshaw you know what i mean and im not going to have english people thinking were ignorant of the common decencies of life lydia shall not go to church in a hat she had better never go i will lend her one of my bonnets let me see which one she gazed at lydia in critical abstraction i wear rather young bonnets she mused aloud and were both rather dark the only difficulty is im so much more delicate she brooded upon the question in a silence from which she burst exulting the very thing i can fuss it up in no time it wont take two minutes to get it ready and youll look just killing in it she turned grave again henshaw she said i wish you would go to church this morning  i would do almost anything for you josephine but really you know you oughtnt to ask that i was there last sunday i cant go every sunday its bad enough in england a man ought to have some relief on the continent  well well i suppose i oughtnt to ask you sighed his wife especially as youre going with us tonight  ill go tonight with pleasure said mr erwin he rose when his wife and lydia left the table and opened the door for them with a certain courtesy he had it struck even lydias uneducated sense as something peculiarly sweet and fine and it did not overawe her own simplicity but seemed of kind with it  the bonnet when put to proof did not turn out to be all that it was vaunted it looked a little odd from the first and mrs erwin when she was herself dressed ended by taking it off and putting on lydia the hat previously condemned youre divine in that she said and after all you are a traveler and i can say that some of your things were spoiled coming overpeople always get things ruined in a sea voyageand theyll think it was your bonnet  i kept my things very nicely aunt josephine said lydia conscientiously i dont believe anything was hurt  oh well you cant tell till youve unpacked and were not responsible for what people happen to think you know wait her aunt suddenly cried she pulled open a drawer and snatched two ribbons from it which she pinned to the sides of lydias hat and tied in a bow under her chin she caught out a lace veil and drew that over the front of the hat and let it hang in a loose knot behind now she said pushing her up to a mirror that she might see its a bonnet and i neednt say anything  they went in mrs erwins gondola to the palace in which the english service was held and lydia was silent as she looked shyly almost fearfully round on the visionary splendors of venice  mrs erwin did not like to be still what are you thinking of lydia she asked  oh i suppose i was thinking that the leaves were beginning to turn in the sugar orchard answered lydia faithfully i was thinking how still the sun would be in the pastures there this morning i suppose the stillness here put me in mind of it one of these bells has the same tone as our bell at home  yes said mrs erwin everybody finds a familiar bell in venice there are enough of them goodness knows i dont see why you call it still with all this clashing and banging i suppose this seems very odd to you lydia she continued indicating the general venetian effect its an old story to me though the great beauty of venice is that you get more for your money here than you can anywhere else in the world there isnt much society however and you mustnt expect to be very gay  i have never been gay said lydia  well thats no reason you shouldnt be returned her aunt if you were in florence or rome or even naples you could have a good time there im glad your uncle didnt hear me say that  what asked lydia  good time thats an americanism  is it  yes hes perfectly delighted when he catches me in one i try to break myself of them but i dont always know them myself sometimes i feel almost like never talking at all but you cant do that you know  no assented lydia  and you have to talk americanisms if youre an american you mustnt think your uncle isnt obliging lydia he is i oughtnt to have asked him to go to churchit bores him so much i used to feel terribly about it once when we were first married but things have changed very much of late years especially with all this scientific talk in england its quite different from what it used to be some of the best people in society are skeptics now and that makes it quite another thing lydia looked grave but she said nothing and her aunt added i wouldnt have asked him but i had a little headache myself  aunt josephine said lydia im afraid youre doing too much for me why didnt you let me come alone  come alone to church mrs erwin addressed her in a sort of whispered shriek it would have been perfectly scandalous  to go to church alone demanded lydia astounded  yes a young girl mustnt go anywhere alone  why  ill explain to you sometime lydia or rather youll learn for yourself in italy its very different from what it is in america mrs erwin suddenly started up and bowed with great impressiveness as a gondola swept towards them the gondoliers wore shirts of blue silk and long crimson sashes on the cushions of the boat beside a hideous little man who was sucking the top of an ivoryhandled stick reclined a beautiful woman pale with purplish rings round the large black eyes with which faintly smiling she acknowledged mrs erwins salutation and then stared at lydia  oh you may look and you may look and you may look cried mrs erwin under her breath youve met more than your match at last the countess tatocka she explained to lydia that was her palace we passed just nowthe one with the iron balconies did you notice the gentleman with her she always takes to those monsters hes a neapolitan painter and ever so talentedclever that is hes dead in love with her they say  are they engaged asked lydia  engaged exclaimed mrs erwin with her shriek in dumb show why child shes married  to him demanded the girl with a recoil  no to her husband  to her husband gasped lydia and she  why she isnt quite well seen even in venice mrs erwin explained but shes rich and her conversazioni are perfectly brilliant shes very artistic and she writes poetrypolish poetry i wish she could hear you sing lydia i know shell be frantic to see you again but i dont see how its to be managed her house isnt one you can take a young girl to and i cant ask her your uncle detests her  do you go to her house lydia inquired stiffly  why as a foreigner i can go of course lydia you cant be as particular about everything on the continent as you are at home  the former oratory of the palazzo grinzelli which served as the english chapel was filled with travelers of both the englishspeaking nationalities as distinguishable by their dress as by their faces lydias aunt affected the english style but some instinctive elegance betrayed her and every englishwoman there knew and hated her for an american though she was a precisian in her liturgy instant in all the responses and genuflexions she found opportunity in the course of the lesson to make lydia notice every one and she gave a telegrammic biography of each person she knew with a criticism of the costume of all the strangers managing so skillfully that by the time the sermon began she was able to yield the text a statuesquely close attention and might have been carved in marble where she sat as a realistic conception of worship  the sermon came to an end the ritual proceeded the hymn with the hemming and hawing of respectable inability began and lydia lifted her voice with the rest few of the people were in their own church some turned and stared at her the bonnets and the back hair of those who did not look were intent upon her the long red neck of one elderly englishman restrained by decorum from turning his head toward her perspired with curiosity mrs erwin fidgeted and dropped her eyes from the glances which fell to her for explanation of lydia and hurried away with her as soon as the services ended in the hall on the waterfloor of the palace where they were kept waiting for their gondola a while she seemed to shrink even from the small surly greetings with which people whose thoughts are on higher things permit themselves to recognize fellowbeings of their acquaintance in coming out of church but an old lady who supported herself with a cane pushed through the crowd to where they stood aloof and without speaking to mrs erwin put out her hand to lydia she had a strong undaunted plain face in which was expressed the habit of doing what she liked my dear she said how wonderfully you sing where did you get that heavenly voice you are an american i see that by your beauty you are mrs erwins niece i suppose whom she expected will you come and sing to me you must bring her mrs erwin  she hobbled away without waiting for an answer and lydia and her aunt got into their gondola oh how glad i am cried mrs erwin in a joyful flutter shes the very tiptop of the english here she has a whole palace and you meet the very best people at her house i was afraid when you were singing lydia that they would think your voice was too good to be good formthats an expression you must get it means everythingit sounded almost professional i wanted to nudge you to sing a little lower or different or something but i couldnt everybody was looking so no matter its all right now if she liked it nobody else will dare to breathe you can see that she has taken a fancy to you shell make a great pet of you  who is she asked lydia bluntly  lady fenleigh such a characterso eccentric but really i suppose very hard to live with it must have been quite a release for poor sir fenleigh  she didnt seem in mourning said lydia has he been dead long  why he isnt dead at all he is what you call a grasswidower the best soul in the world everybody says and very very fond of her but she couldnt stand it he was too good dont you understand theyve lived apart a great many years shes lived a great deal in asia minorsomewhere she likes venice but of course theres no telling how long she may stay she has another house in florence all ready to go and be lived in at a days notice i wish i had presented you it did go through my head but it didnt seem as if i could get the blood out it is a fearful name lydia i always felt it so when i was a girl and i was so glad to marry out of it and it sounds so terribly american i think you must take your mothers name my dear latham is rather flattish but its worlds better than blood  i am not ashamed of my fathers name said lydia  but youll have to change it some day at any ratewhen you get married  lydia turned away i will be called blood till then if lady fenleigh  yes my dear promptly interrupted her aunt i know that sort of independence i used to have whole declarations of it but youll get over that in europe there was a timejust after the warwhen the english quite liked our sticking up for ourselves but thats past now they like us to be outlandish but they dont like us to be independent how did you like the sermon didnt you think we had a nicelydressed congregation  i thought the sermon was very short answered lydia  well thats the english way and i like it if you get in all the service you must make the sermon short  lydia did not say anything for a little while then she asked is the service the same at the evening meeting  evening meeting repeated mrs erwin  yesthe church tonight  why child there isnt any church tonight what are you talking about  didnt uncledidnt mr erwin say he would go with us tonight  mrs erwin seemed about to laugh and then she looked embarrassed why lydia she cried at last he didnt mean church he meant opera  opera sunday night aunt josephine do you go to the theatre on sabbath evening  there was something appalling in the girls stern voice mrs erwin gathered herself tremulously together for defense why of course lydia i dont approve of it though i never was orthodox your uncle likes to go and if everybodys there that you want to see and they will give the best operas sunday night what are you to do  lydia said nothing but a hard look came into her face and she shut her lips tight  now you see lydia resumed her aunt with an air of deductive reasoning from the premises the advantage of having a bonnet on even if its only a makebelieve i dont believe a soul knew it all those americans had hats you were the only american girl there with a bonnet im sure that it had more than half to do with lady fenleighs speaking to you it showed that you had been well brought up  but i never wore a bonnet to church at home said lydia  that has nothing to do with it if they thought you did and lydia she continued i was thinking while you were singing there that i wouldnt say anything at once about your coming over to cultivate your voice thats got to be such an american thing now ill let it out little by littleand after lady fenleighs quite taken you under her wing perhaps we may go to milan with you or to naplestheres a conservatory there too and we can pull up stakes as easily as not well said mrs erwin interrupting herself im glad henshaw wasnt by to hear that speech hed have had it down among his americanisms instantly i dont know whether it is an americanism but he puts down all the outlandish sayings he gets hold of to americans he has no end of english slang in his book everything has opened beautifully lydia and i intend you shall have the best time she looked fondly at her brothers child youve no idea how much you remind me of your poor father you have his looks exactly i always thought he would come out to europe before he died we used to be so proud of his looks at home i can remember that though i was the youngest and he was ten years older than i but i always did worship beauty a perfect greek mr roseblack calls me youll see him hes an english painter staying here he comes a great deal  mrs erwin mrs erwin called a ladys voice from a gondola behind them the accent was perfectly english but the voice entirely italian where are you running to  why miss landini retorted mrs erwin looking back over her shoulder is that you where in the world are you going  oh ive been to pay a visit to my old english teacher hes awfully ill with rheumatism but awfully he cant turn in bed  why poor man this is my niece whom i told you i was expecting arrived last night weve been to church mrs erwin exclaimed each of the facts  the italian girl stretched her hand across the gunwales of the boats which their respective gondoliers had brought skillfully side by side and took lydias hand im glad to see you my dear but my god how beautiful you americans are but you dont look american you know you look spanish i shall come a great deal to see you and practice my english  come home with us now miss landini and have lunch said mrs erwin  no my dear i cant my aunt will be raising the devil if im not there to drink coffee with her and ive been a great while away now till tomorrow miss landinis gondolier pushed his boat away and rowed it up a narrow canal on the right  i suppose mrs erwin explained that shes really her mother everybody says so but she always calls her aunt dear knows who her father was but shes a very bright girl lydia and youll like her dont you think she speaks english wonderfully for a person whos never been out of venice  why does she swear asked lydia stonily  swear oh i know what you mean thats the funniest thing about miss landini your uncle says its a shame to correct her but i do whenever i think of it why you know such words as god and devil dont sound at all wicked in italian and ladies use them quite commonly she understands that it isnt good form to do so in english but when she gets excited she forgets well you cant say but what she was impressed lydia  after lunch various people came to call upon mrs erwin several of them were italians who were learning english and they seemed to think it inoffensive to say that they were glad of the opportunity to practice the language with lydia they talked local gossip with her aunt and they spoke of an approaching visit to venice from the king it seemed to lydia that the kings character was not good  mr roseblack the english artist came he gave himself the effect of being in mrs erwins confidence apparently without her authority and he bestowed a share of this intimacy upon lydia he had the manner of a man who had been taken up by people above him and the impudence of a talent which had not justified the expectations formed of it he softly reproached mrs erwin for running away after service before he could speak to her and told her how much everybody had been enchanted by her nieces singing at least they said it was your niece  oh yes mr roseblack let me introduce you to miss lydia looked hard even to threatening at her aunt and mrs erwin added blood  i beg your pardon said mr roseblack with his pickedup politeness i didnt get the name  blood said mrs erwin more distinctly  aöh said mr roseblack in a castoff accent of jaded indifferentism just touched with displeasure yes he added dreamily to lydia it was divine you know you might say it needed training but it had the naïve sweetness we associate with your countrywomen theyre greatly admired in england now you know for their beauty oh i assure you its quite the thing to admire american ladies i want to arrange a little lunch at my studio for mrs erwin and yourself and i want you to abet me in it miss blood lydia stared at him but he was not troubled im going to ask to sketch you really you know theres a poisesomething birdlike a sort of repose in movement he sat in a corner of the sofa with his head fallen back and abandoned to an absent enjoyment of lydias pictorial capabilities he was very red his full beard which started as straw color changed to red when it got a little way from his face he wore a suit of rough blue the coat buttoned tightly about him and he pulled a glove through his hand as he talked he was scarcely roused from his reverie by the entrance of an italian officer with his hussar jacket hanging upon one shoulder and his sword caught up in his left hand he ran swiftly to mrs erwin and took her hand  ah my compliments i come practice my english with you a little is it well said a little or do you say a small  a little cavaliere answered mrs erwin amiably but you must say a good deal in this case  yes yesgood deal for what  let me introduce you to my niece colonel pazzelli said mrs erwin  ah too much honor too much honor murmured the cavaliere he brought his heels together with a click and drooped towards lydia till his head was on a level with his hips recovering himself he caught up his eyeglasses and bent them on lydia very please very honored much he stopped and looked confused and lydia turned pale and red  now wont you play that pretty barcarole you played the other night at lady fenleighs entreated mrs erwin  colonel pazzelli wrenched himself from the fascination of lydias presence and lavished upon mrs erwin the hoarded english of a week yes yes very nice very good with much pleasure i thank you yes i play he was one of those natives who in all the great italian cities haunt englishspeaking societies they try to drink tea without grimacing and sing for the ladies of our race who innocently pet them finding them so very like other women in their ladylike sweetness and softness it is said they boast among their own countrymen of their triumphs the cavaliere unbuckled his sword and laying it across a chair sat down at the piano he played not one but many barcaroles and seemed loath to leave the instrument  now lydia said mrs erwin fondly wont you sing us something  do called mr roseblack from the sofa with the intonation of a spoiled firstcousin or halfbrother  i dont feel like singing today answered lydia immovably mrs erwin was about to urge her further but other people came insome jewish ladies and then a russian whom lydia took at first for an american they all came and went but mr roseblack remained in his corner of the sofa and never took his eyes from lydias face at last he went and then mr erwin looked in  is that beast gone he asked i shall be obliged to show him the door yet josephine you ought to snub him hes worse than his pictures well youve had a whole raft of folks todayas your countrymen say  yes thank heaven cried mrs erwin and theyre all gone i dont want lydia to think that i let everybody come to see me on sunday thursday is my day lydia but a few privileged friends understand that they can drop in sunday afternoon she gave lydia a sketch of the life and character of each of these friends and now i must tell you that your manner is very good lydia that reserved way of yours is quite the thing for a young girl in europe i suppose its a gift i never could get it even when i was a girl but you mustnt show any hauteur even when you dislike people and you refused to sing with rather too much aplomb i dont suppose it was noticed thoughthose ladies coming in at the same time really i thought mr roseblack and colonel pazzelli were trying to outstare each other it was certainly amusing i never saw such an evident case lydia the poor cavaliere looked as if he had seen you somewhere before in a dream and was struggling to make it all out  lydia remained impassive presently she said she would go to her room and write home before dinner when she went out mrs erwin fetched a deep sigh and threw herself upon her husbands sympathy  shes terribly unresponsive she began i supposed shed be in raptures with the place at least but you wouldnt know there was anything at all remarkable in venice from anything shes said we have met ever so many interesting people todaythe countess tatocka and lady fenleigh and miss landini and everybody but i dont really think shes said a word about a soul shes too queer for anything  i dare say she hasnt the experience to be astonished from suggested mr erwin easily shes here as if shed been dropped down from her village  yes thats true considered his wife but its hard with lydias air and style and selfpossession to realize that she is merely a village girl  she may be much more impressed than she chooses to show mr erwin continued i remember a very curious essay by a french writer about your countrymen he contended that they were characterized by a savage stoicism through their contact with the indians  nonsense henshaw there hasnt been an indian near south bradfield for two hundred years and besides that am i stoical  im bound to say replied her husband that so far as you go youre a complete refutation of the theory  i hate to see a young girl so close fretted mrs erwin but perhaps she added more cheerfully shell be the easier managed being so passive she doesnt seem at all willfulthats one comfort  she went to lydias room just before dinner and found the girl with her head fallen on her arms upon the table where she had been writing she looked up and faced her aunt with swollen eyes  why poor thing cried mrs erwin what is it dear what is it lydia she asked tenderly and she pulled lydias face down upon her neck  oh nothing said lydia i suppose i was a little homesick writing home made me  she somewhat coldly suffered mrs erwin to kiss her and smooth her hair while she began to talk with her of her grandfather and her aunt at home but this is going to be home to you now said mrs erwin and im not going to let you be sick for any other i want you to treat me just like a mother or an older sister perhaps i shant be the wisest mother to you in the world but i mean to be one of the best come now bathe your eyes my dear and lets go to dinner i dont like to keep your uncle waiting she did not go at once but showed lydia the appointments of the room and lightly indicated what she had caused to be done and what she had done with her own hands to make the place pretty for her and now shall i take your letter and have your uncle post it this evening she picked up the letter from the table hadnt you any wax to seal it you know they dont generally mucilage their envelopes in europe  lydia blushed i left it open for you to read i thought you ought to know what i wrote  mrs erwin dropped her hands in front of her with the open letter stretched between them and looked at her niece in rapture lydia she cried one would suppose you had lived all your days in europe showing me your letter this waywhy its quite like a continental girl  i thought it was no more than right you should see what i was writing home said lydia unresponsively  well no matter even if it was right replied mrs erwin it comes to the same thing and now as youve been quite a european daughter im going to be a real american mother she took up the wax and sealed lydias letter without looking into it there she said triumphantly  she was very good to lydia all through dinner and made her talk of the simple life at home and the village characters whom she remembered from her last summers visit that amused mr erwin who several times when his wife was turning the talk upon lydias voyage over intervened with some new question about the life of the queer little yankee hilltown he said she must tell lady fenleigh about itshe was fond of picking up those curios it would make any ones social fortune who could explain such a place intelligibly in london when they got to having typical villages of the different civilizations at the international expositionsas no doubt they wouldsomebody must really send south bradfield over he pleased himself vastly with this fancy till mrs erwin who had been eying lydia critically from time to time as if making note of her features and complexion said she had a white cloak and that in venice where one need not dress a great deal for the opera lydia could wear it that night  lydia looked up in astonishment but she sat passive during her aunts discussion of her plans when they rose from table she said at her stiffest and coldest aunt josephine i want you to excuse me from going with you tonight i dont feel like going  not feel like going exclaimed her aunt in dismay why your uncle has taken a box  lydia opposed nothing to this argument she only said i would rather not go  oh but you will dear coaxed her aunt you would enjoy it so much  i thought you understood from what i said today replied lydia that i could not go  why no i didnt i knew you objected but if i thought it was proper for you to go  i should not go at home said lydia in the same immovable fashion  of course not every place has its customs and in venice it has always been the custom to go to the opera on sunday night this fact had no visible weight with lydia and after a pause her aunt added didnt paul himself say to do in rome as the romans do  no aunt josephine cried lydia indignantly he did not  mrs erwin turned to her husband with a face of appeal and he answered really my dear i think youre mistaken i always had the impression that the saying wasan americanism of some sort  but it doesnt matter interposed lydia decisively i couldnt go if i didnt think it was right whoever said it  oh well began mrs erwin if you wouldnt mind what paul said she suddenly checked herself and after a little silence she resumed kindly i wont try to force you lydia i didnt realize what a very short time it is since you left home and how you still have all those ideas i wouldnt distress you about them for the world my dear i want you to feel at home with me and ill make it as like home for you as i can in everything henshaw i think you must go alone this evening i will stay with lydia  oh no no i couldnt let you i cant let you i shall not know what to do if i keep you at home oh dont leave it that way please i shall feel so badly about it  why we can both stay suggested mr erwin kindly  lydias lips trembled and her eyes glistened and mrs erwin said ill go with you henshaw ill be ready in half an hour i wont dress much she added this as if not to dress a great deal at the opera sunday night might somehow be accepted as an observance of the sabbath     xxiv   the next morning veronica brought lydia a little scrawl from her aunt bidding the girl come and breakfast with her in her room at nine  well my dear her aunt called to her from her pillow when she appeared you find me flat enough this morning if there was anything wrong about going to the opera last night i was properly punished for it such wretched stuff as i never heard and instead of the new ballet that they promised they gave an old thing that i had seen till i was sick of it you didnt miss much i can tell you how fresh and bright you do look lydia she sighed did you sleep well were you lonesome while we were gone veronica says you were reading the whole evening are you fond of reading  i dont think i am very said lydia it was a book that i began on the ship its a novel she hesitated i wasnt reading it i was just looking at it  what a queer child you are i suppose you were dying to read it and wouldnt because it was sunday well mrs erwin put her hand under her pillow and pulled out a gossamer handkerchief with which she delicately touched her complexion here and there and repaired with an instinctive rearrangement of powder the envious ravages of a slight rash about her nose i respect your high principles beyond anything lydia and if they can only be turned in the right direction they will never be any disadvantage to you veronica came in with the breakfast on a tray and mrs erwin added now pull up that little table and bring your chair my dear and let us take it easy i like to talk while im breakfasting will you pour out my chocolate thats it in the ugly little pot with the wooden handle the copper ones for you with coffee in it i never could get that repose which seems to come perfectly natural to you i was always inclined to be a little rowdy my dear and ive had to fight hard against it without any help from either of my husbands men like it they think its funny when i was first married i was very young and so was he it was a real love match and my husband was very well off and when i began to be delicate nothing would do but he must come to europe with me how little i ever expected to outlive him  you dont look very sick now began lydia  ill said her aunt you must say ill sick is an americanism  its in the bible said lydia gravely  oh there are a great many words in the bible you cant use returned her aunt no i dont look ill now and im worlds better but i couldnt live a year in any other climate i suppose you seem to take after your mothers side well as i was saying the european ways didnt come natural to me at all i used to have a great deal of gayety when i was a girl and i liked beaux and attentions and i had very free ways i couldnt get their stiffness here for years and years and all through my widowhood it was one wretched failure with me do what i would i was always violating the most essential rules and the worst of it was that it only seemed to make me the more popular i do believe it was nothing but my rowdiness that attracted mr erwin but i determined when i had got an englishman i would make one bold strike for the proprieties and have them or die in the attempt i determined that no englishwoman i ever saw should outdo me in strict conformity to all the usages of european society so i cut myself off from all the americans and went with nobody but the english  do you like them better asked lydia with the blunt childlike directness that had already more than once startled her aunt  like them i detest them if mr erwin were a real englishman i think i should go crazy but hes been so little in his own country all his life in india nearly and the rest on the continentthat hes quite human and no american husband was ever more patient and indulgent and thats saying a good deal he would be glad to have nothing but americans around he has an enthusiasm for themor for what he supposes they are like the english you ought to have heard them during our war it would have made your blood boil and then how they came crawling round after it was all over and trying to pet us up ugh  if you feel so about them said lydia as before why do you want to go with them so much  my dear cried her aunt to beat them with their own weapons on their own groundto show them that an american can be more european than any of them if she chooses and now youve come here with looks and temperament and everything just to my hand youre more beautiful than any english girl ever dreamt of being youre very distinguishedlooking your voice is perfectly divine and youre colder than an iceberg oh if i only had one winter with you in rome i think i should die in peace mrs erwin paused and drank her chocolate which she had been letting cool in the eagerness of her discourse but never mind she continued we will do the best we can here ive seen english girls going out two or three together without protection in rome and florence but i mean that you shall be quite italian in that respect the italians never go out without a chaperone of some sort and you must never be seen without me or your uncle or veronica now ill tell you how you must do at parties and so on you must be very retiring youre that any way but you must always keep close to me it doesnt do for young people to talk much together in society it makes scandal about a girl if you dance you must always hurry back to me dear me exclaimed mrs erwin i remember how when i was a girl i used to hang on to the young mens arms and promenade with them after a dance and go out to supper with them and flirt on the stairssuch times but that wouldnt do here lydia it would ruin a girls reputation she could hardly walk arm in arm with a young man if she was engaged to him lydia blushed darkly red and then turned paler than usual while her aunt went on you might do it perhaps and have it set down to american eccentricity or underbreeding but im not going to have that i intend you to be just as dull and diffident in society as if you were an italian and more than if you were english your voice of course is a difficulty if you sing that will make you conspicuous in spite of everything but i dont see why that cant be turned to advantage its no worse than your beauty yes if youre so splendid looking and so gifted and at the same time as stupid as the rest its so much clear gain it will come easy for you to be shy with men for i suppose youve hardly ever talked with any living up there in that outoftheway village and your manner is very good its reserved and yet it isnt green the way continued mrs erwin to treat men in europe is to behave as if they were guilty till they prove themselves innocent all you have to do is to reverse all your american ideas but here i am lecturing you as if you had been just such a girl as i was with half a dozen love affairs on her hands at once and no end of gentlemen friends europe wont be hard for you my dear for you havent got anything to unlearn but some girls that come overits perfectly ridiculous the trouble they get into and the time they have getting things straight they take it for granted that men in good society are gentlemenwhat we mean by gentlemen  lydia had been letting her coffee stand and had scarcely tasted the delicious french bread and the sweet lombard butter of which her aunt ate so heartily why child said mrs erwin at last where is your appetite one would think you were the elderly invalid who had been up late did you find it too exciting to sit at home looking at a novel what was it if its a new story i should like to see it but you didnt bring a novel from south bradfield with you  no said lydia with a husky reluctance one of thepassengers gave it to me  had you many passengers but of course not that was what made it so delightful when i came over that way i was newly married then and with spiritsoh dear mefor anything it was one adventure the whole way and we got so well acquainted it was like one family i suppose your grandfather put you in charge of some family i know artists sometimes come out that way and people for their health  there was no family on our ship said lydia my stateroom had been fixed up for the captains wife  our captains wife was along too interposed mrs erwin she was such a joke with us she had been out to venice on a voyage before and used to be always talking about the ducal palace and did they really turn out of their stateroom for you  she was not along said lydia  not along repeated mrs erwin feebly whowho were the other passengers  there were three gentlemen answered lydia  three gentlemen three men threeand youand mrs erwin fell back upon her pillow and remained gazing at lydia with a sort of remote bewildered pity as at perdition not indeed beyond compassion but far beyond help lydias color had been coming and going but now it settled to a clear white mrs erwin commanded herself sufficiently to resume and there werethere wereno other ladies  no  and you were  i was the only woman on board replied lydia she rose abruptly striking the edge of the table in her movement and setting its china and silver jarring oh i know what you mean aunt josephine but two days ago i couldnt have dreamt it from the time the ship sailed till i reached this wicked place there wasnt a word said nor a look looked to make me think i wasnt just as right and safe there as if i had been in my own room at home they were never anything but kind and good to me they never let me think that they could be my enemies or that i must suspect them and be on the watch against them they were americans i had to wait for one of your europeans to teach me thatfor that officer who was here yesterday  the cavaliere why where  he spoke to me in the cars when mr erwin was asleep had he any right to do so  he would think he had if he thought you were alone said mrs erwin plaintively i dont see how we could resent it it was simply a mistake on his part and now you see lydia  oh i see how my coming the way i have will seem to all these people cried lydia with passionate despair i know how it will seem to that married woman who lets a man be in love with her and that old woman who cant live with her husband because hes too good and kind and that girl who swears and doesnt know who her father is and that impudent painter and that officer who thinks he has the right to insult women if he finds them alone i wonder the sea doesnt swallow up a place where even americans go to the theatre on the sabbath  lydia lydia it isnt so bad as it seems to you pleaded her aunt thrown upon the defensive by the girls outburst there are ever so many good and nice people in venice and i know them tooitalians as well as foreigners and even amongst those you saw miss landini is one of the kindest girls in the world and she had just been to see her old teacher when we met hershe half takes care of him and lady fenleighs a perfect mother to the poor and i never was at the countess tatockas except in the most distant way at a ball where everybody went and is it better to let your uncle go to the opera alone or to go with him you told me to go with him yourself and they consider sunday over on the continent after morning service any way  oh it makes no difference retorted lydia wildly i am going away i am going home i have money enough to get to trieste and the ship is there and captain jenness will take me back with him oh she moaned he has been in europe too and i suppose hes like the rest of you and he thought because i was alone and helpless he had the right tooh i see it i see now that he never meant anything andoh oh oh she fell on her knees beside the bed as if crushed to them by the cruel doubt that suddenly overwhelmed her and flung out her arms on mrs erwins coverletit was of venetian lace sewed upon silk a choice bit from the palace of one of the ducal familiesand buried her face in it  her aunt rose from her pillow and looked in wonder and trouble at the beautiful fallen head and the fair young figure shaken with sobs hewhowhat are you talking about lydia whom do you mean did captain jenness  no no wailed the girl the one that gave me the book  the one that gave you the book the book you were looking at last night  yes sobbed lydia with her voice muffled in the coverlet  mrs erwin lay down again with significant deliberation her face was still full of trouble but of bewilderment no longer in moments of great distress the female mind is apt to lay hold of some minor anxiety for its distraction and to find a certain relief in it lydia said her aunt in a broken voice i wish you wouldnt cry in the coverlet it doesnt hurt the lace but it stains the silk lydia swept her handkerchief under her face but did not lift it her aunt accepted the compromise how came he to give you the book  oh i dont know i cant tell i thought it was becausebecause it was almost at the very beginning and after that he walked up and down with me every night nearly and he tried to be with me all he could and he was always saying things to make me thinkoh dear oh dear oh dear and he tried to make me care for him oh it was cruel cruel  you mean that he made love to you asked her aunt  yesnoi dont know he tried to make me care for him and to make me think he cared for me  did he say he cared for you did he  no  mrs erwin mused a while before she said yes it was cruel indeed poor child and it was cowardly too  cowardly lydia lifted her face and flashed a glance of tearful fire at her aunt he is the bravest man in the world and the most generous and highminded he jumped into the sea after that wicked mr hicks and saved his life when he disliked him worse than anything  who was mr hicks  he was the one that stopped at messina he was the one that got some brandy at gibraltar and behaved so dreadfully and wanted to fight him  whom  this one the one who gave me the book and dont you see that his being so good makes it all the worse yes and he pretended to be glad when i told him i thought he was goodhe got me to say it she had her face down again in her handkerchief and i suppose you think it was horrible too for me to take his arm and talk and walk with him whenever he asked me  no not for you lydia said her aunt gently and dont you think now she asked after a pause that he cared for you  oh i did think soi did believe it but now now  now what  now im afraid that may be he was only playing with me and putting me off and pretending that he had something to tell me when he got to venice and he never meant anything by anything  is he coming to her aunt began but lydia broke vehemently out again  if he had cared for me why couldnt he have told me so at once and not had me wait till he got to venice he knew i  there are two ways of explaining it said mrs erwin he may have been in earnest lydia and felt that he had no right to be more explicit till you were in the care of your friends that would be the european way which you consider so bad said mrs erwin under the circumstances it was impossible for him to keep any distance and all he could do was to postpone his declaration till there could be something like good form about it yes it might have been that she was silent but the troubled look did not leave her face i am sorry for you lydia she resumed but i dont know that i wish he was in earnest lydia looked up at her in dismay it might be far less embarrassing the other way however painful he may not be at all a suitable person the tears stood in lydias eyes and all her face expressed a puzzled suspense where was he from asked mrs erwin finally till then she had been more interested in the lover than the man  boston mechanically answered lydia  what was his name  mr staniford owned lydia with a blush  her aunt seemed dispirited at the sound yes i know who they are she sighed  and arent they nice isnt hesuitable asked lydia tremulously  oh poor child hes only too suitable i cant explain to you lydia but at home he wouldnt have looked at a girl like you what sort of looking person is he  hes ratherred and he haslight hair  it must be the family im thinking of said mrs erwin she had lived nearly twenty years in europe and had seldom revisited her native city but at the sound of a boston name she was all bostonian again she rapidly sketched the history of the family to which she imagined staniford to belong i remember his sister i used to see her at school she must have been five or six years younger than i and this boy  why hes twentyeight years old interrupted lydia  how came he to tell you  i dont know he said that he looked thirtyfour  yes she was always a forward thing toowith her freckles said mrs erwin musingly as if lost in reminiscences not wholly pleasing of miss staniford  he has freckles admitted lydia  yes its the one said mrs erwin he couldnt have known what your family was from anything you said  we never talked about our families  oh i dare say you talked about yourselves  yes  all the time  pretty nearly  and he didnt try to find out who or what you were  he asked a great deal about south bradfield  of course that was where he thought you had always belonged mrs erwin lay quiescent for a while in apparent uncertainty as to how she should next attack the subject how did you first meet  lydia began with the scene on lucas wharf and little by little told the whole story up to the moment of their parting at trieste there were lapses and pauses in the story which her aunt was never at a loss to fill aright at the end she said if it were not for his promising to come here and see you i should say mr staniford had been flirting and as it is he may not regard it as anything more than flirtation of course there was his being jealous of mr dunham and mr hicks as he certainly was and his wanting to explain about that lady at messinayes that looked peculiar but he may not have meant anything by it his parting so at trieste with you that might be either because he was embarrassed at its having got to be such a serious thing or because he really felt badly lydia she asked at last what made you think he cared for you  i dont know said the girl her voice had sunk to a husky whisper i didnt believe it till he said he wanted me to be hisconscience and tried to make me say he was good and  thats a certain kind of mans way of flirting it may mean nothing at all i could tell in an instant if i saw him  he said he would be here this afternoon murmured lydia tremulously  this afternoon cried mrs erwin i must get up  at her toilette she had the exaltation and fury of a champion arming for battle     xxv   mr erwin entered about the completion of her preparations and without turning round from her glass she said i want you to think of the worst thing you can henshaw i dont see how im ever to lift up my head again as if this word had reminded her of her head she turned it from side to side and got the effect in the glass first of one earring and then of the other her husband patiently waited and she now confronted him you may as well know first as last henshaw and i want you to prepare yourself for it nothing can be done and you will just have to live through it lydiahas come overon that shipalonewith three young menand not the shadownot the ghostof another womanon board mrs erwin gesticulated with her handglass in delivering the words in a manner at once intensely vivid and intensely solemn yet somehow falling short of the due tragic effect her husband stood pulling his mustache straight down while his wife turned again to the mirror and put the final touches to her personal appearance with hands which she had the effect of having desperately washed of all responsibility he stood so long in this meditative mood that she was obliged to be peremptory with his image in the glass well she cried  why my dear said mr erwin at last they were all americans together you know  and what difference does that make demanded mrs erwin whirling from his image to the man again  why of course you know it isnt as if they wereenglish mrs erwin flung down three hairpins upon her dressingcase and visibly despaired of course you dont expect your countrymen his wifes appearance was here so terrible that he desisted and resumed by saying dont be vexed my dear ii rather like it you know it strikes me as a genuine bit of american civilization  american civilization oh henshaw wailed mrs erwin is it possible that after all ive said and done and lived you still think that any one but a girl from the greenest little country place could do such a thing as that well it is no use trying to enlighten english people you like it do you well im not sure that the englishman who misunderstands american things and likes them isnt a little worse than the englishman who misunderstands them and dislikes them you all misunderstand them and would you like it if one of the young men had been making love to lydia  the amateur of our civilization hesitated and was serious but he said at last why you know im not surprised shes so uncommonly pretty ii suppose theyre engaged he suggested  his wife held her peace for scorn then she said the gentleman is of a very good boston family and would no more think of engaging himself to a young girl without the knowledge of her friends than you would besides hes been in europe a great deal  i wish i could meet some americans who hadnt been in europe said mr erwin i should like to see what you call the simonpure american as for the young mans not engaging himself it seems to me that he didnt avail himself of his national privileges i should certainly have done it in his place if id been an american  well if youd been an american you wouldnt answered his wife  why  because an american would have had too much delicacy  i dont understand that  i know you dont henshaw and theres where you show yourself an englishman  really said her husband youre beginning to crow my dear come i like that a great deal better than your cringing to the effete despotisms of the old world as your fourth of july orators have it its almost impossible to get a bit of good honest bounce out of an american nowadaysto get him to spread himself as you say  all that is neither here nor there henshaw said his wife the question is how to receive mr stanifordthats his namewhen he comes how are we to regard him hes coming here to see lydia and she thinks hes coming to propose  excuse me but how does she regard him  oh theres no question about that poor child shes dead in love with him and cant understand why he didnt propose on shipboard  and she isnt an englishman either exulted mr erwin it appears that there are americans and americans and that the men of your nation have more delicacy than the women like  dont be silly said his wife of course women always think what they would do in such cases if they were men but if men did what women think they would do if they were men the women would be disgusted  oh  yes her feeling in the matter is no guide  do you know his family asked mr erwin  i think i do yes im sure i do  are they nice people  havent i told you they were a good boston family  then upon my word i dont see that weve to take any attitude at all i dont see that weve to regard him in one way or the other it quite remains for him to make the first move  as if they had been talking of nothing but dress before mrs erwin asked do you think i look better in this black mexicaine or would you wear your écru  i think you look very well in this but whyhe isnt going to propose to you i hope  i must have on something decent to receive him in what time does the train from trieste get in  at three oclock  its one now theres plenty of time but there isnt any too much ill go and get lydia ready or perhaps youll tap on her door henshaw and send her here of course this is the end of her voiceif it is the end  its the end of having an extraordinarily pretty girl in the house i dont at all like it you knowhaving her whisked away in this manner  mrs erwin refused to let her mind wander from the main point hell be round as soon as he can after he arrives i shall expect him by four at the latest  i fancy hell stop for his dinner before he comes said mr erwin  not at all retorted his wife haughtily and with his going out of the room she set her face in a resolute cheerfulness for the task of heartening lydia when she should appear but it only expressed misgiving when the girl came in with her yachtingdress on why lydia shall you wear that  lydia swept her dress with a downward glance  i thought i would wear it i thought hei should seemmore natural in it i wore it all the time on the ship except sundays he said he liked it the best  mrs erwin shook her head it wouldnt do everything must be on a new basis now he might like it but it would be too romantic wouldnt it dont you think she shook her head still but less decisively better wear your silk dont you think youd better wear your silk this is very pretty and the dark blue does become you awfully still i dont knowi dont know either a great many english wear those careless things in the house well wear it lydia you do look perfectly killing in it ill tell you your uncle was going to ask you to go out in his boat hes got one he rows himself and this is a boating costume and you know you could time yourselves so as to get back just right and you could come in with this on  lydia turned pale oughtnt ioughtnt ito be here she faltered  her aunt laughed gayly why hell ask for me lydia  for you asked lydia doubtfully  yes and i can easily keep him till you get back if youre here by four  the train said lydia arrives at three  how did you know asked her aunt keenly  lydias eyelids fell even lower than their wont  i looked it out in that railroad guide in the parlor  her aunt kissed her and youve thought the whole thing out dear havent you im glad to see you so happy about it  yes said the girl with a fluttering breath i have thought it out and i believe him i she tried to say something more but could not  mrs erwin rang the bell and sent for her husband he knows about it lydia she said  hes just as much interested as we are dear but you neednt be worried hes a perfect post for not showing a thing if you dont want him to hes really quite superhuman in thatequal to a woman you can talk americanisms with him if we sat here staring at each other till four oclockhe must go to his hotel before he comes here and i say four at the earliest and its much more likely to be five or six or perhaps eveningi should die  mr erwins rowing was the wonder of all venice there was every reason why he should fall overboard at each stroke as he stood to propel the boat in the gondolier fashion except that he never yet had done so it was sometimes his fortune to be caught on the shallows by the falling tide but on that day he safely explored the lagoons and returned promptly at four oclock to the palace  his wife was standing on the balcony looking out for them and she smiled radiantly down into lydias anxiously lifted face but when she met the girl at the head of the staircase in the great hall she embraced her and said with the same gay smile he hasnt come yet dear and of course he wont come till after dinner if i hadnt been as silly as you are lydia i never should have let you expect him sooner hell want to go to his hotel and no matter how impatient he is hell want to dress and be a little ceremonious about his call you know were strangers to him whatever you are  yes said lydia mechanically she was going to sit down as she was of her own motion she would not have stirred from the place till he came or it was certain he would not come but her aunt would not permit the despair into which she saw her sinking  she laughed resolutely and said i think we must give up the little sentimentality of meeting him in that dress now go and change it lydia put on your silkor wait let me go with you i want to try some little effects with your complexion weve experimented with the simple and familiar and now well see what can be done in the way of the magnificent and unexpected im going to astonish the young man with a venetian beauty you know you look italian lydia  yes he said so answered lydia  did he that shows he has an eye and hell appreciate what we are going to do  she took lydia to her own room for the greater convenience of her experiments and from that moment she did not allow her to be alone she scarcely allowed her to be silent she made her talk she kept her in movement at dinner she permitted no lapse henshaw she said lydia has been telling me about a storm they had just before they reached gibraltar i wish you would tell her of the typhoon you were in when you first went out to india her husband obeyed and then recurring to the days of his civil employment in india he told stories of tigerhunts and of the sepoy mutiny mrs erwin would not let them sit very long at table after dinner she asked lydia to sing and she suffered her to sing all the american songs her uncle asked for at eight oclock she said with a knowing little look at lydia which included a subwink for her husband you may go to your café alone this evening henshaw lydia and i are going to stay at home and talk south bradfield gossip ive hardly had a moment with her yet but when he was gone she took lydia to her own room again and showed her all her jewelry and passed the time in making changes in the girls toilette  it was like the heroic endeavor of the arctic voyager who feels the deadly chill in his own veins and keeps himself alive by rousing his comrade from the torpor stealing over him they saw in each others eyes that if they yielded a moment to the doubt in their hearts they were lost  at ten oclock mrs erwin said abruptly go to bed lydia then the girl broke down and abandoned herself in a storm of tears dont cry dear dont cry pleaded her aunt he will be here in the morning i know he will he has been delayed  no hes not coming said lydia through her sobs  something has happened urged mrs erwin  no said lydia as before her tears ceased as suddenly as they had come she lifted her head and drying her eyes looked into her aunts face are you ashamed of me she asked hoarsely  ashamed of you oh poor child  i cant pretend anything if i had never told you about it at all i could have kept it back till i died but nowbut you will never hear me speak of it again its over she took up her candle and stiffly suffering the compassionate embrace with which her aunt clung to her she walked across the great hall in the vain splendor in which she had been adorned and shut the door behind her     xxvi   dunham lay in a stupor for twentyfour hours and after that he was delirious with dim intervals of reason in which they kept him from talking till one morning he woke and looked up at staniford with a perfectly clear eye and said as if resuming the conservation i struck my head on a pile of chains  yes replied staniford with a wan smile and youve been out of it pretty near ever since you mustnt talk  oh im all right said dunham i know about my being hurt i shall be cautious have you written to miss hibbard i hope you havent  yes i have replied staniford but i havent sent the letter he added in answer to dunhams look of distress i thought you were going to pull through in spite of the doctorhes wanted to bleed you and i could hardly keep his lancet out of youand so i wrote mentioning the accident and announcing your complete restoration the letter merely needs dating and sealing ill look it up and have it posted he began a search in the pockets of his coat and then went to his portfolio  what day is this asked dunham  friday said staniford rummaging his portfolio  have you been in venice  look here dunham if you begin in that way i cant talk to you it shows that youre still out of your head how could i have been in venice  but miss blood the aroostook  miss blood went to venice with her uncle last saturday the aroostook is here in trieste the captain has just gone away hes stood watch and watch with me while you were off on business  but didnt you go to venice on monday  well hardly answered staniford  no you stayed with mei see said dunham  of course i wrote to her at once said staniford huskily and explained the matter as well as i could without making an ado about it but now you stop dunham if you excite yourself therell be the deuce to pay again  im not excited said dunham but i cant help thinking how disappointedbut of course youve heard from her  well theres hardly time yet said staniford evasively  why yes there is perhaps your letter miscarried  dont cried staniford in a hollow undervoice which he broke through to add go to sleep now dunham or keep quiet somehow  dunham was silent for a while and staniford continued his search which he ended by taking the portfolio by one corner and shaking its contents out on the table i dont seem to find it but ive put it away somewhere ill get it he went to another coat that hung on the back of a chair and fumbled in its pockets hello here are those letters they brought me from the postoffice saturday night murrays and stantons and that bore farringtons i forgot all about them he ran the unopened letters over in his hand ah heres my familiar scrawl he stopped suddenly and walked away to the window where he stood with his back to dunham  staniford what is it  itsits my letter to her said staniford without looking round  your letter to miss bloodnot gone staniford with his face still from him silently nodded oh moaned dunham in selfforgetful compassion how could it have happened  i see perfectly well said the other quietly but he looked round at dunham with a face that was haggard i sent it out to be posted by the portier and he got it mixed up with these letters for me and brought it back  the young men were both silent but the tears stood in dunhams eyes if it hadnt been for me it wouldnt have happened he said  no gently retorted staniford if it hadnt been for me it wouldnt have happened i made you come from messina with me when you wanted to go on to naples with those people if id had any sense i should have spoken fully to her before we parted and it was i who sent you to see if she were on the steamer when you fell and hurt yourself i know whos to blame dunham what day did i tell you this was  friday  a week and i told her to expect me monday afternoon a week without a word or a sign of any kind well i might as well take passage in the aroostook and go back to boston again  why no cried dunham you must take the first train to venice dont lose an instant you can explain everything as soon as you see her  staniford shook his head if all her life had been different if she were a woman of the world it would be different she would know how to account for some little misgivings on my part but as it is she wouldnt know how to account for even the appearance of them what she must have suffered all this weeki cant think of it he sat down and turned his face away presently he sprang up again but im going dunham i guess you wont die now but you may die if you like i would go over your dead body  now you are talking sense said dunham  staniford did not listen he had got out his railroad guide and was studying it no there are only those two trains a day the seven oclock has gone and the next starts at ten tonight great heavens i could walk it sooner dunham he asked do you think id better telegraph  what would you say  say that theres been a mistake that a letter miscarried that ill be there in the morning that  wouldnt that be taking her anxiety a little too much for granted  yes thats true well youve got your wits about you now dunham cried staniford with illogical bitterness very probably he added gloomily she doesnt care anything for me after all  thats a good frame of mind to go in said dunham  why is it demanded staniford did i ever presume upon any supposed interest in her  you did at first replied dunham  staniford flushed angrily but you cannot quarrel with a man lying helpless on his back besides what dunham said was true  the arrangements for stanifords journey were quickly madeso quickly that when he had seen the doctor and had been down to the aroostook and engaged captain jenness to come and take his place with dunham for the next two nights he had twelve hours on his hands before the train for venice would leave and he started at last with but one clear perceptionthat at the soonest it must be twelve hours more before he could see her  he had seemed intolerably slow in arriving on the train but once arrived in venice he wished that he had come by the steamboat which would not be in for three hours yet in despair he went to bed considering that after he had tossed there till he could endure it no longer he would still have the resource of getting up which he would not have unless he went to bed when he lay down he found himself drowsy and while he wondered at this he fell asleep and dreamed a strange dream so terrible that he woke himself by groaning in spirit a thing which as he reflected he had never done before the sun was piercing the crevice between his shutters and a glance at his watch showed him that it was eleven oclock  the shadow of his dream projected itself into his waking mood and steeped it in a gloom which he could not escape he rose and dressed and meagrely breakfasted without knowing how he came there he stood announced in mrs erwins parlor and waited for her to receive him  his card was brought in to her where she lay in bed after supporting lydia through the first sharp shock of disappointment she had yielded to the prolonged strain and the girl was now taking care of her she gave a hysterical laugh as she read the name on the card veronica brought and crushing it in her hand hes come she cried  i will not see him said lydia instantly  no assented her aunt it wouldnt be at all the thing besides hes asked for me your uncle might see him but hes out of the way of course he would be out of the way now let me see the excitement inspired her she rose in bed and called for the pretty sack in which she ordinarily breakfasted and took a look at herself in a handglass that lay on the bed lydia did not move she scarcely seemed to breathe but a swift pulse in her neck beat visibly if it would be decent to keep him waiting so long i could dress and see him myself im well enough mrs erwin again reflected well she said at last you must see him lydia  i began the girl  yes you some one must it will be all right on second thought i believe i should send you even if i were quite ready to go myself this affair has been carried on so far on the american plan and i think i shall let you finish it without my interference yes as your uncle said when i told him youre all americans together and you are mr staniford has come to see you though he asks for me thats perfectly proper but i cant see him and i want you to excuse me to him  what would youwhat must i lydia began again  no lydia interrupted her aunt i wont tell you a thing i might have advised you when you first came but now iwell i think ive lived too long in europe to be of use in such a case and i wont have anything to do with it i wont tell you how to meet him or what to say but oh childhere the womans love of loving triumphed in her breasti wish i was in your place go  lydia slowly rose breathless  lydia cried her aunt look at me lydia turned her head are you going to be hard with him  i dont know what hes coming for said lydia dishonestly  but if hes coming for what you hope  i dont hope for anything  but you did dont be severe youre terrible when youre severe  i will be just  oh no you mustnt my dear it wont do at all to be just with men poor fellows kiss me lydia she pulled her down and kissed her when the girl had got as far as the door lydia lydia she called after her lydia turned do you realize what dress youve got on lydia looked down at her robe it was the blue flannel yachtingsuit of the aroostook which she had put on for convenience in taking care of her aunt isnt it too ridiculous mrs erwin meant to praise the coincidence not to blame the dress lydia smiled faintly for answer and the next moment she stood at the parlor door  staniford at her entrance turned from looking out of the window and saw her as in his dream with her hand behind her pushing the door to but the face with which she looked at him was not like the dead sad face of his dream it was thrillingly alive and all passions were blent in itlove doubt reproach indignation the tears stood in her eyes but a fire burnt through the tears with his first headlong impulse to console explain deplore came a thought that struck him silent at sight of her he remembered as he had not till then remembered in all his wild longing and fearing that there had not yet been anything explicit between them that there was no engagement and that he had upon the face of things at least no right to offer her more than some formal expression of regret for not having been able to keep his promise to come sooner while this stupefying thought gradually filled his whole sense to the exclusion of all else he stood looking at her with a dumb and helpless appeal utterly stunned and wretched he felt the life die out of his face and leave it blank and when at last she spoke he knew that it was in pity of him or contempt of him mrs erwin is not well she said and she wished me  but he broke in upon her oh dont talk to me of mrs erwin it was you i wanted to see are you well are you alive do you he stopped as precipitately as he began and after another hopeless pause he went on piteously i dont know where to begin i ought to have been here five days ago i dont know what you think of me or whether you have thought of me at all and before i can ask i must tell you why i wanted to come then and why i come now and why i think i must have come back from the dead to see you you are all the world to me and have been ever since i saw you it seems a ridiculously unnecessary thing to say i have been looking and acting and living it so long but i say it because i choose to have you know it whether you ever cared for me or not i thought i was coming here to explain why i had not come sooner but i neednt do that unless unless he looked at her where she still stood aloof and he added oh answer me something for pitys sake dont send me away without a word there have been times when you wouldnt have done that  oh i did care for you she broke out you know i did  he was instantly across the room beside her yes yes i know it but she shrank away  you tried to make me believe you cared for me by everything you could do and i did believe you then and yes i believed you afterwards when i didnt know what to believe you were the one true thing in the world to me but it seems that you didnt believe it yourself  that i didnt believe it myself that ii dont know what you mean  you took a week to think it over i have had a week too and i have thought it over too you have come too late  too late you dont you cant meanlisten to me lydia i want to tell you  no there is nothing you can tell me that would change me i know it i understand it all  but you dont understand what kept me  i dont wish to know what made you break your word i dont care to know i couldnt go back and feel as i did to you oh thats gone it isnt that you did not comethat you made me wait and suffer but you knew how it would be with me after i got here and all the things i should find out and how i should feel and you stayed away i dont know whether i can forgive you even oh im afraid i dont but i can never care for you again nothing but a case of life and death  it was a case of life and death  lydia stopped in her reproaches and looked at him with wistful doubt changing to a tender fear  oh have you been hurt have you been sick she pleaded in a breaking voice and made some unconscious movement toward him he put out his hand and would have caught one of hers but she clasped them in each other  no not idunham  oh said lydia as if this were not at all enough  he fell and struck his head the night you left i thought he would die staniford reported his own diagnosis not the doctors but he was perhaps in the right to do this i had made him go down to the wharf with me i wanted to see you again before you started and i thought we might find you on the boat he could see her face relenting her hands released each other he was delirious till yesterday i couldnt leave him  oh why didnt you write to me she ignored dunham as completely as if he had never lived you knew that i her voice died away and her breast rose  i did write  but howi never got it  noit was not posted through a cruel blunder and then i thought i got to thinking that you didnt care  oh said the girl could you doubt me  you doubted me said staniford seizing his advantage i brought the letter with me to prove my truth she did not look at him but she took the letter and ran it greedily into her pocket its well i did so since you dont believe my word  oh yesyes i know it she said i never doubted it staniford stood bemazed though he knew enough to take the hands she yielded him but she suddenly caught them away again and set them against his breast i was very wrong to suspect you ever im sorry i did but theres something else i dont know how to say what i want to say but it must be said  is it something disagreeable asked staniford lightly  its right answered lydia unsmilingly  oh well dont say it he pleaded or dont say it nownot till youve forgiven me for the anxiety ive caused you not till youve praised me for trying to do what i thought the right thing you cant imagine how hard it was for one who hasnt the habit  i do praise you for it theres nothing to forgive you but i cant let you care for me unless i knowunlessshe stopped and then mr staniford she began firmly since i came here ive been learning things that i didnt know before they have changed the whole world to me and it can never be the same again  im sorry for that but if they havent changed you the world may go  no not if were to live in it answered the girl with the soberer wisdom women keep at such times it will have to be known how we met what will people say they will laugh  i dont think they will in my presence said staniford with swelling nostrils they may use their pleasure elsewhere  and i shouldnt care for their laughing either said lydia but oh why did you come  why did i come  was it because you felt bound by anything thats happened and you wouldnt let me bear the laugh alone im not afraid for myself i shall never blame you you can go perfectly free  but i dont want to go free  lydia looked at him with piercing earnestness do you think im proud she asked  yes i think you are said staniford vaguely  it isnt for myself that i should be proud with other people but i would rather die than bring ridicule upon one iupon you  i can believe that said staniford devoutly and patiently reverencing the delay of her scruples  and ifand her lips trembled but she steadied her trembling voice if they laughed at you and thought of me in a slighting way because staniford gave a sort of roar of grief and pain to know how her heart must have been wrung before she could come to this you were all so good that you didnt let me think there was anything strange about it  oh good heavens we only did what it was our precious and sacred privilege to do we were all of one mind about it from the first but dont torture yourself about it my darling its over now its pastno its present and it will always be forever the dearest and best thing in life lydia do you believe that i love you  oh i must  and dont you believe that im telling you the truth when i say that i wouldnt for all the world can give or take change anything thats been  yes i do believe you oh i havent said at all what i wanted to say there was a great deal that i ought to say i cant seem to recollect it  he smiled to see her grieving at this recreance of her memory to her conscience well you shall have a whole lifetime to recall it in  no i must try to speak now and you must tell me the truth now no matter what it costs either of us she laid her hands upon his extended arms and grasped them intensely theres something else i want to ask you what you thought when you found me alone on that ship with all of you if she had stopped at this point stanifords cause might have been lost but she went on i want to know whether you were ever ashamed of me or despised me for it whether you ever felt that because i was helpless and friendless there you had the right to think less of me than if you had first met me here in this house  it was still a terrible question but it offered a loophole of escape which staniford was swift to seize let those who will justify the answer with which he smiled into her solemn eyes i will leave you to say a generous uncandor like this goes as far with a magnanimous and serioushearted woman as perhaps anything else  oh i knew it i knew it cried lydia and then as he caught her to him at last ohohare you sure its right  i have no doubt of it answered staniford nor had he any question of the strategy through which he had triumphed in this crucial test he may have thought that there were always explanations that had to be made afterwards or he may have believed that he had expiated in what he had done and suffered for her any slight which he had felt possibly he considered that she had asked more than she had a right to do it is certain that he said with every appearance of sincerity it began the moment i saw you on the wharf there and when i came to know my mind i kept it from you only till i could tell you here but now i wish i hadnt life is too short for such a week as this  no said lydia you acted for the best and you aregood  ill keep that praise till ive earned it answered staniford     xxvii   in the campo santi apostoli at venice there stands a little apart from the church of that name a chapel which has been for many years the place of worship for the lutheran congregation it was in this church that staniford and lydia were married six weeks later before the altar under titians beautiful picture of christ breaking bread  the wedding was private but it was not quite a family affair miss hibbard had come down with her mother from dresden to complete dunhams cure and she was there with him perfectly recovered he was not quite content of course that the marriage should not take place in the english chapel but he was largely consoled by the candles burning on the altar the aroostook had been delayed by repairs which were found necessary at trieste and captain jenness was able to come over and represent the ship at the wedding ceremony and at the lunch which followed he reserved till the moment of parting a supreme expression of goodwill when he had got a hand of lydias and one of stanifords in each of his with his wrists crossed he said now i aint one to tack round and stand off and on a great deal but what i want to say is just this the aroostook sails next week and if you two are a mind to go back in her the ships yours as i said to miss blood herei mean mis staniford well i haint had much time to get used to itwhen she first come aboard there at boston i dont mean any pay i want you to go back as my guests you can use the cabin for your parlor and i promise you i wont take any other passengers this time i declare said captain jenness lowering his voice and now referring to hicks for the first time since the day of his escapade i did feel dreadful about that fellow  oh never mind replied staniford if it hadnt been for hicks perhaps i mightnt have been here he exchanged glances with his wife that showed they had talked all that matter over  the captain grew confidential mr mason told me he saw you lending that chap money i hope he didnt give you the slip  no it came to me here at blumenthals the other day  well thats right it all worked together for good as you say now you come  what do you say my dear asked staniford on whom the poetic fitness of the captains proposal had wrought  women are never blinded by romance however much they like it in the abstract its coming winter do you think you wouldnt be seasick returned the bride of an hour with the practical wisdom of a matron  staniford laughed shes right captain im no sailor ill get home by the allrail route as far as i can  captain jenness threw back his head and laughed too good thats about it and he released their hands so as to place one hairy paw on a shoulder of each youll get along together i guess  but were just as much obliged to you as if we went captain jenness and tell all the crew that im homesick for the aroostook and thank all for being so kind to me and i thank you captain jenness lydia looked at her husband and then startled the captain with a kiss  he blushed all over but carried it off as boldly as he could well well he said thats right if you change your minds before the aroostook sails you let me know  this affair made a great deal of talk in venice where the common stock of leisure is so great that each person may without self reproach devote a much larger share of attention to the interests of the others than could be given elsewhere the decorous fictions in which mrs erwin draped the singular facts of the acquaintance and courtship of lydia and staniford were what unfailingly astonished and amused him and he abetted them without scruple he found her worldliness as innocent as the unworldliness of lydia and he gave mrs erwin his hearty sympathy when she ingenuously owned that the effort to throw dust in the eyes of her european acquaintance was simply killing her he found endless refreshment in the contemplation of her attitude towards her burdensome little world and in her reasons for enslaving herself to it he was very good friends with both of the erwins when he could spare the time from lydia he went about with her uncle in his boat and respected his skill in rowing it without falling overboard he could not see why any one should be so much interested in the american character and dialect as mr erwin was but he did not object and he reflected that after all they were not what their admirer supposed them  the erwins came with the stanifords as far as paris on their way home and afterwards joined them in california where staniford bought a ranch and found occupation if not profit in its management once cut loose from her european ties mrs erwin experienced an incomparable repose and comfort in the life of san francisco it was she declared the life for which she had really been adapted after all and in the climate of santa barbara she found all that she had left in italy in that land of strange and surprising forms of every sort her husband has been very happy in the realization of an america surpassing even his wildest dreams and he has richly stored his notebook with philological curiosities he hears around him the vigorous and imaginative locutions of the pike language in which like the late canon kingsley he finds a scandinavian hugeness and pending the publication of his handbook of americanisms he is in confident search of the miner who uses his pronouns cockneywise like other english observers friendly and unfriendly he does not permit the facts to interfere with his preconceptions  stanifords choice long remained a mystery to his acquaintances and was but partially explained by mrs dunham when she came home why i suppose he fell in love with her she said of course thrown together that way as they were for six weeks it might have happened to anybody but james staniford was always the most consummate flirt that breathed and he never could see a woman without coming up in that metaphysical way of his and trying to interest her in him he was always laughing at women but there never was a man who cared more for them from all that i could learn from charles he began by making fun of her and all at once he became perfectly infatuated with her i dont see why i never could get charles to tell me anything remarkable that she said or did she was simply a country girl with country ideas and no sort of cultivation why there was nothing to her hes done the wisest thing he could by taking her out to california she never would have gone down here i suppose james staniford knew that as well as any of us and if he finds it worth while to bury himself with her there weve no reason to complain she did sing wonderfully that is her voice was perfectly divine but of course thats all over now she didnt seem to care much for it and she really knew so little of life that i dont believe she could form the idea of an artistic career or feel that it was any sacrifice to give it up james staniford was not worth any such sacrifice but she couldnt know that either she was good i suppose she was very stiff and she hadnt a word to say for herself i think she was cold to be sure she was a beauty i really never saw anything like itthat pale complexion some brunettes have with her hair growing low and such eyes and lashes  perhaps the beauty had something to do with his falling in love with her suggested a listener the ladies present tried to look as if this ought not to be sufficient  oh very likely said mrs dunham she added with an air of being the wreck of her former self but we all know what becomes of beauty after marriage  the mind of lydias friends had been expressed in regard to her marriage when the stanifords upon their arrival home from europe paid a visit to south bradfield it was in the depths of the winter following their union and the hill country stern and wild even in midsummer wore an aspect of savage desolation it was sheeted in heavy snow through which here and there in the pastures a craggy bowlder lifted its face and frowned and along the woods the stunted pines and hemlocks blackened against a background of leafless oaks and birches a northwest wind cut shrill across the white wastes and from the crests of the billowed drifts drove a scud of stinging particles in their faces while the sun as high as that of italy coldly blazed from a cloudless blue sky ezra perkins perched on the seat before them stiff and silent as if he were frozen there drove them from bradfield junction to south bradfield in the long wagonbody set on bobsleds with which he replaced his concord coach in winter at the station he had sparingly greeted lydia as if she were just back from greenfield and in the interest of personal independence had ignored a faint motion of hers to shake hands at her grandfathers gate he set his passengers down without a word and drove away leaving staniford to get in his trunk as he might  well i declare said miss maria who had taken one end of the trunk in spite of him and was leading the way up through the path cleanly blocked out of the snow that ezra perkins is enough to make you wish hed stayed in dakoty  staniford laughed as he had laughed at everything on the way from the station and had probably thus wounded ezra perkinss susceptibilities the village houses separated so widely by the one long street each with its path neatly tunneled from the roadway to the gate the meetinghouse so much vaster than the present needs of worship and looking bluecold with its neverrenewed single coat of white paint the graveyard set in the midst of the village and showing after ezra perkinss disappearance as many signs of life as any other locality realized in the most satisfactory degree his theories of what winter must be in such a place as south bradfield the burning smell of the sheetiron stove in the parlor with its battlemented top of filigree iron work the grimness of the horsehair covered best furniture the care with which the oldfashioned fire places had been walled up and all accessible character of the period to which the house belonged had been effaced gave him an equal pleasure he went about with his arm round lydias waist examining these things and yielding to the joy they caused him when they were alone oh my darling he said in one of these accesses of delight when i think that its my privilege to take you away from all this i begin to feel not so very unworthy after all  but he was very polite as miss maria owned when mr and mrs goodlow came in during the evening with two or three unmarried ladies of the village and he kept them from falling into the frozen silence which habitually expresses social enjoyment in south bradfield when strangers are present he talked about the prospects of italian advancement to an equal state of intellectual and moral perfection with rural new england while mr goodlow listened rocking himself back and forth in the haircloth armchair deacon latham passing his hand continually along the stove battlements now and then let his fingers rest on the sheetiron till he burnt them and then jerked them suddenly away to put them back the next moment in his absorbing interest miss maria amidst a murmur of admiration from the ladies passed spongecake and coffee she confessed afterwards that the evening had been so brilliant to her as to seem almost wicked and the other ladies who owned to having lain awake all night on her coffee said that if they had enjoyed themselves they were properly punished for it  when they were gone and lydia and staniford had said goodnight and miss maria coming in from the kitchen with a handlamp for her father approached the marbletopped centretable to blow out the large lamp of peagreen glass with red woollen wick which had shed the full radiance of a sunburner upon the festival she faltered at a manifest unreadiness in the old man to go to bed though the fire was low and they had both resumed the drooping carriage of people in going about cold houses he looked excited and so far as his unpracticed visage could intimate the emotion joyous  well there maria he said you cant say but what hes a master hand to converse any way id know as i ever see mr goodlow more struck up with any one he looked as if every word done him good i presume it put him in mind of meetins with brother ministers i dont suppose but what he misses it some here you cant say but what hes a fine appearin young man i dknow as i see anything wrong in his kind of dressin up to the nines as you may say as longs hes got the money i dont see what harm it is its all worked for good lyddys going out that way though it did seem a mysterious providence at the time  well began miss maria she paused as if she had been hurried too far by her feelings and ought to give them a check before proceeding well i dont presume youd notice it but shes got a spot on her silk sot a whole breadths got to come out and be let in again bottom side up i guess theres a pair of em for carelessness she waited a moment before continuing i dknow as i like to see a husband puttin his arm round his wife even when he dont suppose any ones lookin but i dknow but what its natural too but its one comfort to seet she aint the least mite silly about him hes dreadful freckled miss maria again paused thoughtfully while her father burnt his fingers on the stove for the last time and took them definitively away i dont say but what he talked well enough as far forth as talkin goes mr goodlow said at the doort he didnt knows he ever passed many such evenins since hed been in south bradfield and i dknow as i have i presume he has his faults we aint any of us perfect but he does seem terribly wrapped up in lyddy i dont say but what hell make her a good husband if she must have one i dont suppose but what people might think as you may say t shed made out pretty well and if lyddys suited i dknow as anybody else has got any call to be over particular  the end
