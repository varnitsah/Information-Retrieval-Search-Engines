64439995	round the red lamp  being facts and fancies of medical life  by sir arthur conan doyle     the preface  being an extract from a long and animated correspondence with a friend in america  i quite recognise the force of your objection that an invalid or a woman in weak health would get no good from stories which attempt to treat some features of medical life with a certain amount of realism if you deal with this life at all however and if you are anxious to make your doctors something more than marionettes it is quite essential that you should paint the darker side since it is that which is principally presented to the surgeon or physician  he sees many beautiful things it is true fortitude and heroism love and selfsacrifice but they are all called forth as our nobler qualities are always called forth by bitter sorrow and trial  one cannot write of medical life and be merry over it  then why write of it you may ask  if a subject is painful why treat it at all  i answer that it is the province of fiction to treat painful things as well as cheerful ones  the story which wiles away a weary hour fulfils an obviously good purpose but not more so i hold than that which helps to emphasise the graver side of life  a tale which may startle the reader out of his usual grooves of thought and shocks him into seriousness plays the part of the alterative and tonic in medicine bitter to the taste but bracing in the result  there are a few stories in this little collection which might have such an effect and i have so far shared in your feeling that i have reserved them from serial publication  in bookform the reader can see that they are medical stories and can if he or she be so minded avoid them  yours very truly  a conan doyle   p syou ask about the red lamp  it is the usual sign of the general practitioner in england     contents    behind the times   his first operation   a straggler of 15   the third generation   a false start   the curse of eve   sweethearts   a physiologists wife   the case of lady sannox   a question of diplomacy   a medical document   lot no 249   the los amigos fiasco   the doctors of hoyland   the surgeon talks     round the red lamp     behind the times  my first interview with dr james winter was under dramatic circumstances  it occurred at two in the morning in the bedroom of an old country house  i kicked him twice on the white waistcoat and knocked off his gold spectacles while he with the aid of a female accomplice stifled my angry cries in a flannel petticoat and thrust me into a warm bath  i am told that one of my parents who happened to be present remarked in a whisper that there was nothing the matter with my lungs  i cannot recall how dr winter looked at the time for i had other things to think of but his description of my own appearance is far from flattering  a fluffy head a body like a trussed goose very bandy legs and feet with the soles turned inwardsthose are the main items which he can remember  from this time onwards the epochs of my life were the periodical assaults which dr winter made upon me  he vaccinated me he cut me for an abscess he blistered me for mumps  it was a world of peace and he the one dark cloud that threatened  but at last there came a time of real illnessa time when i lay for months together inside my wickerworkbasket bed and then it was that i learned that that hard face could relax that those countrymade creaking boots could steal very gently to a bedside and that that rough voice could thin into a whisper when it spoke to a sick child  and now the child is himself a medical man and yet dr winter is the same as ever  i can see no change since first i can remember him save that perhaps the brindled hair is a trifle whiter and the huge shoulders a little more bowed  he is a very tall man though he loses a couple of inches from his stoop  that big back of his has curved itself over sick beds until it has set in that shape  his face is of a walnut brown and tells of long winter drives over bleak country roads with the wind and the rain in his teeth  it looks smooth at a little distance but as you approach him you see that it is shot with innumerable fine wrinkles like a last years apple  they are hardly to be seen when he is in repose but when he laughs his face breaks like a starred glass and you realise then that though he looks old he must be older than he looks   how old that is i could never discover  i have often tried to find out and have struck his stream as high up as george iv and even the regency but without ever getting quite to the source  his mind must have been open to impressions very early but it must also have closed early for the politics of the day have little interest for him while he is fiercely excited about questions which are entirely prehistoric he shakes his head when he speaks of the first reform bill and expresses grave doubts as to its wisdom and i have heard him when he was warmed by a glass of wine say bitter things about robert peel and his abandoning of the corn laws  the death of that statesman brought the history of england to a definite close and dr winter refers to everything which had happened since then as to an insignificant anticlimax  but it was only when i had myself become a medical man that i was able to appreciate how entirely he is a survival of a past generation  he had learned his medicine under that obsolete and forgotten system by which a youth was apprenticed to a surgeon in the days when the study of anatomy was often approached through a violated grave  his views upon his own profession are even more reactionary than in politics fifty years have brought him little and deprived him of less vaccination was well within the teaching of his youth though i think he has a secret preference for inoculation  bleeding he would practise freely but for public opinion  chloroform he regards as a dangerous innovation and he always clicks with his tongue when it is mentioned he has even been known to say vain things about laennec and to refer to the stethoscope as a newfangled french toy  he carries one in his hat out of deference to the expectations of his patients but he is very hard of hearing so that it makes little difference whether he uses it or not  he reads as a duty his weekly medical paper so that he has a general idea as to the advance of modern science  he always persists in looking upon it as a huge and rather ludicrous experiment  the germ theory of disease set him chuckling for a long time and his favourite joke in the sick room was to say shut the door or the germs will be getting in as to the darwinian theory it struck him as being the crowning joke of the century  the children in the nursery and the ancestors in the stable he would cry and laugh the tears out of his eyes  he is so very much behind the day that occasionally as things move round in their usual circle he finds himself to his bewilderment in the front of the fashion  dietetic treatment for example had been much in vogue in his youth and he has more practical knowledge of it than any one whom i have met  massage too was familiar to him when it was new to our generation  he had been trained also at a time when instruments were in a rudimentary state and when men learned to trust more to their own fingers  he has a model surgical hand muscular in the palm tapering in the fingers with an eye at the end of each  i shall not easily forget how dr patterson and i cut sir john sirwell the county member and were unable to find the stone  it was a horrible moment  both our careers were at stake  and then it was that dr winter whom we had asked out of courtesy to be present introduced into the wound a finger which seemed to our excited senses to be about nine inches long and hooked out the stone at the end of it  its always well to bring one in your waistcoatpocket said he with a chuckle but i suppose you youngsters are above all that  we made him president of our branch of the british medical association but he resigned after the first meeting  the young men are too much for me he said  i dont understand what they are talking about yet his patients do very well  he has the healing touchthat magnetic thing which defies explanation or analysis but which is a very evident fact none the less  his mere presence leaves the patient with more hopefulness and vitality  the sight of disease affects him as dust does a careful housewife  it makes him angry and impatient  tut tut this will never do he cries as he takes over a new case  he would shoo death out of the room as though he were an intrusive hen but when the intruder refuses to be dislodged when the blood moves more slowly and the eyes grow dimmer then it is that dr winter is of more avail than all the drugs in his surgery  dying folk cling to his hand as if the presence of his bulk and vigour gives them more courage to face the change and that kindly windbeaten face has been the last earthly impression which many a sufferer has carried into the unknown  when dr patterson and iboth of us young energetic and uptodatesettled in the district we were most cordially received by the old doctor who would have been only too happy to be relieved of some of his patients  the patients themselves however followed their own inclinationswhich is a reprehensible way that patients haveso that we remained neglected with our modern instruments and our latest alkaloids while he was serving out senna and calomel to all the countryside  we both of us loved the old fellow but at the same time in the privacy of our own intimate conversations we could not help commenting upon this deplorable lack of judgment  its all very well for the poorer people said patterson  but after all the educated classes have a right to expect that their medical man will know the difference between a mitral murmur and a bronchitic rale  its the judicial frame of mind not the sympathetic which is the essential one  i thoroughly agreed with patterson in what he said  it happened however that very shortly afterwards the epidemic of influenza broke out and we were all worked to death  one morning i met patterson on my round and found him looking rather pale and fagged out  he made the same remark about me  i was in fact feeling far from well and i lay upon the sofa all the afternoon with a splitting headache and pains in every joint  as evening closed in i could no longer disguise the fact that the scourge was upon me and i felt that i should have medical advice without delay  it was of patterson naturally that i thought but somehow the idea of him had suddenly become repugnant to me  i thought of his cold critical attitude of his endless questions of his tests and his tappings  i wanted something more soothingsomething more genial  mrs hudson said i to my housekeeper would you kindly run along to old dr winter and tell him that i should be obliged to him if he would step round  she was back with an answer presently  dr winter will come round in an hour or so sir but he has just been called in to attend dr patterson     his first operation  it was the first day of the winter session and the third years man was walking with the first years man  twelve oclock was just booming out from the tron church  let me see said the third years man  you have never seen an operation  never  then this way please  this is rutherfords historic bar  a glass of sherry please for this gentleman  you are rather sensitive are you not  my nerves are not very strong i am afraid  hum  another glass of sherry for this gentleman  we are going to an operation now you know  the novice squared his shoulders and made a gallant attempt to look unconcerned  nothing very badeh  well yespretty bad  anan amputation  no its a bigger affair than that  i thinki think they must be expecting me at home  theres no sense in funking  if you dont go today you must tomorrow  better get it over at once  feel pretty fit  oh yes all right  the smile was not a success  one more glass of sherry then  now come on or we shall be late  i want you to be well in front  surely that is not necessary  oh it is far better  what a drove of students  there are plenty of new men among them  you can tell them easily enough cant you if they were going down to be operated upon themselves they could not look whiter  i dont think i should look as white  well i was just the same myself  but the feeling soon wears off you see a fellow with a face like plaster and before the week is out he is eating his lunch in the dissecting rooms  ill tell you all about the case when we get to the theatre  the students were pouring down the sloping street which led to the infirmaryeach with his little sheaf of notebooks in his hand  there were pale frightened lads fresh from the high schools and callous old chronics whose generation had passed on and left them  they swept in an unbroken tumultuous stream from the university gate to the hospital  the figures and gait of the men were young but there was little youth in most of their faces  some looked as if they ate too littlea few as if they drank too much  tall and short tweedcoated and black roundshouldered bespectacled and slim they crowded with clatter of feet and rattle of sticks through the hospital gate  now and again they thickened into two lines as the carriage of a surgeon of the staff rolled over the cobblestones between  theres going to be a crowd at archers whispered the senior man with suppressed excitement  it is grand to see him at work  ive seen him jab all round the aorta until it made me jumpy to watch him this way and mind the whitewash  they passed under an archway and down a long stoneflagged corridor with drabcoloured doors on either side each marked with a number some of them were ajar and the novice glanced into them with tingling nerves  he was reassured to catch a glimpse of cheery fires lines of whitecounterpaned beds and a profusion of coloured texts upon the wall  the corridor opened upon a small hall with a fringe of poorly clad people seated all round upon benches  a young man with a pair of scissors stuck like a flower in his buttonhole and a notebook in his hand was passing from one to the other whispering and writing  anything good asked the third years man  you should have been here yesterday said the outpatient clerk glancing up  we had a regular field day  a popliteal aneurism a colles fracture a spina bifida a tropical abscess and an elephantiasis  hows that for a single haul  im sorry i missed it  but theyll come again i suppose  whats up with the old gentleman  a broken workman was sitting in the shadow rocking himself slowly to and fro and groaning  a woman beside him was trying to console him patting his shoulder with a hand which was spotted over with curious little white blisters  its a fine carbuncle said the clerk with the air of a connoisseur who describes his orchids to one who can appreciate them  its on his back and the passage is draughty so we must not look at it must we daddy  pemphigus he added carelessly pointing to the womans disfigured hands  would you care to stop and take out a metacarpal  no thank you  we are due at archers  come on and they rejoined the throng which was hurrying to the theatre of the famous surgeon  the tiers of horseshoe benches rising from the floor to the ceiling were already packed and the novice as he entered saw vague curving lines of faces in front of him and heard the deep buzz of a hundred voices and sounds of laughter from somewhere up above him  his companion spied an opening on the second bench and they both squeezed into it  this is grand the senior man whispered  youll have a rare view of it all  only a single row of heads intervened between them and the operating table  it was of unpainted deal plain strong and scrupulously clean  a sheet of brown waterproofing covered half of it and beneath stood a large tin tray full of sawdust  on the further side in front of the window there was a board which was strewed with glittering instrumentsforceps tenacula saws canulas and trocars  a line of knives with long thin delicate blades lay at one side  two young men lounged in front of this one threading needles the other doing something to a brass coffeepotlike thing which hissed out puffs of steam  thats peterson whispered the senior the big bald man in the front row  hes the skingrafting man you know  and thats anthony browne who took a larynx out successfully last winter  and theres murphy the pathologist and stoddart the eyeman  youll come to know them all soon  who are the two men at the table  nobodydressers  one has charge of the instruments and the other of the puffing billy  its listers antiseptic spray you know and archers one of the carbolicacid men  hayes is the leader of the cleanlinessandcoldwater school and they all hate each other like poison  a flutter of interest passed through the closely packed benches as a woman in petticoat and bodice was led in by two nurses  a red woolen shawl was draped over her head and round her neck  the face which looked out from it was that of a woman in the prime of her years but drawn with suffering and of a peculiar beeswax tint  her head drooped as she walked and one of the nurses with her arm round her waist was whispering consolation in her ear  she gave a quick sideglance at the instrument table as she passed but the nurses turned her away from it  what ails her asked the novice  cancer of the parotid  its the devil of a case extends right away back behind the carotids  theres hardly a man but archer would dare to follow it  ah here he is himself  as he spoke a small brisk irongrey man came striding into the room rubbing his hands together as he walked  he had a cleanshaven face of the naval officer type with large bright eyes and a firm straight mouth  behind him came his big housesurgeon with his gleaming pincenez and a trail of dressers who grouped themselves into the corners of the room  gentlemen cried the surgeon in a voice as hard and brisk as his manner we have here an interesting case of tumour of the parotid originally cartilaginous but now assuming malignant characteristics and therefore requiring excision  on to the table nurse  thank you chloroform clerk  thank you  you can take the shawl off nurse  the woman lay back upon the waterproofed pillow and her murderous tumour lay revealed  in itself it was a pretty thingivory white with a mesh of blue veins and curving gently from jaw to chest  but the lean yellow face and the stringy throat were in horrible contrast with the plumpness and sleekness of this monstrous growth  the surgeon placed a hand on each side of it and pressed it slowly backwards and forwards  adherent at one place gentlemen he cried  the growth involves the carotids and jugulars and passes behind the ramus of the jaw whither we must be prepared to follow it  it is impossible to say how deep our dissection may carry us  carbolic tray  thank you  dressings of carbolic gauze if you please  push the chloroform mr johnson  have the small saw ready in case it is necessary to remove the jaw  the patient was moaning gently under the towel which had been placed over her face  she tried to raise her arms and to draw up her knees but two dressers restrained her  the heavy air was full of the penetrating smells of carbolic acid and of chloroform  a muffled cry came from under the towel and then a snatch of a song sung in a high quavering monotonous voice    he says says he   if you fly with me   youll be mistress of the icecream van   youll be mistress of the  it mumbled off into a drone and stopped  the surgeon came across still rubbing his hands and spoke to an elderly man in front of the novice  narrow squeak for the government he said  oh ten is enough  they wont have ten long  theyd do better to resign before they are driven to it  oh i should fight it out  whats the use  they cant get past the committee even if they got a vote in the house  i was talking to  patients ready sir said the dresser  talking to mcdonaldbut ill tell you about it presently  he walked back to the patient who was breathing in long heavy gasps  i propose said he passing his hand over the tumour in an almost caressing fashion to make a free incision over the posterior border and to take another forward at right angles to the lower end of it might i trouble you for a medium knife mr johnson  the novice with eyes which were dilating with horror saw the surgeon pick up the long gleaming knife dip it into a tin basin and balance it in his fingers as an artist might his brush  then he saw him pinch up the skin above the tumour with his left hand  at the sight his nerves which had already been tried once or twice that day gave way utterly  his head swain round and he felt that in another instant he might faint  he dared not look at the patient  he dug his thumbs into his ears lest some scream should come to haunt him and he fixed his eyes rigidly upon the wooden ledge in front of him  one glance one cry would he knew break down the shred of selfpossession which he still retained  he tried to think of cricket of green fields and rippling water of his sisters at homeof anything rather than of what was going on so near him  and yet somehow even with his ears stopped up sounds seemed to penetrate to him and to carry their own tale  he heard or thought that he heard the long hissing of the carbolic engine  then he was conscious of some movement among the dressers  were there groans too breaking in upon him and some other sound some fluid sound which was more dreadfully suggestive still  his mind would keep building up every step of the operation and fancy made it more ghastly than fact could have been  his nerves tingled and quivered  minute by minute the giddiness grew more marked the numb sickly feeling at his heart more distressing  and then suddenly with a groan his head pitching forward and his brow cracking sharply upon the narrow wooden shelf in front of him he lay in a dead faint   when he came to himself he was lying in the empty theatre with his collar and shirt undone  the third years man was dabbing a wet sponge over his face and a couple of grinning dressers were looking on  all right cried the novice sitting up and rubbing his eyes  im sorry to have made an ass of myself  well so i should think said his companion  what on earth did you faint about  i couldnt help it  it was that operation  what operation  why that cancer  there was a pause and then the three students burst out laughing why you juggins cried the senior man there never was an operation at all  they found the patient didnt stand the chloroform well and so the whole thing was off  archer has been giving us one of his racy lectures and you fainted just in the middle of his favourite story     a straggler of 15  it was a dull october morning and heavy rolling fogwreaths lay low over the wet grey roofs of the woolwich houses  down in the long bricklined streets all was sodden and greasy and cheerless  from the high dark buildings of the arsenal came the whirr of many wheels the thudding of weights and the buzz and babel of human toil  beyond the dwellings of the workingmen smokestained and unlovely radiated away in a lessening perspective of narrowing road and dwindling wall  there were few folk in the streets for the toilers had all been absorbed since break of day by the huge smokespouting monster which sucked in the manhood of the town to belch it forth weary and workstained every night  little groups of children straggled to school or loitered to peep through the single front windows at the big giltedged bibles balanced upon small threelegged tables which were their usual adornment  stout women with thick red arms and dirty aprons stood upon the whitened doorsteps leaning upon their brooms and shrieking their morning greetings across the road  one stouter redder and dirtier than the rest had gathered a small knot of cronies around her and was talking energetically with little shrill titters from her audience to punctuate her remarks  old enough to know better she cried in answer to an exclamation from one of the listeners  if he haint no sense now i specs he wont learn much on this side o jordan  why ow old is he at all blessed if i could ever make out  well it aint so hard to reckon said a sharpfeatured palefaced woman with watery blue eyes  hes been at the battle o waterloo and has the pension and medal to prove it  that were a terble long time agone remarked a third  it were afore i were born  it were fifteen year after the beginnin of the century cried a younger woman who had stood leaning against the wall with a smile of superior knowledge upon her face  my bill was asaying so last sabbath when i spoke to him o old daddy brewster here  and suppose he spoke truth missus simpson ow long agone do that make it  its eightyone now said the original speaker checking off the years upon her coarse red fingers and that were fifteen  ten and ten and ten and ten and tenwhy its only sixtyandsix year so he aint so old after all  but he werent a newborn babe at the battle silly cried the young woman with a chuckle  spose he were only twenty then he couldnt be less than sixandeighty now at the lowest  aye hes thatevery day of it cried several  ive had bout enough of it remarked the large woman gloomily unless his young niece or grandniece or whatever she is come today im off and he can find some one else to do his work  your own ome first says i  aint he quiet then missus simpson asked the youngest of the group  listen to him now she answered with her hand half raised and her head turned slantwise towards the open door  from the upper floor there came a shuffling sliding sound with a sharp tapping of a stick there he go back and forrards doing what he call his sentry go  arf the night through hes at that game the silly old juggins  at six oclock this very mornin there he was beatin with a stick at my door turn out guard he cried and a lot more jargon that i could make nothing of  then what with his coughin and awkin and spittin there aint no gettin a wink o sleep  hark to him now  missus simpson missus simpson cried a cracked and querulous voice from above  thats him she cried nodding her head with an air of triumph  he do go on somethin scandalous  yes mr brewster sir  i want my morning ration missus simpson  its just ready mr brewster sir  blessed if he aint like a baby cryin for its pap said the young woman  i feel as if i could shake his old bones up sometimes cried mrs simpson viciously  but whos for a arf of fourpenny  the whole company were about to shuffle off to the public house when a young girl stepped across the road and touched the housekeeper timidly upon the arm  i think that is no 56 arsenal view she said  can you tell me if mr brewster lives here  the housekeeper looked critically at the newcomer  she was a girl of about twenty broadfaced and comely with a turnedup nose and large honest grey eyes  her print dress her straw hat with its bunch of glaring poppies and the bundle she carried had all a smack of the country  youre norah brewster i spose said mrs simpson eyeing her up and down with no friendly gaze  yes ive come to look after my granduncle gregory  and a good job too cried the housekeeper with a toss of her head its about time that some of his own folk took a turn at it for ive had enough of it  there you are young woman  in you go and make yourself at home  theres tea in the caddy and bacon on the dresser and the old man will be about you if you dont fetch him his breakfast ill send for my things in the evenin  with a nod she strolled off with her attendant gossips in the direction of the public house  thus left to her own devices the country girl walked into the front room and took off her hat and jacket  it was a lowroofed apartment with a sputtering fire upon which a small brass kettle was singing cheerily  a stained cloth lay over half the table with an empty brown teapot a loaf of bread and some coarse crockery  norah brewster looked rapidly about her and in an instant took over her new duties ere five minutes had passed the tea was made two slices of bacon were frizzling on the pan the table was rearranged the antimacassars straightened over the sombre brown furniture and the whole room had taken a new air of comfort and neatness  this done she looked round curiously at the prints upon the walls  over the fireplace in a small square case a brown medal caught her eye hanging from a strip of purple ribbon  beneath was a slip of newspaper cutting  she stood on her tiptoes with her fingers on the edge of the mantelpiece and craned her neck up to see it glancing down from time to time at the bacon which simmered and hissed beneath her  the cutting was yellow with age and ran in this way  on tuesday an interesting ceremony was performed at the barracks of the third regiment of guards when in the presence of the prince regent lord hill lord saltoun and an assemblage which comprised beauty as well as valour a special medal was presented to corporal gregory brewster of captain haldanes flank company in recognition of his gallantry in the recent great battle in the lowlands  it appears that on the evermemorable 18th of june four companies of the third guards and of the coldstreams under the command of colonels maitland and byng held the important farmhouse of hougoumont at the right of the british position  at a critical point of the action these troops found themselves short of powder  seeing that generals foy and jerome buonaparte were again massing their infantry for an attack on the position colonel byng dispatched corporal brewster to the rear to hasten up the reserve ammunition  brewster came upon two powder tumbrils of the nassau division and succeeded after menacing the drivers with his musket in inducing them to convey their powder to hougoumont  in his absence however the hedges surrounding the position had been set on fire by a howitzer battery of the french and the passage of the carts full of powder became a most hazardous matter the first tumbril exploded blowing the driver to fragments  daunted by the fate of his comrade the second driver turned his horses but corporal brewster springing upon his seat hurled the man down and urging the powder cart through the flames succeeded in forcing his way to his companions  to this gallant deed may be directly attributed the success of the british arms for without powder it would have been impossible to have held hougoumont and the duke of wellington had repeatedly declared that had hougoumont fallen as well as la haye sainte he would have found it impossible to have held his ground long may the heroic brewster live to treasure the medal which he has so bravely won and to look back with pride to the day when in the presence of his comrades he received this tribute to his valour from the august hands of the first gentleman of the realm  the reading of this old cutting increased in the girls mind the veneration which she had always had for her warrior kinsman  from her infancy he had been her hero and she remembered how her father used to speak of his courage and his strength how he could strike down a bullock with a blow of his fist and carry a fat sheep under either arm true she had never seen him but a rude painting at home which depicted a squarefaced clean shaven stalwart man with a great bearskin cap rose ever before her memory when she thought of him  she was still gazing at the brown medal and wondering what the dulce et decorum est might mean which was inscribed upon the edge when there came a sudden tapping and shuffling upon the stair and there at the door was standing the very man who had been so often in her thoughts  but could this indeed be he  where was the martial air the flashing eye the warrior face which she had pictured  there framed in the doorway was a huge twisted old man gaunt and puckered with twitching hands and shuffling purposeless feet  a cloud of fluffy white hair a redveined nose two thick tufts of eyebrow and a pair of dimly questioning watery blue eyesthese were what met her gaze  he leaned forward upon a stick while his shoulders rose and fell with his crackling rasping breathing  i want my morning rations he crooned as he stumped forward to his chair  the cold nips me without em  see to my fingers  he held out his distorted hands all blue at the tips wrinkled and gnarled with huge projecting knuckles  its nigh ready answered the girl gazing at him with wonder in her eyes  dont you know who i am granduncle  i am norah brewster from witham  rum

some minutes while norah sat stirring her tea and glancing sideways at the bluish lips and champing jaws of her companion  you must have seen a deal o life uncle said she  it must seem a long long time to you  not so very long neither  im ninety come candlemas but it dont seem long since i took the bounty  and that battle it might have been yesterday  eh but i get a power o good from my rations  he did indeed look less worn and colourless than when she first saw him  his face was flushed and his back more erect  have you read that he asked jerking his head towards the cutting  yes uncle and im sure you must be proud of it  ah it was a great day for me  a great day  the regent was there and a fine body of a man too  the ridgment is proud of you says he and im proud of the ridgment say i

that for them  theyve got the swing  he gazed after them until the last files had turned the corner and the measured tramp of their marching had died away in the distance  he had just regained his chair when the door opened and a gentleman stepped in  ah mr brewster  better today he asked  come in doctor  yes im better  but theres a deal o bubbling in my chest  its all them toobes  if i could but cut the phlegm id be right  cant you give me something to cut the phlegm  the doctor a gravefaced young man put his fingers to the furrowed bluecorded wrist  you must be careful he said  you must take no liberties  the thin tide of life seemed to thrill rather than to throb under his finger  the old man chuckled  ive got brother jarges girl to look after me now  shell see i dont break barracks

croaked and chuckled for a long time over his discovery  it wouldnt ha done for the dook he muttered  no by jimini the dook would ha had a word there  the doctor smiled  well you are doing very well said he  ill look in once a week or so and see how you are  as norah followed him to the door he beckoned her outside  he is very weak he whispered  if you find him failing you must send for me  what ails him doctor  ninety years ails him  his arteries are pipes of lime  his heart is shrunken and flabby  the man is worn out  norah stood watching the brisk figure of the young doctor and pondering over these new responsibilities which had come upon her when she turned a tall brownfaced artilleryman with the three gold chevrons of sergeant upon his arm was standing carbine in hand at her elbow  goodmorning miss said he raising one thick finger to his jaunty yellowbanded cap  i blieve theres an old gentleman lives here of the name of brewster who was engaged in the battle o waterloo  its my granduncle sir said norah casting down her eyes before the keen critical gaze of the young soldier  he is in the front parlour  could i have a word with him miss  ill call again if it dont chance to be convenient  i am sure that he would be very glad to see you sir  hes in here if youll step in  uncle heres a gentleman who wants to speak with you  proud to see you sirproud and glad sir cried the sergeant taking three steps forward into the room and grounding his carbine while he raised his hand palm forwards in a salute  norah stood by the door with her mouth and eyes open wondering if her granduncle had ever in his prime looked like this magnificent creature and whether he in his turn would ever come to resemble her granduncle  the old man blinked up at his visitor and shook his head slowly  sit ye down sergeant said he pointing with his stick to a chair youre full young for the stripes  lordy its easier to get three now than one in my day  gunners were old soldiers then and the grey hairs came quicker than the three stripes  i am eight years service sir cried the sergeant  macdonald is my namesergeant macdonald of h battery southern artillery division  i have called as the spokesman of my mates at the gunners barracks to say that we are proud to have you in the town sir  old brewster chuckled and rubbed his bony hands  that were what the regent said he cried  the ridgment is proud of ye says he  and i am proud of the ridgment says i  and a damned good answer too says he and he and lord hill bust out alaughin  the noncommissioned mess would be proud and honoured to see you sir said sergeant macdonald and if you could step as far youll always find a pipe o baccy and a glass o grog awaitin you  the old man laughed until he coughed  like to see me would they the dogs said he  well well when the warm weather comes again ill maybe drop in  too grand for a canteen eh  got your mess just the same as the orficers  whats the world acomin to at all  you was in the line sir was you not asked the sergeant respectfully  the line cried the old man with shrill scorn  never wore a shako in my life  i am a guardsman i am  served in the third guardsthe same they

when i ought to be there  but it aint my fault neither for im ready to fall in when the word comes  weve all got to muster there answered the sergeant  wont you try my baccy sir handing over a sealskin pouch  old brewster drew a blackened clay pipe from his pocket and began to stuff the tobacco into the bowl  in an instant it slipped through his fingers and was broken to pieces on the floor  his lip quivered his nose puckered up and he began crying with the long helpless sobs of a child  ive broke my pipe he cried  dont uncle oh dont cried norah bending over him and patting his white head as one soothes a baby  it dont matter  we can easy get another  dont you fret yourself sir said the sergeant  eres a wooden pipe with an amber mouth if youll do me the honour to accept it from me  id be real glad if you will take it  jimini cried he his smiles breaking in an instant through his tears  its a fine pipe  see to my new pipe norah  i lay that jarge never had a pipe like that  youve got your firelock there sergeant  yes sir  i was on my way back from the butts when i looked in  let me have the feel of it  lordy but it seems like old times to have ones hand on a musket  whats the manual sergeant eh  cock your firelocklook to your primingpresent your firelockeh sergeant  oh jimini ive broke your musket in halves  thats all right sir cried the gunner laughing  you pressed on the lever and opened the breechpiece  thats where we load em you know  load em at the wrong end  well well to think o that  and no ramrod neither  ive heard tell of it but i never believed it afore ah  it wont come up to brown bess  when theres work to be done you mark my word and see if they dont come back to brown bess  by the lord sir cried the sergeant hotly they need some change out in south africa now  i see by this mornins paper that the government has knuckled under to these boers  theyre hot about it at the noncom mess i can tell you sir  eheh croaked old brewster  by jimini it wouldnt ha done for the dook the dook would ha had a word to say over that  ah that he would sir cried the sergeant and god send us another like him  but ive wearied you enough for one sitting  ill look in again and ill bring a comrade or two with me if i may for there isnt one but would be proud to have speech with you  so with another salute to the veteran and a gleam of white teeth at norah the big gunner withdrew leaving a memory of blue cloth and of gold braid behind him  many days had not passed however before he was back again and during all the long winter he was a frequent visitor at arsenal view  there came a time at last when it might be doubted to which of the two occupants his visits were directed nor was it hard to say by which he was most anxiously awaited  he brought others with him and soon through all the lines a pilgrimage to daddy brewsters came to be looked upon as the proper thing to do  gunners and sappers linesmen and dragoons came bowing and bobbing into the little parlour with clatter of side arms and clink of spurs stretching their long legs across the patchwork rug and hunting in the front of their tunics for the screw of tobacco or paper of snuff which they had brought as a sign of their esteem  it was a deadly cold winter with six weeks on end of snow on the ground and norah had a hard task to keep the life in that timeworn body  there were times when his mind would leave him and when save an animal outcry when the hour of his meals came round no word would fall from him  he was a whitehaired child with all a childs troubles and emotions  as the warm weather came once more however and the green buds peeped forth again upon the trees the blood thawed in his veins and he would even drag himself as far as the door to bask in the lifegiving sunshine  it do hearten me up so he said one morning as he glowed in the hot may sun  its a job to keep back the flies though  they get owdacious in this weather and they do plague me cruel  ill keep them off you uncle said norah  eh but its fine  this sunshine makes me think o the glory to come you might read me a bit o the bible lass  i find it wonderful soothing  what part would you like uncle  oh them wars  the wars  aye keep to the wars  give me the old testament for choice  theres more taste to it to my mind  when parson comes he wants to get off to something else but its joshua or nothing with me  them israelites was good soldiersgood growed soldiers all of em  but uncle pleaded norah its all peace in the next world  no it aint gal  oh yes uncle surely  the old corporal knocked his stick irritably upon the ground  i tell ye it aint gal  i asked parson  well what did he say  he said there was to be a last fight  he even gave it a name he did the battle of armarm  armageddon  aye thats the name parson said  i specs the third guardsll be there  and the dookthe dookll have a word to say  an elderly greywhiskered gentleman had been walking down the street glancing up at the numbers of the houses  now as his eyes fell upon the old man he came straight for him  hullo said he perhaps you are gregory brewster  my name sir answered the veteran  you are the same brewster as i understand who is on the roll of the scots guards as having been present at the battle of waterloo  i am that man sir though we called it the third guards in those days  it was a fine ridgment and they only need me to make up a full muster  tut tut theyll have to wait years for that said the gentleman heartily  but i am the colonel of the scots guards and i thought i would like to have a word with you  old gregory brewster was up in an instant with his hand to his rabbitskin cap  god bless me he cried to think of it to think of it  hadnt the gentleman better come in suggested the practical norah from behind the door  surely sir surely walk in sir if i may be so bold  in his excitement he had forgotten his stick and as he led the way into the parlour his knees tottered and he threw out his hands  in an instant the colonel had caught him on one side and norah on the other  easy and steady said the colonel as he led him to his armchair  thank ye sir i was near gone that time  but lordy i why i can scarce believe it  to think of me the corporal of the flank company and you the colonel of the battalion  how things come round to be sure  why we are very proud of you in london said the colonel  and so you are actually one of the men who held hougoumont  he looked at the bony trembling hands with their huge knotted knuckles the stringy throat and the heaving rounded shoulders  could this indeed be the last of that band of heroes  then he glanced at the halffilled phials the blue liniment bottles the longspouted kettle and the sordid details of the sick room  better surely had he died under the blazing rafters of the belgian farmhouse thought the colonel  i hope that you are pretty comfortable and happy he remarked after a pause  thank ye sir  i have a good deal o trouble with my toobesa deal o trouble  you wouldnt think the job it is to cut the phlegm  and i need my rations  i gets cold without em  and the flies  i aint strong enough to fight against them  hows the memory asked the colonel  oh there aint nothing amiss there  why sir i could give you the name of every man in captain haldanes flank company  and the battleyou remember it  why i sees it all afore me every time i shuts my eyes  lordy sir you wouldnt hardly believe how clear it is to me  theres our line from the paregoric bottle right along to the snuff box  dye see well then the pill box is for hougoumont on the rightwhere we wasand norahs thimble for la haye sainte  there it is all right sir and here were our guns and here behind the reserves and the belgians  ach them belgians  he spat furiously into the fire then heres the french where my pipe lies and over here where i put my baccy pouch was the proosians acomin up on our left flank jimini but it was a glad sight to see the smoke of their guns  and what was it that struck you most now in connection with the whole affair asked the colonel  i lost three halfcrowns over it i did crooned old brewster  i shouldnt wonder if i was never to get that money now  i lent em to jabez smith my rear rank man in brussels  only till payday grig says he  by gosh he was stuck by a lancer at quatre bras and me with not so much as a slip o paper to prove the debt  them three halfcrowns is as good as lost to me  the colonel rose from his chair laughing  the officers of the guards want you to buy yourself some little trifle which may add to your comfort he said  it is not from me so you need not thank me he took up the old mans tobacco pouch and slipped a crisp banknote inside it  thank ye kindly sir  but theres one favour that i would like to ask you colonel  yes my man  if im called colonel you wont grudge me a flag and a firing party im not a civilian im a guardsmanim the last of the old third guards  all right my man ill see to it said the colonel  goodbye i hope to have nothing but good news from you  a kind gentleman norah croaked old brewster as they saw him walk past the window but lordy he aint fit to hold the stirrup o my colonel byng  it was on the very next day that the old corporal took a sudden change for the worse  even the golden sunlight streaming through the window seemed unable to warm that withered frame  the doctor came and shook his head in silence  all day the man lay with only his puffing blue lips and the twitching of his scraggy neck to show that he still held the breath of life  norah and sergeant macdonald had sat by him in the afternoon but he had shown no consciousness of their presence  he lay peacefully his eyes half closed his hands under his cheek as one who is very weary  they had left him for an instant and were sitting in the front room where norah was preparing tea when of a sudden they heard a shout that rang through the house  loud and clear and swelling it pealed in their earsa voice full of strength and energy and fiery passion the guards need powder it cried and yet again the guards need powder  the sergeant sprang from his chair and rushed in followed by the trembling norah  there was the old man standing up his blue eyes sparkling his white hair bristling his whole figure towering and expanding with eagle head and glance of fire  the guards need powder he thundered once again and by god they shall have it he threw up his long arms and sank back with a groan into his chair  the sergeant stooped over him  and his face darkened  oh archie archie sobbed the frightened girl what do you think of him  the sergeant turned away  i think said he that the third guards have a full muster now     the third generation  scudamore lane sloping down riverwards from just behind the monument lies at night in the shadow of two black and monstrous walls which loom high above the glimmer of the scattered gas lamps  the footpaths are narrow and the causeway is paved with rounded cobblestones so that the endless drays roar along it like breaking waves  a few oldfashioned houses lie scattered among the business premises and in one of these halfway down on the lefthand side dr horace selby conducts his large practice  it is a singular street for so big a man but a specialist who has an european reputation can afford to live where he likes  in his particular branch too patients do not always regard seclusion as a disadvantage  it was only ten oclock  the dull roar of the traffic which converged all day upon london bridge had died away now to a mere confused murmur it was raining heavily and the gas shone dimly through the streaked and dripping glass throwing little circles upon the glistening cobblestones  the air was full of the sounds of the rain the thin swish of its fall the heavier drip from the eaves and the swirl and gurgle down the two steep gutters and through the sewer grating  there was only one figure in the whole length of scudamore lane  it was that of a man and it stood outside the door of dr horace selby  he had just rung and was waiting for an answer  the fanlight beat full upon the gleaming shoulders of his waterproof and upon his upturned features  it was a wan sensitive clearcut face with some subtle nameless peculiarity in its expression something of the startled horse in the whiterimmed eye something too of the helpless child in the drawn cheek and the weakening of the lower lip  the manservant knew the stranger as a patient at a bare glance at those frightened eyes such a look had been seen at that door many times before  is the doctor in  the man hesitated  he has had a few friends to dinner sir  he does not like to be disturbed outside his usual hours sir  tell him that i must see him  tell him that it is of the very first importance  here is my card  he fumbled with his trembling fingers in trying to draw one from his case  sir francis norton is the name tell him that sir francis norton of deane park must see him without delay  yes sir  the butler closed his fingers upon the card and the halfsovereign which accompanied it  better hang your coat up here in the hall  it is very wet  now if you will wait here in the consultingroom i have no doubt that i shall be able to send the doctor in to you  it was a large and lofty room in which the young baronet found himself the carpet was so soft and thick that his feet made no sound as he walked across it  the two gas jets were turned only halfway up and the dim light with the faint aromatic smell which filled the air had a vaguely religious suggestion  he sat down in a shining leather armchair by the smouldering fire and looked gloomily about him  two sides of the room were taken up with books fat and sombre with broad gold lettering upon their backs  beside him was the high oldfashioned mantelpiece of white marblethe top of it strewed with cotton wadding and bandages graduated measures and little bottles there was one with a broad neck just above him containing bluestone and another narrower one with what looked like the ruins of a broken pipestem and caustic outside upon a red label  thermometers hypodermic syringes bistouries and spatulas were scattered about both on the mantelpiece and on the central table on either side of the sloping desk  on the same table to the right stood copies of the five books which dr horace selby had written upon the subject with which his name is peculiarly associated while on the left on the top of a red medical directory lay a huge glass model of a human eye the size of a turnip which opened down the centre to expose the lens and double chamber within  sir francis norton had never been remarkable for his powers of observation and yet he found himself watching these trifles with the keenest attention  even the corrosion of the cork of an acid bottle caught his eye and he wondered that the doctor did not use glass stoppers  tiny scratches where the light glinted off from the table little stains upon the leather of the desk chemical formulae scribbled upon the labels of the phialsnothing was too slight to arrest his attention  and his sense of hearing was equally alert  the heavy ticking of the solemn black clock above the mantelpiece struck quite painfully upon his ears  yet in spite of it and in spite also of the thick oldfashioned wooden partition he could hear voices of men talking in the next room and could even catch scraps of their conversation  second hand was bound to take it why you drew the last of them yourself  how could i play the queen when i knew that the ace was against me the phrases came in little spurts falling back into the dull murmur of conversation  and then suddenly he heard the creaking of a door and a step in the hall and knew with a tingling mixture of impatience and horror that the crisis of his life was at hand  dr horace selby was a large portly man with an imposing presence his nose and chin were bold and pronounced yet his features were puffy a combination which would blend more freely with the wig and cravat of the early georges than with the closecropped hair and black frockcoat of the end of the nineteenth century  he was clean shaven for his mouth was too good to coverlarge flexible and sensitive with a kindly human softening at either corner which with his brown sympathetic eyes had drawn out many a shamestruck sinners secret two masterful little bushy sidewhiskers bristled out from under his ears spindling away upwards to merge in the thick curves of his brindled hair  to his patients there was something reassuring in the mere bulk and dignity of the man  a high and easy bearing in medicine as in war bears with it a hint of victories in the past and a promise of others to come  dr horace selbys face was a consolation and so too were the large white soothing hands one of which he held out to his visitor  i am sorry to have kept you waiting  it is a conflict of duties you perceivea hosts to his guests and an advisers to his patient  but now i am entirely at your disposal sir francis  but dear me you are very cold  yes i am cold  and you are trembling all over  tut tut this will never do  this miserable night has chilled you  perhaps some little stimulant  no thank you  i would really rather not  and it is not the night which has chilled me  i am frightened doctor  the doctor halfturned in his chair and he patted the arch of the young mans knee as he might the neck of a restless horse  what then he asked looking over his shoulder at the pale face with the startled eyes  twice the young man parted his lips  then he stooped with a sudden gesture and turning up the right leg of his trousers he pulled down his sock and thrust forward his shin  the doctor made a clicking noise with his tongue as he glanced at it  both legs  no only one  suddenly  this morning  hum  the doctor pouted his lips and drew his finger and thumb down the line of his chin  can you account for it he asked briskly  no  a trace of sternness came into the large brown eyes  i need not point out to you that unless the most absolute frankness  the patient sprang from his chair  so help me god he cried i have nothing in my life with which to reproach myself  do you think that i would be such a fool as to come here and tell you lies  once for all i have nothing to regret  he was a pitiful halftragic and halfgrotesque figure as he stood with one trouser leg rolled to the knee and that ever present horror still lurking in his eyes  a burst of merriment came from the cardplayers in the next room and the two looked at each other in silence  sit down said the doctor abruptly your assurance is quite sufficient  he stooped and ran his finger down the line of the young mans shin raising it at one point  hum serpiginous he murmured shaking his head  any other symptoms  my eyes have been a little weak  let me see your teeth  he glanced at them and again made the gentle clicking sound of sympathy and disapprobation  now your eye  he lit a lamp at the patients elbow and holding a small crystal lens to concentrate the light he threw it obliquely upon the patients eye  as he did so a glow of pleasure came over his large expressive face a flush of such enthusiasm as the botanist feels when he packs the rare plant into his tin knapsack or the astronomer when the longsought comet first swims into the field of his telescope  this is very typicalvery typical indeed he murmured turning to his desk and jotting down a few memoranda upon a sheet of paper curiously enough i am writing a monograph upon the subject  it is singular that you should have been able to furnish so wellmarked a case  he had so forgotten the patient in his symptom that he had assumed an almost congratulatory air towards its possessor  he reverted to human sympathy again as his patient asked for particulars  my dear sir there is no occasion for us to go into strictly professional details together said he soothingly  if for example i were to say that you have interstitial keratitis how would you be the wiser  there are indications of a strumous diathesis  in broad terms i may say that you have a constitutional and hereditary taint  the young baronet sank back in his chair and his chin fell forwards upon his chest  the doctor sprang to a sidetable and poured out half a glass of liqueur brandy which he held to his patients lips  a little fleck of colour came into his cheeks as he drank it down  perhaps i spoke a little abruptly said the doctor but you must have known the nature of your complaint  why otherwise should you have come to me  god help me i suspected it but only today when my leg grew bad  my father had a leg like this  it was from him then  no from my grandfather  you have heard of sir rupert norton the great corinthian  the doctor was a man of wide reading with a retentive memory  the name brought back instantly to him the remembrance of the sinister reputation of its ownera notorious buck of the thirtieswho had gambled and duelled and steeped himself in drink and debauchery until even the vile set with whom he consorted had shrunk away from him in horror and left him to a sinister old age with the barmaid wife whom he had married in some drunken frolic  as he looked at the young man still leaning back in the leather chair there seemed for the instant to flicker up behind him some vague presentiment of that foul old dandy with his dangling seals manywreathed scarf and dark satyric face what was he now  an armful of bones in a mouldy box  but his deeds they were living and rotting the blood in the veins of an innocent man  i see that you have heard of him said the young baronet  he died horribly i have been told but not more horribly than he had lived my father was his only son  he was a studious man fond of books and canaries and the country but his innocent life did not save him  his symptoms were cutaneous i understand  he wore gloves in the house  that was the first thing i can remember and then it was his throat  and then his legs  he used to ask me so often about my own health and i thought him so fussy for how could i tell what the meaning of it was  he was always watching mealways with a sidelong eye fixed upon me  now at last i know what he was watching for  had you brothers or sisters  none thank god  well well it is a sad case and very typical of many which come in my way  you are no lonely sufferer sir francis  there are many thousands who bear the same cross as you do  but where is the justice of it doctor cried the young man springing from his chair and pacing up and down the consultingroom if i were heir to my grandfathers sins as well as to their results i could understand it but i am of my fathers type  i love all that is gentle and beautifulmusic and poetry and art  the coarse and animal is abhorrent to me  ask any of my friends and they would tell you that  and now that this vile loathsome thingach i am polluted to the marrow soaked in abomination  and why  havent i a right to ask why  did i do it  was it my fault  could i help being born  and look at me now blighted and blasted just as life was at its sweetest talk about the sins of the fatherhow about the sins of the creator he shook his two clinched hands in the airthe poor impotent atom with his pinpoint of brain caught in the whirl of the infinite  the doctor rose and placing his hands upon his shoulders he pressed him back into his chair once more  there there my dear lad said he you must not excite yourself  you are trembling all over  your nerves cannot stand it  we must take these great questions upon trust what are we after all  halfevolved creatures in a transition stage nearer perhaps to the medusa on the one side than to perfected humanity on the other  with half a complete brain we cant expect to understand the whole of a complete fact can we now  it is all very dim and dark no doubt but i think that popes famous couplet sums up the whole matter and from my heart after fifty years of varied experience i can say  but the young baronet gave a cry of impatience and disgust  words words words  you can sit comfortably there in your chair and say themand think them too no doubt  youve had your life but ive never had mine  youve healthy blood in your veins mine is putrid and yet i am as innocent as you  what would words do for you if you were in this chair and i in that  ah its such a mockery and a makebelieve  dont think me rude though doctor  i dont mean to be that  i only say that it is impossible for you or any other man to realise it  but ive a question to ask you doctor  its one on which my whole life must depend  he writhed his fingers together in an agony of apprehension  speak out my dear sir  i have every sympathy with you  do you thinkdo you think the poison has spent itself on me  do you think that if i had children they would suffer  i can only give one answer to that  the third and fourth generation says the trite old text  you may in time eliminate it from your system but many years must pass before you can think of marriage  i am to be married on tuesday whispered the patient  it was the doctors turn to be thrilled with horror  there were not many situations which would yield such a sensation to his seasoned nerves  he sat in silence while the babble of the cardtable broke in upon them again  we had a double ruff if you had returned a heart i was bound to clear the trumps  they were hot and angry about it  how could you cried the doctor severely  it was criminal  you forget that i have only learned how i stand today  he put his two hands to his temples and pressed them convulsively  you are a man of the world dr selby  you have seen or heard of such things before give me some advice  im in your hands  it is all very sudden and horrible and i dont think i am strong enough to bear it  the doctors heavy brows thickened into two straight lines and he bit his nails in perplexity  the marriage must not take place  then what am i to do  at all costs it must not take place  and i must give her up  there can be no question about that  the young man took out a pocketbook and drew from it a small photograph holding it out towards the doctor  the firm face softened as he looked at it  it is very hard on you no doubt  i can appreciate it more now that i have seen that  but there is no alternative at all  you must give up all thought of it  but this is madness doctormadness i tell you  no i wont raise my voice  i forgot myself  but realise it man  i am to be married on tuesday  this coming tuesday you understand  and all the world knows it  how can i put such a public affront upon her  it would be monstrous  none the less it must be done  my dear lad there is no way out of it  you would have me simply write brutally and break the engagement at the last moment without a reason  i tell you i couldnt do it  i had a patient once who found himself in a somewhat similar situation some years ago said the doctor thoughtfully  his device was a singular one  he deliberately committed a penal offence and so compelled the young ladys people to withdraw their consent to the marriage  the young baronet shook his head  my personal honour is as yet unstained said he  i have little else left but that at least i will preserve  well well it is a nice dilemma and the choice lies with you  have you no other suggestion  you dont happen to have property in australia  none  but you have capital  yes  then you could buy some  tomorrow morning would do  a thousand mining shares would be enough  then you might write to say that urgent business affairs have compelled you to start at an hours notice to inspect your property  that would give you six months at any rate  well that would be possible  yes certainly it would be possible but think of her position  the house full of wedding presentsguests coming from a distance  it is awful  and you say that there is no alternative  the doctor shrugged his shoulders  well then i might write it now and start tomorroweh  perhaps you would let me use your desk  thank you  i am so sorry to keep you from your guests so long  but i wont be a moment now  he wrote an abrupt note of a few lines  then with a sudden impulse he tore it to shreds and flung it into the fireplace  no i cant sit down and tell her a lie doctor he said rising  we must find some other way out of this  i will think it over and let you know my decision  you must allow me to double your fee as i have taken such an unconscionable time  now goodbye and thank you a thousand times for your sympathy and advice  why dear me you havent even got your prescription yet  this is the mixture and i should recommend one of these powders every morning and the chemist will put all directions upon the ointment box  you are placed in a cruel situation but i trust that these may be but passing clouds  when may i hope to hear from you again  tomorrow morning  very good  how the rain is splashing in the street  you have your waterproof there  you will need it  goodbye then until tomorrow  he opened the door  a gust of cold damp air swept into the hall  and yet the doctor stood for a minute or more watching the lonely figure which passed slowly through the yellow splotches of the gas lamps and into the broad bars of darkness between  it was but his own shadow which trailed up the wall as he passed the lights and yet it looked to the doctors eye as though some huge and sombre figure walked by a manikins side and led him silently up the lonely street  dr horace selby heard again of his patient next morning and rather earlier than he had expected  a paragraph in the daily news caused him to push away his breakfast untasted and turned him sick and faint while he read it  a deplorable accident it was headed and it ran in this way  a fatal accident of a peculiarly painful character is reported from king william street  about eleven oclock last night a young man was observed while endeavouring to get out of the way of a hansom to slip and fall under the wheels of a heavy twohorse dray  on being picked up his injuries were found to be of the most shocking character and he expired while being conveyed to the hospital  an examination of his pocketbook and cardcase shows beyond any question that the deceased is none other than sir francis norton of deane park who has only within the last year come into the baronetcy  the accident is made the more deplorable as the deceased who was only just of age was on the eve of being married to a young lady belonging to one of the oldest families in the south  with his wealth and his talents the ball of fortune was at his feet and his many friends will be deeply grieved to know that his promising career has been cut short in so sudden and tragic a fashion     a false start  is dr horace wilkinson at home  i am he  pray step in  the visitor looked somewhat astonished at having the door opened to him by the master of the house  i wanted to have a few words  the doctor a pale nervous young man dressed in an ultraprofessional long black frockcoat with a high white collar cutting off his dapper sidewhiskers in the centre rubbed his hands together and smiled  in the thick burly man in front of him he scented a patient and it would be his first  his scanty resources had begun to run somewhat low and although he had his first quarters rent safely locked away in the righthand drawer of his desk it was becoming a question with him how he should meet the current expenses of his very simple housekeeping  he bowed therefore waved his visitor in closed the hall door in a careless fashion as though his own presence thereat had been a purely accidental circumstance and finally led the burly stranger into his scantily furnished front room where he motioned him to a seat  dr wilkinson planted himself behind his desk and placing his fingertips together he gazed with some apprehension at his companion  what was the matter with the man  he seemed very red in the face  some of his old professors would have diagnosed his case by now and would have electrified the patient by describing his own symptoms before he had said a word about them  dr horace wilkinson racked his brains for some clue but nature had fashioned him as a ploddera very reliable plodder and nothing more  he could think of nothing save that the visitors watchchain had a very brassy appearance with a corollary to the effect that he would be lucky if he got halfacrown out of him  still even halfacrown was something in those early days of struggle  whilst the doctor had been running his eyes over the stranger the latter had been plunging his hands into pocket after pocket of his heavy coat  the heat of the weather his dress and this exercise of pocketrummaging had all combined to still further redden his face which had changed from brick to beet with a gloss of moisture on his brow  this extreme ruddiness brought a clue at last to the observant doctor  surely it was not to be attained without alcohol  in alcohol lay the secret of this mans trouble  some little delicacy was needed however in showing him that he had read his case arightthat at a glance he had penetrated to the inmost sources of his ailments  its very hot observed the stranger mopping his forehead  yes it is weather which tempts one to drink rather more beer than is good for one answered dr horace wilkinson looking very knowingly at his companion from over his fingertips  dear dear you shouldnt do that  i  i never touch beer  neither do i  ive been an abstainer for twenty years  this was depressing  dr wilkinson blushed until he was nearly as red as the other  may i ask what i can do for you he asked picking up his stethoscope and tapping it gently against his thumbnail  yes i was just going to tell you  i heard of your coming but i couldnt get round before  he broke into a nervous little cough  yes said the doctor encouragingly  i should have been here three weeks ago but you know how these things get put off  he coughed again behind his large red hand  i do not think that you need say anything more said the doctor taking over the case with an easy air of command  your cough is quite sufficient  it is entirely bronchial by the sound  no doubt the mischief is circumscribed at present but there is always the danger that it may spread so you have done wisely to come to me  a little judicious treatment will soon set you right  your waistcoat please but not your shirt  puff out your chest and say ninetynine in a deep voice  the redfaced man began to laugh  its all right doctor said he that cough comes from chewing tobacco and i know its a very bad habit  nineandninepence is what i have to say to you for im the officer of the gas company and they have a claim against you for that on the metre  dr horace wilkinson collapsed into his chair  then youre not a patient he gasped  never needed a doctor in my life sir  oh thats all right  the doctor concealed his disappointment under an affectation of facetiousness  you dont look as if you troubled them much  i dont know what we should do if every one were as robust i shall call at the companys offices and pay this small amount  if you could make it convenient sir now that i am here it would save trouble  oh certainly  these eternal little sordid money troubles were more trying to the doctor than plain living or scanty food  he took out his purse and slid the contents on to the table  there were two halfcrowns and some pennies  in his drawer he had ten golden sovereigns  but those were his rent  if he once broke in upon them he was lost  he would starve first  dear me said he with a smile as at some strange unheardof incident  i have run short of small change  i am afraid i shall have to call upon the company after all  very well sir the inspector rose and with a practised glance around which valued every article in the room from the twoguinea carpet to the eightshilling muslin curtains he took his departure  when he had gone dr wilkinson rearranged his room as was his habit a dozen times in the day  he laid out his large quains dictionary of medicine in the forefront of the table so as to impress the casual patient that he had ever the best authorities at his elbow  then he cleared all the little instruments out of his pocketcasethe scissors the forceps the bistouries the lancetsand he laid them all out beside the stethoscope to make as good a show as possible his ledger daybook and visitingbook were spread in front of him there was no entry in any of them yet but it would not look well to have the covers too glossy and new so he rubbed them together and daubed ink over them  neither would it be well that any patient should observe that his name was the first in the book so he filled up the first page of each with notes of imaginary visits paid to nameless patients during the last three weeks  having done all this he rested his head upon his hands and relapsed into the terrible occupation of waiting  terrible enough at any time to the young professional man but most of all to one who knows that the weeks and even the days during which he can hold out are numbered  economise as he would the money would still slip away in the countless little claims which a man never understands until he lives under a rooftree of his own  dr wilkinson could not deny as he sat at his desk and looked at the little heap of silver and coppers that his chances of being a successful practitioner in sutton were rapidly vanishing away  and yet it was a bustling prosperous town with so much money in it that it seemed strange that a man with a trained brain and dexterous fingers should be starved out of it for want of employment  at his desk dr horace wilkinson could see the neverending double current of people which ebbed and flowed in front of his window  it was a busy street and the air was forever filled with the dull roar of life the grinding of the wheels and the patter of countless feet  men women and children thousands and thousands of them passed in the day and yet each was hurrying on upon his own business scarce glancing at the small brass plate or wasting a thought upon the man who waited in the front room  and yet how many of them would obviously glaringly have been the better for his professional assistance  dyspeptic men anemic women blotched faces bilious complexionsthey flowed past him they needing him he needing them and yet the remorseless bar of professional etiquette kept them forever apart  what could he do could he stand at his own front door pluck the casual stranger by the sleeve and whisper in his ear sir you will forgive me for remarking that you are suffering from a severe attack of acne rosacea which makes you a peculiarly unpleasant object  allow me to suggest that a small prescription containing arsenic which will not cost you more than you often spend upon a single meal will be very much to your advantage  such an address would be a degradation to the high and lofty profession of medicine and there are no such sticklers for the ethics of that profession as some to whom she has been but a bitter and a grudging mother  dr horace wilkinson was still looking moodily out of the window when there came a sharp clang at the bell  often it had rung and with every ring his hopes had sprung up only to dwindle away again and change to leaden disappointment as he faced some beggar or touting tradesman  but the doctors spirit was young and elastic and again in spite of all experience it responded to that exhilarating summons he sprang to his feet cast his eyes over the table thrust out his medical books a little more prominently and hurried to the door  a groan escaped him as he entered the hall  he could see through the halfglazed upper panels that a gypsy van hung round with wicker tables and chairs had halted before his door and that a couple of the vagrants with a baby were waiting outside  he had learned by experience that it was better not even to parley with such people  i have nothing for you said he loosing the latch by an inch  go away  he closed the door but the bell clanged once more  get away  get away he cried impatiently and walked back into his consultingroom he had hardly seated himself when the bell went for the third time  in a towering passion he rushed back flung open the door  what the  if you please sir we need a doctor  in an instant he was rubbing his hands again with his blandest professional smile  these were patients then whom he had tried to hunt from his doorstepthe very first patients whom he had waited for so impatiently  they did not look very promising  the man a tall lankhaired gypsy had gone back to the horses head  there remained a small hardfaced woman with a great bruise all round her eye  she wore a yellow silk handkerchief round her head and a baby tucked in a red shawl was pressed to her bosom  pray step in madam said dr horace wilkinson with his very best sympathetic manner  in this case at least there could be no mistake as to diagnosis  if you will sit on this sofa i shall very soon make you feel much more comfortable  he poured a little water from his carafe into a saucer made a compress of lint fastened it over the injured eye and secured the whole with a spica bandage secundum artem  thank ye kindly sir said the woman when his work was finished thats nice and warm and may god bless your honour  but it wasnt about my eye at all that i came to see a doctor  not your eye dr horace wilkinson was beginning to be a little doubtful as to the advantages of quick diagnosis  it is an excellent thing to be able to surprise a patient but hitherto it was always the patient who had surprised him  the babys got the measles  the mother parted the red shawl and exhibited a little dark blackeyed gypsy baby whose swarthy face was all flushed and mottled with a darkred rash  the child breathed with a rattling sound and it looked up at the doctor with eyes which were heavy with want of sleep and crusted together at the lids  hum  yes  measles sure enoughand a smart attack  i just wanted you to see her sir so that you could signify  could what  signify if anything happened  oh i seecertify  and now that youve seen it sir ill go on for reubenthats my manis in a hurry  but dont you want any medicine  oh now youve seen it its all right  ill let you know if anything happens  but you must have some medicine  the child is very ill  he descended into the little room which he had fitted as a surgery and he made up a twoounce bottle of cooling medicine  in such cities as sutton there are few patients who can afford to pay a fee to both doctor and chemist so that unless the physician is prepared to play the part of both he will have little chance of making a living at either  there is your medicine madam  you will find the directions upon the bottle  keep the child warm and give it a light diet  thank you kindly sir she shouldered her baby and marched for the door  excuse me madam said the doctor nervously  dont you think it too small a matter to make a bill of  perhaps it would be better if we had a settlement at once  the gypsy woman looked at him reproachfully out of her one uncovered eye  are you going to charge me for that she asked  how much then  well say halfacrown  he mentioned the sum in a halfjesting way as though it were too small to take serious notice of but the gypsy woman raised quite a scream at the mention of it  arfacrown for that  well my good woman why not go to the poor doctor if you cannot afford a fee  she fumbled in her pocket craning awkwardly to keep her grip upon the baby  heres sevenpence she said at last holding out a little pile of copper coins  ill give you that and a wicker footstool  but my fee is halfacrown  the doctors views of the glory of his profession cried out against this wretched haggling and yet what was he to do  where am i to get arfacrown  it is well for gentlefolk like you who sit in your grand houses and can eat and drink what you like an charge arfacrown for just saying as much as ow dye do  we cant pick up arfcrowns like that  what we gets we earns ard  this sevenpence is just all ive got  you told me to feed the child light  she must feed light for what shes to have is more than i know  whilst the woman had been speaking dr horace wilkinsons eyes had wandered to the tiny heap of money upon the table which represented all that separated him from absolute starvation and he chuckled to himself at the grim joke that he should appear to this poor woman to be a being living in the lap of luxury  then he picked up the odd coppers leaving only the two halfcrowns upon the table  here you are he said brusquely  never mind the fee and take these coppers  they may be of some use to you  goodbye  he bowed her out and closed the door behind her  after all she was the thin edge of the wedge  these wandering people have great powers of recommendation  all large practices have been built up from such foundations  the hangerson to the kitchen recommend to the kitchen they to the drawingroom and so it spreads  at least he could say now that he had had a patient  he went into the back room and lit the spiritkettle to boil the water for his tea laughing the while at the recollection of his recent interview  if all patients were like this one it could easily be reckoned how many it would take to ruin him completely  putting aside the dirt upon his carpet and the loss of time there were twopence gone upon the bandage fourpence or more upon the medicine to say nothing of phial cork label and paper  then he had given her fivepence so that his first patient had absorbed altogether not less than one sixth of his available capital  if five more were to come he would be a broken man  he sat down upon the portmanteau and shook with laughter at the thought while he measured out his one spoonful and a half of tea at one shilling eightpence into the brown earthenware teapot suddenly however the laugh faded from his face and he cocked his ear towards the door standing listening with a slanting head and a sidelong eye  there had been a rasping of wheels against the curb the sound of steps outside and then a loud peal at the bell  with his teaspoon in his hand he peeped round the corner and saw with amazement that a carriage and pair were waiting outside and that a powdered footman was standing at the door  the spoon tinkled down upon the floor and he stood gazing in bewilderment  then pulling himself together he threw open the door  young man said the flunky tell your master dr wilkinson that he is wanted just as quick as ever he can come to lady millbank at the towers  he is to come this very instant  wed take him with us but we have to go back to see if dr mason is home yet  just you stir your stumps and give him the message  the footman nodded and was off in an instant while the coachman lashed his horses and the carriage flew down the street  here was a new development  dr horace wilkinson stood at his door and tried to think it all out  lady millbank of the towers  people of wealth and position no doubt  and a serious case or why this haste and summoning of two doctors  but then why in the name of all that is wonderful should he be sent for  he was obscure unknown without influence  there must be some mistake  yes that must be the true explanation or was it possible that some one was attempting a cruel hoax upon him  at any rate it was too positive a message to be disregarded  he must set off at once and settle the matter one way or the other  but he had one source of information  at the corner of the street was a small shop where one of the oldest inhabitants dispensed newspapers and gossip  he could get information there if anywhere  he put on his wellbrushed top hat secreted instruments and bandages in all his pockets and without waiting for his tea closed up his establishment and started off upon his adventure  the stationer at the corner was a human directory to every one and everything in sutton so that he soon had all the information which he wanted  sir john millbank was very well known in the town it seemed he was a merchant prince an exporter of pens three times mayor and reported to be fully worth two millions sterling  the towers was his palatial seat just outside the city  his wife had been an invalid for some years and was growing worse  so far the whole thing seemed to be genuine enough  by some amazing chance these people really had sent for him  and then another doubt assailed him and he turned back into the shop  i am your neighbour dr horace wilkinson said he  is there any other medical man of that name in the town  no the stationer was quite positive that there was not  that was final then  a great good fortune had come in his way and he must take prompt advantage of it  he called a cab and drove furiously to the towers with his brain in a whirl giddy with hope and delight at one moment and sickened with fears and doubts at the next lest the case should in some way be beyond his powers or lest he should find at some critical moment that he was without the instrument or appliance that was needed  every strange and outre case of which he had ever heard or read came back into his mind and long before he reached the towers he had worked himself into a positive conviction that he would be instantly required to do a trephining at the least  the towers was a very large house standing back amid trees at the head of a winding drive  as he drove up the doctor sprang out paid away half his worldly assets as a fare and followed a stately footman who having taken his name led him through the oakpanelled stainedglass hall gorgeous with deers heads and ancient armour and ushered him into a large sittingroom beyond  a very irritablelooking acidfaced man was seated in an armchair by the fireplace while two young ladies in white were standing together in the bow window at the further end  hullo hullo hullo  whats thisheh cried the irritable man are you dr wilkinson  eh  yes sir i am dr wilkinson  really now  you seem very youngmuch younger than i expected well well well masons old and yet he dont seem to know much about it  i suppose we must try the other end now  youre the wilkinson who wrote something about the lungs  heh  here was a light  the only two letters which the doctor had ever written to the lancetmodest little letters thrust away in a back column among the wrangles about medical ethics and the inquiries as to how much it took to keep a horse in the countryhad been upon pulmonary disease  they had not been wasted then  some eye had picked them out and marked the name of the writer  who could say that work was ever wasted or that merit did not promptly meet with its reward  yes i have written on the subject  ha  well then wheres mason  i have not the pleasure of his acquaintance  nothats queer too  he knows you and thinks a lot of your opinion youre a stranger in the town are you not  yes i have only been here a very short time  that was what mason said  he didnt give me the address  said he would call on you and bring you but when the wife got worse of course i inquired for you and sent for you direct  i sent for mason too but he was out  however we cant wait for him so just run away upstairs and do what you can  well i am placed in a rather delicate position said dr horace wilkinson with some hesitation  i am here as i understand to meet my colleague dr mason in consultation  it would perhaps hardly be correct for me to see the patient in his absence  i think that i would rather wait  would you by jove  do you think ill let my wife get worse while the doctor is coolly kicking his heels in the room below  no sir i am a plain man and i tell you that you will either go up or go out  the style of speech jarred upon the doctors sense of the fitness of things but still when a mans wife is ill much may be overlooked  he contented himself by bowing somewhat stiffly  i shall go up if you insist upon it said he  i do insist upon it  and another thing i wont have her thumped about all over the chest or any hocuspocus of the sort  she has bronchitis and asthma and thats all  if you can cure it well and good  but it only weakens her to have you tapping and listening and it does no good either  personal disrespect was a thing that the doctor could stand but the profession was to him a holy thing and a flippant word about it cut him to the quick  thank you said he picking up his hat  i have the honour to wish you a very good day  i do not care to undertake the responsibility of this case  hullo whats the matter now  it is not my habit to give opinions without examining my patient  i wonder that you should suggest such a course to a medical man  i wish you good day  but sir john millbank was a commercial man and believed in the commercial principle that the more difficult a thing is to attain the more valuable it is  a doctors opinion had been to him a mere matter of guineas  but here was a young man who seemed to care nothing either for his wealth or title  his respect for his judgment increased amazingly  tut tut said he mason is not so thinskinned  there there have your way  do what you like and i wont say another word  ill just run upstairs and tell lady millbank that you are coming  the door had hardly closed behind him when the two demure young ladies darted out of their corner and fluttered with joy in front of the astonished doctor  oh well done well done cried the taller clapping her hands  dont let him bully you doctor said the other  oh it was so nice to hear you stand up to him  thats the way he does with poor dr mason  dr mason has never examined mamma yet  he always takes papas word for everything  hush maude here he comes again  they subsided in an instant into their corner as silent and demure as ever  dr horace wilkinson followed sir john up the broad thickcarpeted staircase and into the darkened sick room  in a quarter of an hour he had sounded and sifted the case to the uttermost and descended with the husband once more to the drawingroom  in front of the fireplace were standing two gentlemen the one a very typical cleanshaven general practitioner the other a strikinglooking man of middle age with pale blue eyes and a long red beard  hullo mason youve come at last  yes sir john and i have brought as i promised dr wilkinson with me  dr  wilkinson  why this is he  dr mason stared in astonishment  i have never seen the gentleman before he cried  nevertheless i am dr wilkinsondr horace wilkinson of 114 canal view  good gracious sir john cried dr mason  did you think that in a case of such importance i should call in a junior local practitioner  this is dr adam wilkinson lecturer on pulmonary diseases at regents college london physician upon the staff of the st swithins hospital and author of a dozen works upon the subject  he happened to be in sutton upon a visit and i thought i would utilise his presence to have a firstrate opinion upon lady millbank  thank you said sir john dryly  but i fear my wife is rather tired now for she has just been very thoroughly examined by this young gentleman  i think we will let it stop at that for the present though of course as you have had the trouble of coming here i should be glad to have a note of your fees  when dr mason had departed looking very disgusted and his friend the specialist very amused sir john listened to all the young physician had to say about the case  now ill tell you what said he when he had finished  im a man of my word dye see  when i like a man i freeze to him  im a good friend and a bad enemy  i believe in you and i dont believe in mason  from now on you are my doctor and that of my family  come and see my wife every day  how does that suit your book  i am extremely grateful to you for your kind intentions toward me but i am afraid there is no possible way in which i can avail myself of them  heh what dye mean  i could not possibly take dr masons place in the middle of a case like this  it would be a most unprofessional act  oh well go your own way cried sir john in despair  never was such a man for making difficulties  youve had a fair offer and youve refused it and now you can just go your own way  the millionaire stumped out of the room in a huff and dr horace wilkinson made his way homeward to his spiritlamp and his oneandeightpenny tea with his first guinea in his pocket and with a feeling that he had upheld the best traditions of his profession  and yet this false start of his was a true start also for it soon came to dr masons ears that his junior had had it in his power to carry off his best patient and had forborne to do so  to the honour of the profession be it said that such forbearance is the rule rather than the exception and yet in this case with so very junior a practitioner and so very wealthy a patient the temptation was greater than is usual there was a grateful note a visit a friendship and now the wellknown firm of mason and wilkinson is doing the largest family practice in sutton     the curse of eve  robert johnson was an essentially commonplace man with no feature to distinguish him from a million others  he was pale of face ordinary in looks neutral in opinions thirty years of age and a married man by trade he was a gentlemans outfitter in the new north road and the competition of business squeezed out of him the little character that was left  in his hope of conciliating customers he had become cringing and pliable until working ever in the same routine from day to day he seemed to have sunk into a soulless machine rather than a man  no great question had ever stirred him  at the end of this snug century selfcontained in his own narrow circle it seemed impossible that any of the mighty primitive passions of mankind could ever reach him  yet birth and lust and illness and death are changeless things and when one of these harsh facts springs out upon a man at some sudden turn of the path of life it dashes off for the moment his mask of civilisation and gives a glimpse of the stranger and stronger face below  johnsons wife was a quiet little woman with brown hair and gentle ways  his affection for her was the one positive trait in his character  together they would lay out the shop window every monday morning the spotless shirts in their green cardboard boxes below the neckties above hung in rows over the brass rails the cheap studs glistening from the white cards at either side while in the background were the rows of cloth caps and the bank of boxes in which the more valuable hats were screened from the sunlight  she kept the books and sent out the bills  no one but she knew the joys and sorrows which crept into his small life  she had shared his exultations when the gentleman who was going to india had bought ten dozen shirts and an incredible number of collars and she had been as stricken as he when after the goods had gone the bill was returned from the hotel address with the intimation that no such person had lodged there  for five years they had worked building up the business thrown together all the more closely because their marriage had been a childless one  now however there were signs that a change was at hand and that speedily she was unable to come downstairs and her mother mrs peyton came over from camberwell to nurse her and to welcome her grandchild  little qualms of anxiety came over johnson as his wifes time approached  however after all it was a natural process  other mens wives went through it unharmed and why should not his  he was himself one of a family of fourteen and yet his mother was alive and hearty it was quite the exception for anything to go wrong  and yet in spite of his reasonings the remembrance of his wifes condition was always like a sombre background to all his other thoughts  dr miles of bridport place the best man in the neighbourhood was retained five months in advance and as time stole on many little packets of absurdly small white garments with frill work and ribbons began to arrive among the big consignments of male necessities  and then one evening as johnson was ticketing the scarfs in the shop he heard a bustle upstairs and mrs peyton came running down to say that lucy was bad and that she thought the doctor ought to be there without delay  it was not robert johnsons nature to hurry  he was prim and staid and liked to do things in an orderly fashion  it was a quarter of a mile from the corner of the new north road where his shop stood to the doctors house in bridport place  there were no cabs in sight so he set off upon foot leaving the lad to mind the shop  at bridport place he was told that the doctor had just gone to harman street to attend a man in a fit  johnson started off for harman street losing a little of his primness as he became more anxious  two full cabs but no empty ones passed him on the way  at harman street he learned that the doctor had gone on to a case of measles fortunately he had left the address69 dunstan road at the other side of the regents canal roberts primness had vanished now as he thought of the women waiting at home and he began to run as hard as he could down the kingsland road  some way along he sprang into a cab which stood by the curb and drove to dunstan road  the doctor had just left and robert johnson felt inclined to sit down upon the steps in despair  fortunately he had not sent the cab away and he was soon back at bridport place  dr miles had not returned yet but they were expecting him every instant  johnson waited drumming his fingers on his knees in a high dim lit room the air of which was charged with a faint sickly smell of ether  the furniture was massive and the books in the shelves were sombre and a squat black clock ticked mournfully on the mantelpiece  it told him that it was halfpast seven and that he had been gone an hour and a quarter  whatever would the women think of him  every time that a distant door slammed he sprang from his chair in a quiver of eagerness  his ears strained to catch the deep notes of the doctors voice  and then suddenly with a gush of joy he heard a quick step outside and the sharp click of the key in the lock in an instant he was out in the hall before the doctors foot was over the threshold  if you please doctor ive come for you he cried the wife was taken bad at six oclock  he hardly knew what he expected the doctor to do  something very energetic certainlyto seize some drugs perhaps and rush excitedly with him through the gaslit streets  instead of that dr miles threw his umbrella into the rack jerked off his hat with a somewhat peevish gesture and pushed johnson back into the room  lets see  you did engage me didnt you he asked in no very cordial voice  oh yes doctor last november  johnson the outfitter you know in the new north road  yes yes  its a bit overdue said the doctor glancing at a list of names in a notebook with a very shiny cover  well how is she  i dont  ah of course its your first  youll know more about it next time  mrs peyton said it was time you were there sir  my dear sir there can be no very pressing hurry in a first case  we shall have an allnight affair i fancy  you cant get an engine to go without coals mr johnson and i have had nothing but a light lunch  we could have something cooked for yousomething hot and a cup of tea  thank you but i fancy my dinner is actually on the table  i can do no good in the earlier stages  go home and say that i am coming and i will be round immediately afterwards  a sort of horror filled robert johnson as he gazed at this man who could think about his dinner at such a moment  he had not imagination enough to realise that the experience which seemed so appallingly important to him was the merest everyday matter of business to the medical man who could not have lived for a year had he not amid the rush of work remembered what was due to his own health  to johnson he seemed little better than a monster  his thoughts were bitter as he sped back to his shop  youve taken your time said his motherinlaw reproachfully looking down the stairs as he entered  i couldnt help it he gasped  is it over  over  shes got to be worse poor dear before she can be better wheres dr miles  hes coming after hes had dinner  the old woman was about to make some reply when from the halfopened door behind a high whinnying voice cried out for her  she ran back and closed the door while johnson sick at heart turned into the shop  there he sent the lad home and busied himself frantically in putting up shutters and turning out boxes  when all was closed and finished he seated himself in the parlour behind the shop  but he could not sit still  he rose incessantly to walk a few paces and then fell back into a chair once more  suddenly the clatter of china fell upon his ear and he saw the maid pass the door with a cup on a tray and a smoking teapot  who is that for jane he asked  for the mistress mr johnson  she says she would fancy it  there was immeasurable consolation to him in that homely cup of tea it wasnt so very bad after all if his wife could think of such things so lighthearted was he that he asked for a cup also  he had just finished it when the doctor arrived with a small black leather bag in his hand  well how is she he asked genially  oh shes very much better said johnson with enthusiasm  dear me thats bad said the doctor  perhaps it will do if i look in on my morning round  no no cried johnson clutching at his thick frieze overcoat  we are so glad that you have come  and doctor please come down soon and let me know what you think about it  the doctor passed upstairs his firm heavy steps resounding through the house  johnson could hear his boots creaking as he walked about the floor above him and the sound was a consolation to him  it was crisp and decided the tread of a man who had plenty of selfconfidence  presently still straining his ears to catch what was going on he heard the scraping of a chair as it was drawn along the floor and a moment later he heard the door fly open and someone come rushing downstairs  johnson sprang up with his hair bristling thinking that some dreadful thing had occurred but it was only his motherinlaw incoherent with excitement and searching for scissors and some tape  she vanished again and jane passed up the stairs with a pile of newly aired linen  then after an interval of silence johnson heard the heavy creaking tread and the doctor came down into the parlour  thats better said he pausing with his hand upon the door  you look pale mr johnson  oh no sir not at all he answered deprecatingly mopping his brow with his handkerchief  there is no immediate cause for alarm said dr miles  the case is not all that we could wish it  still we will hope for the best  is there danger sir gasped johnson  well there is always danger of course  it is not altogether a favourable case but still it might be much worse  i have given her a draught  i saw as i passed that they have been doing a little building opposite to you  its an improving quarter  the rents go higher and higher  you have a lease of your own little place eh  yes sir yes cried johnson whose ears were straining for every sound from above and who felt none the less that it was very soothing that the doctor should be able to chat so easily at such a time thats to say no sir i am a yearly tenant  ah i should get a lease if i were you  theres marshall the watchmaker down the street  i attended his wife twice and saw him through the typhoid when they took up the drains in prince street  i assure you his landlord sprung his rent nearly forty a year and he had to pay or clear out  did his wife get through it doctor  oh yes she did very well  hullo hullo  he slanted his ear to the ceiling with a questioning face and then darted swiftly from the room  it was march and the evenings were chill so jane had lit the fire but the wind drove the smoke downwards and the air was full of its acrid taint  johnson felt chilled to the bone though rather by his apprehensions than by the weather  he crouched over the fire with his thin white hands held out to the blaze  at ten oclock jane brought in the joint of cold meat and laid his place for supper but he could not bring himself to touch it  he drank a glass of the beer however and felt the better for it  the tension of his nerves seemed to have reacted upon his hearing and he was able to follow the most trivial things in the room above  once when the beer was still heartening him he nerved himself to creep on tiptoe up the stair and to listen to what was going on  the bedroom door was half an inch open and through the slit he could catch a glimpse of the cleanshaven face of the doctor looking wearier and more anxious than before  then he rushed downstairs like a lunatic and running to the door he tried to distract his thoughts by watching what was going on in the street  the shops were all shut and some rollicking boon companions came shouting along from the publichouse  he stayed at the door until the stragglers had thinned down and then came back to his seat by the fire  in his dim brain he was asking himself questions which had never intruded themselves before  where was the justice of it  what had his sweet innocent little wife done that she should be used so  why was nature so cruel  he was frightened at his own thoughts and yet wondered that they had never occurred to him before  as the early morning drew in johnson sick at heart and shivering in every limb sat with his great coat huddled round him staring at the grey ashes and waiting hopelessly for some relief  his face was white and clammy and his nerves had been numbed into a half conscious state by the long monotony of misery  but suddenly all his feelings leapt into keen life again as he heard the bedroom door open and the doctors steps upon the stair  robert johnson was precise and unemotional in everyday life but he almost shrieked now as he rushed forward to know if it were over  one glance at the stern drawn face which met him showed that it was no pleasant news which had sent the doctor downstairs  his appearance had altered as much as johnsons during the last few hours  his hair was on end his face flushed his forehead dotted with beads of perspiration  there was a peculiar fierceness in his eye and about the lines of his mouth a fighting look as befitted a man who for hours on end had been striving with the hungriest of foes for the most precious of prizes  but there was a sadness too as though his grim opponent had been overmastering him  he sat down and leaned his head upon his hand like a man who is fagged out  i thought it my duty to see you mr johnson and to tell you that it is a very nasty case  your wifes heart is not strong and she has some symptoms which i do not like  what i wanted to say is that if you would like to have a second opinion i shall be very glad to meet anyone whom you might suggest  johnson was so dazed by his want of sleep and the evil news that he could hardly grasp the doctors meaning  the other seeing him hesitate thought that he was considering the expense  smith or hawley would come for two guineas said he  but i think pritchard of the city road is the best man  oh yes bring the best man cried johnson  pritchard would want three guineas  he is a senior man you see  id give him all i have if he would pull her through  shall i run for him  yes  go to my house first and ask for the green baize bag  the assistant will give it to you  tell him i want the a c e mixture her heart is too weak for chloroform  then go for pritchard and bring him back with you  it was heavenly for johnson to have something to do and to feel that he was of some use to his wife  he ran swiftly to bridport place his footfalls clattering through the silent streets and the big dark policemen turning their yellow funnels of light on him as he passed two tugs at the nightbell brought down a sleepy halfclad assistant who handed him a stoppered glass bottle and a cloth bag which contained something which clinked when you moved it  johnson thrust the bottle into his pocket seized the green bag and pressing his hat firmly down ran as hard as he could set foot to ground until he was in the city road and saw the name of pritchard engraved in white upon a red ground he bounded in triumph up the three steps which led to the door and as he did so there was a crash behind him  his precious bottle was in fragments upon the pavement  for a moment he felt as if it were his wifes body that was lying there  but the run had freshened his wits and he saw that the mischief might be repaired  he pulled vigorously at the nightbell  well whats the matter asked a gruff voice at his elbow  he started back and looked up at the windows but there was no sign of life  he was approaching the bell again with the intention of pulling it when a perfect roar burst from the wall  i cant stand shivering here all night cried the voice  say who you are and what you want or i shut the tube  then for the first time johnson saw that the end of a speakingtube hung out of the wall just above the bell  he shouted up it  i want you to come with me to meet dr miles at a confinement at once  how far shrieked the irascible voice  the new north road hoxton  my consultation fee is three guineas payable at the time  all right shouted johnson  you are to bring a bottle of a c e mixture with you  all right  wait a bit  five minutes later an elderly hardfaced man with grizzled hair flung open the door  as he emerged a voice from somewhere in the shadows cried  mind you take your cravat john and he impatiently growled something over his shoulder in reply  the consultant was a man who had been hardened by a life of ceaseless labour and who had been driven as so many others have been by the needs of his own increasing family to set the commercial before the philanthropic side of his profession  yet beneath his rough crust he was a man with a kindly heart  we dont want to break a record said he pulling up and panting after attempting to keep up with johnson for five minutes  i would go quicker if i could my dear sir and i quite sympathise with your anxiety but really i cant manage it  so johnson on fire with impatience had to slow down until they reached the new north road when he ran ahead and had the door open for the doctor when he came  he heard the two meet outside the bedroom and caught scraps of their conversation  sorry to knock you upnasty casedecent people  then it sank into a mumble and the door closed behind them  johnson sat up in his chair now listening keenly for he knew that a crisis must be at hand  he heard the two doctors moving about and was able to distinguish the step of pritchard which had a drag in it from the clean crisp sound of the others footfall  there was silence for a few minutes and then a curious drunken mumbling singsong voice came quavering up very unlike anything which he had heard hitherto  at the same time a sweetish insidious scent imperceptible perhaps to any nerves less strained than his crept down the stairs and penetrated into the room  the voice dwindled into a mere drone and finally sank away into silence and johnson gave a long sigh of relief for he knew that the drug had done its work and that come what might there should be no more pain for the sufferer  but soon the silence became even more trying to him than the cries had been  he had no clue now as to what was going on and his mind swarmed with horrible possibilities  he rose and went to the bottom of the stairs again  he heard the clink of metal against metal and the subdued murmur of the doctors voices  then he heard mrs peyton say something in a tone as of fear or expostulation and again the doctors murmured together  for twenty minutes he stood there leaning against the wall listening to the occasional rumbles of talk without being able to catch a word of it  and then of a sudden there rose out of the silence the strangest little piping cry and mrs peyton screamed out in her delight and the man ran into the parlour and flung himself down upon the horsehair sofa drumming his heels on it in his ecstasy  but often the great cat fate lets us go only to clutch us again in a fiercer grip  as minute after minute passed and still no sound came from above save those thin glutinous cries johnson cooled from his frenzy of joy and lay breathless with his ears straining  they were moving slowly about  they were talking in subdued tones  still minute after minute passing and no word from the voice for which he listened his nerves were dulled by his night of trouble and he waited in limp wretchedness upon his sofa  there he still sat when the doctors came down to hima bedraggled miserable figure with his face grimy and his hair unkempt from his long vigil  he rose as they entered bracing himself against the mantelpiece  is she dead he asked  doing well answered the doctor  and at the words that little conventional spirit which had never known until that night the capacity for fierce agony which lay within it learned for the second time that there were springs of joy also which it had never tapped before  his impulse was to fall upon his knees but he was shy before the doctors  can i go up  in a few minutes  im sure doctor im veryim very he grew inarticulate  here are your three guineas dr pritchard  i wish they were three hundred  so do i said the senior man and they laughed as they shook hands  johnson opened the shop door for them and heard their talk as they stood for an instant outside  looked nasty at one time  very glad to have your help  delighted im sure  wont you step round and have a cup of coffee  no thanks  im expecting another case  the firm step and the dragging one passed away to the right and the left  johnson turned from the door still with that turmoil of joy in his heart  he seemed to be making a new start in life  he felt that he was a stronger and a deeper man  perhaps all this suffering had an object then  it might prove to be a blessing both to his wife and to him  the very thought was one which he would have been incapable of conceiving twelve hours before  he was full of new emotions  if there had been a harrowing there had been a planting too  can i come up he cried and then without waiting for an answer he took the steps three at a time  mrs peyton was standing by a soapy bath with a bundle in her hands from under the curve of a brown shawl there looked out at him the strangest little red face with crumpled features moist loose lips and eyelids which quivered like a rabbits nostrils  the weak neck had let the head topple over and it rested upon the shoulder  kiss it robert cried the grandmother kiss your son  but he felt a resentment to the little red blinking creature  he could not forgive it yet for that long night of misery  he caught sight of a white face in the bed and he ran towards it with such love and pity as his speech could find no words for  thank god it is over  lucy dear it was dreadful  but im so happy now  i never was so happy in my life  her eyes were fixed upon the brown bundle  you mustnt talk said mrs peyton  but dont leave me  whispered his wife  so he sat in silence with his hand in hers  the lamp was burning dim and the first cold light of dawn was breaking through the window  the night had been long and dark but the day was the sweeter and the purer in consequence  london was waking up  the roar began to rise from the street  lives had come and lives had gone but the great machine was still working out its dim and tragic destiny     sweethearts  it is hard for the general practitioner who sits among his patients both morning and evening and sees them in their homes between to steal time for one little daily breath of cleanly air  to win it he must slip early from his bed and walk out between shuttered shops when it is chill but very clear and all things are sharply outlined as in a frost  it is an hour that has a charm of its own when but for a postman or a milkman one has the pavement to oneself and even the most common thing takes an everrecurring freshness as though causeway and lamp and signboard had all wakened to the new day  then even an inland city may seem beautiful and bear virtue in its smoketainted air  but it was by the sea that i lived in a town that was unlovely enough were it not for its glorious neighbour  and who cares for the town when one can sit on the bench at the headland and look out over the huge blue bay and the yellow scimitar that curves before it  i loved it when its great face was freckled with the fishing boats and i loved it when the big ships went past far out a little hillock of white and no hull with topsails curved like a bodice so stately and demure but most of all i loved it when no trace of man marred the majesty of nature and when the sunbursts slanted down on it from between the drifting rainclouds  then i have seen the further edge draped in the gauze of the driving rain with its thin grey shading under the slow clouds while my headland was golden and the sun gleamed upon the breakers and struck deep through the green waves beyond showing up the purple patches where the beds of seaweed are lying  such a morning as that with the wind in his hair and the spray on his lips and the cry of the eddying gulls in his ear may send a man back braced afresh to the reek of a sickroom and the dead drab weariness of practice  it was on such another day that i first saw my old man  he came to my bench just as i was leaving it  my eye must have picked him out even in a crowded street for he was a man of large frame and fine presence with something of distinction in the set of his lip and the poise of his head  he limped up the winding path leaning heavily upon his stick as though those great shoulders had become too much at last for the failing limbs that bore them  as he approached my eyes caught natures danger signal that faint bluish tinge in nose and lip which tells of a labouring heart  the brae is a little trying sir said i  speaking  as a physician i should say that you would do well to rest here before you go further  he inclined his head in a stately oldworld fashion and seated himself upon the bench  seeing that he had no wish to speak i was silent also but i could not help watching him out of the corners of my eyes for he was such a wonderful survival of the early half of the century with his lowcrowned curlybrimmed hat his black satin tie which fastened with a buckle at the back and above all his large fleshy cleanshaven face shot with its mesh of wrinkles  those eyes ere they had grown dim had looked out from the boxseat of mail coaches and had seen the knots of navvies as they toiled on the brown embankments  those lips had smiled over the first numbers of pickwick and had gossiped of the promising young man who wrote them the face itself was a seventyyear almanack and every seam an entry upon it where public as well as private sorrow left its trace  that pucker on the forehead stood for the mutiny perhaps that line of care for the crimean winter it may be and that last little sheaf of wrinkles as my fancy hoped for the death of gordon  and so as i dreamed in my foolish way the old gentleman with the shining stock was gone and it was seventy years of a great nations life that took shape before me on the headland in the morning  but he soon brought me back to earth again  as he recovered his breath he took a letter out of his pocket and putting on a pair of hornrimmed eyeglasses he read it through very carefully  without any design of playing the spy i could not help observing that it was in a womans hand  when he had finished it he read it again and then sat with the corners of his mouth drawn down and his eyes staring vacantly out over the bay the most forlornlooking old gentleman that ever i have seen  all that is kindly within me was set stirring by that wistful face but i knew that he was in no humour for talk and so at last with my breakfast and my patients calling me i left him on the bench and started for home  i never gave him another thought until the next morning when at the same hour he turned up upon the headland and shared the bench which i had been accustomed to look upon as my own  he bowed again before sitting down but was no more inclined than formerly to enter into conversation  there had been a change in him during the last twentyfour hours and all for the worse  the face seemed more heavy and more wrinkled while that ominous venous tinge was more pronounced as he panted up the hill  the clean lines of his cheek and chin were marred by a days growth of grey stubble and his large shapely head had lost something of the brave carriage which had struck me when first i glanced at him  he had a letter there the same or another but still in a womans hand and over this he was moping and mumbling in his senile fashion with his brow puckered and the corners of his mouth drawn down like those of a fretting child  so i left him with a vague wonder as to who he might be and why a single spring day should have wrought such a change upon him  so interested was i that next morning i was on the look out for him sure enough at the same hour i saw him coming up the hill but very slowly with a bent back and a heavy head  it was shocking to me to see the change in him as he approached  i am afraid that our air does not agree with you sir i ventured to remark  but it was as though he had no heart for talk  he tried as i thought to make some fitting reply but it slurred off into a mumble and silence  how bent and weak and old he seemedten years older at the least than when first i had seen him  it went to my heart to see this fine old fellow wasting away before my eyes  there was the eternal letter which he unfolded with his shaking fingers  who was this woman whose words moved him so  some daughter perhaps or granddaughter who should have been the light of his home instead of  i smiled to find how bitter i was growing and how swiftly i was weaving a romance round an unshaven old man and his correspondence  yet all day he lingered in my mind and i had fitful glimpses of those two trembling blueveined knuckly hands with the paper rustling between them  i had hardly hoped to see him again  another days decline must i thought hold him to his room if not to his bed  great then was my surprise when as i approached my bench i saw that he was already there  but as i came up to him i could scarce be sure that it was indeed the same man  there were the curlybrimmed hat and the shining stock and the horn glasses but where were the stoop and the greystubbled pitiable face  he was cleanshaven and firm lipped with a bright eye and a head that poised itself upon his great shoulders like an eagle on a rock  his back was as straight and square as a grenadiers and he switched at the pebbles with his stick in his exuberant vitality  in the buttonhole of his wellbrushed black coat there glinted a golden blossom and the corner of a dainty red silk handkerchief lapped over from his breast pocket  he might have been the eldest son of the weary creature who had sat there the morning before  good morning sir good morning he cried with a merry waggle of his cane  good morning i answered how beautiful the bay is looking  yes sir but you should have seen it just before the sun rose  what have you been here since then  i was here when there was scarce light to see the path  you are a very early riser  on occasion sir on occasion  he cocked his eye at me as if to gauge whether i were worthy of his confidence  the fact is sir that my wife is coming back to me to day  i suppose that my face showed that i did not quite see the force of the explanation  my eyes too may have given him assurance of sympathy for he moved quite close to me and began speaking in a low confidential voice as if the matter were of such weight that even the seagulls must be kept out of our councils  are you a married man sir  no i am not  ah then you cannot quite understand it  my wife and i have been married for nearly fifty years and we have never been parted never at all until now  was it for long i asked  yes sir  this is the fourth day  she had to go to scotland  a matter of duty you understand and the doctors would not let me go not that i would have allowed them to stop me but she was on their side  now thank god it is over and she may be here at any moment  here  yes here  this headland and bench were old friends of ours thirty years ago  the people with whom we stay are not to tell the truth very congenial and we have little privacy among them  that is why we prefer to meet here  i could not be sure which train would bring her but if she had come by the very earliest she would have found me waiting  in that case said i rising  no sir no he entreated i beg that you will stay  it does not weary you this domestic talk of mine  on the contrary  i have been so driven inwards during these few last days ah what a nightmare it has been perhaps it may seem strange to you that an old fellow like me should feel like this  it is charming  no credit to me sir  theres not a man on this planet but would feel the same if he had the good fortune to be married to such a woman perhaps because you see me like this and hear me speak of our long life together you conceive that she is old too  he laughed heartily and his eyes twinkled at the humour of the idea  shes one of those women you know who have youth in their hearts and so it can never be very far from their faces  to me shes just as she was when she first took my hand in hers in 45  a wee little bit stouter perhaps but then if she had a fault as a girl it was that she was a shade too slender  she was above me in station you knowi a clerk and she the daughter of my employer  oh it was quite a romance i give you my word and i won her and somehow i have never got over the freshness and the wonder of it  to think that that sweet lovely girl has walked by my side all through life and that i have been able  he stopped suddenly and i glanced round at him in surprise  he was shaking all over in every fibre of his great body  his hands were clawing at the woodwork and his feet shuffling on the gravel  i saw what it was  he was trying to rise but was so excited that he could not  i half extended my hand but a higher courtesy constrained me to draw it back again and turn my face to the sea  an instant afterwards he was up and hurrying down the path  a woman was coming towards us  she was quite close before he had seen herthirty yards at the utmost  i know not if she had ever been as he described her or whether it was but some ideal which he carried in his brain  the person upon whom i looked was tall it is true but she was thick and shapeless with a ruddy fullblown face  and a skirt grotesquely gathered up  there was a green ribbon in her hat which jarred upon my eyes and her blouselike bodice was full and clumsy and this was the lovely girl the ever youthful  my heart sank as i thought how little such a woman might appreciate him how unworthy she might be of his love  she came up the path in her solid way while he staggered along to meet her  then as they came together looking discreetly out of the furthest corner of my eye i saw that he put out both his hands while she shrinking from a public caress took one of them in hers and shook it  as she did so i saw her face and i was easy in my mind for my old man  god grant that when this hand is shaking and when this back is bowed a womans eyes may look so into mine     a physiologists wife  professor ainslie grey had not come down to breakfast at the usual hour  the presentation chimingclock which stood between the terracotta busts of claude bernard and of john hunter upon the diningroom mantelpiece had rung out the halfhour and the threequarters  now its golden hand was verging upon the nine and yet there were no signs of the master of the house  it was an unprecedented occurrence  during the twelve years that she had kept house for him his youngest sister had never known him a second behind his time  she sat now in front of the high silver coffeepot uncertain whether to order the gong to be resounded or to wait on in silence  either course might be a mistake  her brother was not a man who permitted mistakes  miss ainslie grey was rather above the middle height thin with peering puckered eyes and the rounded shoulders which mark the bookish woman  her face was long and spare flecked with colour above the cheekbones with a reasonable thoughtful forehead and a dash of absolute obstinacy in her thin lips and prominent chin  snow white cuffs and collar with a plain dark dress cut with almost quakerlike simplicity bespoke the primness of her taste  an ebony cross hung over her flattened chest  she sat very upright in her chair listening with raised eyebrows and swinging her eyeglasses backwards and forwards with a nervous gesture which was peculiar to her  suddenly she gave a sharp satisfied jerk of the head and began to pour out the coffee  from outside there came the dull thudding sound of heavy feet upon thick carpet  the door swung open and the professor entered with a quick nervous step  he nodded to his sister and seating himself at the other side of the table began to open the small pile of letters which lay beside his plate  professor ainslie grey was at that time fortythree years of agenearly twelve years older than his sister  his career had been a brilliant one  at edinburgh at cambridge and at vienna he had laid the foundations of his great reputation both in physiology and in zoology  his pamphlet on the mesoblastic origin of excitomotor nerve roots had won him his fellowship of the royal society and his researches upon the nature of bathybius with some remarks upon lithococci had been translated into at least three european languages  he had been referred to by one of the greatest living authorities as being the very type and embodiment of all that was best in modern science  no wonder then that when the commercial city of birchespool decided to create a medical school they were only too glad to confer the chair of physiology upon mr ainslie grey  they valued him the more from the conviction that their class was only one step in his upward journey and that the first vacancy would remove him to some more illustrious seat of learning  in person he was not unlike his sister  the same eyes the same contour the same intellectual forehead  his lips however were firmer and his long thin lower jaw was sharper and more decided  he ran his finger and thumb down it from time to time as he glanced over his letters  those maids are very noisy he remarked as a clack of tongues sounded in the distance  it is sarah said his sister i shall speak about it  she had handed over his coffeecup and was sipping at her own glancing furtively through her narrowed lids at the austere face of her brother  the first great advance of the human race said the professor was when by the development of their left frontal convolutions they attained the power of speech  their second advance was when they learned to control that power  woman has not yet attained the second stage  he half closed his eyes as he spoke and thrust his chin forward but as he ceased he had a trick of suddenly opening both eyes very wide and staring sternly at his interlocutor  i am not garrulous john said his sister  no ada in many respects you approach the superior or male type  the professor bowed over his egg with the manner of one who utters a courtly compliment but the lady pouted and gave an impatient little shrug of her shoulders  you were late this morning john she remarked after a pause  yes ada i slept badly  some little cerebral congestion no doubt due to overstimulation of the centers of thought  i have been a little disturbed in my mind  his sister stared across at him in astonishment  the professors mental processes had hitherto been as regular as his habits  twelve years continual intercourse had taught her that he lived in a serene and rarefied atmosphere of scientific calm high above the petty emotions which affect humbler minds  you are surprised ada he remarked  well i cannot wonder at it i should have been surprised myself if i had been told that i was so sensitive to vascular influences  for after all all disturbances are vascular if you probe them deep enough  i am thinking of getting married  not mrs ojames cried ada grey laying down her eggspoon  my dear you have the feminine quality of receptivity very remarkably developed  mrs ojames is the lady in question  but you know so little of her  the esdailes themselves know so little  she is really only an acquaintance although she is staying at the lindens  would it not be wise to speak to mrs esdaile first john  i do not think ada that mrs esdaile is at all likely to say anything which would materially affect my course of action  i have given the matter due consideration  the scientific mind is slow at arriving at conclusions but having once formed them it is not prone to change  matrimony is the natural condition of the human race  i have as you know been so engaged in academical and other work that i have had no time to devote to merely personal questions  it is different now and i see no valid reason why i should forego this opportunity of seeking a suitable helpmate  and you are engaged  hardly that ada  i ventured yesterday to indicate to the lady that i was prepared to submit to the common lot of humanity  i shall wait upon her after my morning lecture and learn how far my proposals meet with her acquiescence  but you frown ada  his sister started and made an effort to conceal her expression of annoyance  she even stammered out some few words of congratulation but a vacant look had come into her brothers eyes and he was evidently not listening to her  i am sure john that i wish you the happiness which you deserve  if i hesitated at all it is because i know how much is at stake and because the thing is so sudden so unexpected  her thin white hand stole up to the black cross upon her bosom  these are moments when we need guidance john  if i could persuade you to turn to spiritual  the professor waved the suggestion away with a deprecating hand  it is useless to reopen that question he said  we cannot argue upon it  you assume more than i can grant  i am forced to dispute your premises  we have no common basis  his sister sighed  you have no faith she said  i have faith in those great evolutionary forces which are leading the human race to some unknown but elevated goal  you believe in nothing  on the contrary my dear ada i believe in the differentiation of protoplasm  she shook her head sadly  it was the one subject upon which she ventured to dispute her brothers infallibility  this is rather beside the question remarked the professor folding up his napkin  if i am not mistaken there is some possibility of another matrimonial event occurring in the family  eh ada  what  his small eyes glittered with sly facetiousness as he shot a twinkle at his sister  she sat very stiff and traced patterns upon the cloth with the sugartongs  dr james mmurdo obrien said the professor sonorously  dont john dont cried miss ainslie grey  dr james mmurdo obrien continued her brother inexorably is a man who has already made his mark upon the science of the day  he is my first and my most distinguished pupil  i assure you ada that his remarks upon the bilepigments with special reference to urobilin is likely to live as a classic  it is not too much to say that he has revolutionised our views about urobilin  he paused but his sister sat silent with bent head and flushed cheeks  the little ebony cross rose and fell with her hurried breathings  dr james mmurdo obrien has as you know the offer of the physiological chair at melbourne  he has been in australia five years and has a brilliant future before him  today he leaves us for edinburgh and in two months time he goes out to take over his new duties  you know his feeling towards you  it rests with you as to whether he goes out alone  speaking for myself i cannot imagine any higher mission for a woman of culture than to go through life in the company of a man who is capable of such a research as that which dr james mmurdo obrien has brought to a successful conclusion  he has not spoken to me murmured the lady  ah there are signs which are more subtle than speech said her brother wagging his head  but you are pale  your vasomotor system is excited  your arterioles have contracted  let me entreat you to compose yourself  i think i hear the carriage  i fancy that you may have a visitor this morning ada  you will excuse me now  with a quick glance at the clock he strode off into the hall and within a few minutes he was rattling in his quiet wellappointed brougham through the bricklined streets of birchespool  his lecture over professor ainslie grey paid a visit to his laboratory where he adjusted several scientific instruments made a note as to the progress of three separate infusions of bacteria cut halfadozen sections with a microtome and finally resolved the difficulties of seven different gentlemen who were pursuing researches in as many separate lines of inquiry  having thus conscientiously and methodically completed the routine of his duties he returned to his carriage and ordered the coachman to drive him to the lindens  his face as he drove was cold and impassive but he drew his fingers from time to time down his prominent chin with a jerky twitchy movement  the lindens was an oldfashioned ivyclad house which had once been in the country but was now caught in the long redbrick feelers of the growing city  it still stood back from the road in the privacy of its own grounds  a winding path lined with laurel bushes led to the arched and porticoed entrance  to the right was a lawn and at the far side under the shadow of a hawthorn a lady sat in a gardenchair with a book in her hands  at the click of the gate she started and the professor catching sight of her turned away from the door and strode in her direction  what wont you go in and see mrs esdaile she asked sweeping out from under the shadow of the hawthorn  she was a small woman strongly feminine from the rich coils of her lightcoloured hair to the dainty garden slipper which peeped from under her creamtinted dress  one tiny wellgloved hand was outstretched in greeting while the other pressed a thick greencovered volume against her side  her decision and quick tactful manner bespoke the mature woman of the world but her upraised face had preserved a girlish and even infantile expression of innocence in its large fearless grey eyes and sensitive humorous mouth  mrs ojames was a widow and she was twoandthirty years of age but neither fact could have been deduced from her appearance  you will surely go in and see mrs esdaile she repeated glancing up at him with eyes which had in them something between a challenge and a caress  i did not come to see mrs esdaile he answered with no relaxation of his cold and grave manner i came to see you  i am sure i should be highly honoured she said with just the slightest little touch of brogue in her accent  what are the students to do without their professor  i have already completed my academic duties  take my arm and we shall walk in the sunshine  surely we cannot wonder that eastern people should have made a deity of the sun  it is the great beneficent force of naturemans ally against cold sterility and all that is abhorrent to him  what were you reading  hales matter and life  the professor raised his thick eyebrows  hale he said and then again in a kind of whisper hale  you differ from him she asked  it is not i who differ from him  i am only a monada thing of no moment  the whole tendency of the highest plane of modern thought differs from him  he defends the indefensible  he is an excellent observer but a feeble reasoner  i should not recommend you to found your conclusions upon hale  i must read natures chronicle to counteract his pernicious influence said mrs ojames with a soft cooing laugh  natures chronicle was one of the many books in which professor ainslie grey had enforced the negative doctrines of scientific agnosticism  it is a faulty work said he i cannot recommend it  i would rather refer you to the standard writings of some of my older and more eloquent colleagues  there was a pause in their talk as they paced up and down on the green velvetlike lawn in the genial sunshine  have you thought at all he asked at last of the matter upon which i spoke to you last night  she said nothing but walked by his side with her eyes averted and her face aslant  i would not hurry you unduly he continued  i know that it is a matter which can scarcely be decided offhand  in my own case it cost me some thought before i ventured to make the suggestion  i am not an emotional man but i am conscious in your presence of the great evolutionary instinct which makes either sex the complement of the other  you believe in love then she asked with a twinkling upward glance  i am forced to  and yet you can deny the soul  how far these questions are psychic and how far material is still sub judice said the professor with an air of toleration  protoplasm may prove to be the physical basis of love as well as of life  how inflexible you are she exclaimed you would draw love down to the level of physics  or draw physics up to the level of love  come that is much better she cried with her sympathetic laugh that is really very pretty and puts science in quite a delightful light  her eyes sparkled and she tossed her chin with the pretty wilful air of a woman who is mistress of the situation  i have reason to believe said the professor that my position here will prove to be only a steppingstone to some wider scene of scientific activity  yet even here my chair brings me in some fifteen hundred pounds a year which is supplemented by a few hundreds from my books  i should therefore be in a position to provide you with those comforts to which you are accustomed  so much for my pecuniary position  as to my constitution it has always been sound  i have never suffered from any illness in my life save fleeting attacks of cephalalgia the result of too prolonged a stimulation of the centres of cerebration  my father and mother had no sign of any morbid diathesis but i will not conceal from you that my grandfather was afflicted with podagra  mrs ojames looked startled  is that very serious she asked  it is gout said the professor  oh is that all  it sounded much worse than that  it is a grave taint but i trust that i shall not be a victim to atavism  i have laid these facts before you because they are factors which cannot be overlooked in forming your decision  may i ask now whether you see your way to accepting my proposal  he paused in his walk and looked earnestly and expectantly down at her  a struggle was evidently going on in her mind  her eyes were cast down her little slipper tapped the lawn and her fingers played nervously with her chatelain  suddenly with a sharp quick gesture which had in it something of abandon and recklessness she held out her hand to her companion  i accept she said  they were standing under the shadow of the hawthorn  he stooped gravely down and kissed her glovecovered fingers  i trust that you may never have cause to regret your decision he said  i trust that you never may she cried with a heaving breast  there were tears in her eyes and her lips twitched with some strong emotion  come into the sunshine again said he  it is the great restorative your nerves are shaken  some little congestion of the medulla and pons  it is always instructive to reduce psychic or emotional conditions to their physical equivalents  you feel that your anchor is still firm in a bottom of ascertained fact  but it is so dreadfully unromantic said mrs ojames with her old twinkle  romance is the offspring of imagination and of ignorance  where science throws her calm clear light there is happily no room for romance  but is not love romance she asked  not at all  love has been taken away from the poets and has been brought within the domain of true science  it may prove to be one of the great cosmic elementary forces  when the atom of hydrogen draws the atom of chlorine towards it to form the perfected molecule of hydrochloric acid the force which it exerts may be intrinsically similar to that which draws me to you  attraction and repulsion appear to be the primary forces  this is attraction  and here is repulsion said mrs ojames as a stout florid lady came sweeping across the lawn in their direction  so glad you have come out mrs esdaile  here is professor grey  how do you do professor said the lady with some little pomposity of manner  you were very wise to stay out here on so lovely a day is it not heavenly  it is certainly very fine weather the professor answered  listen to the wind sighing in the trees cried mrs esdaile holding up one finger  it is natures lullaby  could you not imagine it professor grey to be the whisperings of angels  the idea had not occurred to me madam  ah professor i have always the same complaint against you  a want of rapport with the deeper meanings of nature  shall i say a want of imagination  you do not feel an emotional thrill at the singing of that thrush  i confess that i am not conscious of one mrs esdaile  or at the delicate tint of that background of leaves  see the rich greens  chlorophyll murmured the professor  science is so hopelessly prosaic  it dissects and labels and loses sight of the great things in its attention to the little ones  you have a poor opinion of womans intellect professor grey  i think that i have heard you say so  it is a question of avoirdupois said the professor closing his eyes and shrugging his shoulders  the female cerebrum averages two ounces less in weight than the male  no doubt there are exceptions  nature is always elastic  but the heaviest thing is not always the strongest said mrs ojames laughing  isnt there a law of compensation in science  may we not hope to make up in quality for what we lack in quantity  i think not remarked the professor gravely  but there is your luncheongong  no thank you mrs esdaile i cannot stay  my carriage is waiting  goodbye  goodbye mrs ojames  he raised his hat and stalked slowly away among the laurel bushes  he has no taste said mrs esdaileno eye for beauty  on the contrary mrs ojames answered with a saucy little jerk of the chin  he has just asked me to be his wife   as professor ainslie grey ascended the steps of his house the halldoor opened and a dapper gentleman stepped briskly out  he was somewhat sallow in the face with dark beady eyes and a short black beard with an aggressive bristle  thought and work had left their traces upon his face but he moved with the brisk activity of a man who had not yet bade goodbye to his youth  im in lucks way he cried  i wanted to see you  then come back into the library said the professor you must stay and have lunch with us  the two men entered the hall and the professor led the way into his private sanctum  he motioned his companion into an armchair  i trust that you have been successful obrien said he  i should be loath to exercise any undue pressure upon my sister ada but i have given her to understand that there is no one whom i should prefer for a brotherinlaw to my most brilliant scholar the author of some remarks upon the bilepigments with special reference to urobilin  you are very kind professor greyyou have always been very kind said the other  i approached miss grey upon the subject she did not say no  she said yes then  no she proposed to leave the matter open until my return from edinburgh  i go today as you know and i hope to commence my research tomorrow  on the comparative anatomy of the vermiform appendix by james mmurdo obrien said the professor sonorously  it is a glorious subjecta subject which lies at the very root of evolutionary philosophy  ah she is the dearest girl cried obrien with a sudden little spurt of celtic enthusiasmshe is the soul of truth and of honour  the vermiform appendix began the professor  she is an angel from heaven interrupted the other  i fear that it is my advocacy of scientific freedom in religious thought which stands in my way with her  you must not truckle upon that point  you must be true to your convictions let there be no compromise there  my reason is true to agnosticism and yet i am conscious of a voida vacuum  i had feelings at the old church at home between the scent of the incense and the roll of the organ such as i have never experienced in the laboratory or the lectureroom  sensuouspurely sensuous said the professor rubbing his chin vague hereditary tendencies stirred into life by the stimulation of the nasal and auditory nerves  maybe so maybe so the younger man answered thoughtfully  but this was not what i wished to speak to you about  before i enter your family your sister and you have a claim to know all that i can tell you about my career  of my worldly prospects i have already spoken to you  there is only one point which i have omitted to mention  i am a widower  the professor raised his eyebrows  this is news indeed said he  i married shortly after my arrival in australia  miss thurston was her name  i met her in society  it was a most unhappy match  some painful emotion possessed him  his quick expressive features quivered and his white hands tightened upon the arms of the chair the professor turned away towards the window  you are the best judge he remarked but i should not think that it was necessary to go into details  you have a right to know everythingyou and miss grey  it is not a matter on which i can well speak to her direct  poor jinny was the best of women but she was open to flattery and liable to be misled by designing persons  she was untrue to me grey  it is a hard thing to say of the dead but she was untrue to me  she fled to auckland with a man whom she had known before her marriage  the brig which carried them foundered and not a soul was saved  this is very painful obrien said the professor with a deprecatory motion of his hand  i cannot see however how it affects your relation to my sister  i have eased my conscience said obrien rising from his chair i have told you all that there is to tell  i should not like the story to reach you through any lips but my own  you are right obrien  your action has been most honourable and considerate  but you are not to blame in the matter save that perhaps you showed a little precipitancy in choosing a lifepartner without due care and inquiry  obrien drew his hand across his eyes  poor girl he cried  god help me i love her still  but i must go  you will lunch with us  no professor i have my packing still to do  i have already bade miss grey adieu  in two months i shall see you again  you will probably find me a married man  married  yes i have been thinking of it  my dear professor let me congratulate you with all my heart  i had no idea  who is the lady  mrs ojames is her namea widow of the same nationality as yourself but to return to matters of importance i should be very happy to see the proofs of your paper upon the vermiform appendix  i may be able to furnish you with material for a footnote or two  your assistance will be invaluable to me said obrien with enthusiasm and the two men parted in the hall  the professor walked back into the diningroom where his sister was already seated at the luncheontable  i shall be married at the registrars he remarked i should strongly recommend you to do the same  professor ainslie grey was as good as his word  a fortnights cessation of his classes gave him an opportunity which was too good to let pass  mrs ojames was an orphan without relations and almost without friends in the country  there was no obstacle in the way of a speedy wedding  they were married accordingly in the quietest manner possible and went off to cambridge together where the professor and his charming wife were present at several academic observances and varied the routine of their honeymoon by incursions into biological laboratories and medical libraries  scientific friends were loud in their congratulations not only upon mrs greys beauty but upon the unusual quickness and intelligence which she displayed in discussing physiological questions  the professor was himself astonished at the accuracy of her information  you have a remarkable range of knowledge for a woman jeannette he remarked upon more than one occasion  he was even prepared to admit that her cerebrum might be of the normal weight  one foggy drizzling morning they returned to birchespool for the next day would reopen the session and professor ainslie grey prided himself upon having never once in his life failed to appear in his lectureroom at the very stroke of the hour  miss ada grey welcomed them with a constrained cordiality and handed over the keys of office to the new mistress  mrs grey pressed her warmly to remain but she explained that she had already accepted an invitation which would engage her for some months  the same evening she departed for the south of england  a couple of days later the maid carried a card just after breakfast into the library where the professor sat revising his morning lecture it announced the rearrival of dr james mmurdo obrien  their meeting was effusively genial on the part of the younger man and coldly precise on that of his former teacher  you see there have been changes said the professor  so i heard  miss grey told me in her letters and i read the notice in the british medical journal  so its really married you are  how quickly and quietly you have managed it all  i am constitutionally averse to anything in the nature of show or ceremony  my wife is a sensible womani may even go the length of saying that for a woman she is abnormally sensible  she quite agreed with me in the course which i have adopted  and your research on vallisneria  this matrimonial incident has  interrupted  it but i have resumed my classes and we shall soon be quite in harness again  i must see miss grey before i leave england  we have corresponded and i think that all will be well  she must come out with me  i dont think i could go without her  the professor shook his head  your nature is not so weak as you pretend he said  questions of this sort are after all quite subordinate to the great duties of life  obrien smiled  you would have me take out my celtic soul and put in a saxon one he said  either my brain is too small or my heart is too big  but when may i call and pay my respects to mrs grey  will she be at home this afternoon  she is at home now  come into the morningroom  she will be glad to make your acquaintance  they walked across the linoleumpaved hall  the professor opened the door of the room and walked in followed by his friend  mrs grey was sitting in a basketchair by the window light and fairylike in a looseflowing pink morninggown  seeing a visitor she rose and swept towards them  the professor heard a dull thud behind him  obrien had fallen back into a chair with his hand pressed tight to his side  jinny he gaspedjinny  mrs grey stopped dead in her advance and stared at him with a face from which every expression had been struck out save one of astonishment and horror  then with a sharp intaking of the breath she reeled and would have fallen had the professor not thrown his long nervous arm round her  try this sofa said he  she sank back among the cushions with the same white cold dead look upon her face  the professor stood with his back to the empty fireplace and glanced from the one to the other  so obrien he said at last you have already made the acquaintance of my wife  your wife cried his friend hoarsely  she is no wife of yours  god help me she is my wife  the professor stood rigidly upon the hearthrug  his long thin fingers were intertwined and his head sunk a little forward  his two companions had eyes only for each other  jinny said he  james  how could you leave me so jinny  how could you have the heart to do it  i thought you were dead  i mourned for your deathay and you have made me mourn for you living  you have withered my life  she made no answer but lay back among her cushions with her eyes still fixed upon him  why do you not speak  because you are right james  i have treated you cruellyshamefully but it is not as bad as you think  you fled with de horta  no i did not  at the last moment my better nature prevailed  he went alone  but i was ashamed to come back after what i had written to you  i could not face you  i took passage alone to england under a new name and here i have lived ever since  it seemed to me that i was beginning life again  i knew that you thought i was drowned  who could have dreamed that fate would throw us together again  when the professor asked me  she stopped and gave a gasp for breath  you are faint  said the professorkeep the head low it aids the cerebral circulation  he flattened down the cushion  i am sorry to leave you obrien but i have my class duties to look to  possibly i may find you here when i return  with a grim and rigid face he strode out of the room  not one of the three hundred students who listened to his lecture saw any change in his manner and appearance or could have guessed that the austere gentleman in front of them had found out at last how hard it is to rise above ones humanity  the lecture over he performed his routine duties in the laboratory and then drove back to his own house  he did not enter by the front door but passed through the garden to the folding glass casement which led out of the morningroom  as he approached he heard his wifes voice and obriens in loud and animated talk  he paused among the rosebushes uncertain whether to interrupt them or no  nothing was further from his nature than play the eavesdropper but as he stood still hesitating words fell upon his ear which struck him rigid and motionless  you are still my wife jinny said obrien i forgive you from the bottom of my heart  i love you and i have never ceased to love you though you had forgotten me  no james my heart was always in melbourne  i have always been yours  i thought that it was better for you that i should seem to be dead  you must choose between us now jinny  if you determine to remain here i shall not open my lips  there shall be no scandal  if on the other hand you come with me its little i care about the worlds opinion  perhaps i am as much to blame as you  i thought too much of my work and too little of my wife  the professor heard the cooing caressing laugh which he knew so well  i shall go with you james she said  and the professor  the poor professor  but he will not mind much james he has no heart  we must tell him our resolution  there is no need said professor ainslie grey stepping in through the open casement  i have overheard the latter part of your conversation  i hesitated to interrupt you before you came to a conclusion  obrien stretched out his hand and took that of the woman  they stood together with the sunshine on their faces  the professor paused at the casement with his hands behind his back and his long black shadow fell between them  you have come to a wise decision said he  go back to australia together and let what has passed be blotted out of your lives  but youyou stammered obrien  the professor waved his hand  never trouble about me he said  the woman gave a gasping cry  what can i do or say she wailed  how could i have foreseen this i thought my old life was dead  but it has come back again with all its hopes and its desires  what can i say to you ainslie  i have brought shame and disgrace upon a worthy man  i have blasted your life  how you must hate and loathe me  i wish to god that i had never been born  i neither hate nor loathe you jeannette said the professor quietly  you are wrong in regretting your birth for you have a worthy mission before you in aiding the lifework of a man who has shown himself capable of the highest order of scientific research  i cannot with justice blame you personally for what has occurred  how far the individual monad is to be held responsible for hereditary and engrained tendencies is a question upon which science has not yet said her last word  he stood with his fingertips touching and his body inclined as one who is gravely expounding a difficult and impersonal subject  obrien had stepped forward to say something but the others attitude and manner froze the words upon his lips  condolence or sympathy would be an impertinence to one who could so easily merge his private griefs in broad questions of abstract philosophy  it is needless to prolong the situation the professor continued in the same measured tones  my brougham stands at the door  i beg that you will use it as your own  perhaps it would be as well that you should leave the town without unnecessary delay  your things jeannette shall be forwarded  obrien hesitated with a hanging head  i hardly dare offer you my hand he said  on the contrary  i think that of the three of us you come best out of the affair  you have nothing to be ashamed of  your sister  i shall see that the matter is put to her in its true light goodbye  let me have a copy of your recent research  goodbye jeannette  goodbye  their hands met and for one short moment their eyes also  it was only a glance but for the first and last time the womans intuition cast a light for itself into the dark places of a strong mans soul  she gave a little gasp and her other hand rested for an instant as white and as light as thistledown upon his shoulder  james james she cried  dont you see that he is stricken to the heart  he turned her quietly away from him  i am not an emotional man he said i have my dutiesmy research on vallisneria  the brougham is there  your cloak is in the hall  tell john where you wish to be driven  he will bring you anything you need now go  his last two words were so sudden so volcanic in such contrast to his measured voice and masklike face that they swept the two away from him  he closed the door behind them and paced slowly up and down the room  then he passed into the library and looked out over the wire blind  the carriage was rolling away  he caught a last glimpse of the woman who had been his wife  he saw the feminine droop of her head and the curve of her beautiful throat  under some foolish aimless impulse he took a few quick steps towards the door  then he turned and throwing himself into his studychair he plunged back into his work   there was little scandal about this singular domestic incident  the professor had few personal friends and seldom went into society  his marriage had been so quiet that most of his colleagues had never ceased to regard him as a bachelor  mrs esdaile and a few others might talk but their field for gossip was limited for they could only guess vaguely at the cause of this sudden separation  the professor was as punctual as ever at his classes and as zealous in directing the laboratory work of those who studied under him  his own private researches were pushed on with feverish energy  it was no uncommon thing for his servants when they came down of a morning to hear the shrill scratchings of his tireless pen or to meet him on the staircase as he ascended grey and silent to his room  in vain his friends assured him that such a life must undermine his health  he lengthened his hours until day and night were one long ceaseless task  gradually under this discipline a change came over his appearance  his features always inclined to gauntness became even sharper and more pronounced  there were deep lines about his temples and across his brow  his cheek was sunken and his complexion bloodless  his knees gave under him when he walked and once when passing out of his lectureroom he fell and had to be assisted to his carriage  this was just before the end of the session and soon after the holidays commenced the professors who still remained in birchespool were shocked to hear that their brother of the chair of physiology had sunk so low that no hopes could be entertained of his recovery  two eminent physicians had consulted over his case without being able to give a name to the affection from which he suffered  a steadily decreasing vitality appeared to be the only symptoma bodily weakness which left the mind unclouded  he was much interested himself in his own case and made notes of his subjective sensations as an aid to diagnosis  of his approaching end he spoke in his usual unemotional and somewhat pedantic fashion  it is the assertion he said of the liberty of the individual cell as opposed to the cellcommune  it is the dissolution of a cooperative society  the process is one of great interest  and so one grey morning his cooperative society dissolved  very quietly and softly he sank into his eternal sleep  his two physicians felt some slight embarrassment when called upon to fill in his certificate  it is difficult to give it a name said one  very said the other  if he were not such an unemotional man i should have said that he had died from some sudden nervous shockfrom in fact what the vulgar would call a broken heart  i dont think poor grey was that sort of a man at all  let us call it cardiac anyhow said the older physician  so they did so     the case of lady sannox  the relations between douglas stone and the notorious lady sannox were very well known both among the fashionable circles of which she was a brilliant member and the scientific bodies which numbered him among their most illustrious confreres  there was naturally therefore a very widespread interest when it was announced one morning that the lady had absolutely and for ever taken the veil and that the world would see her no more  when at the very tail of this rumour there came the assurance that the celebrated operating surgeon the man of steel nerves had been found in the morning by his valet seated on one side of his bed smiling pleasantly upon the universe with both legs jammed into one side of his breeches and his great brain about as valuable as a cap full of porridge the matter was strong enough to give quite a little thrill of interest to folk who had never hoped that their jaded nerves were capable of such a sensation  douglas stone in his prime was one of the most remarkable men in england  indeed he could hardly be said to have ever reached his prime for he was but nineandthirty at the time of this little incident  those who knew him best were aware that famous as he was as a surgeon he might have succeeded with even greater rapidity in any of a dozen lines of life  he could have cut his way to fame as a soldier struggled to it as an explorer bullied for it in the courts or built it out of stone and iron as an engineer  he was born to be great for he could plan what another man dare not do and he could do what another man dare not plan  in surgery none could follow him  his nerve his judgment his intuition were things apart  again and again his knife cut away death but grazed the very springs of life in doing it until his assistants were as white as the patient  his energy his audacity his fullblooded selfconfidencedoes not the memory of them still linger to the south of marylebone road and the north of oxford street  his vices were as magnificent as his virtues and infinitely more picturesque  large as was his income and it was the third largest of all professional men in london it was far beneath the luxury of his living  deep in his complex nature lay a rich vein of sensualism at the sport of which he placed all the prizes of his life  the eye the ear the touch the palateall were his masters  the bouquet of old vintages the scent of rare exotics the curves and tints of the daintiest potteries of europeit was to these that the quickrunning stream of gold was transformed  and then there came his sudden mad passion for lady sannox when a single interview with two challenging glances and a whispered word set him ablaze  she was the loveliest woman in london and the only one to him  he was one of the handsomest men in london but not the only one to her  she had a liking for new experiences and was gracious to most men who wooed her  it may have been cause or it may have been effect that lord sannox looked fifty though he was but sixandthirty  he was a quiet silent neutraltinted man this lord with thin lips and heavy eyelids much given to gardening and full of homelike habits  he had at one time been fond of acting had even rented a theatre in london and on its boards had first seen miss marion dawson to whom he had offered his hand his title and the third of a county since his marriage this early hobby had become distasteful to him even in private theatricals it was no longer possible to persuade him to exercise the talent which he had often shown that he possessed  he was happier with a spud and a wateringcan among his orchids and chrysanthemums  it was quite an interesting problem whether he was absolutely devoid of sense or miserably wanting in spirit  did he know his ladys ways and condone them or was he a mere blind doting fool  it was a point to be discussed over the teacups in snug little drawingrooms or with the aid of a cigar in the bow windows of clubs  bitter and plain were the comments among men upon his conduct  there was but one who had a good word to say for him and he was the most silent member in the smokingroom  he had seen him break in a horse at the university and it seemed to have left an impression upon his mind  but when douglas stone became the favourite all doubts as to lord sannoxs knowledge or ignorance were set for ever at rest  there was no subterfuge about stone  in his highhanded impetuous fashion he set all caution and discretion at defiance  the scandal became notorious  a learned body intimated that his name had been struck from the list of its vicepresidents  two friends implored him to consider his professional credit  he cursed them all three and spent forty guineas on a bangle to take with him to the lady  he was at her house every evening and she drove in his carriage in the afternoons  there was not an attempt on either side to conceal their relations but there came at last a little incident to interrupt them  it was a dismal winters night very cold and gusty with the wind whooping in the chimneys and blustering against the windowpanes  a thin spatter of rain tinkled on the glass with each fresh sough of the gale drowning for the instant the dull gurgle and drip from the eves douglas stone had finished his dinner and sat by his fire in the study a glass of rich port upon the malachite table at his elbow  as he raised it to his lips he held it up against the lamplight and watched with the eye of a connoisseur the tiny scales of beeswing which floated in its rich ruby depths  the fire as it spurted up threw fitful lights upon his bold clearcut face with its widelyopened grey eyes its thick and yet firm lips and the deep square jaw which had something roman in its strength and its animalism  he smiled from time to time as he nestled back in his luxurious chair  indeed he had a right to feel well pleased for against the advice of six colleagues he had performed an operation that day of which only two cases were on record and the result had been brilliant beyond all expectation  no other man in london would have had the daring to plan or the skill to execute such a heroic measure  but he had promised lady sannox to see her that evening and it was already halfpast eight  his hand was outstretched to the bell to order the carriage when he heard the dull thud of the knocker  an instant later there was the shuffling of feet in the hall and the sharp closing of a door  a patient to see you sir in the consultingroom said the butler  about himself  no sir i think he wants you to go out  it is too late cried douglas stone peevishly  i wont go  this is his card sir  the butler presented it upon the gold salver which had been given to his master by the wife of a prime minister  hamil ali smyrna  hum  the fellow is a turk i suppose  yes sir  he seems as if he came from abroad sir  and hes in a terrible way  tut tut  i have an engagement  i must go somewhere else  but ill see him  show him in here pim  a few moments later the butler swung open the door and ushered in a small and decrepit man who walked with a bent back and with the forward push of the face and blink of the eyes which goes with extreme short sight  his face was swarthy and his hair and beard of the deepest black  in one hand he held a turban of white muslin striped with red in the other a small chamois leather bag  goodevening said douglas stone when the butler had closed the door  you speak english i presume  yes sir  i am from asia minor but i speak english when i speak slow  you wanted me to go out i understand  yes sir  i wanted very much that you should see my wife  i could come in the morning but i have an engagement which prevents me from seeing your wife tonight  the turks answer was a singular one  he pulled the string which closed the mouth of the chamois leather bag and poured a flood of gold on to the table  there are one hundred pounds there said he and i promise you that it will not take you an hour  i have a cab ready at the door  douglas stone glanced at his watch  an hour would not make it too late to visit lady sannox  he had been there later  and the fee was an extraordinarily high one  he had been pressed by his creditors lately and he could not afford to let such a chance pass  he would go  what is the case he asked  oh it is so sad a one  so sad a one  you have not perhaps heard of the daggers of the almohades  never  ah they are eastern daggers of a great age and of a singular shape with the hilt like what you call a stirrup  i am a curiosity dealer you understand and that is why i have come to england from smyrna but next week i go back once more  many things i brought with me and i have a few things left but among them to my sorrow is one of these daggers  you will remember that i have an appointment sir said the surgeon with some irritation  pray confine yourself to the necessary details  you will see that it is necessary  today my wife fell down in a faint in the room in which i keep my wares and she cut her lower lip upon this cursed dagger of almohades  i see said douglas stone rising  and you wish me to dress the wound  no no it is worse than that  what then  these daggers are poisoned  poisoned  yes and there is no man east or west who can tell now what is the poison or what the cure  but all that is known i know for my father was in this trade before me and we have had much to do with these poisoned weapons  what are the symptoms  deep sleep and death in thirty hours  and you say there is no cure  why then should you pay me this considerable fee  no drug can cure but the knife may  and how  the poison is slow of absorption  it remains for hours in the wound  washing then might cleanse it  no more than in a snakebite  it is too subtle and too deadly  excision of the wound then  that is it  if it be on the finger take the finger off  so said my father always  but think of where this wound is and that it is my wife  it is dreadful  but familiarity with such grim matters may take the finer edge from a mans sympathy  to douglas stone this was already an interesting case and he brushed aside as irrelevant the feeble objections of the husband  it appears to be that or nothing said he brusquely  it is better to lose a lip than a life  ah yes i know that you are right  well well it is kismet and must be faced  i have the cab and you will come with me and do this thing  douglas stone took his case of bistouries from a drawer and placed it with a roll of bandage and a compress of lint in his pocket  he must waste no more time if he were to see lady sannox  i am ready said he pulling on his overcoat  will you take a glass of wine before you go out into this cold air  his visitor shrank away with a protesting hand upraised  you forget that i am a mussulman and a true follower of the prophet said he  but tell me what is the bottle of green glass which you have placed in your pocket  it is chloroform  ah that also is forbidden to us  it is a spirit and we make no use of such things  what  you would allow your wife to go through an operation without an anaesthetic  ah she will feel nothing poor soul  the deep sleep has already come on which is the first working of the poison  and then i have given her of our smyrna opium  come sir for already an hour has passed  as they stepped out into the darkness a sheet of rain was driven in upon their faces and the hall lamp which dangled from the arm of a marble caryatid went out with a fluff  pim the butler pushed the heavy door to straining hard with his shoulder against the wind while the two men groped their way towards the yellow glare which showed where the cab was waiting  an instant later they were rattling upon their journey  is it far asked douglas stone  oh no  we have a very little quiet place off the euston road  the surgeon pressed the spring of his repeater and listened to the little tings which told him the hour  it was a quarter past nine  he calculated the distances and the short time which it would take him to perform so trivial an operation  he ought to reach lady sannox by ten oclock  through the fogged windows he saw the blurred gaslamps dancing past with occasionally the broader glare of a shop front  the rain was pelting and rattling upon the leathern top of the carriage and the wheels swashed as they rolled through puddle and mud  opposite to him the white headgear of his companion gleamed faintly through the obscurity  the surgeon felt in his pockets and arranged his needles his ligatures and his safetypins that no time might be wasted when they arrived  he chafed with impatience and drummed his foot upon the floor  but the cab slowed down at last and pulled up  in an instant douglas stone was out and the smyrna merchants toe was at his very heel  you can wait said he to the driver  it was a meanlooking house in a narrow and sordid street  the surgeon who knew his london well cast a swift glance into the shadows but there was nothing distinctiveno shop no movement nothing but a double line of dull flatfaced houses a double stretch of wet flagstones which gleamed in the lamplight and a double rush of water in the gutters which swirled and gurgled towards the sewer gratings  the door which faced them was blotched and discoloured and a faint light in the fan pane above it served to show the dust and the grime which covered it  above in one of the bedroom windows there was a dull yellow glimmer  the merchant knocked loudly and as he turned his dark face towards the light douglas stone could see that it was contracted with anxiety  a bolt was drawn and an elderly woman with a taper stood in the doorway shielding the thin flame with her gnarled hand  is all well gasped the merchant  she is as you left her sir  she has not spoken  no she is in a deep sleep  the merchant closed the door and douglas stone walked down the narrow passage glancing about him in some surprise as he did so  there was no oilcloth no mat no hatrack  deep grey dust and heavy festoons of cobwebs met his eyes everywhere  following the old woman up the winding stair his firm footfall echoed harshly through the silent house  there was no carpet  the bedroom was on the second landing  douglas stone followed the old nurse into it with the merchant at his heels  here at least there was furniture and to spare  the floor was littered and the corners piled with turkish cabinets inlaid tables coats of chain mail strange pipes and grotesque weapons  a single small lamp stood upon a bracket on the wall  douglas stone took it down and picking his way among the lumber walked over to a couch in the corner on which lay a woman dressed in the turkish fashion with yashmak and veil  the lower part of the face was exposed and the surgeon saw a jagged cut which zigzagged along the border of the under lip  you will forgive the yashmak said the turk  you know our views about woman in the east  but the surgeon was not thinking about the yashmak  this was no longer a woman to him  it was a case  he stooped and examined the wound carefully  there are no signs of irritation said he  we might delay the operation until local symptoms develop  the husband wrung his hands in incontrollable agitation  oh sir sir he cried  do not trifle you do not know  it is deadly  i know and i give you my assurance that an operation is absolutely necessary  only the knife can save her  and yet i am inclined to wait said douglas stone  that is enough the turk cried angrily  every minute is of importance and i cannot stand here and see my wife allowed to sink it only remains for me to give you my thanks for having come and to call in some other surgeon before it is too late  douglas stone hesitated  to refund that hundred pounds was no pleasant matter  but of course if he left the case he must return the money and if the turk were right and the woman died his position before a coroner might be an embarrassing one  you have had personal experience of this poison he asked  i have  and you assure me that an operation is needful  i swear it by all that i hold sacred  the disfigurement will be frightful  i can understand that the mouth will not be a pretty one to kiss  douglas stone turned fiercely upon the man  the speech was a brutal one  but the turk has his own fashion of talk and of thought and there was no time for wrangling  douglas stone drew a bistoury from his case opened it and felt the keen straight edge with his forefinger  then he held the lamp closer to the bed  two dark eyes were gazing up at him through the slit in the yashmak  they were all iris and the pupil was hardly to be seen  you have given her a very heavy dose of opium  yes she has had a good dose  he glanced again at the dark eyes which looked straight at his own they were dull and lustreless but even as he gazed a little shifting sparkle came into them and the lips quivered  she is not absolutely unconscious said he  would it not be well to use the knife while it would be painless  the same thought had crossed the surgeons mind  he grasped the wounded lip with his forceps and with two swift cuts he took out a broad vshaped piece  the woman sprang up on the couch with a dreadful gurgling scream  her covering was torn from her face  it was a face that he knew  in spite of that protruding upper lip and that slobber of blood it was a face that he knew  she kept on putting her hand up to the gap and screaming  douglas stone sat down at the foot of the couch with his knife and his forceps  the room was whirling round and he had felt something go like a ripping seam behind his ear  a bystander would have said that his face was the more ghastly of the two  as in a dream or as if he had been looking at something at the play he was conscious that the turks hair and beard lay upon the table and that lord sannox was leaning against the wall with his hand to his side laughing silently  the screams had died away now and the dreadful head had dropped back again upon the pillow but douglas stone still sat motionless and lord sannox still chuckled quietly to himself  it was really very necessary for marion this operation said he not physically but morally you know morally  douglas stone stooped forwards and began to play with the fringe of the coverlet  his knife tinkled down upon the ground but he still held the forceps and something more  i had long intended to make a little example said lord sannox suavely  your note of wednesday miscarried and i have it here in my pocketbook  i took some pains in carrying out my idea  the wound by the way was from nothing more dangerous than my signet ring  he glanced keenly at his silent companion and cocked the small revolver which he held in his coat pocket  but douglas stone was still picking at the coverlet  you see you have kept your appointment after all said lord sannox  and at that douglas stone began to laugh  he laughed long and loudly but lord sannox did not laugh now  something like fear sharpened and hardened his features  he walked from the room and he walked on tiptoe  the old woman was waiting outside  attend to your mistress when she awakes said lord sannox  then he went down to the street  the cab was at the door and the driver raised his hand to his hat  john said lord sannox you will take the doctor home first  he will want leading downstairs i think  tell his butler that he has been taken ill at a case  very good sir  then you can take lady sannox home  and how about yourself sir  oh my address for the next few months will be hotel di roma venice just see that the letters are sent on  and tell stevens to exhibit all the purple chrysanthemums next monday and to wire me the result     a question of diplomacy  the foreign minister was down with the gout  for a week he had been confined to the house and he had missed two cabinet councils at a time when the pressure upon his department was severe  it is true that he had an excellent undersecretary and an admirable staff but the minister was a man of such ripe experience and of such proven sagacity that things halted in his absence  when his firm hand was at the wheel the great ship of state rode easily and smoothly upon her way when it was removed she yawed and staggered until twelve british editors rose up in their omniscience and traced out twelve several courses each of which was the sole and only path to safety  then it was that the opposition said vain things and that the harassed prime minister prayed for his absent colleague  the foreign minister sat in his dressingroom in the great house in cavendish square  it was may and the square garden shot up like a veil of green in front of his window but in spite of the sunshine a fire crackled and sputtered in the grate of the sickroom  in a deepred plush armchair sat the great statesman his head leaning back upon a silken pillow one foot stretched forward and supported upon a padded rest  his deeplylined finelychiselled face and slowmoving heavilypouched eyes were turned upwards towards the carved and painted ceiling with that inscrutable expression which had been the despair and the admiration of his continental colleagues upon the occasion of the famous congress when he had made his first appearance in the arena of european diplomacy  yet at the present moment his capacity for hiding his emotions had for the instant failed him for about the lines of his strong straight mouth and the puckers of his broad overhanging forehead there were sufficient indications of the restlessness and impatience which consumed him  and indeed there was enough to make a man chafe for he had much to think of and yet was bereft of the power of thought  there was for example that question of the dobrutscha and the navigation of the mouths of the danube which was ripe for settlement  the russian chancellor had sent a masterly statement upon the subject and it was the pet ambition of our minister to answer it in a worthy fashion then there was the blockade of crete and the british fleet lying off cape matapan waiting for instructions which might change the course of european history  and there were those three unfortunate macedonian tourists whose friends were momentarily expecting to receive their ears or their fingers in default of the exorbitant ransom which had been demanded  they must be plucked out of those mountains by force or by diplomacy or an outraged public would vent its wrath upon downing street  all these questions pressed for a solution and yet here was the foreign minister of england planted in an armchair with his whole thoughts and attention riveted upon the ball of his right toe  it was humiliatinghorribly humiliating  his reason revolted at it  he had been a respecter of himself a respecter of his own will but what sort of a machine was it which could be utterly thrown out of gear by a little piece of inflamed gristle  he groaned and writhed among his cushions  but after all was it quite impossible that he should go down to the house  perhaps the doctor was exaggerating the situation  there was a cabinet council that day  he glanced at his watch  it must be nearly over by now  but at least he might perhaps venture to drive down as far as westminster  he pushed back the little round table with its bristle of medicinebottles and levering himself up with a hand upon either arm of the chair he clutched a thick oak stick and hobbled slowly across the room  for a moment as he moved his energy of mind and body seemed to return to him  the british fleet should sail from matapan  pressure should be brought to bear upon the turks  the greeks should be shownow  in an instant the mediterranean was blotted out and nothing remained but that huge undeniable intrusive redhot toe  he staggered to the window and rested his left hand upon the ledge while he propped himself upon his stick with his right outside lay the bright cool square garden a few welldressed passersby and a single neatlyappointed carriage which was driving away from his own door  his quick eye caught the coatofarms on the panel and his lips set for a moment and his bushy eyebrows gathered ominously with a deep furrow between them  he hobbled back to his seat and struck the gong which stood upon the table  your mistress said he as the servingman entered  it was clear that it was impossible to think of going to the house the shooting up his leg warned him that his doctor had not overestimated the situation  but he had a little mental worry now which had for the moment eclipsed his physical ailments  he tapped the ground impatiently with his stick until the door of the dressingroom swung open and a tall elegant lady of rather more than middle age swept into the chamber  her hair was touched with grey but her calm sweet face had all the freshness of youth and her gown of green shot plush with a sparkle of gold passementerie at her bosom and shoulders showed off the lines of her fine figure to their best advantage  you sent for me charles  whose carriage was that which drove away just now  oh youve been up she cried shaking an admonitory forefinger what an old dear it is  how can you be so rash  what am i to say to sir william when he comes  you know that he gives up his cases when they are insubordinate  in this instance the case may give him up said the minister peevishly but i must beg clara that you will answer my question  oh the carriage  it must have been lord arthur sibthorpes  i saw the three chevrons upon the panel muttered the invalid  his lady had pulled herself a little straighter and opened her large blue eyes  then why ask she said  one might almost think charles that you were laying a trap  did you expect that i should deceive you  you have not had your lithia powder  for heavens sake leave it alone  i asked because i was surprised that lord arthur should call here  i should have fancied clara that i had made myself sufficiently clear on that point  who received him  i did  that is i and ida  i will not have him brought into contact with ida  i do not approve of it  the matter has gone too far already  lady clara seated herself on a velvettopped footstool and bent her stately figure over the ministers hand which she patted softly between her own  now you have said it charles said she  it has gone too fari give you my word dear that i never suspected it until it was past all mending  i may be to blameno doubt i am but it was all so sudden the tail end of the season and a week at lord donnythornes  that was all  but oh  charlie she loves him so and she is our only one  how can we make her miserable  tut tut cried the minister impatiently slapping on the plush arm of his chair  this is too much  i tell you clara i give you my word that all my official duties all the affairs of this great empire do not give me the trouble that ida does  but she is our only one charles  the more reason that she should not make a mesalliance  mesalliance charles  lord arthur sibthorpe son of the duke of tavistock with a pedigree from the heptarchy  debrett takes them right back to morcar earl of northumberland  the minister shrugged his shoulders  lord arthur is the fourth son of the poorest duke in england said he  he has neither prospects nor profession  but oh charlie you could find him both  i do not like him  i do not care for the connection  but consider ida  you know how frail her health is  her whole soul is set upon him  you would not have the heart charles to separate them  there was a tap at the door  lady clara swept towards it and threw it open  yes thomas  if you please my lady the prime minister is below  show him up thomas  now charlie you must not excite yourself over public matters  be very good and cool and reasonable like a darling  i am sure that i may trust you  she threw her light shawl round the invalids shoulders and slipped away into the bedroom as the great man was ushered in at the door of the dressingroom  my dear charles said he cordially stepping into the room with all the boyish briskness for which he was famous i trust that you find yourself a little better  almost ready for harness eh  we miss you sadly both in the house and in the council  quite a storm brewing over this grecian business  the times took a nasty line this morning  so i saw said the invalid smiling up at his chief  well well we must let them see that the country is not entirely ruled from printing house square yet  we must keep our own course without faltering  certainly charles most undoubtedly assented the prime minister with his hands in his pockets  it was so kind of you to call  i am all impatience to know what was done in the council  pure formalities nothing more  bytheway the macedonian prisoners are all right  thank goodness for that  we adjourned all other business until we should have you with us next week  the question of a dissolution begins to press  the reports from the provinces are excellent  the foreign minister moved impatiently and groaned  we must really straighten up our foreign business a little said he i must get novikoffs note answered  it is clever but the fallacies are obvious  i wish too we could clear up the afghan frontier  this illness is most exasperating  there is so much to be done but my brain is clouded  sometimes i think it is the gout and sometimes i put it down to the colchicum  what will our medical autocrat say laughed the prime minister  you are so irreverent charles  with a bishop one may feel at ones ease they are not beyond the reach of argument  but a doctor with his stethoscope and thermometer is a thing apart  your reading does not impinge upon him  he is serenely above you  and then of course he takes you at a disadvantage  with health and strength one might cope with him  have you read hahnemann  what are your views upon hahnemann  the invalid knew his illustrious colleague too well to follow him down any of those bypaths of knowledge in which he delighted to wander  to his intensely shrewd and practical mind there was something repellent in the waste of energy involved in a discussion upon the early church or the twentyseven principles of mesmer  it was his custom to slip past such conversational openings with a quick step and an averted face  i have hardly glanced at his writings said he  bytheway i suppose that there was no special departmental news  ah  i had almost forgotten  yes it was one of the things which i had called to tell you  sir algernon jones has resigned at tangier there is a vacancy there  it had better be filled at once  the longer delay the more applicants  ah patronage patronage sighed the prime minister  every vacancy makes one doubtful friend and a dozen very positive enemies  who so bitter as the disappointed placeseeker  but you are right charles better fill it at once especially as there is some little trouble in morocco  i understand that the duke of tavistock would like the place for his fourth son lord arthur sibthorpe  we are under some obligation to the duke  the foreign minister sat up eagerly  my dear friend he said it is the very appointment which i should have suggested  lord arthur would be very much better in tangier at present than inin  cavendish square hazarded his chief with a little arch query of his eyebrows  well let us say london  he has manner and tact  he was at constantinople in nortons time  then he talks arabic  a smattering  but his french is good  speaking of arabic charles have you dipped into averroes  no i have not  but the appointment would be an excellent one in every way  would you have the great goodness to arrange the matter in my absence  certainly charles certainly  is there anything else that i can do  no  i hope to be in the house by monday  i trust so  we miss you at every turn  the times will try to make mischief over that grecian business  a leaderwriter is a terribly irresponsible thing charles  there is no method by which he may be confuted however preposterous his assertions  goodbye  read porson goodbye  he shook the invalids hand gave a jaunty wave of his broadbrimmed hat and darted out of the room with the same elasticity and energy with which he had entered it  the footman had already opened the great folding door to usher the illustrious visitor to his carriage when a lady stepped from the drawingroom and touched him on the sleeve  from behind the halfclosed portiere of stamped velvet a little pale face peeped out halfcurious halffrightened  may i have one word  surely lady clara  i hope it is not intrusive  i would not for the world overstep the limits  my dear lady clara interrupted the prime minister with a youthful bow and wave  pray do not answer me if i go too far  but i know that lord arthur sibthorpe has applied for tangier  would it be a liberty if i asked you what chance he has  the post is filled up  oh  in the foreground and background there was a disappointed face  and lord arthur has it  the prime minister chuckled over his little piece of roguery  we have just decided it he continued  lord arthur must go in a week  i am delighted to perceive lady clara that the appointment has your approval  tangier is a place of extraordinary interest  catherine of braganza and colonel kirke will occur to your memory  burton has written well upon northern africa  i dine at windsor so i am sure that you will excuse my leaving you  i trust that lord charles will be better  he can hardly fail to be so with such a nurse  he bowed waved and was off down the steps to his brougham  as he drove away lady clara could see that he was already deeply absorbed in a papercovered novel  she pushed back the velvet curtains and returned into the drawingroom  her daughter stood in the sunlight by the window tall fragile and exquisite her features and outline not unlike her mothers but frailer softer more delicate  the golden light struck one half of her highbred sensitive face and glimmered upon her thicklycoiled flaxen hair striking a pinkish tint from her closelycut costume of fawncoloured cloth with its dainty cinnamon ruchings  one little soft frill of chiffon nestled round her throat from which the white graceful neck and wellpoised head shot up like a lily amid moss  her thin white hands were pressed together and her blue eyes turned beseechingly upon her mother  silly girl  silly girl said the matron answering that imploring look  she put her hands upon her daughters sloping shoulders and drew her towards her  it is a very nice place for a short time  it will be a stepping stone  but oh mamma in a week  poor arthur  he will be happy  what happy to part  he need not part  you shall go with him  oh mamma  yes i say it  oh mamma in a week  yes indeed  a great deal may be done in a week  i shall order your trousseau today  oh you dear sweet angel  but i am so frightened  and papa  oh dear i am so frightened  your papa is a diplomatist dear  yes ma  but between ourselves he married a diplomatist too  if he can manage the british empire i think that i can manage him ida  how long have you been engaged child  ten weeks mamma  then it is quite time it came to a head  lord arthur cannot leave england without you  you must go to tangier as the ministers wife now you will sit there on the settee dear and let me manage entirely  there is sir williams carriage  i do think that i know how to manage sir william  james just ask the doctor to step in this way  a heavy twohorsed carriage had drawn up at the door and there came a single stately thud upon the knocker  an instant afterwards the drawingroom door flew open and the footman ushered in the famous physician  he was a small man cleanshaven with the oldfashioned black dress and white cravat with highstanding collar  he swung his golden pincenez in his right hand as he walked and bent forward with a peering blinking expression which was somehow suggestive of the dark and complex cases through which he had seen  ah said he as he entered  my young patient  i am glad of the opportunity  yes i wish to speak to you about her sir william  pray take this armchair  thank you i will sit beside her said he taking his place upon the settee  she is looking better less anaemic unquestionably and a fuller pulse  quite a little tinge of colour and yet not hectic  i feel stronger sir william  but she still has the pain in the side  ah that pain  he tapped lightly under the collarbones and then bent forward with his biaural stethoscope in either ear  still a trace of dulnessstill a slight crepitation he murmured  you spoke of a change doctor  yes certainly a judicious change might be advisable  you said a dry climate  i wish to do to the letter what you recommend  you have always been model patients  we wish to be  you said a dry climate  did i  i rather forget the particulars of our conversation  but a dry climate is certainly indicated  which one  well i think really that a patient should be allowed some latitude i must not exact too rigid discipline  there is room for individual choicethe engadine central europe egypt algiers which you like  i hear that tangier is also recommended  oh yes certainly it is very dry  you hear ida sir william says that you are to go to tangier  or any  no no sir william  we feel safest when we are most obedient  you have said tangier and we shall certainly try tangier  really lady clara your implicit faith is most flattering  it is not everyone who would sacrifice their own plans and inclinations so readily  we know your skill and your experience sir william  ida shall try tangier  i am convinced that she will be benefited  i have no doubt of it  but you know lord charles  he is just a little inclined to decide medical matters as he would an affair of state  i hope that you will be firm with him  as long as lord charles honours me so far as to ask my advice i am sure that he would not place me in the false position of having that advice disregarded  the medical baronet whirled round the cord of his pincenez and pushed out a protesting hand  no no but you must be firm on the point of tangier  having deliberately formed the opinion that tangier is the best place for our young patient i do not think that i shall readily change my conviction  of course not  i shall speak to lord charles upon the subject now when i go upstairs  pray do  and meanwhile she will continue her present course of treatment  i trust that the warm african air may send her back in a few months with all her energy restored  he bowed in the courteous sweeping oldworld fashion which had done so much to build up his ten thousand a year and with the stealthy gait of a man whose life is spent in sickrooms he followed the footman upstairs  as the red velvet curtains swept back into position the lady ida threw her arms round her mothers neck and sank her face on to her bosom  oh mamma you are a diplomatist she cried  but her mothers expression was rather that of the general who looked upon the first smoke of the guns than of one who had won the victory  all will be right dear said she glancing down at the fluffy yellow curls and tiny ear  there is still much to be done but i think we may venture to order the trousseau  oh i how brave you are  of course it will in any case be a very quiet affair  arthur must get the license  i do not approve of holeandcorner marriages but where the gentleman has to take up an official position some allowance must be made  we can have lady hilda edgecombe and the trevors and the grevilles and i am sure that the prime minister would run down if he could  and papa  oh yes he will come too if he is well enough  we must wait until sir william goes and meanwhile i shall write to lord arthur  half an hour had passed and quite a number of notes had been dashed off in the fine bold parkpaling handwriting of the lady clara when the door clashed and the wheels of the doctors carriage were heard grating outside against the kerb  the lady clara laid down her pen kissed her daughter and started off for the sickroom  the foreign minister was lying back in his chair with a red silk handkerchief over his forehead and his bulbous cottonwadded foot still protruding upon its rest  i think it is almost liniment time said lady clara shaking a blue crinkled bottle  shall i put on a little  oh this pestilent toe groaned the sufferer  sir william wont hear of my moving yet  i do think he is the most completely obstinate and pigheaded man that i have ever met  i tell him that he has mistaken his profession and that i could find him a post at constantinople  we need a mule out there  poor sir william laughed lady clara  but how has he roused your wrath  he is so persistentso dogmatic  upon what point  well he has been laying down the law about ida  he has decreed it seems that she is to go to tangier  he said something to that effect before he went up to you  oh he did did he  the slowmoving inscrutable eye came sliding round to her  lady claras face had assumed an expression of transparent obvious innocence an intrusive candour which is never seen in nature save when a woman is bent upon deception  he examined her lungs charles  he did not say much but his expression was very grave  not to say owlish interrupted the minister  no no charles it is no laughing matter  he said that she must have a change  i am sure that he thought more than he said  he spoke of dulness and crepitation and the effects of the african air  then the talk turned upon dry bracing health resorts and he agreed that tangier was the place  he said that even a few months there would work a change  and that was all  yes that was all  lord charles shrugged his shoulders with the air of a man who is but half convinced  but of course said lady clara serenely if you think it better that ida should not go she shall not  the only thing is that if she should get worse we might feel a little uncomfortable afterwards  in a weakness of that sort a very short time may make a difference  sir william evidently thought the matter critical  still there is no reason why he should influence you  it is a little responsibility however  if you take it all upon yourself and free me from any of it so that afterwards  my dear clara how you do croak  oh i dont wish to do that charles  but you remember what happened to lord bellamys child  she was just idas age  that was another case in which sir williams advice was disregarded  lord charles groaned impatiently  i have not disregarded it said he  no no of course not  i know your strong sense and your good heart too well dear  you were very wisely looking at both sides of the question  that is what we poor women cannot do  it is emotion against reason as i have often heard you say  we are swayed this way and that but you men are persistent and so you gain your way with us but i am so pleased that you have decided for tangier  have i  well dear you said that you would not disregard sir william  well clara admitting that ida is to go to tangier you will allow that it is impossible for me to escort her  utterly  and for you  while you are ill my place is by your side  there is your sister  she is going to florida  lady dumbarton then  she is nursing her father  it is out of the question  well then whom can we possibly ask  especially just as the season is commencing  you see clara the fates fight against sir william  his wife rested her elbows against the back of the great red chair and passed her fingers through the statesmans grizzled curls stooping down as she did so until her lips were close to his ear  there is lord arthur sibthorpe said she softly  lord charles bounded in his chair and muttered a word or two such as were more frequently heard from cabinet ministers in lord melbournes time than now  are you mad clara he cried  what can have put such a thought into your head  the prime minister  who  the prime minister  yes dear  now do do be good  or perhaps i had better not speak to you about it any more  well i really think that you have gone rather too far to retreat  it was the prime minister then who told me that lord arthur was going to tangier  it is a fact though it had escaped my memory for the instant  and then came sir william with his advice about ida  oh charlie it is surely more than a coincidence  i am convinced said lord charles with his shrewd questioning gaze that it is very much more than a coincidence lady clara  you are a very clever woman my dear  a born manager and organiser  lady clara brushed past the compliment  think of our own young days charlie she whispered with her fingers still toying with his hair  what were you then  a poor man not even ambassador at tangier  but i loved you and believed in you and have i ever regretted it  ida loves and believes in lord arthur and why should she ever regret it either  lord charles was silent  his eyes were fixed upon the green branches which waved outside the window but his mind had flashed back to a devonshire countryhouse of thirty years ago and to the one fateful evening when between old yew hedges he paced along beside a slender girl and poured out to her his hopes his fears and his ambitious he took the white thin hand and pressed it to his lips  you have been a good wife to me clara said he  she said nothing  she did not attempt to improve upon her advantage a less consummate general might have tried to do so and ruined all she stood silent and submissive noting the quick play of thought which peeped from his eyes and lip  there was a sparkle in the one and a twitch of amusement in the other as he at last glanced up at her  clara said he deny it if you can  you have ordered the trousseau  she gave his ear a little pinch  subject to your approval said she  you have written to the archbishop  it is not posted yet  you have sent a note to lord arthur  how could you tell that  he is downstairs now  no but i think that is his brougham  lord charles sank back with a look of halfcomical despair  who is to fight against such a woman he cried  oh if i could send you to novikoff  he is too much for any of my men  but clara i cannot have them up here  not for your blessing  no no  it would make them so happy  i cannot stand scenes  then i shall convey it to them  and pray say no more about ittoday at any rate  i have been weak over the matter  oh charlie you who are so strong  you have outflanked me clara  it was very well done  i must congratulate you  well  she murmured as she kissed him you know i have been studying a very clever diplomatist for thirty years     a medical document  medical men are as a class very much too busy to take stock of singular situations or dramatic events  thus it happens that the ablest chronicler of their experiences in our literature was a lawyer a life spent in watching over deathbedsor over birthbeds which are infinitely more tryingtakes something from a mans sense of proportion as constant strong waters might corrupt his palate  the overstimulated nerve ceases to respond  ask the surgeon for his best experiences and he may reply that he has seen little that is remarkable or break away into the technical  but catch him some night when the fire has spurted up and his pipe is reeking with a few of his brother practitioners for company and an artful question or allusion to set him going  then you will get some raw green facts new plucked from the tree of life  it is after one of the quarterly dinners of the midland branch of the british medical association  twenty coffee cups a dozer liqueur glasses and a solid bank of blue smoke which swirls slowly along the high gilded ceiling gives a hint of a successful gathering  but the members have shredded off to their homes  the line of heavy bulgepocketed overcoats and of stethoscopebearing top hats is gone from the hotel corridor  round the fire in the sittingroom three medicos are still lingering however all smoking and arguing while a fourth who is a mere layman and young at that sits back at the table under cover of an open journal he is writing furiously with a stylographic pen asking a question in an innocent voice from time to time and so flickering up the conversation whenever it shows a tendency to wane  the three men are all of that staid middle age which begins early and lasts late in the profession  they are none of them famous yet each is of good repute and a fair type of his particular branch  the portly

he always promises himself that he will get level some day when a millionaire with a chronic complaintthe ideal combinationshall seek his services  the third sitting on the right with his dress shoes shining on the top of the fender is hargrave the rising surgeon  his face has none of the broad humanity of theodore fosters the eye is stern and critical the mouth straight and severe but there is strength and decision in every line of it and it is nerve rather than sympathy which the patient demands when he is bad enough to come to hargraves door  he calls himself a jawman a mere jawman as he modestly puts it but in point of fact he is too young and too poor to confine himself to a specialty and there is nothing surgical which hargrave has not the skill and the audacity to do  before after and during murmurs the general practitioner in answer to some interpolation of the outsiders  i assure you manson one sees all sorts of evanescent forms of madness  ah puerperal throws in the other knocking the curved grey ash from his cigar  but you had some case in your mind foster  well there was only one last week which was new to me  i had been engaged by some people of the name of silcoe  when the trouble came round i went myself for they would not hear of an assistant  the husband who was a policeman was sitting at the head of the bed on the further side  this wont do said i  oh yes doctor it must do said she  its quite irregular and he must go said i  its that or nothing said she  i wont open my mouth or stir a finger the whole night said he  so it ended by my allowing him to remain and there he sat for eight hours on end  she was very good over the matter but every now and again he would fetch a hollow groan and i noticed that he held his right hand just under the sheet all the time where i had no doubt that it was clasped by her left  when it was all happily over i looked at him and his face was the colour of this cigar ash and his head had dropped on to the edge of the pillow  of course i thought he had fainted with emotion and i was just telling myself what i thought of myself for having been such a fool as to let him stay there when suddenly i saw that the sheet over his hand was all soaked with blood i whisked it down and  there was the fellows wrist half cut through  the woman had one bracelet of a policemans handcuff over her left wrist and the other round his right one  when she had been in pain she had twisted with all her strength and the iron had fairly eaten into the bone of the mans arm  aye doctor said she when she saw i had noticed it  hes got to take his share as well as me turn and turn said she  dont you find it a very wearing branch of the profession asks foster after a pause  my dear fellow it was the fear of it that drove me into lunacy work  aye and it has driven men into asylums who never found their way on to the medical staff  i was a very shy fellow myself as a student and i know what it means  no joke that in general practice says the alienist  well you hear men talk about it as though it were but i tell you its much nearer tragedy  take some poor raw young fellow who has just put up his plate in a strange town  he has found it a trial all his life perhaps to talk to a woman about lawn tennis and church services  when a young man is shy he is shyer than any girl  then down comes an anxious mother and consults him upon the most intimate family matters  i shall never go to that doctor again says she afterwards  his manner is so stiff and unsympathetic unsympathetic why the poor lad was struck dumb and paralysed  i have known general practitioners who were so shy that they could not bring themselves to ask the way in the street  fancy what sensitive men like that must endure before they get broken in to medical practice  and then they know that nothing is so catching as shyness and that if they do not keep a face of stone their patient will be covered with confusion and so they keep their face of stone and earn the reputation perhaps of having a heart to correspond  i suppose nothing would shake your nerve manson  well when a man lives year in year out among a thousand lunatics with a fair sprinkling of homicidals among them ones nerves either get set or shattered  mine are all right so far  i was frightened once says the surgeon  it was when i was doing dispensary work  one night i had a call from some very poor people and gathered from the few words they said that their child was ill when i entered the room i saw a small cradle in the corner  raising the lamp i walked over and putting back the curtains i looked down at the baby  i tell you it was sheer providence that i didnt drop that lamp and set the whole place alight  the head on the pillow turned and i saw a face looking up at me which seemed to me to have more malignancy and wickedness than ever i had dreamed of in a nightmare it was the flush of red over the cheekbones and the brooding eyes full of loathing of me and of everything else that impressed me  ill never forget my start as instead of the chubby face of an infant my eyes fell upon this creature  i took the mother into the next room what is it i asked  a girl of sixteen said she and then throwing up her arms oh pray god she may be taken  the poor thing though she spent her life in this little cradle had great long thin limbs which she curled up under her  i lost sight of the case and dont know what became of it but ill never forget the look in her eyes  thats creepy says dr foster  but i think one of my experiences would run it close  shortly after i put up my plate i had a visit from a little hunchbacked woman who wished me to come and attend to her sister in her trouble  when i reached the house which was a very poor one i found two other little hunchedbacked women exactly like the first waiting for me in the sittingroom  not one of them said a word but my companion took the lamp and walked upstairs with her two sisters behind her and me bringing up the rear  i can see those three queer shadows cast by the lamp upon the wall as clearly as i can see that tobacco pouch  in the room above was the fourth sister a remarkably beautiful girl in evident need of my assistance  there was no wedding ring upon her finger  the three deformed sisters seated themselves round the room like so many graven images and all night not one of them opened her mouth  im not romancing hargrave this is absolute fact  in the early morning a fearful thunderstorm broke out one of the most violent i have ever known  the little garret burned blue with the lightning and thunder roared and rattled as if it were on the very roof of the house  it wasnt much of a lamp i had and it was a queer thing when a spurt of lightning came to see those three twisted figures sitting round the walls or to have the voice of my patient drowned by the booming of the thunder  by jove  i dont mind telling you that there was a time when i nearly bolted from the room all came right in the end but i never heard the true story of the unfortunate beauty and her three crippled sisters  thats the worst of these medical stories sighs the outsider  they never seem to have an end  when a man is up to his neck in practice my boy he has no time to gratify his private curiosity  things shoot across him and he gets a glimpse of them only to recall them perhaps at some quiet moment like this  but ive always felt manson that your line had as much of the terrible in it as any other  more groans the alienist  a disease of the body is bad enough but this seems to be a disease of the soul  is it not a shocking thinga thing to drive a reasoning man into absolute materialismto think that you may have a fine noble fellow with every divine instinct and that some little vascular change the dropping we will say of a minute spicule of bone from the inner table of his skull on to the surface of his brain may have the effect of changing him to a filthy and pitiable creature with every low and debasing tendency  what a satire an asylum is upon the majesty of man and no less upon the ethereal nature of the soul  faith and hope murmurs the general practitioner  i have no faith not much hope and all the charity i can afford says the surgeon  when theology squares itself with the facts of life ill read it up  you were talking about cases says the outsider jerking the ink down into his stylographic pen  well take a common complaint which kills many thousands every year like g p for instance  whats g p  general practitioner suggests the surgeon with a grin  the british public will have to know what g p  is says the alienist gravely  its increasing by leaps and bounds and it has the distinction of being absolutely incurable  general paralysis is its full title and i tell you it promises to be a perfect scourge  heres a fairly typical case now which i saw last monday week  a young farmer a splendid fellow surprised his fellows by taking a very rosy view of things at a time when the whole countryside was grumbling  he was going to give up wheat give up arable land too if it didnt pay plant two thousand acres of rhododendrons and get a monopoly of the supply for covent gardenthere was no end to his schemes all sane enough but just a bit inflated  i called at the farm not to see him but on an altogether different matter  something about the mans way of talking struck me and i watched him narrowly  his lip had a trick of quivering his words slurred themselves together and so did his handwriting when he had occasion to draw up a small agreement  a closer inspection showed me that one of his pupils was ever so little larger than the other  as i left the house his wife came after me isnt it splendid to see job looking so well doctor said she hes that full of energy he can hardly keep himself quiet  i did not say anything for i had not the heart but i knew that the fellow was as much condemned to death as though he were lying in the cell at newgate it was a characteristic case of incipient g p  good heavens cries the outsider  my own lips tremble  i often slur my words  i believe ive got it myself  three little chuckles come from the front of the fire  theres the danger of a little medical knowledge to the layman  a great authority has said that every first years student is suffering in silent agony from four diseases remarks the surgeon one is heart disease of course another is cancer of the parotid  i forget the two other  where does the parotid come in  oh its the last wisdom tooth coming through  and what would be the end of that young farmer asks the outsider  paresis of all the muscles ending in fits coma and death  it may be a few months it may be a year or two  he was a very strong young man and would take some killing  bytheway says the alienist did i ever tell you about the first certificate i signed  i came as near ruin then as a man could go  what was it then  i was in practice at the time  one morning a mrs cooper called upon me and informed me that her husband had shown signs of delusions lately  they took the form of imagining that he had been in the army and had distinguished himself very much  as a matter of fact he was a lawyer and had never been out of england  mrs cooper was of opinion that if i were to call it might alarm him so it was agreed between us that she should send him up in the evening on some pretext to my consultingroom which would give me the opportunity of having a chat with him and if i were convinced of his insanity of signing his certificate  another doctor had already signed so that it only needed my concurrence to have him placed under treatment  well mr cooper arrived in the evening about half an hour before i had expected him and consulted me as to some malarious symptoms from which he said that he suffered  according to his account he had just returned from the abyssinian campaign and had been one of the first of the british forces to enter magdala  no delusion could possibly be more marked for he would talk of little else so i filled in the papers without the slightest hesitation  when his wife arrived after he had left i put some questions to her to complete the form  what is his age i asked  fifty said she  fifty i cried  why the man i examined could not have been more than thirty  and so it came out that the real mr cooper had never called upon me at all but that by one of those coincidences which take a mans breath away another cooper who really was a very distinguished young officer of artillery had come in to consult me  my pen was wet to sign the paper when i discovered it says dr manson mopping his forehead  we were talking about nerve just now observes the surgeon  just after my qualifying i served in the navy for a time as i think you know  i was on the flagship on the west african station and i remember a singular example of nerve which came to my notice at that time  one of our small gunboats had gone up the calabar river and while there the surgeon died of coast fever  on the same day a mans leg was broken by a spar falling upon it and it became quite obvious that it must be taken off above the knee if his life was to be saved the young lieutenant who was in charge of the craft searched among the dead doctors effects and laid his hands upon some chloroform a hipjoint knife and a volume of greys anatomy  he had the man laid by the steward upon the cabin table and with a picture of a cross section of the thigh in front of him he began to take off the limb every now and then referring to the diagram he would say  stand by with the lashings steward  theres blood on the chart about here then he would jab with his knife until he cut the artery and he and his assistant would tie it up before they went any further  in this way they gradually whittled the leg off and upon my word they made a very excellent job of it  the man is hopping about the portsmouth hard at this day  its no joke when the doctor of one of these isolated gunboats himself falls ill continues the surgeon after a pause  you might think it easy for him to prescribe for himself but this fever knocks you down like a club and you havent strength left to brush a mosquito off your face  i had a touch of it at lagos and i know what i am telling you but there was a chum of mine who really had a curious experience  the whole crew gave him up and as they had never had a funeral aboard the ship they began rehearsing the forms so as to be ready  they thought that he was unconscious but he swears he could hear every word that passed  corpse comin up the latchway cried the cockney sergeant of marines  present harms  he was so amused and so indignant too that he just made up his mind that he wouldnt be carried through that hatchway and he wasnt either  theres no need for fiction in medicine remarks foster for the facts will always beat anything you can fancy  but it has seemed to me sometimes that a curious paper might be read at some of these meetings about the uses of medicine in popular fiction  how  well of what the folk die of and what diseases are made most use of in novels  some are worn to pieces and others which are equally common in real life are never mentioned  typhoid is fairly frequent but scarlet fever is unknown  heart disease is common but then heart disease as we know it is usually the sequel of some foregoing disease of which we never hear anything in the romance  then there is the mysterious malady called brain fever which always attacks the heroine after a crisis but which is unknown under that name to the text books  people when they are overexcited in novels fall down in a fit  in a fairly large experience i have never known anyone do so in real life  the small complaints simply dont exist  nobody ever gets shingles or quinsy or mumps in a novel  all the diseases too belong to the upper part of the body  the novelist never strikes below the belt  ill tell you what foster says the alienist there is a side of life which is too medical for the general public and too romantic for the professional journals but which contains some of the richest human materials that a man could study  its not a pleasant side i am afraid but if it is good enough for providence to create it is good enough for us to try and understand  it would deal with strange outbursts of savagery and vice in the lives of the best men curious momentary weaknesses in the record of the sweetest women known but to one or two and inconceivable to the world around  it would deal too with the singular phenomena of waxing and of waning manhood and would throw a light upon those actions which have cut short many an honoured career and sent a man to a prison when he should have been hurried to a consultingroom  of all evils that may come upon the sons of men god shield us principally from that one  i had a case some little time ago which was out of the ordinary says the surgeon  theres a famous beauty in london societyi mention no nameswho used to be remarkable a few seasons ago for the very low dresses which she would wear  she had the whitest of skins and most beautiful of shoulders so it was no wonder  then gradually the frilling at her neck lapped upwards and upwards until last year she astonished everyone by wearing quite a high collar at a time when it was completely out of fashion  well one day this very woman was shown into my consultingroom  when the footman was gone she suddenly tore off the upper part of her dress  for gods sake do something for me she cried  then i saw what the trouble was  a rodent ulcer was eating its way upwards coiling on in its serpiginous fashion until the end of it was flush with her collar  the red streak of its trail was lost below the line of her bust  year by year it had ascended and she had heightened her dress to hide it until now it was about to invade her face  she had been too proud to confess her trouble even to a medical man  and did you stop it  well with zinc chloride i did what i could  but it may break out again  she was one of those beautiful whiteandpink creatures who are rotten with struma  you may patch but you cant mend  dear dear dear cries the general practitioner with that kindly softening of the eyes which had endeared him to so many thousands  i suppose we mustnt think ourselves wiser than providence but there are times when one feels that something is wrong in the scheme of things ive seen some sad things in my life  did i ever tell you that case where nature divorced a most loving couple  he was a fine young fellow an athlete and a gentleman but he overdid athletics  you know how the force that controls us gives us a little tweak to remind us when we get off the beaten track  it may be a pinch on the great toe if we drink too much and work too little  or it may be a tug on our nerves if we dissipate energy too much  with the athlete of course its the heart or the lungs  he had bad phthisis and was sent to davos  well as luck would have it she developed rheumatic fever which left her heart very much affected  now do you see the dreadful dilemma in which those poor people found themselves  when he came below four thousand feet or so his symptoms became terrible  she could come up about twentyfive hundred and then her heart reached its limit  they had several interviews half way down the valley which left them nearly dead and at last the doctors had to absolutely forbid it  and so for four years they lived within three miles of each other and never met  every morning he would go to a place which overlooked the chalet in which she lived and would wave a great white cloth and she answer from below  they could see each other quite plainly with their field glasses and they might have been in different planets for all their chance of meeting  and one at last died says the outsider  no sir  im sorry not to be able to clinch the story but the man recovered and is now a successful stockbroker in drapers gardens  the woman too is the mother of a considerable family  but what are you doing there  only taking a note or two of your talk  the three medical men laugh as they walk towards their overcoats  why weve done nothing but talk shop says the general practitioner what possible interest can the public take in that     lot no 249  of the dealings of edward bellingham with william monkhouse lee and of the cause of the great terror of abercrombie smith it may be that no absolute and final judgment will ever be delivered  it is true that we have the full and clear narrative of smith himself and such corroboration as he could look for from thomas styles the servant from the reverend plumptree peterson fellow of olds and from such other people as chanced to gain some passing glance at this or that incident in a singular chain of events  yet in the main the story must rest upon smith alone and the most will think that it is more likely that one brain however outwardly sane has some subtle warp in its texture some strange flaw in its workings than that the path of nature has been overstepped in open day in so famed a centre of learning and light as the university of oxford  yet when we think how narrow and how devious this path of nature is how dimly we can trace it for all our lamps of science and how from the darkness which girds it round great and terrible possibilities loom ever shadowly upwards it is a bold and confident man who will put a limit to the strange bypaths into which the human spirit may wander  in a certain wing of what we will call old college in oxford there is a corner turret of an exceeding great age  the heavy arch which spans the open door has bent downwards in the centre under the weight of its years and the grey lichenblotched blocks of stone are bound and knitted together with withes and strands of ivy as though the old mother had set herself to brace them up against wind and weather  from the door a stone stair curves upward spirally passing two landings and terminating in a third one its steps all shapeless and hollowed by the tread of so many generations of the seekers after knowledge  life has flowed like water down this winding stair and waterlike has left these smoothworn grooves behind it  from the longgowned pedantic scholars of plantagenet days down to the young bloods of a later age how full and strong had been that tide of young english life  and what was left now of all those hopes those strivings those fiery energies save here and there in some oldworld churchyard a few scratches upon a stone and perchance a handful of dust in a mouldering coffin  yet here were the silent stair and the grey old wall with bend and saltire and many another heraldic device still to be read upon its surface like grotesque shadows thrown back from the days that had passed  in the month of may in the year 1884 three young men occupied the sets of rooms which opened on to the separate landings of the old stair  each set consisted simply of a sittingroom and of a bedroom while the two corresponding rooms upon the groundfloor were used the one as a coalcellar and the other as the livingroom of the servant or gyp thomas styles whose duty it was to wait upon the three men above him  to right and to left was a line of lecturerooms and of offices so that the dwellers in the old turret enjoyed a certain seclusion which made the chambers popular among the more studious undergraduates  such were the three who occupied them nowabercrombie smith above edward bellingham beneath him and william monkhouse lee upon the lowest storey  it was ten oclock on a bright spring night and abercrombie smith lay back in his armchair his feet upon the fender and his briarroot pipe between his lips  in a similar chair and equally at his ease there lounged on the other side of the fireplace his old school friend jephro hastie  both men were in flannels for they had spent their evening upon the river but apart from their dress no one could look at their hardcut alert faces without seeing that they were openair menmen whose minds and tastes turned naturally to all that was manly and robust  hastie indeed was stroke of his college boat and smith was an even better oar but a coming examination had already cast its shadow over him and held him to his work save for the few hours a week which health demanded  a litter of medical books upon the table with scattered bones models and anatomical plates pointed to the extent as well as the nature of his studies while a couple of singlesticks and a set of boxinggloves above the mantelpiece hinted at the means by which with hasties help he might take his exercise in its most compressed and least distant form  they knew each other very wellso well that they could sit now in that soothing silence which is the very highest development of companionship  have some whisky said abercrombie smith at last between two cloudbursts  scotch in the jug and irish in the bottle  no thanks  im in for the sculls  i dont liquor when im training how about you  im reading hard  i think it best to leave it alone  hastie nodded and they relapsed into a contented silence  bytheway smith asked hastie presently have you made the acquaintance of either of the fellows on your stair yet  just a nod when we pass  nothing more  hum i should be inclined to let it stand at that  i know something of them both  not much but as much as i want  i dont think i should take them to my bosom if i were you  not that theres much amiss with monkhouse lee  meaning the thin one  precisely  he is a gentlemanly little fellow  i dont think there is any vice in him  but then you cant know him without knowing bellingham  meaning the fat one  yes the fat one  and hes a man whom i for one would rather not know  abercrombie smith raised his eyebrows and glanced across at his companion  whats up then he asked  drink  cards  cad  you used not to be censorious  ah you evidently dont know the man or you wouldnt ask  theres something damnable about himsomething reptilian  my gorge always rises at him  i should put him down as a man with secret vicesan evil liver  hes no fool though  they say that he is one  of the best men in his line that they have ever had in the college  medicine or classics  eastern languages  hes a demon at them  chillingworth met him somewhere above the second cataract last long and he told me that he just prattled to the arabs as if he had been born and nursed and weaned among them  he talked coptic to the copts and hebrew to the jews and arabic to the bedouins and they were all ready to kiss the hem of his frockcoat  there are some old hermit johnnies up in those parts who sit on rocks and scowl and spit at the casual stranger  well when they saw this chap bellingham before he had said five words they just lay down on their bellies and wriggled  chillingworth said that he never saw anything like it  bellingham seemed to take it as his right too and strutted about among them and talked down to them like a dutch uncle  pretty good for an undergrad of olds wasnt it  why do you say you cant know lee without knowing bellingham  because bellingham is engaged to his sister eveline  such a bright little girl smith  i know the whole family well  its disgusting to see that brute with her  a toad and a dove thats what they always remind me of  abercrombie smith grinned and knocked his ashes out against the side of the grate  you show every card in your hand old chap said he  what a prejudiced greeneyed evilthinking old man it is  you have really nothing against the fellow except that  well ive known her ever since she was as long as that cherrywood pipe and i dont like to see her taking risks  and it is a risk  he looks beastly  and he has a beastly temper a venomous temper  you remember his row with long norton  no you always forget that i am a freshman  ah it was last winter  of course  well you know the towpath along by the river  there were several fellows going along it bellingham in front when they came on an old marketwoman coming the other way  it had been rainingyou know what those fields are like when it has rainedand the path ran between the river and a great puddle that was nearly as broad  well what does this swine do but keep the path and push the old girl into the mud where she and her marketings came to terrible grief  it was a blackguard thing to do and long norton who is as gentle a fellow as ever stepped told him what he thought of it one word led to another and it ended in norton laying his stick across the fellows shoulders  there was the deuce of a fuss about it and its a treat to see the way in which bellingham looks at norton when they meet now  by jove smith its nearly eleven oclock  no hurry  light your pipe again  not i  im supposed to be in training  here ive been sitting gossiping when i ought to have been safely tucked up  ill borrow your skull if you can share it  williams has had mine for a month  ill take the little bones of your ear too if you are sure you wont need them  thanks very much  never mind a bag i can carry them very well under my arm  goodnight my son and take my tip as to your neighbour  when hastie bearing his anatomical plunder had clattered off down the winding stair abercrombie smith hurled his pipe into the wastepaper basket and drawing his chair nearer to the lamp plunged into a formidable greencovered volume adorned with great colored maps of that strange internal kingdom of which we are the hapless and helpless monarchs  though a freshman at oxford the student was not so in medicine for he had worked for four years at glasgow and at berlin and this coming examination would place him finally as a member of his profession  with his firm mouth broad forehead and clearcut somewhat hardfeatured face he was a man who if he had no brilliant talent was yet so dogged so patient and so strong that he might in the end overtop a more showy genius  a man who can hold his own among scotchmen and north germans is not a man to be easily set back  smith had left a name at glasgow and at berlin and he was bent now upon doing as much at oxford if hard work and devotion could accomplish it  he had sat reading for about an hour and the hands of the noisy carriage clock upon the side table were rapidly closing together upon the twelve when a sudden sound fell upon the students eara sharp rather shrill sound like the hissing intake of a mans breath who gasps under some strong emotion  smith laid down his book and slanted his ear to listen  there was no one on either side or above him so that the interruption came certainly from the neighbour beneaththe same neighbour of whom hastie had given so unsavoury an account  smith knew him only as a flabby palefaced man of silent and studious habits a man whose lamp threw a golden bar from the old turret even after he had extinguished his own  this community in lateness had formed a certain silent bond between them  it was soothing to smith when the hours stole on towards dawning to feel that there was another so close who set as small a value upon his sleep as he did  even now as his thoughts turned towards him smiths feelings were kindly hastie was a good fellow but he was rough strongfibred with no imagination or sympathy  he could not tolerate departures from what he looked upon as the model type of manliness  if a man could not be measured by a publicschool standard then he was beyond the pale with hastie  like so many who are themselves robust he was apt to confuse the constitution with the character to ascribe to want of principle what was really a want of circulation  smith with his stronger mind knew his friends habit and made allowance for it now as his thoughts turned towards the man beneath him  there was no return of the singular sound and smith was about to turn to his work once more when suddenly there broke out in the silence of the night a hoarse cry a positive screamthe call of a man who is moved and shaken beyond all control  smith sprang out of his chair and dropped his book  he was a man of fairly firm fibre but there was something in this sudden uncontrollable shriek of horror which chilled his blood and pringled in his skin  coming in such a place and at such an hour it brought a thousand fantastic possibilities into his head should he rush down or was it better to wait  he had all the national hatred of making a scene and he knew so little of his neighbour that he would not lightly intrude upon his affairs  for a moment he stood in doubt and even as he balanced the matter there was a quick rattle of footsteps upon the stairs and young monkhouse lee half dressed and as white as ashes burst into his room  come down he gasped  bellinghams ill  abercrombie smith followed him closely down stairs into the sittingroom which was beneath his own and intent as he was upon the matter in hand he could not but take an amazed glance around him as he crossed the threshold  it was such a chamber as he had never seen beforea museum rather than a study  walls and ceiling were thickly covered with a thousand strange relics from egypt and the east  tall angular figures bearing burdens or weapons stalked in an uncouth frieze round the apartments  above were bullheaded storkheaded catheaded owlheaded statues with vipercrowned almondeyed monarchs and strange beetlelike deities cut out of the blue egyptian lapis lazuli  horus and isis and osiris peeped down from every niche and shelf while across the ceiling a true son of old nile a great hangingjawed crocodile was slung in a double noose  in the centre of this singular chamber was a large square table littered with papers bottles and the dried leaves of some graceful palmlike plant  these varied objects had all been heaped together in order to make room for a mummy case which had been conveyed from the wall as was evident from the gap there and laid across the front of the table  the mummy itself a horrid black withered thing like a charred head on a gnarled bush was lying half out of the case with its clawlike hand and bony forearm resting upon the table  propped up against the sarcophagus was an old yellow scroll of papyrus and in front of it in a wooden armchair sat the owner of the room his head thrown back his widelyopened eyes directed in a horrified stare to the crocodile above him and his blue thick lips puffing loudly with every expiration  my god hes dying cried monkhouse lee distractedly  he was a slim handsome young fellow oliveskinned and darkeyed of a spanish rather than of an english type with a celtic intensity of manner which contrasted with the saxon phlegm of abercombie smith  only a faint i think said the medical student  just give me a hand with him  you take his feet  now on to the sofa  can you kick all those little wooden devils off  what a litter it is  now he will be all right if we undo his collar and give him some water  what has he been up to at all  i dont know  i heard him cry out  i ran up  i know him pretty well you know  it is very good of you to come down  his heart is going like a pair of castanets said smith laying his hand on the breast of the unconscious man  he seems to me to be frightened all to pieces  chuck the water over him  what a face he has got on him  it was indeed a strange and most repellent face for colour and outline were equally unnatural  it was white not with the ordinary pallor of fear but with an absolutely bloodless white like the under side of a sole  he was very fat but gave the impression of having at some time been considerably fatter for his skin hung loosely in creases and folds and was shot with a meshwork of wrinkles  short stubbly brown hair bristled up from his scalp with a pair of thick wrinkled ears protruding on either side  his light grey eyes were still open the pupils dilated and the balls projecting in a fixed and horrid stare it seemed to smith as he looked down upon him that he had never seen natures danger signals flying so plainly upon a mans countenance and his thoughts turned more seriously to the warning which hastie had given him an hour before  what the deuce can have frightened him so he asked  its the mummy  the mummy  how then  i dont know  its beastly and morbid  i wish he would drop it its the second fright he has given me  it was the same last winter i found him just like this with that horrid thing in front of him  what does he want with the mummy then  oh hes a crank you know  its his hobby  he knows more about these things than any man in england  but i wish he wouldnt  ah hes beginning to come to  a faint tinge of colour had begun to steal back into bellinghams ghastly cheeks and his eyelids shivered like a sail after a calm  he clasped and unclasped his hands drew a long thin breath between his teeth and suddenly jerking up his head threw a glance of recognition around him  as his eyes fell upon the mummy he sprang off the sofa seized the roll of papyrus thrust it into a drawer turned the key and then staggered back on to the sofa  whats up he asked  what do you chaps want  youve been shrieking out and making no end of a fuss said monkhouse lee  if our neighbour here from above hadnt come down im sure i dont know what i should have done with you  ah its abercrombie smith said bellingham glancing up at him how very good of you to come in  what a fool i am  oh my god what a fool i am  he sunk his head on to his hands and burst into peal after peal of hysterical laughter  look here  drop it cried smith shaking him roughly by the shoulder  your nerves are all in a jangle  you must drop these little midnight games with mummies or youll be going off your chump  youre all on wires now  i wonder said bellingham whether you would be as cool as i am if you had seen  what then  oh nothing  i meant that i wonder if you could sit up at night with a mummy without trying your nerves  i have no doubt that you are quite right  i dare say that i have been taking it out of myself too much lately  but i am all right now  please dont go though  just wait for a few minutes until i am quite myself  the room is very close remarked lee throwing open the window and letting in the cool night air  its balsamic resin said bellingham  he lifted up one of the dried palmate leaves from the table and frizzled it over the chimney of the lamp  it broke away into heavy smoke wreaths and a pungent biting odour filled the chamber  its the sacred plantthe plant of the priests he remarked  do you know anything of eastern languages smith  nothing at all  not a word  the answer seemed to lift a weight from the egyptologists mind  bytheway he continued how long was it from the time that you ran down until i came to my senses  not long  some four or five minutes  i thought it could not be very long said he drawing a long breath but what a strange thing unconsciousness is  there is no measurement to it  i could not tell from my own sensations if it were seconds or weeks  now that gentleman on the table was packed up in the days of the eleventh dynasty some forty centuries ago and yet if he could find his tongue he would tell us that this lapse of time has been but a closing of the eyes and a reopening of them  he is a singularly fine mummy smith  smith stepped over to the table and looked down with a professional eye at the black and twisted form in front of him  the features though horribly discoloured were perfect and two little nutlike eyes still lurked in the depths of the black hollow sockets  the blotched skin was drawn tightly from bone to bone and a tangled wrap of black coarse hair fell over the ears  two thin teeth like those of a rat overlay the shrivelled lower lip  in its crouching position with bent joints and craned head there was a suggestion of energy about the horrid thing which made smiths gorge rise  the gaunt ribs with their parchmentlike covering were exposed and the sunken leadenhued abdomen with the long slit where the embalmer had left his mark but the lower limbs were wrapt round with coarse yellow bandages  a number of little clovelike pieces of myrrh and of cassia were sprinkled over the body and lay scattered on the inside of the case  i dont know his name said bellingham passing his hand over the shrivelled head  you see the outer sarcophagus with the inscriptions is missing  lot 249 is all the title he has now  you see it printed on his case  that was his number in the auction at which i picked him up  he has been a very pretty sort of fellow in his day remarked abercrombie smith  he has been a giant  his mummy is six feet seven in length and that would be a giant over there for they were never a very robust race feel these great knotted bones too  he would be a nasty fellow to tackle  perhaps these very hands helped to build the stones into the pyramids suggested monkhouse lee looking down with disgust in his eyes at the crooked unclean talons  no fear  this fellow has been pickled in natron and looked after in the most approved style  they did not serve hodsmen in that fashion salt or bitumen was enough for them  it has been calculated that this sort of thing cost about seven hundred and thirty pounds in our money our friend was a noble at the least  what do you make of that small inscription near his feet smith  i told you that i know no eastern tongue  ah so you did  it is the name of the embalmer i take it  a very conscientious worker he must have been  i wonder how many modern works will survive four thousand years  he kept on speaking lightly and rapidly but it was evident to abercrombie smith that he was still palpitating with fear  his hands shook his lower lip trembled and look where he would his eye always came sliding round to his gruesome companion  through all his fear however there was a suspicion of triumph in his tone and manner  his eye shone and his footstep as he paced the room was brisk and jaunty  he gave the impression of a man who has gone through an ordeal the marks of which he still bears upon him but which has helped him to his end  youre not going yet he cried as smith rose from the sofa  at the prospect of solitude his fears seemed to crowd back upon him and he stretched out a hand to detain him  yes i must go  i have my work to do  you are all right now  i think that with your nervous system you should take up some less morbid study  oh i am not nervous as a rule and i have unwrapped mummies before  you fainted last time observed monkhouse lee  ah yes so i did  well i must have a nerve tonic or a course of electricity  you are not going lee  ill do whatever you wish ned  then ill come down with you and have a shakedown on your sofa goodnight smith  i am so sorry to have disturbed you with my foolishness  they shook hands and as the medical student stumbled up the spiral and irregular stair he heard a key turn in a door and the steps of his two new acquaintances as they descended to the lower floor   in this strange way began the acquaintance between edward bellingham and abercrombie smith an acquaintance which the latter at least had no desire to push further  bellingham however appeared to have taken a fancy to his roughspoken neighbour and made his advances in such a way that he could hardly be repulsed without absolute brutality  twice he called to thank smith for his assistance and many times afterwards he looked in with books papers and such other civilities as two bachelor neighbours can offer each other  he was as smith soon found a man of wide reading with catholic tastes and an extraordinary memory  his manner too was so pleasing and suave that one came after a time to overlook his repellent appearance  for a jaded and wearied man he was no unpleasant companion and smith found himself after a time looking forward to his visits and even returning them  clever as he undoubtedly was however the medical student seemed to detect a dash of insanity in the man  he broke out at times into a high inflated style of talk which was in contrast with the simplicity of his life  it is a wonderful thing he cried to feel that one can command powers of good and of evila ministering angel or a demon of vengeance  and again of monkhouse lee he saidlee is a good fellow an honest fellow but he is without strength or ambition  he would not make a fit partner for a man with a great enterprise  he would not make a fit partner for me  at such hints and innuendoes stolid smith puffing solemnly at his pipe would simply raise his eyebrows and shake his head with little interjections of medical wisdom as to earlier hours and fresher air  one habit bellingham had developed of late which smith knew to be a frequent herald of a weakening mind  he appeared to be forever talking to himself  at late hours of the night when there could be no visitor with him smith could still hear his voice beneath him in a low muffled monologue sunk almost to a whisper and yet very audible in the silence  this solitary babbling annoyed and distracted the student so that he spoke more than once to his neighbour about it bellingham however flushed up at the charge and denied curtly that he had uttered a sound indeed he showed more annoyance over the matter than the occasion seemed to demand  had abercrombie smith had any doubt as to his own ears he had not to go far to find corroboration  tom styles the little wrinkled manservant who had attended to the wants of the lodgers in the turret for a longer time than any mans memory could carry him was sorely put to it over the same matter  if you please sir said he as he tidied down the top chamber one morning do you think mr bellingham is all right sir  all right styles  yes sir  right in his head sir  why should he not be then  well i dont know sir  his habits has changed of late  hes not the same man he used to be though i make free to say that he was never quite one of my gentlemen like mr hastie or yourself sir  hes took to talkin to himself something awful  i wonder it dont disturb you i dont know what to make of him sir  i dont know what business it is of yours styles  well i takes an interest mr smith  it may be forward of me but i cant help it  i feel sometimes as if i was mother and father to my young gentlemen  it all falls on me when things go wrong and the relations come  but mr bellingham sir  i want to know what it is that walks about his room sometimes when hes out and when the doors locked on the outside  eh youre talking nonsense styles  maybe so sir but i heard it moren once with my own ears  rubbish styles  very good sir  youll ring the bell if you want me  abercrombie smith gave little heed to the gossip of the old manservant but a small incident occurred a few days later which left an unpleasant effect upon his mind and brought the words of styles forcibly to his memory  bellingham had come up to see him late one night and was entertaining him with an interesting account of the rock tombs of beni hassan in upper egypt when smith whose hearing was remarkably acute distinctly heard the sound of a door opening on the landing below  theres some fellow gone in or out of your room he remarked  bellingham sprang up and stood helpless for a moment with the expression of a man who is half incredulous and half afraid  i surely locked it  i am almost positive that i locked it he stammered  no one could have opened it  why i hear someone coming up the steps now said smith  bellingham rushed out through the door slammed it loudly behind him and hurried down the stairs  about halfway down smith heard him stop and thought he caught the sound of whispering  a moment later the door beneath him shut a key creaked in a lock and bellingham with beads of moisture upon his pale face ascended the stairs once more and reentered the room  its all right he said throwing himself down in a chair  it was that fool of a dog  he had pushed the door open  i dont know how i came to forget to lock it  i didnt know you kept a dog said smith looking very thoughtfully at the disturbed face of his companion  yes i havent had him long  i must get rid of him  hes a great nuisance  he must be if you find it so hard to shut him up  i should have thought that shutting the door would have been enough without locking it  i want to prevent old styles from letting him out  hes of some value you know and it would be awkward to lose him  i am a bit of a dogfancier myself said smith still gazing hard at his companion from the corner of his eyes  perhaps youll let me have a look at it  certainly  but i am afraid it cannot be tonight i have an appointment  is that clock right  then i am a quarter of an hour late already  youll excuse me i am sure  he picked up his cap and hurried from the room  in spite of his appointment smith heard him reenter his own chamber and lock his door upon the inside  this interview left a disagreeable impression upon the medical students mind  bellingham had lied to him and lied so clumsily that it looked as if he had desperate reasons for concealing the truth smith knew that his neighbour had no dog  he knew also that the step which he had heard upon the stairs was not the step of an animal  but if it were not then what could it be  there was old styless statement about the something which used to pace the room at times when the owner was absent  could it be a woman  smith rather inclined to the view  if so it would mean disgrace and expulsion to bellingham if it were discovered by the authorities so that his anxiety and falsehoods might be accounted for  and yet it was inconceivable that an undergraduate could keep a woman in his rooms without being instantly detected  be the explanation what it might there was something ugly about it and smith determined as he turned to his books to discourage all further attempts at intimacy on the part of his softspoken and illfavoured neighbour  but his work was destined to interruption that night  he had hardly caught tip the broken threads when a firm heavy footfall came three steps at a time from below and hastie in blazer and flannels burst into the room  still at it said he plumping down into his wonted armchair  what a chap you are to stew  i believe an earthquake might come and knock oxford into a cocked hat and you would sit perfectly placid with your books among the rains  however i wont bore you long  three whiffs of baccy and i am off  whats the news then asked smith cramming a plug of birdseye into his briar with his forefinger  nothing very much  wilson made 70 for the freshmen against the eleven  they say that they will play him instead of buddicomb for buddicomb is clean off colour  he used to be able to bowl a little but its nothing but halfvollies and long hops now  medium right suggested smith with the intense gravity which comes upon a varsity man when he speaks of athletics  inclining to fast with a work from leg  comes with the arm about three inches or so  he used to be nasty on a wet wicket  oh bytheway have you heard about long norton  whats that  hes been attacked  attacked  yes just as he was turning out of the high street and within a hundred yards of the gate of olds  but who  ah thats the rub  if you said what you would be more grammatical  norton swears that it was not human and indeed from the scratches on his throat i should be inclined to agree with him  what then  have we come down to spooks  abercrombie smith puffed his scientific contempt  well no i dont think that is quite the idea either  i am inclined to think that if any showman has lost a great ape lately and the brute is in these parts a jury would find a true bill against it  norton passes that way every night you know about the same hour  theres a tree that hangs low over the paththe big elm from rainys garden norton thinks the thing dropped on him out of the tree  anyhow he was nearly strangled by two arms which he says were as strong and as thin as steel bands  he saw nothing only those beastly arms that tightened and tightened on him  he yelled his head nearly off and a couple of chaps came running and the thing went over the wall like a cat  he never got a fair sight of it the whole time  it gave norton a shake up i can tell you  i tell him it has been as good as a change at the seaside for him  a garrotter most likely said smith  very possibly  norton says not but we dont mind what he says  the garrotter had long nails and was pretty smart at swinging himself over walls  bytheway your beautiful neighbour would be pleased if he heard about it  he had a grudge against norton and hes not a man from what i know of him to forget his little debts  but hallo old chap what have you got in your noddle  nothing smith answered curtly  he had started in his chair and the look had flashed over his face which comes upon a man who is struck suddenly by some unpleasant idea  you looked as if something i had said had taken you on the raw bytheway you have made the acquaintance of master b since i looked in last have you not  young monkhouse lee told me something to that effect  yes i know him slightly  he has been up here once or twice  well youre big enough and ugly enough to take care of yourself hes not what i should call exactly a healthy sort of johnny though no doubt hes very clever and all that  but youll soon find out for yourself  lee is all right hes a very decent little fellow  well so long old chap  i row mullins for the vicechancellors pot on wednesday week so mind you come down in case i dont see you before  bovine smith laid down his pipe and turned stolidly to his books once more  but with all the will in the world he found it very hard to keep his mind upon his work  it would slip away to brood upon the man beneath him and upon the little mystery which hung round his chambers then his thoughts turned to this singular attack of which hastie had spoken and to the grudge which bellingham was said to owe the object of it  the two ideas would persist in rising together in his mind as though there were some close and intimate connection between them  and yet the suspicion was so dim and vague that it could not be put down in words  confound the chap cried smith as he shied his book on pathology across the room  he has spoiled my nights reading and thats reason enough if there were no other why i should steer clear of him in the future  for ten days the medical student confined himself so closely to his studies that he neither saw nor heard anything of either of the men beneath him  at the hours when bellingham had been accustomed to visit him he took care to sport his oak and though he more than once heard a knocking at his outer door he resolutely refused to answer it  one afternoon however he was descending the stairs when just as he was passing it bellinghams door flew open and young monkhouse lee came out with his eyes sparkling and a dark flush of anger upon his olive cheeks  close at his heels followed bellingham his fat unhealthy face all quivering with malignant passion  you fool he hissed  youll  be  sorry  very likely cried the other  mind what i say  its off  i wont hear of it  youve promised anyhow  oh ill keep that  i wont speak  but id rather little eva was in her grave  once for all its off  shell do what i say  we dont want to see you again  so much smith could not avoid hearing but he hurried on for he had no wish to be involved in their dispute  there had been a serious breach between them that was clear enough and lee was going to cause the engagement with his sister to be broken off  smith thought of hasties comparison of the toad and the dove and was glad to think that the matter was at an end  bellinghams face when he was in a passion was not pleasant to look upon  he was not a man to whom an innocent girl could be trusted for life  as he walked smith wondered languidly what could have caused the quarrel and what the promise might be which bellingham had been so anxious that monkhouse lee should keep  it was the day of the sculling match between hastie and mullins and a stream of men were making their way down to the banks of the isis  a may sun was shining brightly and the yellow path was barred with the black shadows of the tall elmtrees  on either side the grey colleges lay back from the road the hoary old mothers of minds looking out from their high mullioned windows at the tide of young life which swept so merrily past them  blackclad tutors prim officials pale reading men brownfaced strawhatted young athletes in white sweaters or manycoloured blazers all were hurrying towards the blue winding river which curves through the oxford meadows  abercrombie smith with the intuition of an old oarsman chose his position at the point where he knew that the struggle if there were a struggle would come  far off he heard the hum which announced the start the gathering roar of the approach the thunder of running feet and the shouts of the men in the boats beneath him  a spray of halfclad deepbreathing runners shot past him and craning over their shoulders he saw hastie pulling a steady thirtysix while his opponent with a jerky forty was a good boats length behind him smith gave a cheer for his friend and pulling out his watch was starting off again for his chambers when he felt a touch upon his shoulder and found that young monkhouse lee was beside him  i saw you there he said in a timid deprecating way  i wanted to speak to you if you could spare me a halfhour  this cottage is mine i share it with harrington of kings  come in and have a cup of tea  i must be back presently said smith  i am hard on the grind at present  but ill come in for a few minutes with pleasure  i wouldnt have come out only hastie is a friend of mine  so he is of mine  hasnt he a beautiful style  mullins wasnt in it but come into the cottage  its a little den of a place but it is pleasant to work in during the summer months  it was a small square white building with green doors and shutters and a rustic trelliswork porch standing back some fifty yards from the rivers bank  inside the main room was roughly fitted up as a studydeal table unpainted shelves with books and a few cheap oleographs upon the wall  a kettle sang upon a spiritstove and there were tea things upon a tray on the table  try that chair and have a cigarette said lee  let me pour you out a cup of tea  its so good of you to come in for i know that your time is a good deal taken up  i wanted to say to you that if i were you i should change my rooms at once  eh  smith sat staring with a lighted match in one hand and his unlit cigarette in the other  yes it must seem very extraordinary and the worst of it is that i cannot give my reasons for i am under a solemn promisea very solemn promise  but i may go so far as to say that i dont think bellingham is a very safe man to live near  i intend to camp out here as much as i can for a time  not safe  what do you mean  ah thats what i mustnt say  but do take my advice and move your rooms  we had a grand row today  you must have heard us for you came down the stairs  i saw that you had fallen out  hes a horrible chap smith  that is the only word for him  i have had doubts about him ever since that night when he faintedyou remember when you came down  i taxed him today and he told me things that made my hair rise and wanted me to stand in with him  im not straitlaced but i am a clergymans son you know and i think there are some things which are quite beyond the pale  i only thank god that i found him out before it was too late for he was to have married into my family  this is all very fine lee said abercrombie smith curtly  but either you are saying a great deal too much or a great deal too little  i give you a warning  if there is real reason for warning no promise can bind you  if i see a rascal about to blow a place up with dynamite no pledge will stand in my way of preventing him  ah but i cannot prevent him and i can do nothing but warn you  without saying what you warn me against  against bellingham  but that is childish  why should i fear him or any man  i cant tell you  i can only entreat you to change your rooms  you are in danger where you are  i dont even say that bellingham would wish to injure you  but it might happen for he is a dangerous neighbour just now  perhaps i know more than you think said smith looking keenly at the young mans boyish earnest face  suppose i tell you that some one else shares bellinghams rooms  monkhouse lee sprang from his chair in uncontrollable excitement  you know then he gasped  a woman  lee dropped back again with a groan  my lips are sealed he said  i must not speak  well anyhow said smith rising it is not likely that i should allow myself to be frightened out of rooms which suit me very nicely it would be a little too feeble for me to move out all my goods and chattels because you say that bellingham might in some unexplained way do me an injury  i think that ill just take my chance and stay where i am and as i see that its nearly five oclock i must ask you to excuse me  he bade the young student adieu in a few curt words and made his way homeward through the sweet spring evening feeling halfruffled halfamused as any other strong unimaginative man might who has been menaced by a vague and shadowy danger  there was one little indulgence which abercrombie smith always allowed himself however closely his work might press upon him  twice a week on the tuesday and the friday it was his invariable custom to walk over to farlingford the residence of dr plumptree peterson situated about a mile and a half out of oxford  peterson had been a close friend of smiths elder brother francis and as he was a bachelor fairly welltodo with a good cellar and a better library his house was a pleasant goal for a man who was in need of a brisk walk  twice a week then the medical student would swing out there along the dark country roads and spend a pleasant hour in petersons comfortable study discussing over a glass of old port the gossip of the varsity or the latest developments of medicine or of surgery  on the day which followed his interview with monkhouse lee smith shut up his books at a quarter past eight the hour when he usually started for his friends house  as he was leaving his room however his eyes chanced to fall upon one of the books which bellingham had lent him and his conscience pricked him for not having returned it  however repellent the man might be he should not be treated with discourtesy taking the book he walked downstairs and knocked at his neighbours door  there was no answer but on turning the handle he found that it was unlocked  pleased at the thought of avoiding an interview he stepped inside and placed the book with his card upon the table  the lamp was turned half down but smith could see the details of the room plainly enough  it was all much as he had seen it beforethe frieze the animalheaded gods the banging crocodile and the table littered over with papers and dried leaves  the mummy case stood upright against the wall but the mummy itself was missing  there was no sign of any second occupant of the room and he felt as he withdrew that he had probably done bellingham an injustice  had he a guilty secret to preserve he would hardly leave his door open so that all the world might enter  the spiral stair was as black as pitch and smith was slowly making his way down its irregular steps when he was suddenly conscious that something had passed him in the darkness  there was a faint sound a whiff of air a light brushing past his elbow but so slight that he could scarcely be certain of it  he stopped and listened but the wind was rustling among the ivy outside and he could hear nothing else  is that you styles he shouted  there was no answer and all was still behind him  it must have been a sudden gust of air for there were crannies and cracks in the old turret  and yet he could almost have sworn that he heard a footfall by his very side  he had emerged into the quadrangle still turning the matter over in his head when a man came running swiftly across the smoothcropped lawn  is that you smith  hullo hastie  for gods sake come at once  young lee is drowned  heres harrington of kings with the news  the doctor is out  youll do but come along at once  there may be life in him  have you brandy  no  ill bring some  theres a flask on my table  smith bounded up the stairs taking three at a time seized the flask and was rushing down with it when as he passed bellinghams room his eyes fell upon something which left him gasping and staring upon the landing  the door which he had closed behind him was now open and right in front of him with the lamplight shining upon it was the mummy case three minutes ago it had been empty  he could swear to that  now it framed the lank body of its horrible occupant who stood grim and stark with his black shrivelled face towards the door  the form was lifeless and inert but it seemed to smith as he gazed that there still lingered a lurid spark of vitality some faint sign of consciousness in the little eyes which lurked in the depths of the hollow sockets  so astounded and shaken was he that he had forgotten his errand and was still staring at the lean sunken figure when the voice of his friend below recalled him to himself  come on smith he shouted  its life and death you know  hurry up  now then he added as the medical student reappeared let us do a sprint  it is well under a mile and we should do it in five minutes  a human life is better worth running for than a pot  neck and neck they dashed through the darkness and did not pull up until panting and spent they had reached the little cottage by the river  young lee limp and dripping like a broken waterplant was stretched upon the sofa the green scum of the river upon his black hair and a fringe of white foam upon his leadenhued lips  beside him knelt his fellowstudent harrington endeavouring to chafe some warmth back into his rigid limbs  i think theres life in him said smith with his hand to the lads side  put your watch glass to his lips  yes theres dimming on it you take one arm hastie  now work it as i do and well soon pull him round  for ten minutes they worked in silence inflating and depressing the chest of the unconscious man  at the end of that time a shiver ran through his body his lips trembled and he opened his eyes  the three students burst out into an irrepressible cheer  wake up old chap  youve frightened us quite enough  have some brandy  take a sip from the flask  hes all right now said his companion harrington  heavens what a fright i got  i was reading here and he had gone for a stroll as far as the river when i heard a scream and a splash  out i ran and by the time that i could find him and fish him out all life seemed to have gone  then simpson couldnt get a doctor for he has a gameleg and i had to run and i dont know what id have done without you fellows  thats right old chap  sit up  monkhouse lee had raised himself on his hands and looked wildly about him  whats up he asked  ive been in the water  ah yes i remember  a look of fear came into his eyes and he sank his face into his hands  how did you fall in  i didnt fall in  how then  i was thrown in  i was standing by the bank and something from behind picked me up like a feather and hurled me in  i heard nothing and i saw nothing  but i know what it was for all that  and so do i whispered smith  lee looked up with a quick glance of surprise  youve learned then he said  you remember the advice i gave you  yes and i begin to think that i shall take it  i dont know what the deuce you fellows are talking about said hastie but i think if i were you harrington i should get lee to bed at once  it will be time enough to discuss the why and the wherefore when he is a little stronger  i think smith you and i can leave him alone now  i am walking back to college if you are coming in that direction we can have a chat  but it was little chat that they had upon their homeward path  smiths mind was too full of the incidents of the evening the absence of the mummy from his neighbours rooms the step that passed him on the stair the reappearancethe extraordinary inexplicable reappearance of the grisly thingand then this attack upon lee corresponding so closely to the previous outrage upon another man against whom bellingham bore a grudge  all this settled in his thoughts together with the many little incidents which had previously turned him against his neighbour and the singular circumstances under which he was first called in to him  what had been a dim suspicion a vague fantastic conjecture had suddenly taken form and stood out in his mind as a grim fact a thing not to be denied  and yet how monstrous it was how unheard of how entirely beyond all bounds of human experience  an impartial judge or even the friend who walked by his side would simply tell him that his eyes had deceived him that the mummy had been there all the time that young lee had tumbled into the river as any other man tumbles into a river and that a blue pill was the best thing for a disordered liver  he felt that he would have said as much if the positions had been reversed  and yet he could swear that bellingham was a murderer at heart and that he wielded a weapon such as no man had ever used in all the grim history of crime  hastie had branched off to his rooms with a few crisp and emphatic comments upon his friends unsociability and abercrombie smith crossed the quadrangle to his corner turret with a strong feeling of repulsion for his chambers and their associations  he would take lees advice and move his quarters as soon as possible for how could a man study when his ear was ever straining for every murmur or footstep in the room below  he observed as he crossed over the lawn that the light was still shining in bellinghams window and as he passed up the staircase the door opened and the man himself looked out at him  with his fat evil face he was like some bloated spider fresh from the weaving of his poisonous web  goodevening said he  wont you come in  no cried smith fiercely  no  you are busy as ever  i wanted to ask you about lee  i was sorry to hear that there was a rumour that something was amiss with him  his features were grave but there was the gleam of a hidden laugh in his eyes as he spoke  smith saw it and he could have knocked him down for it  youll be sorrier still to hear that monkhouse lee is doing very well and is out of all danger he answered  your hellish tricks have not come off this time  oh you neednt try to brazen it out  i know all about it  bellingham took a step back from the angry student and halfclosed the door as if to protect himself  you are mad he said  what do you mean  do you assert that i had anything to do with lees accident  yes thundered smith  you and that bag of bones behind you you worked it between you  i tell you what it is master b they have given up burning folk like you but we still keep a hangman and by george if any man in this college meets his death while you are here ill have you up and if you dont swing for it it wont be my fault youll find that your filthy egyptian tricks wont answer in england  youre a raving lunatic said bellingham  all right  you just remember what i say for youll find that ill be better than my word  the door slammed and smith went fuming up to his chamber where he locked the door upon the inside and spent half the night in smoking his old briar and brooding over the strange events of the evening  next morning abercrombie smith heard nothing of his neighbour but harrington called upon him in the afternoon to say that lee was almost himself again  all day smith stuck fast to his work but in the evening he determined to pay the visit to his friend dr peterson upon which he had started upon the night before  a good walk and a friendly chat would be welcome to his jangled nerves  bellinghams door was shut as he passed but glancing back when he was some distance from the turret he saw his neighbours head at the window outlined against the lamplight his face pressed apparently against the glass as he gazed out into the darkness  it was a blessing to be away from all contact with him but if for a few hours and smith stepped out briskly and breathed the soft spring air into his lungs the halfmoon lay in the west between two gothic pinnacles and threw upon the silvered street a dark tracery from the stonework above there was a brisk breeze and light fleecy clouds drifted swiftly across the sky  olds was on the very border of the town and in five minutes smith found himself beyond the houses and between the hedges of a mayscented oxfordshire lane  it was a lonely and little frequented road which led to his friends house  early as it was smith did not meet a single soul upon his way he walked briskly along until he came to the avenue gate which opened into the long gravel drive leading up to farlingford  in front of him he could see the cosy red light of the windows glimmering through the foliage  he stood with his hand upon the iron latch of the swinging gate and he glanced back at the road along which he had come something was coming swiftly down it  it moved in the shadow of the hedge silently and furtively a dark crouching figure dimly visible against the black background  even as he gazed back at it it had lessened its distance by twenty paces and was fast closing upon him  out of the darkness he had a glimpse of a scraggy neck and of two eyes that will ever haunt him in his dreams he turned and with a cry of terror he ran for his life up the avenue there were the red lights the signals of safety almost within a stones throw of him  he was a famous runner but never had he run as he ran that night  the heavy gate had swung into place behind him but he heard it dash open again before his pursuer  as he rushed madly and wildly through the night he could hear a swift dry patter behind him and could see as he threw back a glance that this horror was bounding like a tiger at his heels with blazing eyes and one stringy arm outthrown  thank god the door was ajar  he could see the thin bar of light which shot from the lamp in the hall  nearer yet sounded the clatter from behind he heard a hoarse gurgling at his very shoulder  with a shriek he flung himself against the door slammed and bolted it behind him and sank halffainting on to the hall chair  my goodness smith whats the matter asked peterson appearing at the door of his study  give me some brandy  peterson disappeared and came rushing out again with a glass and a decanter  you need it he said as his visitor drank off what he poured out for him  why man you are as white as a cheese  smith laid down his glass rose up and took a deep breath  i am my own man again now said he  i was never so unmanned before but with your leave peterson i will sleep here tonight for i dont think i could face that road again except by daylight  its weak i know but i cant help it  peterson looked at his visitor with a very questioning eye  of course you shall sleep here if you wish  ill tell mrs burney to make up the spare bed  where are you off to now  come up with me to the window that overlooks the door  i want you to see what i have seen  they went up to the window of the upper hall whence they could look down upon the approach to the house  the drive and the fields on either side lay quiet and still bathed in the peaceful moonlight  well really smith remarked peterson it is well that i know you to be an abstemious man  what in the world can have frightened you  ill tell you presently  but where can it have gone  ah now look look  see the curve of the road just beyond your gate  yes i see you neednt pinch my arm off  i saw someone pass  i should say a man rather thin apparently and tall very tall  but what of him  and what of yourself  you are still shaking like an aspen leaf  i have been within handgrip of the devil thats all  but come down to your study and i shall tell you the whole story  he did so  under the cheery lamplight with a glass of wine on the table beside him and the portly form and florid face of his friend in front he narrated in their order all the events great and small which had formed so singular a chain from the night on which he had found bellingham fainting in front of the mummy case until his horrid experience of an hour ago  there now he said as he concluded thats the whole black business it is monstrous and incredible but it is true  dr plumptree peterson sat for some time in silence with a very puzzled expression upon his face  i never heard of such a thing in my life never he said at last you have told me the facts  now tell me your inferences  you can draw your own  but i should like to hear yours  you have thought over the matter and i have not  well it must be a little vague in detail but the main points seem to me to be clear enough  this fellow bellingham in his eastern studies has got hold of some infernal secret by which a mummyor possibly only this particular mummycan be temporarily brought to life  he was trying this disgusting business on the night when he fainted  no doubt the sight of the creature moving had shaken his nerve even though he had expected it  you remember that almost the first words he said were to call out upon himself as a fool  well he got more hardened afterwards and carried the matter through without fainting  the vitality which he could put into it was evidently only a passing thing for i have seen it continually in its case as dead as this table  he has some elaborate process i fancy by which he brings the thing to pass  having done it he naturally bethought him that he might use the creature as an agent  it has intelligence and it has strength  for some purpose he took lee into his confidence but lee like a decent christian would have nothing to do with such a business  then they had a row and lee vowed that he would tell his sister of bellinghams true character  bellinghams game was to prevent him and he nearly managed it by setting this creature of his on his track  he had already tried its powers upon another mannortontowards whom he had a grudge  it is the merest chance that he has not two murders upon his soul  then when i taxed him with the matter he had the strongest reasons for wishing to get me out of the way before i could convey my knowledge to anyone else  he got his chance when i went out for he knew my habits and where i was bound for  i have had a narrow shave peterson and it is mere luck you didnt find me on your doorstep in the morning  im not a nervous man as a rule and i never thought to have the fear of death put upon me as it was tonight  my dear boy you take the matter too seriously said his companion your nerves are out of order with your work and you make too much of it  how could such a thing as this stride about the streets of oxford even at night without being seen  it has been seen  there is quite a scare in the town about an escaped ape as they imagine the creature to be  it is the talk of the place  well its a striking chain of events  and yet my dear fellow you must allow that each incident in itself is capable of a more natural explanation  what even my adventure of tonight  certainly  you come out with your nerves all unstrung and your head full of this theory of yours  some gaunt halffamished tramp steals after you and seeing you run is emboldened to pursue you  your fears and imagination do the rest  it wont do peterson it wont do  and again in the instance of your finding the mummy case empty and then a few moments later with an occupant you know that it was lamplight that the lamp was half turned down and that you had no special reason to look hard at the case  it is quite possible that you may have overlooked the creature in the first instance  no no it is out of the question  and then lee may have fallen into the river and norton been garrotted  it is certainly a formidable indictment that  you have against bellingham but if you were to place it before a police magistrate he would simply laugh in your face  i know he would  that is why i mean to take the matter into my own hands  eh  yes i feel that a public duty rests upon me and besides i must do it for my own safety unless i choose to allow myself to be hunted by this beast out of the college and that would be a little too feeble i have quite made up my mind what i shall do  and first of all may i use your paper and pens for an hour  most certainly  you will find all that you want upon that side table  abercrombie smith sat down before a sheet of foolscap and for an hour and then for a second hour his pen travelled swiftly over it  page after page was finished and tossed aside while his friend leaned back in his armchair looking across at him with patient curiosity  at last with an exclamation of satisfaction smith sprang to his feet gathered his papers up into order and laid the last one upon petersons desk  kindly sign this as a witness he said  a witness  of what  of my signature and of the date  the date is the most important why peterson my life might hang upon it  my dear smith you are talking wildly  let me beg you to go to bed  on the contrary i never spoke so deliberately in my life  and i will promise to go to bed the moment you have signed it  but what is it  it is a statement of all that i have been telling you tonight  i wish you to witness it  certainly said peterson signing his name under that of his companion  there you are  but what is the idea  you will kindly retain it and produce it in case i am arrested  arrested  for what  for murder  it is quite on the cards  i wish to be ready for every event  there is only one course open to me and i am determined to take it  for heavens sake dont do anything rash  believe me it would be far more rash to adopt any other course  i hope that we wont need to bother you but it will ease my mind to know that you have this statement of my motives  and now i am ready to take your advice and to go to roost for i want to be at my best in the morning   abercrombie smith was not an entirely pleasant man to have as an enemy slow and easytempered he was formidable when driven to action  he brought to every purpose in life the same deliberate resoluteness which had distinguished him as a scientific student  he had laid his studies aside for a day but he intended that the day should not be wasted not a word did he say to his host as to his plans but by nine oclock he was well on his way to oxford  in the high street he stopped at cliffords the gunmakers and bought a heavy revolver with a box of centralfire cartridges  six of them he slipped into the chambers and halfcocking the weapon placed it in the pocket of his coat  he then made his way to hasties rooms where the big oarsman was lounging over his breakfast with the sporting times propped up against the coffeepot  hullo  whats up he asked  have some coffee  no thank you  i want you to come with me hastie and do what i ask you  certainly my boy  and bring a heavy stick with you  hullo hastie stared  heres a huntingcrop that would fell an ox  one other thing  you have a box of amputating knives  give me the longest of them  there you are  you seem to be fairly on the war trail  anything else  no that will do smith placed the knife inside his coat and led the way to the quadrangle  we are neither of us chickens hastie said he  i think i can do this job alone but i take you as a precaution i am going to have a little talk with bellingham  if i have only him to deal with i wont of course need you  if i shout however up you come and lam out with your whip as hard as you can lick  do you understand  all right  ill come if i hear you bellow  stay here then  it may be a little time but dont budge until i come down  im a fixture  smith ascended the stairs opened bellinghams door and stepped in bellingham was seated behind his table writing  beside him among his litter of strange possessions towered the mummy case with its sale number 249 still stuck upon its front and its hideous occupant stiff and stark within it  smith looked very deliberately round him closed the door locked it took the key from the inside and then stepping across to the fireplace struck a match and set the fire alight bellingham sat staring with amazement and rage upon his bloated face  well really now you make yourself at home he gasped  smith sat himself deliberately down placing his watch upon the table drew out his pistol cocked it and laid it in his lap  then he took the long amputating knife from his bosom and threw it down in front of bellingham  now then said he just get to work and cut up that mummy  oh is that it said bellingham with a sneer  yes that is it  they tell me that the law cant touch you  but i have a law that will set matters straight  if in five minutes you have not set to work i swear by the god who made me that i will put a bullet through your brain  you would murder me  bellingham had half risen and his face was the colour of putty  yes  and for what  to stop your mischief  one minute has gone  but what have i done  i know and you know  this is mere bullying  two minutes are gone  but you must give reasons  you are a madmana dangerous madman  why should i destroy my own property  it is a valuable mummy  you must cut it up and you must burn it  i will do no such thing  four minutes are gone  smith took up the pistol and he looked towards bellingham with an inexorable face  as the secondhand stole round he raised his hand and the finger twitched upon the trigger  there there ill do it screamed bellingham  in frantic haste he caught up the knife and hacked at the figure of the mummy ever glancing round to see the eye and the weapon of his terrible visitor bent upon him  the creature crackled and snapped under every stab of the keen blade  a thick yellow dust rose up from it  spices and dried essences rained down upon the floor  suddenly with a rending crack its backbone snapped asunder and it fell a brown heap of sprawling limbs upon the floor  now into the fire said smith  the flames leaped and roared as the dried and tinderlike debris was piled upon it  the little room was like the stokehole of a steamer and the sweat ran down the faces of the two men but still the one stooped and worked while the other sat watching him with a set face a thick fat smoke oozed out from the fire and a heavy smell of burned rosin and singed hair filled the air  in a quarter of an hour a few charred and brittle sticks were all that was left of lot no 249  perhaps that will satisfy you snarled bellingham with hate and fear in his little grey eyes as he glanced back at his tormenter  no i must make a clean sweep of all your materials  we must have no more devils tricks  in with all these leaves  they may have something to do with it  and what now asked bellingham when the leaves also had been added to the blaze  now the roll of papyrus which you had on the table that night  it is in that drawer i think  no no shouted bellingham  dont burn that  why man you dont know what you do  it is unique it contains wisdom which is nowhere else to be found  out with it  but look here smith you cant really mean it  ill share the knowledge with you  ill teach you all that is in it  or stay let me only copy it before you burn it  smith stepped forward and turned the key in the drawer  taking out the yellow curled roll of paper he threw it into the fire and pressed it down with his heel  bellingham screamed and grabbed at it but smith pushed him back and stood over it until it was reduced to a formless grey ash  now master b said he i think i have pretty well drawn your teeth  youll hear from me again if you return to your old tricks and now goodmorning for i must go back to my studies  and such is the narrative of abercrombie smith as to the singular events which occurred in old college oxford in the spring of 84  as bellingham left the university immediately afterwards and was last heard of in the soudan there is no one who can contradict his statement  but the wisdom of men is small and the ways of nature are strange and who shall put a bound to the dark things which may be found by those who seek for them     the los amigos fiasco  i used to be the leading practitioner of los amigos  of course everyone has heard of the great electrical generating gear there  the town is wide spread and there are dozens of little townlets and villages all round which receive their supply from the same centre so that the works are on a very large scale  the los amigos folk say that they are the largest upon earth but then we claim that for everything in los amigos except the gaol and the deathrate  those are said to be the smallest  now with so fine an electrical supply it seemed to be a sinful waste of hemp that the los amigos criminals should perish in the oldfashioned manner  and then came the news of the eleotrocutions in the east and how the results had not after all been so instantaneous as had been hoped  the western engineers raised their eyebrows when they read of the puny shocks by which these men had perished and they vowed in los amigos that when an irreclaimable came their way he should be dealt handsomely by and have the run of all the big dynamos  there should be no reserve said the engineers but he should have all that they had got  and what the result of that would be none could predict save that it must be absolutely blasting and deadly  never before had a man been so charged with electricity as they would charge him  he was to be smitten by the essence of ten thunderbolts  some prophesied combustion and some disintegration and disappearance   they were waiting eagerly to settle the question by actual demonstration and it was just at that moment that duncan warner came that way  warner had been wanted by the law and by nobody else for many years desperado murderer train robber and road agent he was a man beyond the pale of human pity  he had deserved a dozen deaths and the los amigos folk grudged him so gaudy a one as that  he seemed to feel himself to be unworthy of it for he made two frenzied attempts at escape  he was a powerful muscular man with a lion head tangled black locks and a sweeping beard which covered his broad chest  when he was tried there was no finer head in all the crowded court  its no new thing to find the best face looking from the dock  but his good looks could not balance his bad deeds  his advocate did all he knew but the cards lay against him and duncan warner was handed over to the mercy of the big los amigos dynamos  i was there at the committee meeting when the matter was discussed the town council had chosen four experts to look after the arrangements  three of them  were admirable  there was joseph mconner the very man who had designed the dynamos and there was joshua westmacott the chairman of the los amigos electrical supply company limited  then there was myself as the chief medical man and lastly an old german of the name of peter stulpnagel  the germans were a strong body at los amigos and they all voted for their man  that was how he got on the committee  it was said that he had been a wonderful electrician at home and he was eternally working with wires and insulators and leyden jars but as he never seemed to get any further or to have any results worth publishing he came at last to be regarded as a harmless crank who had made science his hobby  we three practical men smiled when we heard that he had been elected as our colleague and at the meeting we fixed it all up very nicely among ourselves without much thought of the old fellow who sat with his ears scooped forward in his hands for he was a trifle hard of hearing taking no more part in the proceedings than the gentlemen of the press who scribbled their notes on the back benches  we did not take long to settle it all  in new york a strength of some two thousand volts had been used and death had not been instantaneous evidently their shock had been too weak  los amigos should not fall into that error  the charge should be six times greater and therefore of course it would be six times more effective  nothing could possibly be more logical  the whole concentrated force of the great dynamos should be employed on duncan warner  so we three settled it and had already risen to break up the meeting when our silent companion opened his month for the first time  gentlemen said he you appear to me to show an extraordinary ignorance upon the subject of electricity  you have not mastered the first principles of its actions upon a human being  the committee was about to break into an angry reply to this brusque comment but the chairman of the electrical company tapped his forehead to claim its indulgence for the crankiness of the speaker  pray tell us sir said he with an ironical smile what is there in our conclusions with which you find fault  with your assumption that a large dose of electricity will merely increase the effect of a small dose  do you not think it possible that it might have an entirely different result  do you know anything by actual experiment of the effect of such powerful shocks  we know it by analogy said the chairman pompously  all drugs increase their effect when they increase their dose for examplefor example  whisky said joseph mconnor  quite so  whisky  you see it there  peter stulpnagel smiled and shook his head  your argument is not very good said he  when i used to take whisky i used to find that one glass would excite me but that six would send me to sleep which is just the opposite  now suppose that electricity were to act in just the opposite way also what then  we three practical men burst out laughing  we had known that our colleague was queer but we never had thought that he would be as queer as this  what then repeated philip stulpnagel  well take our chances said the chairman  pray consider said peter that workmen who have touched the wires and who have received shocks of only a few hundred volts have died instantly  the fact is well known  and yet when a much greater force was used upon a criminal at new york the man struggled for some little time  do you not clearly see that the smaller dose is the more deadly  i think gentlemen that this discussion has been carried on quite long enough said the chairman rising again  the point i take it has already been decided by the majority of the committee and duncan warner shall be electrocuted on tuesday by the full strength of the los amigos dynamos  is it not so  i agree said joseph mconnor  i agree said i  and i protest said peter stulpnagel  then the motion is carried and your protest will be duly entered in the minutes said the chairman and so the sitting was dissolved  the attendance at the electrocution was a very small one  we four members of the committee were of course present with the executioner who was to act under their orders  the others were the united states marshal the governor of the gaol the chaplain and three members of the press  the room was a small brick chamber forming an outhouse to the central electrical station  it had been used as a laundry and had an oven and copper at one side but no other furniture save a single chair for the condemned man  a metal plate for his feet was placed in front of it to which ran a thick insulated wire  above another wire depended from the ceiling which could be connected with a small metallic rod projecting from a cap which was to be placed upon his head  when this connection was established duncan warners hour was come  there was a solemn hush as we waited for the coming of the prisoner the practical engineers looked a little pale and fidgeted nervously with the wires  even the hardened marshal was ill at ease for a mere hanging was one thing and this blasting of flesh and blood a very different one  as to the pressmen their faces were whiter than the sheets which lay before them  the only man who appeared to feel none of the influence of these preparations was the little german crank who strolled from one to the other with a smile on his lips and mischief in his eyes  more than once he even went so far as to burst into a shout of laughter until the chaplain sternly rebuked him for his illtimed levity  how can you so far forget yourself mr stulpnagel said he as to jest in the presence of death  but the german was quite unabashed  if i were in the presence of death i should not jest said he but since i am not i may do what i choose  this flippant reply was about to draw another and a sterner reproof from the chaplain when the door was swung open and two warders entered leading duncan warner between them  he glanced round him with a set face stepped resolutely forward and seated himself upon the chair  touch her off said he  it was barbarous to keep him in suspense  the chaplain murmured a few words in his ear the attendant placed the cap upon his head and then while we all held our breath the wire and the metal were brought in contact  great scott shouted duncan warner  he had bounded in his chair as the frightful shock crashed through his system  but he was not dead  on the contrary his eyes gleamed far more brightly than they had done before  there was only one change but it was a singular one  the black had passed from his hair and beard as the shadow passes from a landscape  they were both as white as snow  and yet there was no other sign of decay  his skin was smooth and plump and lustrous as a childs  the marshal looked at the committee with a reproachful eye  there seems to be some hitch here gentlemen said he  we three practical men looked at each other  peter stulpnagel smiled pensively  i think that another one should do it said i  again the connection was made and again duncan warner sprang in his chair and shouted but indeed were it not that he still remained in the chair none of us would have recognised him  his hair and his beard had shredded off in an instant and the room looked like a barbers shop on a saturday night  there he sat his eyes still shining his skin radiant with the glow of perfect health but with a scalp as bald as a dutch cheese and a chin without so much as a trace of down  he began to revolve one of his arms slowly and doubtfully at first but with more confidence as he went on  that jint said he has puzzled half the doctors on the pacific slope  its as good as new and as limber as a hickory twig  you are feeling pretty well asked the old german  never better in my life said duncan warner cheerily  the situation was a painful one  the marshal glared at the committee peter stulpnagel grinned and rubbed his hands  the engineers scratched their heads  the baldheaded prisoner revolved his arm and looked pleased  i think that one more shock began the chairman  no sir said the marshal weve had foolery enough for one morning we are here for an execution and a execution well have  what do you propose  theres a hook handy upon the ceiling  fetch in a rope and well soon set this matter straight  there was another awkward delay while the warders departed for the cord  peter stulpnagel bent over duncan warner and whispered something in his ear  the desperado started in surprise  you dont say he asked  the german nodded  what  noways  peter shook his head and the two began to laugh as though they shared some huge joke between them  the rope was brought and the marshal himself slipped the noose over the criminals neck  then the two warders the assistant and he swung their victim into the air  for half an hour he hunga dreadful sightfrom the ceiling  then in solemn silence they lowered him down and one of the warders went out to order the shell to be brought round but as he touched ground again what was our amazement when duncan warner put his hands up to his neck loosened the noose and took a long deep breath  paul jeffersons sale is goin well he remarked i could see the crowd from up yonder and he nodded at the hook in the ceiling  up with him again shouted the marshal well get the life out of him somehow  in an instant the victim was up at the hook once more  they kept him there for an hour but when he came down he was perfectly garrulous  old man plunket goes too much to the arcady saloon said he  three times hes been there in an hour and him with a family  old man plunket would do well to swear off  it was monstrous and incredible but there it was  there was no getting round it  the man was there talking when he ought to have been dead  we all sat staring in amazement but united states marshal carpenter was not a man to be euchred so easily  he motioned the others to one side so that the prisoner was left standing alone  duncan warner said he slowly you are here to play your part and i am here to play mine  your game is to live if you can and my game is to carry out the sentence of the law  youve beat us on electricity  ill give you one there  and youve beat us on hanging for you seem to thrive on it  but its my turn to beat you now for my duty has to be done  he pulled a sixshooter from his coat as he spoke and fired all the shots through the body of the prisoner  the room was so filled with smoke that we could see nothing but when it cleared the prisoner was still standing there looking down in disgust at the front of his coat  coats must be cheap where you come from said he  thirty dollars it cost me and look at it now  the six holes in front are bad enough but four of the balls have passed out and a pretty state the back must be in  the marshals revolver fell from his hand and he dropped his arms to his sides a beaten man  maybe some of you gentlemen can tell me what this means said he looking helplessly at the committee  peter stulpnagel took a step forward  ill tell you all about it said he  you seem to be the only person who knows anything  i am the only person who knows anything  i should have warned these gentlemen but as they would not listen to me i have allowed them to learn by experience  what you have done with your electricity is that you have increased this mans vitality until he can defy death for centuries  centuries  yes it will take the wear of hundreds of years to exhaust the enormous nervous energy with which you have drenched him  electricity is life and you have charged him with it to the utmost  perhaps in fifty years you might execute him but i am not sanguine about it  great scott  what shall i do with him cried the unhappy marshal  peter stulpnagel shrugged his shoulders  it seems to me that it does not much matter what you do with him now said he  maybe we could drain the electricity out of him again  suppose we hang him up by the heels  no no its out of the question  well well he shall do no more mischief in los amigos anyhow said the marshal with decision  he shall go into the new gaol  the prison will wear him out  on the contrary said peter stulpnagel i think that it is much more probable that he will wear out the prison  it was rather a fiasco and for years we didnt talk more about it than we could help but its no secret now and i thought you might like to jot down the facts in your casebook     the doctors of hoyland  dr james ripley was always looked upon as an exceedingly lucky dog by all of the profession who knew him  his father had preceded him in a practice in the village of hoyland in the north of hampshire and all was ready for him on the very first day that the law allowed him to put his name at the foot of a prescription  in a few years the old gentleman retired and settled on the south coast leaving his son in undisputed possession of the whole country side  save for dr horton near basingstoke the young surgeon had a clear run of six miles in every direction and took his fifteen hundred pounds a year though as is usual in country practices the stable swallowed up most of what the consultingroom earned  dr james ripley was twoandthirty years of age reserved learned unmarried with set rather stern features and a thinning of the dark hair upon the top of his head which was worth quite a hundred a year to him  he was particularly happy in his management of ladies  he had caught the tone of bland sternness and decisive suavity which dominates without offending  ladies however were not equally happy in their management of him  professionally he was always at their service socially he was a drop of quicksilver  in vain the country mammas spread out their simple lures in front of him  dances and picnics were not to his taste and he preferred during his scanty leisure to shut himself up in his study and to bury himself in virchows archives and the professional journals  study was a passion with him and he would have none of the rust which often gathers round a country practitioner  it was his ambition to keep his knowledge as fresh and bright as at the moment when he had stepped out of the examination hall  he prided himself on being able at a moments notice to rattle off the seven ramifications of some obscure artery or to give the exact percentage of any physiological compound  after a long days work he would sit up half the night performing iridectomies and extractions upon the sheeps eyes sent in by the village butcher to the horror of his housekeeper who had to remove the debris next morning  his love for his work was the one fanaticism which found a place in his dry precise nature  it was the more to his credit that he should keep up to date in his knowledge since he had no competition to force him to exertion  in the seven years during which he had practised in hoyland three rivals had pitted themselves against him two in the village itself and one in the neighbouring hamlet of lower hoyland  of these one had sickened and wasted being as it was said himself the only patient whom he had treated during his eighteen months of ruralising  a second had bought a fourth share of a basingstoke practice and had departed honourably while a third had vanished one september night leaving a gutted house and an unpaid drug bill behind him  since then the district had become a monopoly and no one had dared to measure himself against the established fame of the hoyland doctor  it was then with a feeling of some surprise and considerable curiosity that on driving through lower hoyland one morning he perceived that the new house at the end of the village was occupied and that a virgin brass plate glistened upon the swinging gate which faced the high road  he pulled up his fifty guinea chestnut mare and took a good look at it  verrinder smith m d was printed across it in very neat small lettering  the last man had had letters half a foot long with a lamp like a firestation  dr james ripley noted the difference and deduced from it that the newcomer might possibly prove a more formidable opponent  he was convinced of it that evening when he came to consult the current medical directory  by it he learned that dr verrinder smith was the holder of superb degrees that he had studied with distinction at edinburgh paris berlin and vienna and finally that he had been awarded a gold medal and the lee hopkins scholarship for original research in recognition of an exhaustive inquiry into the functions of the anterior spinal nerve roots  dr ripley passed his fingers through his thin hair in bewilderment as he read his rivals record  what on earth could so brilliant a man mean by putting up his plate in a little hampshire hamlet  but dr ripley furnished himself with an explanation to the riddle  no doubt dr verrinder smith had simply come down there in order to pursue some scientific research in peace and quiet  the plate was up as an address rather than as an invitation to patients  of course that must be the true explanation  in that case the presence of this brilliant neighbour would be a splendid thing for his own studies  he had often longed for some kindred mind some steel on which he might strike his flint  chance had brought it to him and he rejoiced exceedingly  and this joy it was which led him to take a step which was quite at variance with his usual habits  it is the custom for a newcomer among medical men to call first upon the older and the etiquette upon the subject is strict  dr ripley was pedantically exact on such points and yet he deliberately drove over next day and called upon dr verrinder smith  such a waiving of ceremony was he felt a gracious act upon his part and a fit prelude to the intimate relations which he hoped to establish with his neighbour  the house was neat and well appointed and dr ripley was shown by a smart maid into a dapper little consulting room  as he passed in he noticed two or three parasols and a ladys sun bonnet hanging in the hall  it was a pity that his colleague should be a married man  it would put them upon a different footing and interfere with those long evenings of high scientific talk which he had pictured to himself  on the other hand there was much in the consulting room to please him elaborate instruments seen more often in hospitals than in the houses of private practitioners were scattered about  a sphygmograph stood upon the table and a gasometerlike engine which was new to dr ripley in the corner  a bookcase full of ponderous volumes in french and german papercovered for the most part and varying in tint from the shell to the yoke of a ducks egg caught his wandering eyes and he was deeply absorbed in their titles when the door opened suddenly behind him  turning round he found himself facing a little woman whose plain palish face was remarkable only for a pair of shrewd humorous eyes of a blue which had two shades too much green in it  she held a pincenez in her left hand and the doctors card in her right  how do you do dr ripley said she  how do you do madam returned the visitor  your husband is perhaps out  i am not married said she simply  oh i beg your pardon  i meant the doctordr verrinder smith  i am dr verrinder smith  dr ripley was so surprised that he dropped his hat and forgot to pick it up again  what he grasped the lee hopkins prizeman  you  he had never seen a woman doctor before and his whole conservative soul rose up in revolt at the idea  he could not recall any biblical injunction that the man should remain ever the doctor and the woman the nurse and yet he felt as if a blasphemy had been committed  his face betrayed his feelings only too clearly  i am sorry to disappoint you said the lady drily  you certainly have surprised me he answered picking up his hat  you are not among our champions then  i cannot say that the movement has my approval  and why  i should much prefer not to discuss it  but i am sure you will answer a ladys question  ladies are in danger of losing their privileges when they usurp the place of the other sex  they cannot claim both  why should a woman not earn her bread by her brains  dr ripley felt irritated by the quiet manner in which the lady crossquestioned him  i should much prefer not to be led into a discussion miss smith  dr smith she interrupted  well dr smith  but if you insist upon an answer i must say that i do not think medicine a suitable profession for women and that i have a personal objection to masculine ladies  it was an exceedingly rude speech and he was ashamed of it the instant after he had made it  the lady however simply raised her eyebrows and smiled  it seems to me that you are begging the question said she  of course if it makes women masculine that would be a considerable deterioration  it was a neat little counter and dr ripley like a pinked fencer bowed his acknowledgment  i must go said he  i am sorry that we cannot come to some more friendly conclusion since we are to be neighbours she remarked  he bowed again and took a step towards the door  it was a singular coincidence she continued that at the instant that you called i was reading your paper on locomotor ataxia in the lancet  indeed said he drily  i thought it was a very able monograph  you are very good  but the views which you attribute to professor pitres of bordeaux have been repudiated by him  i have his pamphlet of 1890 said dr ripley angrily  here is his pamphlet of 1891 she picked it from among a litter of periodicals  if you have time to glance your eye down this passage  dr ripley took it from her and shot rapidly through the paragraph which she indicated  there was no denying that it completely knocked the bottom out of his own article  he threw it down and with another frigid bow he made for the door  as he took the reins from the groom he glanced round and saw that the lady was standing at her window and it seemed to him that she was laughing heartily  all day the memory of this interview haunted him  he felt that he had come very badly out of it  she had showed herself to be his superior on his own pet subject  she had been courteous while he had been rude selfpossessed when he had been angry  and then above all there was her presence her monstrous intrusion to rankle in his mind  a woman doctor had been an abstract thing before repugnant but distant  now she was there in actual practice with a brass plate up just like his own competing for the same patients  not that he feared competition but he objected to this lowering of his ideal of womanhood  she could not be more than thirty and had a bright mobile face too  he thought of her humorous eyes and of her strong wellturned chin  it revolted him the more to recall the details of her education  a man of course could come through such an ordeal with all his purity but it was nothing short of shameless in a woman  but it was not long before he learned that even her competition was a thing to be feared  the novelty of her presence had brought a few curious invalids into her consulting rooms and once there they had been so impressed by the firmness of her manner and by the singular newfashioned instruments with which she tapped and peered and sounded that it formed the core of their conversation for weeks afterwards  and soon there were tangible proofs of her powers upon the country side  farmer eyton whose callous ulcer had been quietly spreading over his shin for years back under a gentle regime of zinc ointment was painted round with blistering fluid and found after three blasphemous nights that his sore was stimulated into healing mrs crowder who had always regarded the birthmark upon her second daughter eliza as a sign of the indignation of the creator at a third helping of raspberry tart which she had partaken of during a critical period learned that with the help of two galvanic needles the mischief was not irreparable  in a month dr verrinder smith was known and in two she was famous  occasionally dr ripley met her as he drove upon his rounds  she had started a high dogcart taking the reins herself with a little tiger behind  when they met he invariably raised his hat with punctilious politeness but the grim severity of his face showed how formal was the courtesy  in fact his dislike was rapidly deepening into absolute detestation  the unsexed woman was the description of her which he permitted himself to give to those of his patients who still remained staunch  but indeed they were a rapidlydecreasing body and every day his pride was galled by the news of some fresh defection  the lady had somehow impressed the country folk with almost superstitious belief in her power and from far and near they flocked to her consulting room  but what galled him most of all was when she did something which he had pronounced to be impracticable  for all his knowledge he lacked nerve as an operator and usually sent his worst cases up to london the lady however had no weakness of the sort and took everything that came in her way  it was agony to him to hear that she was about to straighten little alec turners club foot and right at the fringe of the rumour came a note from his mother the rectors wife asking him if he would be so good as to act as chloroformist  it would be inhumanity to refuse as there was no other who could take the place but it was gall and wormwood to his sensitive nature  yet in spite of his vexation he could not but admire the dexterity with which the thing was done  she handled the little waxlike foot so gently and held the tiny tenotomy knife as an artist holds his pencil  one straight insertion one snick of a tendon and it was all over without a stain upon the white towel which lay beneath  he had never seen anything more masterly and he had the honesty to say so though her skill increased his dislike of her  the operation spread her fame still further at his expense and selfpreservation was added to his other grounds for detesting her  and this very detestation it was which brought matters to a curious climax  one winters night just as he was rising from his lonely dinner a groom came riding down from squire faircastles the richest man in the district to say that his daughter had scalded her hand and that medical help was needed on the instant  the coachman had ridden for the lady doctor for it mattered nothing to the squire who came as long as it were speedily  dr ripley rushed from his surgery with the determination that she should not effect an entrance into this stronghold of his if hard driving on his part could prevent it  he did not even wait to light his lamps but sprang into his gig and flew off as fast as hoof could rattle  he lived rather nearer to the squires than she did and was convinced that he could get there well before her  and so he would but for that whimsical element of chance which will for ever muddle up the affairs of this world and dumbfound the prophets  whether it came from the want of his lights or from his mind being full of the thoughts of his rival he allowed too little by half a foot in taking the sharp turn upon the basingstoke road  the empty trap and the frightened horse clattered away into the darkness while the squires groom crawled out of the ditch into which he had been shot  he struck a match looked down at his groaning companion and then after the fashion of rough strong men when they see what they have not seen before he was very sick  the doctor raised himself a little on his elbow in the glint of the match  he caught a glimpse of something white and sharp bristling through his trouser leg half way down the shin  compound he groaned  a three months job and fainted  when he came to himself the groom was gone for he had scudded off to the squires house for help but a small page was holding a giglamp in front of his injured leg and a woman with an open case of polished instruments gleaming in the yellow light was deftly slitting up his trouser with a crooked pair of scissors  its all right doctor said she soothingly  i am so sorry about it  you can have dr horton tomorrow but i am sure you will allow me to help you tonight  i could hardly believe my eyes when i saw you by the roadside  the groom has gone for help groaned the sufferer  when it comes we can move you into the gig  a little more light john  so  ah dear dear we shall have laceration unless we reduce this before we move you  allow me to give you a whiff of chloroform and i have no doubt that i can secure it sufficiently to  dr ripley never heard the end of that sentence  he tried to raise a hand and to murmur something in protest but a sweet smell was in his nostrils and a sense of rich peace and lethargy stole over his jangled nerves  down he sank through clear cool water ever down and down into the green shadows beneath gently without effort while the pleasant chiming of a great belfry rose and fell in his ears  then he rose again up and up and ever up with a terrible tightness about his temples until at last he shot out of those green shadows and was in the light once more  two bright shining golden spots gleamed before his dazed eyes  he blinked and blinked before he could give a name to them  they were only the two brass balls at the end posts of his bed and he was lying in his own little room with a head like a cannon ball and a leg like an iron bar  turning his eyes he saw the calm face of dr verrinder smith looking down at him  ah at last said she  i kept you under all the way home for i knew how painful the jolting would be  it is in good position now with a strong side splint  i have ordered a morphia draught for you  shall i tell your groom to ride for dr horton in the morning  i should prefer that you should continue the case said dr ripley feebly and then with a half hysterical laughyou have all the rest of the parish as patients you know so you may as well make the thing complete by having me also  it was not a very gracious speech but it was a look of pity and not of anger which shone in her eyes as she turned away from his bedside  dr ripley had a brother william who was assistant surgeon at a london hospital and who was down in hampshire within a few hours of his hearing of the accident  he raised his brows when he heard the details  what you are pestered with one of those he cried  i dont know what i should have done without her  ive no doubt shes an excellent nurse  she knows her work as well as you or i  speak for yourself james said the london man with a sniff  but apart from that you know that the principle of the thing is all wrong  you think there is nothing to be said on the other side  good heavens do you  well i dont know  it struck me during the night that we may have been a little narrow in our views  nonsense james  its all very fine for women to win prizes in the lecture room but you know as well as i do that they are no use in an emergency  now i warrant that this woman was all nerves when she was setting your leg  that reminds me that i had better just take a look at it and see that it is all right  i would rather that you did not undo it said the patient  i have her assurance that it is all right  brother william was deeply shocked  of course if a womans assurance is of more value than the opinion of the assistant surgeon of a london hospital there is nothing more to be said he remarked  i should prefer that you did not touch it said the patient firmly and dr william went back to london that evening in a huff  the lady who had heard of his coming was much surprised on learning his departure  we had a difference upon a point of professional etiquette said dr james and it was all the explanation he would vouchsafe  for two long months dr ripley was brought in contact with his rival every day and he learned many things which he had not known before she was a charming companion as well as a most assiduous doctor  her short presence during the long weary day was like a flower in a sand waste  what interested him was precisely what interested her and she could meet him at every point upon equal terms  and yet under all her learning and her firmness ran a sweet womanly nature peeping out in her talk shining in her greenish eyes showing itself in a thousand subtle ways which the dullest of men could read  and he though a bit of a prig and a pedant was by no means dull and had honesty enough to confess when he was in the wrong  i dont know how to apologise to you he said in his shamefaced fashion one day when he had progressed so far as to be able to sit in an armchair with his leg upon another one i feel that i have been quite in the wrong  why then  over this woman question  i used to think that a woman must inevitably lose something of her charm if she took up such studies  oh you dont think they are necessarily unsexed then she cried with a mischievous smile  please dont recall my idiotic expression  i feel so pleased that i should have helped in changing your views  i think that it is the most sincere compliment that i have ever had paid me  at any rate it is the truth said he and was happy all night at the remembrance of the flush of pleasure which made her pale face look quite comely for the instant  for indeed he was already far past the stage when he would acknowledge her as the equal of any other woman  already he could not disguise from himself that she had become the one woman  her dainty skill her gentle touch her sweet presence the community of their tastes had all united to hopelessly upset his previous opinions  it was a dark day for him now when his convalescence allowed her to miss a visit and darker still that other one which he saw approaching when all occasion for her visits would be at an end  it came round at last however and he felt that his whole lifes fortune would hang upon the issue of that final interview  he was a direct man by nature so he laid his hand upon hers as it felt for his pulse and he asked her if she would be his wife  what and unite the practices said she  he started in pain and anger  surely you do not attribute any such base motive to me he cried  i love you as unselfishly as ever a woman was loved  no i was wrong  it was a foolish speech said she moving her chair a little back and tapping her stethoscope upon her knee  forget that i ever said it  i am so sorry to cause you any disappointment and i appreciate most highly the honour which you do me but what you ask is quite impossible  with another woman he might have urged the point but his instincts told him that it was quite useless with this one  her tone of voice was conclusive  he said nothing but leaned back in his chair a stricken man  i am so sorry she said again  if i had known what was passing in your mind i should have told you earlier that i intended to devote my life entirely to science  there are many women with a capacity for marriage but few with a taste for biology  i will remain true to my own line then  i came down here while waiting for an opening in the paris physiological laboratory  i have just heard that there is a vacancy for me there and so you will be troubled no more by my intrusion upon your practice  i have done you an injustice just as you did me one  i thought you narrow and pedantic with no good quality i have learned during your illness to appreciate you better and the recollection of our friendship will always be a very pleasant one to me  and so it came about that in a very few weeks there was only one doctor in hoyland  but folks noticed that the one had aged many years in a few months that a weary sadness lurked always in the depths of his blue eyes and that he was less concerned than ever with the eligible young ladies whom chance or their careful country mammas placed in his way     the surgeon talks  men die of the diseases which they have studied most remarked the surgeon snipping off the end of a cigar with all his professional neatness and finish  its as if the morbid condition was an evil creature which when it found itself closely hunted flew at the throat of its pursuer  if you worry the microbes too much they may worry you ive seen cases of it and not necessarily in microbic diseases either there was of course the wellknown instance of liston and the aneurism and a dozen others that i could mention  you couldnt have a clearer case than that of poor old walker of st  christophers  not heard of it  well of course it was a little before your time but i wonder that it should have been forgotten  you youngsters are so busy in keeping up to the day that you lose a good deal that is interesting of yesterday  walker was one of the best men in europe on nervous disease  you must have read his little book on sclerosis of the posterior columns  its as interesting as a novel and epochmaking in its way  he worked like a horse did walkerhuge consulting practicehours a day in the clinical wardsconstant original investigations  and then he enjoyed himself also  de mortuis of course but still its an open secret among all who knew him  if he died at fortyfive he crammed eighty years into it  the marvel was that he could have held on so long at the pace at which he was going  but he took it beautifully when it came  i was his clinical assistant at the time  walker was lecturing on locomotor ataxia to a wardful of youngsters  he was explaining that one of the early signs of the complaint was that the patient could not put his heels together with his eyes shut without staggering  as he spoke he suited the action to the word  i dont suppose the boys noticed anything  i did and so did he though he finished his lecture without a sign  when it was over he came into my room and lit a cigarette  just run over my reflexes smith said he  there was hardly a trace of them left  i tapped away at his kneetendon and might as well have tried to get a jerk out of that sofacushion  he stood with his eyes shut again and he swayed like a bush in the wind  so said he it was not intercostal neuralgia after all  then i knew that he had had the lightning pains and that the case was complete  there was nothing to say so i sat looking at him while he puffed and puffed at his cigarette  here he was a man in the prime of life one of the handsomest men in london with money fame social success everything at his feet and now without a moments warning he was told that inevitable death lay before him a death accompanied by more refined and lingering tortures than if he were bound upon a red indian stake  he sat in the middle of the blue cigarette cloud with his eyes cast down and the slightest little tightening of his lips then he rose with a motion of his arms as one who throws off old thoughts and enters upon a new course  better put this thing straight at once said he  i must make some fresh arrangements  may i use your paper and envelopes  he settled himself at my desk and he wrote half a dozen letters  it is not a breach of confidence to say that they were not addressed to his professional brothers  walker was a single man which means that he was not restricted to a single woman  when he had finished he walked out of that little room of mine leaving every hope and ambition of his life behind him  and he might have had another year of ignorance and peace if it had not been for the chance illustration in his lecture  it took five years to kill him and he stood it well  if he had ever been a little irregular he atoned for it in that long martyrdom  he kept an admirable record of his own symptoms and worked out the eye changes more fully than has ever been done  when the ptosis got very bad he would hold his eyelid up with one hand while he wrote  then when he could not coordinate his muscles to write he dictated to his nurse  so died in the odour of science james walker aet 45  poor old walker was very fond of experimental surgery and he broke ground in several directions  between ourselves there may have been some more groundbreaking afterwards but he did his best for his cases  you know mnamara dont you  he always wears his hair long he lets it be understood that it comes from his artistic strain but it is really to conceal the loss of one of his ears  walker cut the other one off but you must not tell mac i said so  it was like this  walker had a fad about the portio durathe motor to the face you knowand he thought paralysis of it came from a disturbance of the blood supply  something else which counterbalanced that disturbance might he thought set it right again  we had a very obstinate case of bells paralysis in the wards and had tried it with every conceivable thing blistering tonics nervestretching galvanism needles but all without result  walker got it into his head that removal of the ear would increase the blood supply to the part and he very soon gained the consent of the patient to the operation  well we did it at night  walker of course felt that it was something of an experiment and did not wish too much talk about it unless it proved successful  there were halfadozen of us there mnamara and i among the rest  the room was a small one and in the centre was in the narrow table with a macintosh over the pillow and a blanket which extended almost to the floor on either side  two candles on a sidetable near the pillow supplied all the light  in came the patient with one side of his face as smooth as a babys and the other all in a quiver with fright  he lay down and the chloroform towel was placed over his face while walker threaded his needles in the candle light  the chloroformist stood at the head of the table and mnamara was stationed at the side to control the patient  the rest of us stood by to assist  well the man was about half over when he fell into one of those convulsive flurries which come with the semiunconscious stage he kicked and plunged and struck out with both hands  over with a crash went the little table which held the candles and in an instant we were left in total darkness  you can think what a rush and a scurry there was one to pick up the table one to find the matches and some to restrain the patient who was still dashing himself about  he was held down by two dressers the chloroform was pushed and by the time the candles were relit his incoherent halfsmothered shoutings had changed to a stertorous snore   his head was turned on the pillow and the towel was still kept over his face while the operation was carried through  then the towel was withdrawn and you can conceive our amazement when we looked upon the face of mnamara  how did it happen  why simply enough  as the candles went over the chloroformist had stopped for an instant and had tried to catch them the patient just as the light went out had rolled off and under the table  poor mnamara clinging frantically to him had been dragged across it and the chloroformist feeling him there had naturally claped the towel across his mouth and nose  the others had secured him and the more he roared and kicked the more they drenched him with chloroform  walker was very nice about it and made the most handsome apologies  he offered to do a plastic on the spot and make as good an ear as he could but mnamara had had enough of it  as to the patient we found him sleeping placidly under the table with the ends of the blanket screening him on both sides  walker sent mnamara round his ear next day in a jar of methylated spirit but macs wife was very angry about it and it led to a good deal of illfeeling  some people say that the more one has to do with human nature and the closer one is brought in contact with it the less one thinks of it  i dont believe that those who know most would uphold that view  my own experience is dead against it  i was brought up in the miserablemortalclay school of theology and yet here i am after thirty years of intimate acquaintance with humanity filled with respect for it  the evil lies commonly upon the surface  the deeper strata are good  a hundred times i have seen folk condemned to death as suddenly as poor walker was  sometimes it was to blindness or to mutilations which are worse than death  men and women they almost all took it beautifully and some with such lovely unselfishness and with such complete absorption in the thought of how their fate would affect others that the man about town or the frivolouslydressed woman has seemed to change into an angel before my eyes  i have seen deathbeds too of all ages and of all creeds and want of creeds  i never saw any of them shrink save only one poor imaginative young fellow who had spent his blameless life in the strictest of sects  of course an exhausted frame is incapable of fear as anyone can vouch who is told in the midst of his seasickness that the ship is going to the bottom that is why i rate courage in the face of mutilation to be higher than courage when a wasting illness is fining away into death  now ill take a case which i had in my own practice last wednesday a lady came in to consult methe wife of a wellknown sporting baronet  the husband had come with her but remained at her request in the waitingroom  i need not go into details but it proved to be a peculiarly malignant case of cancer  i knew it said she  how long have i to live  i fear that it may exhaust your strength in a few months i answered  poor old jack said she  ill tell him that it is not dangerous  why should you deceive him i asked  well hes very uneasy about it and he is quaking now in the waitingroom he has two old friends to dinner tonight and i havent the heart to spoil his evening  tomorrow will be time enough for him to learn the truth  out she walked the brave little woman and a moment later her husband with his big red face shining with joy came plunging into my room to shake me by the hand  no i respected her wish and i did not undeceive him  i dare bet that evening was one of the brightest and the next morning the darkest of his life  its wonderful how bravely and cheerily a woman can face a crushing blow  it is different with men  a man can stand it without complaining but it knocks him dazed and silly all the same  but the woman does not lose her wits any more than she does her courage  now i had a case only a few weeks ago which would show you what i mean  a gentleman consulted me about his wife a very beautiful woman  she had a small tubercular nodule upon her upper arm according to him  he was sure that it was of no importance but he wanted to know whether devonshire or the riviera would be the better for her i examined her and found a frightful sarcoma of the bone hardly showing upon the surface but involving the shoulderblade and clavicle as well as the humerus  a more malignant case i have never seen  i sent her out of the room and i told him the truth  what did he do  why he walked slowly round that room with his hands behind his back looking with the greatest interest at the pictures  i can see him now putting up his gold pincenez and staring at them with perfectly vacant eyes which told me that he saw neither them nor the wall behind them  amputation of the arm he asked at last  and of the collarbone and shoulderblade said i  quite so  the collarbone and shoulderblade he repeated still staring about him with those lifeless eyes  it settled him  i dont believe hell ever be the same man again  but the woman took it as bravely and brightly as could be and she has done very well since   the mischief was so great that the arm snapped as we drew it from the nightdress  no i dont think that there will be any return and i have every hope of her recovery  the first patient is a thing which one remembers all ones life  mine was commonplace and the details are of no interest  i had a curious visitor however during the first few months after my plate went up it was an elderly woman richly dressed with a wickerwork picnic basket in her hand  this she opened with the tears streaming down her face and out there waddled the fattest ugliest and mangiest little pug dog that i have ever seen  i wish you to put him painlessly out of the world doctor she cried  quick quick or my resolution may give way  she flung herself down with hysterical sobs upon the sofa  the less experienced a doctor is the higher are his notions of professional dignity as i need not remind you my young friend so i was about to refuse the commission with indignation when i bethought me that quite apart from medicine we were gentleman and lady and that she had asked me to do something for her which was evidently of the greatest possible importance in her eyes  i led off the poor little doggie therefore and with the help of a saucerful of milk and a few drops of prussic acid his exit was as speedy and painless as could be desired  is it over she cried as i entered  it was really tragic to see how all the love which should have gone to husband and children had in default of them been centred upon this uncouth little animal  she left quite broken down in her carriage and it was only after her departure that i saw an envelope sealed with a large red seal and lying upon the blotting pad of my desk  outside in pencil was written  i have no doubt that you would willingly have done this without a fee but i insist upon your acceptance of the enclosed  i opened it with some vague notions of an eccentric millionaire and a fiftypound note but all i found was a postal order for four and sixpence  the whole incident struck me as so whimsical that i laughed until i was tired  youll find theres so much tragedy in a doctors life my boy that he would not be able to stand it if it were not for the strain of comedy which comes every now and then to leaven it  and a doctor has very much to be thankful for also  dont you ever forget it  it is such a pleasure to do a little good that a man should pay for the privilege instead of being paid for it  still of course he has his home to keep up and his wife and children to support  but his patients are his friendsor they should be so  he goes from house to house and his step and his voice are loved and welcomed in each what could a man ask for more than that  and besides he is forced to be a good man  it is impossible for him to be anything else  how can a man spend his whole life in seeing suffering bravely borne and yet remain a hard or a vicious man  it is a noble generous kindly profession and you youngsters have got to see that it remains so
