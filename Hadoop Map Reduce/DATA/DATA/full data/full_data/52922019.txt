52922019	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle  volume ix     book ix  last stage of friedrichs apprenticeship life in ruppin  17321736     chapter i  princess elizabeth christina of brunswickbevern  we described the crownprince as intent to comply especially in all visible external particulars with papas will and pleasureto distinguish himself by real excellence in commandantship of the regiment goltz first of all but before ever getting into that there has another point risen on which obedience equally essential may be still more difficult  ever since the grand catastrophe went off without taking friedrichs head along with it and there began to be hopes of a pacific settlement question has been whom shall the crownprince marry and the debates about it in the royal breast and in tobaccoparliament and rumors about it in the world at large have been manifold and continual in the schulenburg letters we saw the crownprince himself much interested and eagerly inquisitive on that head as was natural but it is not in the crownprinces mind it is in the tobaccoparliament and the royal breast as influenced there that the thing must be decided who in the world will it be then crownprince himself hears now of this party now of that england is quite over and the princess amelia sunk below the horizon friedrich himself appears a little piqued that hotham carried his nose so high that the english would not in those lifeanddeath circumstances abate the least from their both marriages or nonethinks they should have saved wilhelmina and taken his word of honor for the rest england is now out of his headall romance is too sorrowfully swept out and instead of the sacred aircities of hope in this high section of his history the young man is looking into the mean clay hamlets of reality with an eye well recognizing them for real with an eye and heart already tempered to the due hardness for them not a fortunate result though it was an inevitable one we saw him flirting with the beautiful wedded wreech talking to lieutenantgeneral schulenburg about marriage in a way which shook the pipeclay of that virtuous man he knows he would not get his choice if he had one strives not to care nor does he in fact much care the romance being all out of it he looks mainly to outward advantages to personal appearance temper good manners to religious principle sometimes rather in the reverse way fearing an overplus ratherbut always to likelihood of moneys by the match as a very direct item ready command of money he feels will be extremely desirable in a wife desirable and almost indispensable in present straitened circumstances these are the notions of this illsituated coelebs  the parties proposed first and last and rumored of in newspapers and the idle brains of men have been very manyno limit to their numbers it may be anybody an intending purchaser though but possessed of sixpence is in a sense proprietor of the whole fair through schulenburg we heard his own account of them last autumnbut the far noblest of the lot was hardly glanced at or not at all on that occasion the kaisers eldest daughter sole heiress of austria and these vast pragmaticsanction operations archduchess maria theresa herselfit is affirmed to have been prince eugenes oftenexpressed wish that the crownprince of prussia should wed the future empress hormayr allgemeine geschichte der neueslen zeit wien 1817 i 13 cited in preuss i 71 which would indeed have saved immense confusions to mankind nay she alone of princesses beautiful magnanimous brave was the mate for such a princehad the good fairies been consulted which seldom happensand romance itself might have become reality in that case with high results to the very soul of this young prince wishes are free and wise eugene will have been heard perhaps often to express this wish but that must have been all alas the preliminaries political especially religious are at once indispensable and impossible we have to dismiss that daydream a papalprotestant controversy still exists among mankind and this is one penalty they pay for not having settled it sooner the imperial court cannot afford its archduchess on the terms possible in that quarter  what the imperial court can do is to recommend a niece of theirs insignificant young princess elizabeth christina of brunswickbevern who is niece to the empress and may be made useful in this way to herself and us think the imperial majestieswill be a new tie upon the prussians and the pragmatic sanction and keep the alliance still surer for our archduchess in times coming think their majesties she it is insinuated by seckendorf in tobaccoparliament ought not she daughter of your majestys esteemed friendmodestminded innocent young princess with a brother already betrothed in your majestys houseto be the lady it is probable she will  did we inform the reader once about kaiser karls young marriage adventures and may we to remind him mention them a second time how imperial majesty some fiveandtwenty years ago then only king of spain asked princess caroline of anspach who was very poor and an orphan in the world who at once refused declining to think of changing her religion on such a scoreand now governs england telegraphing with walpole as queen there instead how karl now imperial majesty then king of spain next applied to brunswickwolfenbuttel and met with a much better reception there applied to old anton ulrich reigning duke who writes big novels and does other foolish goodnatured thingswho persuaded his granddaughter that a change to catholicism was nothing in such a case that he himself should not care in the least to change how the granddaughter changed accordingly went to barcelona and was weddedand had to dun old grandpapa why dont you change then who did change thereupon thinking to himself plague on it i must then the foolish old herr he is dead and his novels in six volumes quarto are all dead and the granddaughter is kaiserinn on those terms a serene monotonous wellfavored lady diligent in her catholic exercises of whom i never heard any evil good rather in her eminent serene position pity perhaps that she had recommended her niece for this young prussian gentleman whom it by no means did attach to the family so very careful about him at vienna but if there lay a sin and a punishment following on it here or elsewhere in her imperial position surely it is to be charged on foolish old anton ulrich not on her poor lady who had never coveted such height nor durst for her soul take the leap thitherward till the serene old literary gentleman showed her how easy it was  well old anton ulrich is long since dead 1714 age 70 huber t 190 and his religious accounts are all settled beyond cavil and only the sad duty devolves on me of explaining a little what and who his rather insipid offspring are so far as related to readers of this history anton ulrich left two sons the elder of whom was duke and the younger had an apanage blankenburg by name only this younger had childrenserene kaiserinn that now is one of them the elder died childless 1731 michaelis i 132 precisely a few months before the times we are now got to reigning duke of brunswickwolfenbuttel welfbooths hunted camp of the welfs according to etymology brunswick again is braunswick braun brown being an old militant welf in those parts who built some lodge for himself as a convenience thereyear 880 say the uncertain old books hubner t 149 michaelis c all but certain apanages and does not concern us farther to that supreme dignity the younger has now come and his apanage of blankenburg and children with himso that there is now only one outstanding apanage bevern not known to us yet which also will perhaps get reunited if we cared for it ludwig rudolf is the name of this new sovereign duke of brunswickwolfenbuttel or duke in chief age now sixty has a shining bustling somewhat irregular duchess says wilhelmina and a noseor rather almost no nose for sad reasons wilhelmina ii 121 other qualities or accidents i know not of himexcept that he is father of the vienna kaiserinn grandfather of the princess whom seckendorf suggests for our friedrich of prussia  in ludwig rudolfs insipid offspring our readers are unexpectedly somewhat interested let readers patiently attend therefore he had three daughters never any son two of his daughters eldest and youngest are alive still the middle one had a sad fate long ago she married in 1711 alexius the czarowitz of peter the great foolish czarowitz miserable and making others miserable broke her heart by ill conduct ill usage in four years so that she died leaving him only a poor small peter ii who is now dead too and that matter ended all but the memory of it some accounts bear that she did not die that she only pretended it and ran and left her intolerable czarowitz that she wedded at paris in deep obscurity an officer just setting out for louisiana lived many years there as a thrifty soldiers wife returned to paris with her officer reduced to halfpay and told himor told some select official person after him under sevenfold oath being then a widow and necessitousher sublime secret sublime secret which came thus to be known to a supremely select circle at paris and was published in books where one still reads it no vestige of truth in itexcept that perhaps a necessitous soldiers widow at paris considering of ways and means found that she had some trace of likeness to the pictures of this princess and had heard her tragic story  ludwig rudolfs second daughter is dead long years ago nor has this fable as yet risen from her dust of ludwig rudolfs other two daughters we have said that one the eldest was the kaiserinn empress elizabeth christina age now precisely forty with two beautiful daughters sublime maria theresa the elder of them and no son that would live which last little circumstance has caused the pragmatic sanction and tormented universal nature for so many years back ludwig rudolf has a youngest daughter also married and a mother in germanyto this day conspicuously soof whom next or rather of her husband and familycircle we must say a word  her husband is no other than the esteemed friend of friedrich wilhelm duke of brunswickbevern by title who as a junior branch lives on the apanage of bevern as his father did but is sure now to inherit the sovereignty and be duke of brunswickwolfenbuttel at large he or his sons were the present incumbent ludwig rudolf once out present incumbent we have just intimated is his fatherinlaw but it is not on that ground that he looks to inherit he is nephew of old anton ulrich son of a younger brother who was also bevern in antons time and is the evident heirmale old anton being already fallen into the distaff with nothing but three granddaughters antons heir will now be this nephew nephew

only ten years younger than his serene fatherinlaw ludwig rudolfwhom i may as well say here he does at last succeed three years hence 1735 and becomes duke of brunswick in general according to hope but only for a few months having himself died that same year poor duke rather a good man by all the accounts i could hear though not of qualities that shone he is at present duke of brunswickbevernsuch his actual nomenclature in those everfluctuating sibylsleaves of german historybooks wilhelminas and the othersexpectant duke of brunswick in general much a friend of friedrich wilhelm a kind of austrian soldier he was formerly and will again be for brief times generalfeldmarschall so styled but is not notable in war nor otherwise at all except for the offspring he had by this serene spouse of his insipid offspring the impatient reader says but permits me to enumerate one or two of them  1 karl eldest son who is sure to be brunswick in general who is betrothed to princess charlotte of prussiaa satirical creature she fonder of my prince than of him wilhelmina thinks the wedding nevertheless took effect brunswick in general duly fell in first to the father then in a few months more to karl with his charlotte and from them proceeded in due time another karl of whom we shall hear in this historyand of whom all the world heard much in the french revolution wars in 1792 and still more tragically afterwards shot to death or worse at the battle of jena october 1806 battle lost before it was begunsuch the strategic history they give of it he peremptorily ordered the french revolution to suppress itself and that was the answer the french revolution made him from this karl what new queens caroline of england and portentous dukes of brunswick sent upon their travels through the anarchic world profitable only to newspapers we need not say  2 anton ulrich named after his august greatgrandfather does not write novels like him at present a young gentleman of eighteen goes into russia before long hoping to beget czars which issues dreadfully for himself and the potential czars he begot the reader has heard of a potential czar iwan violently done to death in his room one dim moonlight night of 1764 in the fortress of schlusselburg middle of lake ladoga misty moon looking down on the stone battlements on the melancholy waters and saying nothingbut let us not anticipate  3 elizabeth christina to us more important than any of them namesake of the kaiserinn her august aunt age now seventeen insipid finecomplexioned young lady who is talked of for the bride of our crownprince of whom the reader will hear more crownprince fears she is too religiousand will have cagots about her solemn persons in black highly unconscious how little wisdom they have who may be troublesome  4 a merry young boy now ten called ferdinand with whom england within the next thirty years will ring for some time loud enough the great prince ferdinand himselfunder whom the marquis of granby and others became great chatham superintending it this really was a respectable gentleman and did considerable thingsa trismegistus in comparison with the duke of cumberland whom he succeeded a cheerful singularly polite modest wellconditioned man withal to be slightly better known to us if we live he at present is a boy of ten chasing the thistles beard  5 three other sons all soldiers two of them younger than ferdinand whose names were in the gazettes down to a late periodwhom we shall ignore in this place the last of them was marched out of holland where he had long been commanderinchief on rather tory principles in the troubles of 1787 others of them we shall see storming forward on occasion valiantly meeting death in the field of fight all conspicuously brave of character but this shall be enough of them at present  it is of these that ludwig rudolfs youngest daughter the serene ferdinand alberts wife is mother in germany highly conspicuous in their day if the question is put it must be owned they are all rather of the insipid type nothing but a kind of albuminous simplicity noticeable in them no wit originality brightness in the way of uttered intellect if it is asked how came they to the least distinction in this worldthe answer is not immediately apparent but indeed they are welf of the welfs in this respect as in others one asks with increased wonder noticing in the welfs generally nothing but the same albuminous simplicity and poverty rather than opulence of uttered intellect or of qualities that shine how the welfs came to play such a part for the last thousand years and still to be at it in conspicuous places reader i have observed that uttered intellect is not what permanently makes way but unuttered wit logical brilliancy spiritual effulgency true or falsehow precious to idle mankind and to the newspapers and historybooks even when it is false while again nature and practical fact care next to nothing for it in comparison even when it is true two silent qualities you will notice in these welfs modern and ancient which nature much values first consummate human courage a noble perfect and as it were unconscious superiority to fear and then secondly much weight of mind a noble not too conscious sense of what is right and notright i have found in some of themwhich means mostly weight or good gravitation good observance of the perpendicular and is called justice veracity highhonor and other such names these are fine qualities indeed especially with an albuminous simplicity as vehicle to them if the welfs had not much articulate intellect let us guess they made a good use not a bad or indifferent as is commoner of what they had     who his majestys choice is and what the crownprince thinks of it  princess elizabeth christina the insipid brunswick specimen backed by seckendorf and vienna proves on consideration the desirable to friedrich wilhelm in this matter but his sons notions who as yet knows her only by rumor do not go that way insipidity triviality the fear of cagotage and frightful fellows in black supremely unconscious what blockheads they are haunts him a good deal and as for any money comingher sublime aunt the kaiserinn never had much ready money ones resources on that side are likely to be exiguous he would prefer the princess of mecklenburg semirussian catharine or anna of whom we have heard would prefer the princess of eisenach whose name he does not know rightly thinks there are many princesses preferable most of all he would prefer what is well known of him in tobaccoparliament but known to be impossible this long while back to go upon a round of travelas for instance the prince of lorraine is now doingand look about him a little  these candid considerations the crownprince earnestly suggests to grumkow and the secret committee of tobaccoparliament earnestly again and again in his correspondence with that gentleman which goes on very brisk at present much of it lost we hearbut enough and to spare is saved not a beautiful correspondence the tone of it shallow hard of heart tragically flippant especially on the crownprinces part now and then even a touch of the hypocritical from him slight touch and not with will alas what can the poor young man do grumkowwhose ground i think is never quite so secure since that nosti businessprofesses ardent attachment to the real interests of the prince and does solidly advise him of what is feasible what not in headquarters very exemplary attachment credible to what length the prince well enough knows and so the correspondence is unbeautiful not very descriptive evenfor poor friedrich is considerably under mask while he writes to that address and of grumkow himself we want no more description and is in fact on its own score an avoidable article rather than otherwise though perhaps the reader for a poor involved crownprinces sake will wish an exact excerpt or two before we quite dismiss it  towards turning off the brunswick speculation or turning on the mecklenburg or eisenach or any other in its stead the correspondence naturally avails nothing seckendorf has his orders from vienna grumkow has his pensionhis creambowl duly setfor helping beckendorf though angels pleaded not in a tone of tragic flippancy but with the voice of breaking hearts it would be to no purpose the imperial majesties have ordered marry him to brunswick bind him the better to our house in time coming nay the royal mind at potsdam gravitates of itself that way after the first hint is given the imperial will has become the paternal one no answer but obedience what grumkow can do will be if possible to lead or drive the crownprince into obeying smoothly or without breaking of harness again which accordingly is pretty much the sum of his part in this unlovely correspondence the geehoing of an expert wagoner who has got a fiery young arab thoroughly tied into his dastard sandcart and has to drive him by voice or at most by slight crack of whip and does it can we hope a select specimen or two of these documents not on grumkows part or for grumkows unlovely sake may now be acceptable to the reader a letter or two picked from that large stock in a legible state will show us father and son and how that tragic matter went on better than description could  papas letters to the crownprince during that final custrin periodwhen carzig and himmelstadt were going on and there was such progress in economics are all of hopeful ruggedly affectionate tenor and there are a good few of them style curiously rugged intricate headlong and a strong substance of sense and worth tortuously visible everywhere letters so delightful to the poor retrieved crownprince then and there and which are still almost pleasant reading to thirdparties once you introduce grammar and spelling this is one exact specimen most important to the prince and us suddenly one night by estafette his majesty meaning nothing but kindness and grateful to seckendorf and tobaccoparliament for such an idea proposesin these terms merely reduced to english and the common spelling  to the crownprince at custrin from papa potsdam 4th february 1732  my dear son fritzi am very glad you need no more physic but you must have a care of yourself some days yet for the severe weather which gives me and everybody colds so pray be on your guard nehmet euch kubsch in acht  you know my dear son that when my children are obedient i love them much so when you were at berlin i from my heart forgave you

married in my lifetime you may be well persuaded i have had the princesses of germany taken survey of so far as possible and examined by trusty people what their conduct is their education and so on and so a princess has been found the eldest one of bevern who is well brought up modest and retiring as women ought to be  you will without delay cito write me your mind on this i have purchased the von katsch house the feldmarschall old wartensleben poor kattes grandfather as governor of berlin will get that to live in and his government house fine enough old house or palace built by the great

reached custrin by estafette that same midnight 4th5th february when wolden hofmarschall of the princes court titular goldstick there but with abundance of real functions laid on him had the honor to awaken the crownprince into the joy of reading crownprince instantly despatched by another estafette the requisite responses to papa and mammaof which wolden does not know the contents at all not he the obsequious goldstickbut doubtless they mean yes crownprince appearing so overjoyed at this splendid evidence of papas love as the goldstick could perceive woldens letter to friedrich wilhelm 5th february 1732 in preuss ii part 2d or urkundenouch p 206 mammas answer to the message brought her by this return estafette a mere formal verywell written from the fingers outward exists oeuvres xxvi 65 the rest have happily vanished  what the princes actual amount of joy was we shall learn better from the following three successive utterances of his confidentially despatched to grumkow in the intermediate days before berlin or this duke of lorraine whom our readers and the crownprince are to wait upon with actual sight of papa and the intended came in course grumkows letters to the crownprince in this important interval are not extant nor if they were could we stand them from the princes answers it will be sufficiently apparent what the tenor of them was utterance first is about a week after that of the estafette at midnight  to general feldmarschall von grumkow at potsdam from the crownprince  custrin 11th february 1732  my dear general and friendi was charmed to learn by your letter that my affairs are on so good a footing papa so well satisfied with my professions of obedience and you may depend on it i am docile to follow your advice i will lend myself to whatever is possible for me and provided i can secure the kings favor by my obedience i will do all that is within my power  nevertheless in making my bargain with the duke of bevern manage that the corpus delicti my intended be brought up under her grandmother duchess of brunswickwolfenbuttel ludwig rudolfs spouse an airy coquettish ladylet her be the tutoress and model of my intended o general for i should prefer being made awhat shall we say by a light wifeor to serve under the haughty fontange species of topknot so named from fontange an unfortunate female of louis fourteenths who invented the ornament of my spouse as ludwig rudolf does by all accounts than to have a blockhead who would drive me mad by her ineptitudes and whom i should be ashamed to produce  i beg you labor at this affair when one hates romance heroines as heartily as i do one dreads those virtues of the ferocious type les vertus farouches so terribly aware that they are virtuous and i had rather marry the greatestunnamablein berlin than a devotee with half a dozen ghastly hypocrites cagots at her beck if it were still moglich possible in german to make her calvinist reformee our courtcreed which might have an allaying tendency and at least would make her go with the stream but i doubt thati will insist however that her grandmother have the training of her what you can do to help in this my dear friend i am persuaded you will do  it afflicted me a little that the king still has doubts of me while i am obeying in such a matter diametrically opposite to my own ideas in what way shall i offer stronger proofs i may give myself to the devil it will be to no purpose nothing but the old song over again doubt on doubtdont imagine i am going to disoblige the duke the duchess or the daughter i beseech you i know too well what is due to them and too much respect their merits not to observe the strictest rules of what is propereven if i hated their progeny and them like the pestilence  i hope to speak to you with open heart at berlinyou may think too how i shall be embarrassed having to do the amoroso perhaps without being it and to take an appetite for mute uglinessfor i dont much trust count seckendorfs taste in this articlein spite of his testimonies in tobaccoparliament and elsewhere monsieur once more get this princess to learn by heart the ecole des maris and the ecole des femmes that will do her much more good than true christianity by the late mr arndt johann arndt late this long while back von wahren christenthum magdeburg 1610 if besides she would learn steadiness of humor toujours danser sur un pied learn music and nota bene become rather too free than too virtuousah then my dear general then i should feel some liking for her and a colin marrying a phyllis the couple would be in accordance but if she is stupid naturally i renounce the devil and herit is said she has a sister who at least has common sense why take the eldest if so to the king it must be all one there is also a princess christina marie of eisenach real name being christina wilhelmina but no matter who would be quite my fit and whom i should like to try for in fine i mean to come soon into your countries did come 26th february as we shall see and perhaps will say like caesar veni vidi vici  paragraph of tragic compliments to grumkow we omit letter ends in this way  your baireuth news is very interesting i hope in september next time of a grand problem coming there for wilhelmina my sister will recover her first health if i go travelling i hope to have the consolation of seeing her for a fortnight or three weeks i love her more than my life and for all my obediences to the king surely i shall deserve that recompense the diversions for the duke of lorraine are very well schemed butbut what mortal can now care about them close and seal forster iii 160162 oeuvres de frederic xvi 3739  as to this duke of lorraine just coming he is franz stephan a pleasant young man of twentyfive son of that excellent duke leopold joseph whom young lyttelton of hagley was so taken with while touring in those parts in the congressofsoissons time excellent duke leopold joseph is since dead and this franz has succeeded to himwhat succession there was for lorraine as a dukedom has its neck under the foot of france this great while and is evidently not long for this world old fleury men say has his eye upon it and in fact it was as we shall see eaten up by fleury within four years time and this franz proved the last of all the dukes there let readers notice him a man of high destiny otherwise of whom we are to hear much for ten years past he has lived about vienna being a born cousin of that house grandmother was kaiser leopolds own sister and it is understood nay it is privately settled he is to marry the transcendent archduchess peerless maria theresa herself and is to reap he the whole harvest of that pragmatic sanction sown with such travail of the universe at large may be king of the romans which means successor to the kaisership any day and actual kaiser one day  we may as well say here he did at length achieve these dignities though not quite in the time or on the terms proposed king of the romans old kaiser karl never could quite resolve to make himhaving always hopes of male progeny yet which never came for his peerless bride he waited six years still owing to accidents attachment mutual all the while did then wed 1738 and was the happiest of men and expectant kaisersbut found at length the pragmatic sanction to have been a strange sowing of dragonsteeth and the first harvest reapable from it a world of armed menfor the present he is on a grand tour for instruction and other objects has been in england last and is now getting homewards again to vienna across germany conciliating the courts as he goes a pacific friendly eupeptic young man crownprince friedrich they say took much to him in berlin did not quite swear eternal friendship but kept up some correspondence for a while and once sends him a present of salmonbut to proceed with the utterances to grumkow  utterance second is probably of prior date but introducible here being an accidental fragment with the date lost  to the feldmarschall von grumkow from the crownprince exact date lost   as to what you tell me of the princess of mecklenburg for whom they want a brandenburg princecould not i marry her let her come into this country and think no more of russia she would have a dowry of two or three millions of roublesonly fancy how i could live with that i think that project might succeed the princess is lutheran perhaps she objects to go into the greek churchi find none of these advantages in this princess of bevern who as many people even of the dukes court say is not at all beautiful speaks almost nothing and is given to pouting faisant la fachee the good kaiserinn has so little herself that the sums she could afford her niece would be very moderate fragment given in sechendorfs leben iii 249 u  given to pouting too no certainly your insipidity of brunswick without prospects of ready money dangerous for cagotage not a word to say for herself in company and given to pouting i do not reckon her the eligible article  seckendorf schulenburg grumkow and all hands are busy in this matter geehoing the crownprince towards the mark set before him with or without explosion arrive there he must other goal for him is nonein the mean while it appears illustrious franz of lorraine coming on amid the proper demonstrations through magdeburg and the prussian towns has caught some slight illness and been obliged to pause so that berlin cannot have the happiness of seeing him quite so soon as it expected the high guests invited to meet duke franz especially the high brunswicks are already there high brunswicks bevern with duchess and still more important with son and with daughterinsipid corpus delicti herself has appeared on the scene and grumkow we find has been writing some description of her to the crownprince description of an unfavorable nature below the truth not above it to avert disappointment nay to create some gleam of inverse joy when the actual meeting occurs that is his art in driving the fiery little arab ignominiously yoked to him and it is clear he has overdone it for once this is friedrichs third utterance to him much the most emphatic there is  to the general feldmarschall von grumkow  custrin 19th february 1732  judge my dear general if i can have been much charmed with the description you give of the abominable object of my desires for the love of god disabuse the king in regard to her show him that she is a fool then and let him remember well that fools commonly are the most obstinate of creatures  some months ago he wrote a letter to walden the obsequious goldstick of his giving me the choice of several princesses i hope he will not give himself the lie in that i refer you entirely to the letter which schulenburg will have deliveredlittle schulenburg called here in passing your way all hands busy for there is no hope of wealth no reasoning nor chance of fortune that could change my sentiment as expressed there namely that i will not have her whatever become of me and miserable for miserable it is all one let the king but think that it is not for himself that he is marrying me but for myself nay he too will have a thousand chagrins to see two persons hating one another and the miserablest marriage in the worldto hear their mutual complaints which will be to him so many reproaches for having fashioned the instrument of our yoke as a good christian let him consider if it is well done to wish to force people to cause divorces and to be the occasion of all the sins that an illassorted marriage leads us to commit i am determined to front everything in the world sooner and since things are so you may in some good way apprise the duke of bevern that happen what may i never will have her  i have been unfortunate malheureux all my life and i think it is my destiny to continue so one must be patient and take the time as it comes perhaps a sudden tract of good fortune on the back of all the chagrins i have made profession of ever since i entered this world would have made me too proud in a word happen what will i have nothing to reproach myself with i have suffered sufficiently for an exaggerated crime that of attempting to desertheavensand i will not engage myself to extend my miseries chagrins into future times i have still resourcesa pistolshot can deliver me from my sorrows and my life and i think a merciful god would not damn me for that but taking pity on me would in exchange for a life of wretchedness grant me salvation this is whitherward despair can lead a young person whose blood is not so quiescent as if he were seventy i have a feeling of myself monsieur and perceive that when one hates the methods of force as much as i our boiling blood will carry us always towards extremities   if there are honest people in the world they must think how to save me from one of the most perilous passages i have ever been in i waste

behind in manners and social behavior manieres du savoirvivre that is the candid portrait of this princess you may judge by that dearest sister if i find her to my taste or not the greatest merit she has is that she has procured me the liberty of writing to you which is the one solacement i have in your absence  you never can believe my adorable sister how concerned i am about your happiness all my wishes centre there and every moment of my life i form such wishes you may see by this that i preserve still that sincere friendship which has united our hearts from our tenderest yearsrecognize at least my dear sister that you did me a sensible wrong when you suspected me of fickleness towards you and believed false reports of my listening to talebearers me who love only you and whom neither absence nor lying rumors could change in respect of you at least dont again believe such things on my score and never mistrust me till you have had clear proofor till god has forsaken me and i have

treated of between that their princess here present and this his crownprince likewise here is really a thing to their mind serene spouses answer to the effect yea surely very much upon which they all solemnly ascend to the royal apartments upstairs where we have seen wilhelmina dancing before now where lorraine wurtemberg and the other sublimities are in waiting lorraine and the sublimities form a semicircle with the two majesties and pair of young creatures in the centre you young creatures you are of one intention with your parents in this matter alas there is no doubt of it pledge yourselves then by exchange of rings said his majesty with due business brevity the rings are exchanged majesty embraces the two young creatures with great tenderness as do queen and serenities and then all the

the honor of your good graces and believe my charming sister that never brother in the world loved with such tenderness a sister so charming as mine in short believe dear sister that without compliments and in literal truth i am yours wholly tout a vous  friderich  ib xxvii part 1st p 5   this is the betrothal of the crownprince to an insipidity of brunswick insipiditys private feelings perhaps of a languidly glad sort are not known to us crownprinces we have in part seen he has decided to accept his fate without a murmur farther against his poor bride or her qualities not a word more in the schloss of berlin amid such tempests of female gossip mamma still secretly corresponding with england he has to be very reserved on this head especially it is understood he did not in his heart nearly so much dislike the insipid princess as he wished papa to think he did  duke franz of lorraine went off above a week ago on the saturday following the betrothal an amiable serene young gentleman well liked by the crownprince and everybody he avoided the saxon court though passing near it on his way to old kurmainz which is a sign thinks fassmann that mutual matters are on a weak footing in that quarterpragmatic sanction never accepted there and plenty of intricacies existing crownprince friedrich may now go to ruppin and the regiment goltz his business and destinies being now all reduced to a steady conditionsteady sky rather leaden instead of the tempestuous thunderandlightning weather which there heretofore was leaden sky he if left well to himself will perhaps brighten a little study will be possible to him improvement of his own faculties at any rate it is much his determination outwardly besides drilling the regiment goltz he will have a steady correspondence to keep up with his brunswick charmerlet him see that he be not slack in that     chapter ii  small incidents at ruppin  friedrich after some farther pause in berlin till things were got ready for him went to ruppin this is in the spring of 1732 still in berlin 6th march dates from nauen in the ruppin neighborhood for the first time 25th april 1732 among his letters yet extant preuss oeuvres de frederic  xxvii part lst p 4 xvi 49 and he contin  his residence there till august 1736 four important years of young life of which we must endeavor to give in some intelligible condition what traces go hovering about in such records as there are  ruppin where lies the main part of the regiment goltz and where the crownprince colonel of it dwells is a quiet dull little town in that northwestern region inhabitants grown at this day to be 10000 are perhaps guessable then at 2000 regiment goltz daily rolls its drums in ruppin town otherwise lifeless enough except on marketdays and the grandest event ever known in it this removal of the crownprince thitherwhich is doubtless much a theme and proud temporary miracle to ruppin at present of society there or in the neighborhood for such a resident we hear nothing  quiet ruppin stands in grassy flat country much of which is natural moor and less of it reclaimed at that time than now the environs except that they are a bit of the earth and have a bit of the sky over them do not set up for loveliness natural woods abound in that region also peatbogs not yet drained and fishy lakes and meres of a dark complexion plenteous cattle there are pigs among themthicksoled husbandmen inarticulately toiling and moiling some glassfurnaces a royal establishment are the only manufactures we hear of not a picturesque country but a quiet and innocent where work is cut out and one hopes to be well left alone after doing it this crownprince has been in far less desirable localities  he had a reasonable house two houses made into one for him in the place he laid out for himself a garden in the outskirts with what they call a temple in itsome more or less ornamental gardenhousefrom which i have read of his letting off rockets in a summer twilight rockets to amuse a small dinnerparty i should guessdinner of officers such as he had weekly or twice a week on stiller evenings we can fancy him there in solitude reading meditative or musically flutinglooking out upon the silent death of day how the summer gloaming steals over the moorlands and over all lands shutting up the toil of mortals their very flocks and herds collapsing into silence and the big skies and endless times overarching him and them with thoughts perhaps sombre enough now and then but profitable if he face them piously  his fathers affection is returning would so fain return if it durst but the heart of papa has been sadly torn up it is too good news to be quite believed that he has a son grown wise and doing sonlike rumor also is very busy rumor and the tobaccoparliament for or against a little rumor is capable of stirring up great storms in the suspicious paternal mind all along during friedrichs abode at ruppin this is a constantly recurring weathersymptom very grievous now and then not to be guarded against by any precautionthough steady persistence in the proper precaution will abate it and as good as remove it in course of time already friedrich wilhelm begins to understand that there is much in this fritzwho knows how much though of a different type from papasand that it will be better if he and papa so discrepant in type and ticklishly related otherwise live not too constantly together as heretofore which is emphatically the crownprinces notion too  i perceive he read a great deal at ruppin what books i know not specially but judge them to be of more serious solid quality than formerly and that his reading is now generally a kind of studying as well not the express sciences or technologies not these in any sortexcept the military and that an express exception these he never cared for or regarded as the noble knowledges for a king or man history and moral speculation what mankind have done and been in this world so far as history will give one any glimpse of that and what the wisest men poetical or other have thought about mankind and their world this is what he evidently had the appetite for appetite insatiable which lasted with him to the very end of his days fontenelle rollin voltaire all the then french lights and gradually others that lay deeper in the firmamentwhat suppers of the gods one may privately have at ruppin without expense of wine such an opportunity for reading he had never had before  in his soldier business he is punctual assiduous having an interest to shine that way and is in fact approvable as a practical officer and soldier by the strictest judge then living reads on soldiering withal studious to know the rationale of it the ancient and modern methods of it the essential from the unessential in it to understand it thoroughlywhich he got to do one already hears of conferences correspondences with the old dessauer on this head account of the siege of stralsund with plans with didactic commentaries drawn up by that gunpowder sage for behoof of the crownprince did actually exist though i know not what has become of it now and afterwards this crownprince must have been a great military reader from caesars commentaries and earlier to the chevalier folard and the marquis feuquiere memoires sur la guerre specially on the wars of louis xiv in which feuquiere had himself shone a new book at this time amsterdam 1731 first complete edition is paris 1770 4 vols 4to at ruppin and afterwards a chief favorite with friedrich from epaminondas at leuctra to charles xii at pultawa all manner of military histories we perceive are at his fingerends and he has penetrated into the essential heart of each and learnt what it had to teach him something of this how much we know not began at ruppin and it did not end again  on the whole friedrich is prepared to distinguish himself henceforth by strictly conforming in all outward particulars possible to the paternal will and becoming the most obedient of sons partly from policy and necessity partly also from loyalty for he loves his rugged father and begins to perceive that there is more sense in his peremptory notions than at first appeared the young man is himself rather wild as we have seen with plenty of youthful petulance and longings after forbidden fruit and then he lives in an element of gossip his whole life enveloped in a vast dionysiusear every word and action liable to be debated in tobaccoparliament he is very scarce of money too papas allowance being extremely moderate not above 6000 thalers 900 pounds says seckendorf once forster iii 114 seckendorf to prince eugene there will be contradictions enough to settle caution silence every kind of prudence will be much recommendable  in all outward particulars the crownprince will conform in the inward he will exercise a judgment and if he cannot conform will at least be careful to hide to do his commandant duties at ruppin and avoid offences is much his determination we observe he takes great charge of his mens health has the regiment goltz in a shiningly exact condition at the grand reviewsis very industrious now and afterwards to get tall recruits as a dainty to papa knows that nothing in nature is so sure of conciliating that strange old gentleman corresponds accordingly in distant quarters lays out now and afterwards sums far too heavy for his means upon tall recruits for papa but it is good to conciliate in that quarter by every method and at every expenseargus of tobaccoparliament still watching one there and rumor needing to be industriously dealt with difficult to keep down such so far as we can gather is the general figure of friedrichs life at ruppin specific facts of it anecdotes about it are few in those dim books are uncertain as to truth and without importance whether true or not for all his gravity and colonelship it would appear the old spirit of frolic has not quitted him here are two small incidents pointing that way which stand on record credible enough though vague and without importance otherwise incident first is to the following feeble effect indisputable though extremely unmomentous regiment goltz it appears used to have gold trimmings the colonel crownprince petitioned that they might be of silver which he liked better papa answers yes regiment goltz gets its new regimentals done in silver the colonel proposes they shall solemnly burn their old regimentals and they do it the officers of them sub dio perhaps in the princes garden stripping successively in the temple there with such degree of genial humor loud laughter or at least boisterous mocksolemnity as may be in them this is a true incident of the princes history though a small one  incident second is of slightly more significance and intimates not being quite alone in its kind a questionable habit or method the crownprince must have had of dealing with clerical persons hereabouts when they proved troublesome here are no fewer than three such persons or parsons of the ruppin country who got mischief by him how the first gave offence shall be seen and how he was punished offences of the second and the third we can only guess to have been perhaps pulpitrebukes of said punishments perhaps general preaching against military levities want of piety nay open sinfulness in thoughtless young men with cockades whereby the thoughtless young men were again driven to think of nocturnal charivari we will give the story in dr buschings own words who looks before and after to great distances in a way worth attending to the herr doctor an endless collector and compiler on all manner of subjects is very authentic always and does not want for natural sense but he is also very crudeand here and there not far from stupid such his continual haste and slobbery manner of working up those hundred and odd volumes of hissee his autobiography which forms beitrage b vi the biggest and last volume  the sanguinecholeric temperament of friedrich says this doctor drove him in his youth to sensual enjoyments and wild amusements of different kinds in his middle age to fiery enterprises and in his old years to decisions and actions of a rigorous and vehement nature yet so that the primary form of utterance as seen in his youth never altogether ceased with him there are people still among us 1788 who have had in their own experience knowledge of his youthful pranks and yet more are living who know that he himself at table would gayly recount what merry strokes were done by him or by his order in those young years to give an instance or two  while he was at neuruppin as colonel of the infantry regiment there the chaplain of it sometimes waited upon him about the time of dinnerhaving been used to dine occasionally with the former colonel the crownprince however put him always off did not ask him to dinner spoke contemptuously of him in presence of the officers the chaplain was so inconsiderate he took to girding at the crownprince in his sermons once on a time preached he one day there was herod who had herodias to dance before him and hehe gave her john the baptists head for her pains this herod busching says was understood to mean and meant the crownprince herodias the merry corps of officers who made sport for him john the baptists head was no other than the chaplain not invited to dinner to punish him for such a sally the crownprince with the young officers of his regiment went one night to the chaplains house somewhere hard by with cowsgrass adjoining to it as we see and first they knocked in the windows of his sleepingroom upon him hingewindows glass not entirely broken we may hope next there were crackers schwarmer enthusiasts so to speak thrown in upon him and thereby the chaplain and his poor wife more or less in an interesting condition poor woman were driven out into the courtyard and at last into the dungheap thereand so left with their head on a charger to that terrible extent  that is buschings version of the story no doubt substantially correct of which there are traces in other quartersfor it went farther than ruppin and the crownprince had like to have got into trouble from it here is piety said rumor carrying it to tobaccoparliament the crownprince plaintively assures grumkow that it was the officers and that they got punished for it a likely story the princes  when king friedrich in his old days recounted this after dinner in his merry tone he was well pleased that the guests and even the pages and valets behind his back laughed aloud at it not a pious old king doctor still less an orthodox one the doctor continues in a like style at nauen where part of his regiment lay he hadby means of herr von der groben his firstlieutenant much a comrade of his as we otherwise perceivethe diaconus of nauen and his wife hunted out of bed and thrown into terror of their lives one nightoffence of the diaconus not specified nay he himself once pitched his goldheaded stick through salpius the church inspectors windowoffence again not specified or perhaps merely for a little artillery practiceand the throw was so dexterous that it merely made a round hole in the glass stick was lying on the floor and the prince on some excuse or other sent for it next morning margraf heinrich of schwedt continues the doctor very trustworthy on points of fact was a diligent helper in such operations kaiserling whom we shall hear of firstlieutenant von der groben these were prime hands lieutenant buddenbrock old feldmarschalls son used in his old days when himself grown high in rank and dining with the king to be appealed to as witness for the truth of these stories busching beitrage zu der lebensgeschichte denkwurdiger personen v 1921 vol vwholly occupied with friedrich ii king of prussia halle 1788is accessible in french and other languages many details and as buschings wont is few or none not authentic are to be found in it a very great secret spleen against friedrich is also traceablefor which the doctor may have had his reasons not obligatory upon readers of the doctor the truth is friedrich never took the least special notice of him merely employed and promoted him when expedient for both parties and he really was a man of considerable worth in an extremely crude form  these are the two incidents at ruppin in such light as they have and these are all opulent history yields from a ton of broken nails these two brass farthings and shuts her pocket on us again a crownprince given to frolic among other things though aware that gravity would beseem him better much gay bantering humor in him cracklings radiationswhich he is bound to keep well under cover in present circumstances    chapter iii  the salzburgers  for three years past there has been much rumor over germany of a strange affair going on in the remote austrian quarter down in salzburg and its fabulous tyrolese valleys salzburg city and territory has an archbishop not theoretically austrian but sovereign prince so styled it is from him and his orthodoxies and pranks with his sovereign crosier that the noise originates strange rumor of a body of the population discovered to be protestant among the remote mountains and getting miserably illused by the right reverend father in those parts which rumor of a singular romantic religious interest for the general protestant world proves to be but too well founded it has come forth in the form of practical complaint to the corpus evangelicorum at the diet without result from the corpus complaint to various personsin fine to his majesty friedrich wilhelm with result  with result at last actual emigration of the salzburgers and germanyin these very days while the crownprince is at berlin betrothing himself and franz of lorraine witnessing the exercitia and wonders theresees a singular phenomenon of a touching idyllic nature going on and has not yet quite forgotten it in our days salzburg emigration was all in motion flowing steadily onwards by various routes towards berlin at the time the betrothal took place and seven weeks after that event when the crownprince had gone to ruppin and again could only hear of it the first instalment of emigrants arrived bodily at the gates of berlin 30th april at four in the afternoon majesty himself and all the world going out to witness it with something of a poetic almost of a psalmist feeling as well as with a practical on the part of his majesty first instalment this copiously followed by others all that year and flowing on in smaller rills and drippings for several years more till it got completed a notable phenomenon full of lively picturesque and other interest to brandenburg and germanywhich was not forgotten by the crownprince in coming years as we shall transiently find nay which all germany still remembers and even occasionally sings of which this is in brief the history  the salzburg country northeastern slope of the tyrol donau draining that side of it etsch or adige the italian side is celebrated by the tourist for its airy beauty rocky mountains smooth green valleys and swiftrushing streams perhaps some readers have wandered to badgastein or ischl in these nomadic summers have looked into salzburg berchtesgaden and the bavarianaustrian boundarylands seen the woodenclock makings saltworks toymanufactures of those simple people in their slouchhats and can bear some testimony to the phenomena of nature there salzburg is the archbishops city metropolis of his bit of sovereignty that then was tolerable description of it in the baron riesbecks travels through germany london 1787 translation by maty 3 vols 8vo i 124222whose details otherwise on this emigration business are of no authenticity or value a kind of playactor and miscellaneous newspaperman in that time not so opulent to his class as ours is who takes the title of baron on this occasion of coming out with a book of imaginary travels had personally lived practising the miscellaneous arts about lintz and salzburgand may be heard on the look of the country if on little else a romantic city far off among its beautiful mountains shadowing itself in the salza river which rushes down into the inn into the donau now becoming great with the tribute of so many valleys salzburg we have not known hitherto except as the fabulous restingplace of kaiser barbarossa but we are now slightly to see it in a practical light and mark how the memory of friedrich wilhelm makes an incidental lodgment for itself there  it is well known there was extensive protestantism once in those countries prior to the thirtyyears war the fair chance was austria too would all become protestant an extensive minority among all ranks of men in austria too definable as the serious intelligence of mankind in those countries having clearly adopted it whom the others were sure to follow in all ranks of men only not in the highest rank which was pleased rather to continue official and papal highest rank had its thirtyyears war its sleek fathers lummerlein and hyacinth in jesuit serge its terrible fathers wallenstein in chainarmor and by working late and early then and afterwards did manage at length to trample out protestantismthey know with what advantage by this time trample out protestantism or drive it into remote nooks where under sad conditions it might protract an unnoticed existence in the imperial freetowns ulm augsburg and the like protestantism continued and under hard conditions contrives to continue but in the country parts except in unnoticed nooks it is extinct salzburg country is one of those nooks an extensive cryptoprotestantism lodging under the simple slouchhats in the remote valleys there protestantism peaceably kept concealed hurting nobody wholesomely forwarding the woodenclock manufacture and arable or grazier husbandries of those poor people more harmless sons of adam probably did not breathe the vital air than those dissentient salzburgers generation after generation of them giving offence to no creature  successive archbishops had known of this cryptoprotestantism and in remote periods had made occasional slight attempts upon it but none at all for a long time past all attempts that way as ineffectual for any purpose but stirring up strife had been discontinued for many generations buchholz i 148151 and the cryptoprotestantism was again become a mythical romantic object ignored by official persons however in 1727 there came a new archbishop one firmian count firmian by secular quality of a strict lean character zealous rather than wise who had brought his orthodoxies with him in a rigid and very lean form  right reverend firmian had not been long in salzburg till he smelt out the cryptoprotestantism and determined to haul it forth from the mythical condition into the practical and in fact to see his lawbeagles there worry it to death as they ought hence the rumors that had risen over germany in 1729 lawterriers penetrating into human cottages in those remote salzburg valleys smelling out some german bible or devout book making lists of biblereading cottagers haling them to the right reverend fatheringod thence to prison since they would not undertake to cease reading with fine with confiscation tribulation for the peaceable salzburgers respectful creatures doffing their slouchhats almost to mankind in general were entirely obstinate in that matter of the bible cannot your reverence must not dare not and went to prison or whithersoever rather a wide cry rising let us sell our possessions and leave salzburg then according to treaty of westphalia article soandso treaty of westphalia leave salzburg shrieked the right reverend father are we getting into open mutiny then open extensive mutiny shrieked he borrowed a couple of austrian regimentskaiser and we always on the pleasantest termsand marched the most refractory of his salzburgers over the frontiers retaining their properties and families whereupon noise rose louder and louder  refractory salzburgers sent deputies to the diet appealed complained to the corpus evangelicorum treaty of westphalia in handwithout result corpus having verified matters complained to the kaiser to the right reverend father the kaiser intent on getting his pragmatic sanction through the diet and anxious to offend nobody at present gave good words but did nothing the right reverend father answered a letter or two from the corpus then said at last he wished to close the correspondence had the honor to beand answered no farther when written to corpus was without result so it lasted through 1730 rumor which rose in 1729 waxing ever louder into practicable or impracticable shape through that next year tribulation increasing in salzburg and noise among mankind in the end of 1730 the salzburgers sent two deputies to friedrich wilhelm at berlin solidhearted thicksoled men able to answer for themselves and give real account of salzburg and the phenomena this brought matters into a practicable state  are you actual protestants the treaty of westphalia applicable to you not mere fanatic mystics as right reverend firmian asserts protectible by no treaty that was friedrich wilhelms first question and he set his two chief berlin clergymen learned roloff one of them a divine of much fame to catechise the two salzburg deputies and report upon the point their report dated berlin 30th november 1730 with specimens of the main questions i have read fassmann pp 446448 and can fully certify along with roloff and friend that here are orthodox protestants apparently of very pious peaceable nature suffering hard wrongorthodox beyond doubt and covered by the treaty of westphalia whereupon his majesty dismisses them with assurance return and say there shall be helpand straightway lays hand on the business strong swift steady hand as usual with a view that way  salzburg being now a clear case friedrich wilhelm writes to the kaiser to the king of england king of denmarkorders preparations to be made in preussen vacant messuages to be surveyed moneys to be laid upbids his man at the regensburg diet signify that unless this thing is rectified his prussian majesty will see himself necessitated to take effectual steps reprisals the first step according to the old method of his prussian majesty rumor of the salzburg protestants rises higher and higher kaiser intent on conciliating every corpus evangelical and other for his pragmatic sanctions sake admonishes right reverend firmian intimates at last to him that he will actually have to let those poor people emigrate if they demand it treaty of westphalia being express in the end of 1731 it has come thus far  emigrate says your imperial majesty well they shall emigrate answers firmian the sooner the better and straightway in the dead of winter marches in convenient divisions some nine hundred of them over the frontiers go about your business then emigrateto the old one if you likeand our properties our goods and chattels ask theybe thankful you have kept your skins emigrate i say and the poor nine hundred had to go out in the rigor of winter hoary old men among them and women coming near their time and seek quarters in the wide world mostly unknown to them truly firmian is an orthodox herr acquainted with the laws of fair usage and the time of day the sleeping barbarossa does not awaken upon him within the hill herebut in the roncalic fields long ago i should not have liked to stand in his shoes  friedrich wilhelm on this procedure at salzburg intimates to his halberstadt and minden catholic gentlemen that their establishments must be locked up and incomings suspended that they can apply to the right reverend firmian upon itand bids his man at regensburg signify to the diet that such is the course adopted here right reverend firmian has to hold his hand finds both that there shall be emigration and that it must go forward on human terms not inhuman and that in fact the treaty of westphalia will have to guide it not he henceforth those poor ousted salzburgers cower into the bavarian cities till the weather mend and his prussian majestys arrangements be complete for their brethren and them  his prussian majesty has been maturing his plans all this whilegathering moneys getting lands ready we saw him hanging schlubhut in the autumn of 1731 who had peculated from said moneys and surveying preussen under storms of thunder and rain on one occasion preussen is to be the place for these people tilsit and memel region same where the big fight of tannenberg and ruin of the teutsch ritters took place in that fine fertile country there are homes got ready for this emigration out of salzburg  long ago at the beginning of this history did not the reader hear of a pestilence in prussian lithuania pestilence in old king friedrichs time for which the then crownprince now majesty friedrich wilhelm vainly solicited help from the treasury and only brought about partial change of ministry and no help fiftytwo towns were more or less entirely depopulated hundreds of thousands of fertile acres fell to waste again the hands that had ploughed them being swept away the new majesty so soon as ever the swedish war was got rid of took this matter diligently in hand built up the fiftytwo ruined towns issued proclamations once and again years 1719 1721 to the wetterau to switzerland saxony schwaben buchholz i 148 inviting colonists to come and on favorable terms till and reap there his terms are favorable wellconsidered and are honestly kept he has a fixed set of terms for colonists their roadexpenses thither so much a day allowed each travelling soul homesteads ploughing implements cattle land await them at their journeys end their rent and services accurately specified are light not heavy and immunities from this and that are granted them for certain years till they get well nestled excellent arrangements and his majesty has in fact got about 20000 families in that way and still there is room for thousands more so that if the tyrannous firmian took to tribulating salzburg in that manner heaven had provided remedies and a prussian majesty heaven is very opulent has alchemy to change the ugliest substances into beautifulest privately to his majesty for months back this salzburg emigration is a most manageable matter manage well it will be a godsend to his majesty and fit as by preestablished harmony into the ancient prussian sorrow and two afflictions well put together shall become a consolation as the proverb promises go along then right reverend firmian with your emigration there only no foulplay in itor halberstadt and minden get lockedfor the rest of the matter we will undertake  and so february 2d 1732 friedrich wilhelms proclamation copy of it in mauvillon february 1732 ii 311 flew abroad over the world brief and businesslike cheering to all but firmianto this purport come ye poor salzburgers there are homes provided for you apply at regensburg at halle commissaries are appointed will take charge of your long march and you be kind all christian german princes do not hinder them and me and in a few days farther still early in february for the matter is all ready before proclaiming an actual prussian commissary hangs out his announcements and officialities at donauworth old city known to us within reach of the salzburg boundaries collects in a week or two his first lot of emigrants near a thousand strong and fairly takes the road with them  a long road and a strange i think above five hundred miles before we get to halle within prussian land and then seven hundred more to our place there in the utmost east men women infants and hoary grandfathers are heremost of their property soldstill on ruinous conditions think of it your majesty their poor bits of preciosities and heirlooms they have with them made up in succinct bundles stowed on ticketed baggagewains some have their own poor cart and horse to carry the too old and the too young those that cannot walk a pilgrimage like that of the children of israel such a pilgrim caravan as was seldom heard of in our western countries those poor succinct bundles the making of them up and stowing of them the pangs of simple hearts in those remote native valleys the tears that were not seen the cries that were addressed to god only and then at last the actual turning out of the poor caravan in silently practical condition staff in hand no audible complaint heard from it ready to march practically marching herewhich of us can think of it without emotion sad and yet in a sort blessed  every emigrant man has four groschen a day fourpence odd allowed him for road expenses every woman three groschen every child two and regularity itself in the shape of prussian commissaries presides over it such marching of the salzburgers host after host of them by various routes from february onwards above seven thousand of them this year and ten thousand more that gradually followedwas heard of at all german firesides and in all european lands a phenomenon much filling the general ear and imagination especially at the first emergence of it we will give from poor old authentic fassmann as if caught up by some sudden photograph apparatus a rude but undeniable glimpse or two into the actuality of this business the reader will in that way sufficiently conceive it for himself  glimpse first is of an emigrant party arriving in the cold february days of 1732 at nordlingen protestant freetown in bavaria three hundred of them first section i think of those nine hundred who were packed away unceremoniously by firmian last winter and have been wandering about bavaria lodging in kaufbeuern and various preliminary towns till the prussian arrangements became definite prussian commissaries are by this time got to donauworth but these poor salzburgers are ahead of them wandering under the voluntary principle as yet nordlingen in bavaria is an old imperial freetown protestantism not suppressed there as it has been all round scene of some memorable fighting in the thirtyyears war especially of a bad defeat to the swedes and bernhard of weimar the worst they had in the course of that bad business the salzburgers are in number three hundred and thirtyone time first days of february 1732 weather very cold and raw the charitable protestant town has been expecting such an advent  two chief clergymen and the schoolmaster and scholars with some hundreds of citizens and many young people went out to meet them there in the open field stood the salzburgers with their wives and their little ones with their bullockcarts and baggagewains pilgriming towards unknown parts of the earth come in ye blessed of the lord why stand ye without said the parson solemnly by way of welcome and addressed a discourse to them devout and yet human true every word of it enough to draw tears from any fassmann that were therefassmann and we not far from weeping without words thereupon they ranked themselves two and two and marched into the town straight to the church i conjecture town all out to participate and there the two reverend gentlemen successively addressed them again from appropriate texts text of the first reverend gentleman was and every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my names sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life matthew xix 29 text of the second was now the lord had said unto abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house unto a land that i will show thee genesis xii 1 excellent texts well handled let us hopeespecially with brevity after which the strangers were distributed some into publichouses others taken home by the citizens to lodge  out of the spital there was distributed to each person for the first three days a halfpound of fleshmeat bread and a measure of beer the remaining days they got in money six creutzers twopence each and bread on sunday at the churchdoors there was a collection no less than eight hundred gulden 80 pounds population say three thousand for this object at sermon they were put into the central part of the church all nordlingen lovingly encompassing them and were taught in two sermons texts not given what the true church is built of and ought to have nordlingen copiously shedding tears the while viele thranen vergossen as it well might going to church and coming from it each landlord walked ahead of his party party followed two and two on other days there was much catechising of them at different parts of the townorthodox enough you see nothing of superstition or fanaticism in the poor peoplethey made a good testimony of their evangelical truth  the baggagewagons which they had with them ten in number upon which some of their old people sat were brought into the town the baggage was unloaded and the packages two hundred and eightyone of them in all for fassmann is photography itself were locked in the zollhaus over and above what they got from the spital the churchcollection and the townchest citizens were liberal daily sent them food or daily had them by fours and fives to their own houses to meat and so let them wait for the prussian commissary who is just at hand they would not part from one another these three hundred and thirtyone says fassmann though their reunion was but of that accidental nature fassmann pp 439 440  glimpse second not dated perhaps some ten days later and a prussian commissary with this party  on their getting to the anspach territory there was so incredible a joy at the arrival of these exiled brothers in the faith glaubensbruder that in all places almost in the smallest hamlets the bells were set atolling and nothing was heard but a peal of welcome from far and near prussian commissary when about quitting anspach asked leave to pass through bamberg bishop of bamberg too orthodox a gentleman declined so the commissary had to go by nurnberg and baireuth ask not if his welcome was good in those protestant places at erlangen fifteen miles from nurnberg where are french protestants and a dowager margravine of baireuthwidow of wilhelminas fatherinlaws predecessor if the reader can count that daughter of weissenfels who was for marrying wilhelmina not long sinceat erlangen the serene dowager snatched up fifty of them into her own house for christian refection and burghers of means had twelve fifteen and even eighteen of them following such example set nay certain french citizens prosperous and childless besieged the prussian commissary to allow them a few salzburg children for adoption especially one frenchman was extremely urgent and specific but the commissary not having any order was obliged to refuse fassmann p 441 these must have been interesting days for the two young margravines forwarding papas poor pilgrims in that manner  at baireuth other side of nurnberg it was towards good friday when the pilgrims under their commissarius arrived they were lodged in the villages about but came copiously into the town came all in a body to church on good friday and at coming out were one and all carried off to dinner a very scramble arising among the townsfolk to get hold of pilgrims and dine them vast numbers were carried to the schloss one figures wilhelmina among them figures the hereditary prince and old margraf their treatment there was beyond belief says fassmann not only dinner of the amplest quality and quantity but much money added and other gifts from baireuth the route is towards gera and thuringen circling the bamberg territory readers remember gera where the gera bond was madeat gera a commercial gentleman dined the whole party in his own premises and his wife gave four groschen to each individual of them other two persons brothers in the place doing the like one of the poor pilgrim women had been brought to bed on the journey a day or two before the commissarius lodged her in his own inn for greater safety commissarius returning to his inn finds she is off nobody at first can tell him whither a lady of quality vormehme dame has quietly sent her carriage for the poor pilgrim sister and has her in the right softest keeping no end to peoples kindness many wept aloud sobbing out is this all the help we can give commissarius said there will others come shortly them also you can help  in this manner march these pilgrims from donauworth by anspach nurnberg baireuth through gera zeitz weissenfels to halle where they are on prussian ground and within few days of berlin other towns not upon the first straight route to berlin demand to have a share in these grand things share is willingly conceded thus the pilgrims what has its obvious advantages march by a good variety of routes through augsburg ulm instead of donauworth thence to frankfurt from frankfurt some direct to leipzig some through cassel hanover brunswick by halberstadt and magdeburg instead of halle starting all at salzburg landing all at berlin their routes spread over the map of germany in the intermediate space  weissenfels town and duke distinguished themselves by liberality especially the duke didpoor old drinking duke very protestant all these saxon princes except the apostate or pseudoapostate the physically strong for sad political reasons in weissenfels town while the pilgrim procession walked a certain rude foreign fellow flaxpedler by trade hecheltrager hawker of flaxcombs or hecklesis oftenest a slavonic austrian i am told by creed papist or worse said floutingly the archbishop ought to have flung you all into the river you upon which a menial servant of the dukes suddenly broke in upon him in the way of actuality the whole crowd blazing into flame and the pedler would certainly have got irreparable damage had not the townguard instantly hooked him away  april 21st 1732 the first actual body a good nine hundred strong buchholz i 156 got to halle where they were received with devout jubilee psalmsinging spiritual and corporeal refection as at nordlingen and the other stages archidiaconus franke being prominent in iti have no doubt a connection of that chien de franke whom wilhelmina used to know they were lodged in the waisenhaus old frankes orphanhouse official list of them was drawn up here with the fit specificality and after three days they took the road again for berlin useful buchholz then a very little boy remembers the arrival of a body of these salzburgers not this but a later one in august which passed through his native village pritzwalk in the priegnitz how village and village authorities were all awake with opened stores and hearts how his father the village parson preached at five in the afternoon the same buchholz coming afterwards to college at halle had the pleasure of discovering two of the commissaries two of the three who had mainly superintended in this salzburg pilgrimage let the reader also take a glance at them as specimens worth notice  commissarius first herr von reck was a nobleman from the hanover country of very great piety who after his commission was done settled at halle and lived there without servant in privacy from the small means he hadseeking his sole satisfaction in attendance on the theological and ascetic collegelectures where i used to see him constantly in my student time  commissarius second herr gobel was a medical man by profession and had the regular degree of doctor but was in no necessity to apply his talents to the gaining of bread his zeal for religion had moved him to undertake this commission both these gentlemen i have often seen in my youth but do not tell you what they were like farther and both their christian names have escaped me  a third commissarius was of preussen and had religiousliterary tendencies i suppose these three served gratisvolunteers but no doubt under oath and tied by strict enough prussian law physician chaplain roadguide here they are probably of supreme quality ready to our hand buchholz neueste preussischbrandenburgische geschichte berlin 1775 2 vols 4to i 155 n  buchholz after his student time became a poor countryschoolmaster and then a poor countryparson in his native altmark his poor book is of innocent clear faithful nature with some vein of unconscious geniality in it here and therea book by no means so destitute of human worth as some that have superseded it this was posthumous this newest history and has a life of the author prefixed he has four previous volumes on the ancient history of brandenburg which are not known to meabout the year 1745 there were four poor schoolmasters in that region two at havelberg one at seehausen one at werben of extremely studious turn who in spite of the elbe which ran between used to meet on stated nights for colloquy for interchange of books and the like one of them the werben one was this buchholz another seehausen was the winckelmann so celebrated in after years a third one of the havelberg pair went into mecklenburg in a year or two as tutor to karl ludwig the prince of strelitzs childrenwhom also mark for the youngest of these strelitz children was no other than the actual old queen charlotte ours and george iiis just ready for him with her hornbooks about that time let the poor man have what honor he can from that circumstance prince karl ludwig rather a foolishlooking creature we may fall in with personally by and by  it was the 30th april 1732 seven weeks and a day since crownprince friedrichs betrothal that this first body of salzburg emigrants nine hundred strong arrived at berlin four in the afternoon at the brandenburg gate official persons nay majesty himself or perhaps both majesties waiting there to receive them yes ye poor footsore mortals there is the dread king himself stoutish short figure in blue uniform and white wig strawcolored waistcoat and white gaiters stands uncommonly firm on his feet reddish bluereddish face with eyes that pierce through a man look upon him and yet live if you are true men his majestys reception of these poor people could not but be good nothing now wanting in the formal kind but better far in all the essentialities of it there had not been hitherto nor was henceforth the least flaw this salzburg pilgrimage has found for itself and will find regulation guidance ever a steppingstone at the needful place a paved road so far as human regularity and punctuality could pave one that is his majestys shining merit next sunday after sermon they this first lot of salzburgers were publicly catechised in church and all the world could hear their pertinent answers given often in the very scripture texts or express words of luther  his majesty more than once took survey of these pilgrimage divisions when they got to berlin a pleasant sight if there were leisure otherwise on various occasions too her majesty had large parties of them over to monbijou to supper there in the fine gardens and gave them bibles among other gifts if in want of bibles through firmians industry her majesty was charity itself charity and grace combined among these pilgrims on one occasion she picked out a handsome young lass among them and had painter pesne over to take her portrait handsome lass by pesne in her tyrolese hat shone thenceforth on the walls of monbijou and fashion thereupon took up the tyrolese hat which has been much worn since by the beautiful part of the creation says buchholz but how many changes they have introduced in it no pen can trace  at berlin the commissarius ceased and there was usually given the pilgrims a candidatus theologiae who was to conduct them the rest of the way and be their clergyman when once settled five hundred long miles still some were shipped at stettin mostly they marched stage after stagefour groschen a day at the farther end they found all ready tight cottages tillable fields all implements furnished and stockeven to federvieh or chanticleer with a modicum of hens old neighbors and such as liked each other were put together fields grew green again desolate scrubs and scrags yielding to grass and corn wooden clocks even came to viewfor berchtesgaden neighbors also emigrated and swiss came and bavarians and frenchand old trades were revived in those new localities  something beautifully realidyllic in all this surelyyet do not fancy that it all went on like clockwork that there were not jarrings at every step as is the way in things real of the prussian minister chiefly concerned in settling this new colony i have heard one saying forced out of him in some pressure there must be somebody for a scoldingstock and scapegoat i will be it then and then the salzburg officials what a humor they were in no letters allowed from those poor emigrants the wickedest rumors circulated about them all cut to pieces by inroad of the poles pressed for soldiers by the prussian drillsergeant all flung into the lakes and stagnant waters there drowned to the last individual and so on truth nevertheless did slowly pierce through and the grosse wirth our idyllicreal friedrich wilhelm was wanting in nothing lists of their unjust losses in salzburg were on his majestys order made out and authenticated by the many who had suffered in that way thereforced to sell at a days notice and the likewith these his majesty was diligent in the imperial court and did get what human industry could of compensation a part but not the whole contradictory noises had to abate in the end sound purpose built on fact and the laws of nature carried it lies vituperations rumors and delusion sank to zero and the true result remained in 1738 the salzburg emigrant community in preussen held in all their churches a day of thanksgiving and admitted piously that heavens blessing of a truth had been upon this king and them there we leave them a useful solid population ever since in those parts increased by this time we know not how many fold  it cost friedrich wilhelm enormous sums say the old histories probably ten tons of goldthat is to say ten hundred thousand thalers almost 150000 pounds no less but he lived to see it amply repaid even in his own time how much more amply sincebeing a man skilful in investments to a high degree indeed fancy 150000 pounds invested there in the bank of nature herself and a hundred millions invested say at balaclava in the bank of newspaper rumor and the respective rates of interest they will yield a million years hence this was the most idyllic of friedrich wilhelms feats and a very real one the while  we have only to add or repeat that salzburgers to the number of about 7000 souls arrived at their place this first year and in the year or two following less noted by the public but faring steadily forward upon their four groschen a day 10000 more friedrioh wilhelm would have gladly taken the whole but george ii took a certain number say the prussian books george ii or pious trustees instead of him and settled them at ebenezer in virginiaread ebenezer in georgia where general oglethorpe was busy founding a colony petition to parliament 10th 21st may 1733 by oglethorpe and his trustees for 10000 pounds to carry over these salzburgers which was granted tindals rapin london 1769 xx 184 there at ebenezer i calculate they might go ahead too after the questionable fashion of that country and increase and swellbut have never heard of them since  salzburg emigration was a very real transaction on friedrich wilhelms part but it proved idyllic too and made a great impression on the german mind readers know of a book called hermann and dorothea it is written by the great goethe and still worth reading the great goethe had heard when still very little much talk among the elders about this salzburg pilgrimage and how strange a thing it was twenty years ago and more 1749 was goethes birthyear in middle life he threw it into hexameters into the region of the air and did that unreal shadow of it a pleasant work in its way since he was not inclined for more     chapter

or less interest of these salzburgpilgrim movements of this excursion into bohmen here are certain scraps of letters which if once made legible will assist readers to conceive his situation and

infinitely the particulars hitherto unknown which he reports the greatness of that princes actions and the perverse singularity bizarrerie of his fortune all this joined to the lively brilliant and charming way the author has of telling it renders this book interesting to the supreme degree i send you a fragment of my correspondence with the most illustrious sieur crochet some french envoy or emissary i conclude you perceive we go on very sweetly together and are in a high strain i am sorry i burnt one of his letters wherein he assured me he would in the versailles antechamber itself speak of me to the king and that my name had actually been mentioned at the kings levee it certainly is not my ambition to choose this illustrious mortal to publish my renown on the contrary i should think it soiled by such a mouth and prostituted if he were the publisher but enough of the crochet the kindest thing we can do for so contemptible an object is to say nothing of him at all oeuvres de

carry messages from majestyor likelier it may be lieutenant buddenbrock his son merely returning to ruppin we can guess that the flattering dessauer has sent his majesty five gigantic men from the magdeburg regiments and that friedrich is ordered to hustle out thirty of insignificant stature from his own by way of countergift to the dessauerwhich friedrich does instantly but cannot for his life see how being totally cashless he is to replace them with better or replace them at all  2 to captain hacke of the potsdam guard  ruppin 15th july 1732  mein gott what a piece of news buddenbrock has brought me i am to get nothing out of brandenburg my dear hacke thirty men i had to shift out of my company in consequence of buddenbrocks order and where am i now to get other thirty i would gladly give the king tall men as the dessauer at magdeburg does but i have no money and i dont get or set up for getting six men for one thirty short for five tall as he does so true is that scripture to him

shall always bewith a great deal of consideration monsieur mon trescher general c frederic  and nowfor the bohemian journey visit at kladrup as they call itruppin being left in this assiduous and wholesome if rather hampered condition  kaiser karl and his empress in this summer of 1732 were at karlsbad taking the waters for a few weeks friedrich wilhelm who had long for various reasons wished to see his kaiser face to face thought this would be a good opportunity the kaiser himself knowing how it stood with the julichandberg and other questions was not anxious for such an interview still less were his official people among whom the very ceremonial for such a thing was matter of abstruse difficulty seckendorf accordingly had been instructed to hunt wide and throw in discouragements so far as possiblewhich he did but without effect friedrich wilhelm had set his heart upon the thing wished to behold for once a head of the holy roman empire and supreme of christendomalso to see a little with his own eyes into certain matters imperial  and so since an express visit to karlsbad might give rise to newspaper rumors and will not suit it is settled there shall be an accidental intersection of routes as the kaiser travels homewardsay in some quiet bohemian schloss or huntingseat of the kaisers own whither the king may come incognito and thus with a minimum of noise may the needful passage of hospitality be done easy all of this only the vienna ministers are dreadfully in doubt about the ceremonial whether the imperial hand can be given i forget if for kissing or for shakingnay at last they manfully declare that it cannot be given and wish his prussian majesty to understand that it must be refused forster i 328 res summae consequentiae say they and shake solemnly

derschau seckendorf grumkow captain hacke of the potsdam guard and for eighth the dutch ambassador ginkel an accomplished knowing kind of man whom also my readers have occasionally seen their conversation roadcolloquy could it interest any modern reader it has gone all to dusk we can know only that it was human solid for most part and had much tobacco intermingled they were all of the calvinistic persuasion of the military profession knew that life is very serious that speech without cause is much to be avoided they travelled swiftly dined in airy places they are a fact they and their summer dustcloud there whirling through the vacancy of that dim time and have an interest for us though an unimportant one  the first night they got to grunberg a pleasant town of vineyards and of looms across the silesian frontier they are now turning more southeastward they sleep here in the kaisers territory welcomed by some official persons who signify that the overjoyed imperial majesty has as was extremely natural paid the bill everywhere on the morrow before the shuttles awaken friedrich wilhelm is gone again towards the glogau region intending for liegnitz that night coursing rapidly through the green silesian lowlands blue giant mountains riesengebirge beginning to rise on the southwestward far away dines at noon under a splendid tent in a country place called polkwitz balkowitz say pollnitz ii 407 and forster which is not the correct name with country nobility sorrow on them and yet thanks to them come to do reverence at night he gets to liegnitz  here is liegnitz then here are the katzbach and the blackwater schwarzwasser famed in war your majesty here they coalesce gray ashlar houses not without inhabitants unknown to us looking on here are the venerable walls and streets of liegnitz and the castle which defied baty khan and his tartars five hundred years ago 1241 the invasion and battle here of this unexpected barbarianoh your majesty this liegnitz with its princely castle and wide rich territory the bulk of the silesian lowland whose is it if right were done hm his majesty knows full well in seckendorfs presence and going on such an errand we must not speak of certain things but the undisputed truth is duke friedrich ii come of the sovereign piasts made that erbverbruderung and his grandsons grandson died childless so the heirship fell to us as the biggest wig in the most benighted chancery would have to grantonly the kaiser will not never would the kaiser plants his armed self on schlesien and will hear no pleading jagerndorf too which we purchased with our own moneyno more of that it is too miserable very impossible too while we have berg and julich in the wind  at liegnitz friedrich wilhelm reviews the garrison cavalry and infantry before starting then off for glatz some sixty miles before we can dine the goal is towards bohemia all this while and his majesty had he liked the mountainpasses and unlevel ways of the giant mountains might have found a shorter road and a much more picturesque one road abounding in gloomy valleys intricate rocklabyrinths haunts of sprite rubezahl sources of the elbe and i know not what majesty likes level roads and interesting rocklabyrinths built by man rather than by nature majesty makes a wide sweep round to the east of all that leaves the giant mountains and their intricacies as a blue sierra far on his righthad rather see glatz fortress than the caverns of the elbe and will cross into bohemia where the hills are fallen lowest at glatz during dinner numerous nobilities are again in waiting glatz is in jagerndorf region jagerndorf which we purchased with our own money is and remains ours in spite of the mishaps of the thirtyyears warours the darkest chancery would be obliged to say from under the immensest wig patience your majesty time brings roses  from glatz after viewing the works drilling the guard a little not to speak of dining and despatching the nobilities his majesty takes the road again turns now abruptly westward across the hills at their lowest point into bohemia which is close at hand lewin nachod these are the bohemian villages with their remnant of czechs not a prosperous population to look upon but it is the kaisers own kingdom king of bohemia one of his titles ever since sigismund supergrammaticams time and here now at the meeting of the waters elbe one of them a brawling mountainstream is jaromierz respectable little town with an imperial officiality in itwhere the official gentlemen meet us all in gala thrice welcome to this kingdom your majestyand signify that they are to wait upon us henceforth while we do the kaisers kingdom of bohemia that honor  it is tuesday night 29th july this first night in bohemia the official gentlemen lead his majesty to superb rooms newhung with crimson velvet and the due gold fringes and tressesvery grand indeed but probably not so airy as we wish this is the way the kaiser lodges in his journeys and your majesty is to be served like him the goal of our journey is now within few miles wednesday 30th july 1732 his majesty awakens again within these crimsonvelvet hangings with the gold tresses and fringes not so airy as he could wish despatches grumkow to the kaiser who is not many miles off to signify what honor we would do ourselves  it was on saturday last that the kaiser and kaiserinn returning from karlsbad illuminated prag with their serene presence attended highmass vespers and a good deal of other worship as the meagre old newspapers report for us on that and the sunday following and then on monday at six in the morning both the majesties left prag for a place called chlumetz southwestward thirty miles off in the elbe region where they have a pretty hunting castle kaiser intending sylvan sport for a few days says the old rag of a newspaper and then to return to prag it is here that grumkow after a pleasant mornings drive of thirty miles with the sun on his back finds kaiser karl vi and makes his announcements and diplomatic inquiries what next  had friedrich wilhelm been in potsdam or wusterhausen and heard that kaiser karl was within thirty miles of him friedrich wilhelm would have cried with open arms come come but the imperial majesty is otherwise hampered has his rhadamanthine aulic councillors in vast amplitude of wig sternly engaged in study of the etiquettes they have settled that the meeting cannot be in chlumetz lest it might lead to nights lodgings and to intricacies let it be at kladrup say the amplewigged kladrup an imperial stud or horsefarm half a dozen miles from this where there is room for nothing more than dinner there let the meeting be tomorrow at a set hour and in the mean time we will take precautions for the etiquettes so it is settled and grumkow returns with the decision in a complimentary form  through konigsgratz down the right bank of the upper elbe on the morrow morning thursday 31st july 1732 friedrich wilhelm rushes on towards kladrup finds that little village with the horseedifices looking snug enough in the valley of elbealights welcomed by prince eugenio von savoye with word that the kaiser is not come but steadily expected soon prinoe eugenio von savoye ach gott it is another thing your highness than when we met in the flanders wars long sinceat malplaquet that morning when your highness had been to brussels visiting your lady mother in case of the worst slightly grayer your highness is grown i too am nothing like so nimble the great duke poor man is deadprince eugenio von savoye we need not doubt took snuff and answered in a sprightly appropriate manner  kladrup is a country house as well as a horsefarm a square court is the interior as i gather the horsebuildings at a reverent distance forming the fourth side in the centre of this courtsee what a contrivance the aulic councillors have hit uponthere is a wooden stand built with three staircases leading up to it one for each person and three galleries leading off from it into suites of rooms no question of precedence here where each of you has his own staircase and own gallery to his apartment friedrich wilhelm looks down like a rhinoceros on all those cobwebberies no sooner are the kaisers carriagewheels heard within the court than friedrich wilhelm rushes down by what staircase is readiest forward to the very carriagedoor and flings his arms about the kaiser embracing and embraced like mere human friends glad to see one another on these terms they mount the wooden stand majesty of prussia kaiser kaiserinn each by his own staircase see for a space of two hours the kaisers foals and horses led aboutwhich at least fills up any gap in conversation that may threaten to occur the kaiser a little man of high and humane air is not bright in talk the empress a brunswick princess of fine carriage granddaughter of old anton ulrich who wrote the novels is likewise of mute humor in public life but old nordteutschland cradle of ones existence brunswick reminiscences news of your imperial majestys serene father serene sister brotherinlaw the feldmarschall and insipid niece whom we have had the satisfaction to betroth latelyfurnish smalltalk where needful  dinner being near you go by your own gallery to dress from the drawingroom friedrich wilhelm leads out the kaiserinn the kaiser as head of the world walks first though without any lady how they drank the healths gave and received the ewers and towels is written duly in the old books but was as indifferent to friedrich wilhelm as it is to us what their conversation was let no man presume to ask dullish we should apprehendand perhaps better lost to us but where there are tongues there are topics the loom of time wags always and with it the tongues of men kaiser and kaiserinn have both been in karlsbad lately kaiser and kaiserinn both have sailed to spain in old days and been in sieges and things memorable friedrich wilhelm solid squire western of the north does not want for topics and talks as a solid rustic gentleman will native politeness he knows on occasion to etiquette so far as concerns his own pretensions he feels callous altogetherdimly sensible that the eighteenth century is setting in and that solid musketeers and not goldsticks are now the important thing i felt mad to see him so humiliate himself said grumkow afterwards to wilhelmina jenrageais dans ma peau why not  dinner lasted two hours the empress rising friedrich wilhelm leads her to her room then retires to his own and in a quarter of an hour is visited there by the kaiser who conducts him in so many minutes exact by the watch back to the empressfor a sip of coffee as one hopes which may wind up the interview well the sun is still a good space from setting when friedrich wilhelm after cordial adieus neglectful of etiquette is rolling rapidly towards nimburg thirty miles off on the prag highway and kaiser karl with his spouse move deliberately towards chlumetz to hunt again in nimburg friedrich wilhelm sleeps that nightimperial majesties in a muchtumbled world of wild horses ceremonial ewers and eugenios of savoy and malplaquet probably peopling his dreams if it please heaven there may be another private meeting a day or two hence  nimburg ah your majesty son fritz will have a night in nimburg tooriding slowly thither amid the wrecks of kolin battle not to sleep wellbut that happily is hidden from your majesty kolin czaslau chotusitz elbe teinitzhere in this kladrup region your majesty is driving amid poor villages which will be very famous by and by and prag itself will be doubly famed in war if your majesty knew it and the ziscaberg be of bloodier memory than the weissenberg itselfhis majesty the morrows sun having risen upon nimburg rolls into prag successfully about eleven am hill of zisca not disturbing him goes to the kleinseite quarter where an aulic councillor with fine palace is ready all the cannon thundering from the walls at his majestys advent and prince eugenio the everpresent being there to receive his majestyand in fact to invite him to dinner this day at halfpast twelve it is friday 1st of august 1732  by a singular chance there is preserved for us in fassmanns book what we may call an excerpt from the old morning post of prag bringing that extinct day into clear light again recalling the vanished dinnerparty from the realms of hades as a thing that once actually was the list of the dinnerguests is given complete vanished ghosts whom in studying the old historybooks you can with a kind of interest fish up into visibility at will there is prince eugenio von savoye at the bottom of the table in the countthun palace where he lodges there bodily the little man in goldlaced coat of unknown cut the eyes and the tempers bright and rapid as usual or more nose not unprovided with snuff and lips in consequence rather open be seated your majesty high gentlemen all  a big chairofstate stands for his majesty at the upper end of the table his majesty will none of it sits down close by prince eugene at the very bottom and opposite prince alexander of wurtemberg whom we had at berlin lately a general of note in the turkish and other wars here probably there will be better talk and the big chair may preside over us in vacancy which it does prince alexander imperial general against the turks and heirapparent of wurtemberg withal can speak of many thingshardly much of his serene cousin the reigning duke whose health is in a too interesting state the good though unlucky man of the gravenitz sitting now in limbo or travelling about disowned toujours un lavement ses trousses let there be deep silence but the prince alexander can answer abundantly on other heads he comes to his inheritance a few months hence actual reigning duke the poor serene cousin having died and perhaps we shall meet him transiently again  he is ancestor of the czars of russia this prince alexander who is now dining here in the body along with friedrich wilhelm and prince eugene paul of russia unbeautiful paul married the second time from mumpelgard what the french call montbeillard in alsace a serene granddaughter of his from whom come the czarsthanks to her or not prince alexander is ancestor withal of our present kings of wurtemberg if that mean anything father what will mean something to the serene duke still in swaddlingclothes born 21st january 1732 carl eugen the name of him michaelis iii 450 who will be soninlaw to princess wilhelmina of baireuth could your majesty foresee it and will do strange pranks in the world upon poet schiller and others him too and brothers of his were they born and become of size we shall meet a noticeable man and not without sense this prince alexander who is now of a surety eating with usas we find by the extinct morning post in fassmanns old book  of the others eating figures stahrembergs sternbergs kinsky ambassador to england kinsky ambassador to france high austrian dignitaries we shall say nothingwho would listen to us hardly can the hofkanzler count von sinzendorf supreme of aulic men who holds the rudder of austrian statepolicy and probably feels himself loaded with importance beyond most mortals now eating here or elsewheregain the smallest recognition from oblivious english readers of our time it is certain he eats here on this occasion and to his majesty he does not want for importance his majesty intent on julich and berg and other high matters spends many hours next day in earnest private dialogue with him we mention farther with satisfaction that grumkow and ordnancemaster seckendorf are both on the list and all our prussian party down to hacke of the potsdam grenadiers friend schulenburg visibly eating among the others also that the dinner was glorious herrlich and ended about five fassmann p 474 after which his majesty went to two evening parties of a high order in the hradschin quarter or elsewhere cards in the one unless you liked to dance or grin idle talk from you and supper in the other  his majesty amused himself for four other days in prag interspersing long earnest dialogues with sinzendorf with whom he spent the greater part of saturday pollnitz ii 411results as to julion and berg of a rather cloudy nature on saturday came the kaiser too and kaiserinn to their high nouse the schloss in prag and there occurred in the incognito form as if by accident three visits or countervisits two of them of some length the king went dashing about saw deliberately or in glimpses all manner of thingsfrom the military hospital to the tongue of st nepomuk again nepomuk an imaginary saint of those parts pitched into the moldau as is fancied and fabled by wicked king wenzel king and deposedkaiser whom we have heard of for speaking and refusing to speak nepomuk is now become the patron of bridges in consequence stands there in bronze on the bridge of prag and still shows a dried tongue in the world die legende vom heiligen johann von nepomuk von d otto abel berlin 1855 an acute bit of historical criticism this latter we expressly find his majesty saw  on sunday his majesty nothing of a straitlaced man attended divine or quasidivine worship in the cathedral churchwhere high prince bishops delivered palliums did histrionisms manifested the absurditat of papistry more or less coming out of the church he was induced to step in and see the rooms of the schloss or imperial palace in one of the rooms as if by accident the kaiser was found loungingextremely delighted to see your majestyand they had the first of their long or considerable dialogues together purport has not transpired the second considerable dialogue was on the morrow when imperial majesty as if by accident found himself in the countnostitz palace where friedrich wilhelm lodges delighted to be so fortunate again hope your majesty likes prag eternal friendship oh jaand as to julich and berg particulars have not transpired  prag is a place full of sights his majesty dashing about in all quarters has a busy time affairs of state julich and berg principally alternating with what we now call the lions ziscas drum for instance in the arsenal here would your majesty wish to see ziscas own skin which he bequeathed to be a drum when he had done with itnarrenpossenfor indeed the thing is fabulous though in character with zisca or the councilchamber window out of which the three prag projectiles fell into the night of things as a modern historian expresses it three official gentlemen flung out one morning 13th 23d may 1618 kohler p 507 70 feet but fell on sewerage and did not die but set the whole world on fire that is too certain as his majesty knows that brought the crowning of the winterking battle of the weissenberg thirtyyears war and lost us jagerndorf and much else  or wallensteins palacedid your majesty look at that a thing worth glancing at on the score of history and even of naturalhistory that rugged son of steel and gunpowder could not endure the least noise in his sleepingroom or even sittingrooma difficulty in the soldiering way of lifeand had if i remember one hundred and thirty houses torn away in prag and sentries posted all round in the distance to secure silence for his muchmeditating indignant soul and yonder is the weissenberg conspicuous in the western suburban region and here in the eastern close by is the ziscabergo heaven your majesty on this ziscahill will be a new battle of prag which will throw the weissenberg into eclipse and there is awful fighting coming on in these parts again  the third of the considerable dialogues in prag was on this same monday night when his majesty went to wait upon the kaiserinn and the kaiser soon accidentally joined them precious gracious words passedon berg and julich nothing particular that we hearand the high personages with assurances of everlasting friendship said adieu and met no more in this world on his toilettable friedrich wilhelm found a gold tobaccobox sent by the highest lady extant gold tobaccobox item gold tobaccostopper or pipepicker such the parting gifts of her imperial majesty very precious indeed and grateful to the honest heartyet testifying too as was afterwards suggested to the royal mind what these high people think of a rustic orson king and how they fling their nose into the air over his tabagies and him  on the morrow morning early friedrich wilhelm rolls away again homewards by karlsbad by baireuth all the cannon of prag saying thrice good speed to him he has had a glorious time said the berlin courtlady to queen sophie one evening no end of kindness from the imperial majesties but has he brought berg and julich in his pocketalas not a fragment of them nor of any solid thing whatever except it be the gold tobaccobox and the confirmation of our claims on eastfriesland cheap liberty to let us vindicate them if we can if you reckon that a solid thing these two imperial gifts such as they are he has consciously brought back with himand perhaps though as yet unconsciously a third gift of much more value once it is developed into clearness some dim trace of insight into the nomeaning of these high people and how they consider us as mere orsons and wild bisons whom they will do the honor to consume as provision if we behave well  the great king friedrich now crownprince at ruppin writing of this journey long afterwardshastily incorrectly as his wont is in regard to all manner of minute outward particulars and somewhat maltreating or at least misplacing even the inward meaning which was well known to him without investigation but which he is at no trouble to date for himself and has dated at randomsays in his thin rapid way with much polished bitterness  his king friedrich wilhelms experience on this occasion served to prove that goodfaith and the virtues so contrary to the corruption of the age do not succeed in it politicians have banished sincerity la candeur into private life they look upon themselves as raised quite above the laws which they enjoin on other people and give way without reserve to the dictates of their own depraved mind  the guaranty of julich and berg which seckendorf had formally promised in the name of the emperor went off in smoke and the imperial ministers were in a disposition so opposed to prussia the king saw clearly not for some years yet that if there was a court in europe intending to cross his interests it was certainly that of vienna this visit of his to the emperor was like that of solon to croesus solon not i recognizable in the grenadier costume amid the tobaccosmoke and dim accompanimentsand he returned to berlin rich still in his own virtue the most punctilious censors could find no fault in his conduct except a probity carried to excess the interview ended as those of kings often do it cooled not for some time yet or to say better it extinguished the friendship there had been between the two courts friedrich wilhelm left prag full of contempt dimly altogether unconsciously tending to have some contempt and in the end to be full of it for the deceitfulness and pride of the imperial court and the emperors ministers disdained a sovereign who looked without interest on frivolous ceremonials and precedences him they considered too ambitious in aiming at the bergandjulich succession them he regarded came to regard as a pack of knaves who had broken their word and were not punished for it  very bitter your majesty and in all but the dates true enough but what a drop of concentrated absinthe follows next by way of finishwhich might itself have corrected the dating  in spite of so many subjects of discontent the king wedded his eldest son my not too fortunate self out of complaisance to the vienna court with a princess of brunswickbevern niece to the empressbitter fact necessitating change of

lodged me to perfection good wilhelmina here i find my wooden stools tubs to wash in all things as if i were at potsdama good girl and thou must take care of thyself my child mein kind  at dinner his majesty dreading no ill but intent only on the practical got into a quiet but to me most dreadful lecture to the old margraf my fatherinlaw upon debt and money and arrears how he the margraf was cheated at every turn and led about by the nose and kept weltering in debt how he should let the young margraf go into the offices to supervise and withal to learn taxmatters and economics betimes how he friedrich wilhelm would send him a fellow from berlin who understood such things and would drill his scoundrels for him to which the old margraf somewhat flushed in the face made some embarrassed assent knowing it in fact to be true and accepted the berlin manbut he made me his poor daughterinlaw smart for it afterwards not quite dead yet madam you will have to wait a littleand other foolish speech which required to be tempered down again by a judicious female mind  grumkow himself was pleasant on this occasion told us of kladrup the prag etiquettes and how he was like to go mad seeing his majesty so humiliate himself fraulein grumkow a niece of his belonging to the austrian court who is over here with the rest a satirical intriguing baggage she i privately perceive has made a

husband and fatherinlaw having quitted their boarhunt and hurried home  after three days friedrich wilhelm rolled away again lodged once more at meuselwitz with abstruse seckendorf and his good old wife who do the hospitalities well when they must in spite of the single candle once visible on the morrow after which 14th august 1732 his majesty is off again at four in the morning towards leipzig intending to be home that night though it is a long drive at leipzig not to waste time he declines entering the town positively will not though the cannonsalvos are booming all roundbreakfasts in the suburbs with a certain horsedealer rosshandler now deceased a respectable centaur capable no doubt of bargaining a little about cavalry mountings while one eats with appetite and at ones ease which done majesty darts off again the cannonsalvos booming out a second timeand by assiduous driving gets home to potsdam about eight at night and so has happily ended this journey to kladrup fassmann pp

at this advanced stage or of all men seckendorf after riding 25000 miles to kill the doublemarriage engaged in resuscitating it but so it is by endless intriguing matchless in history or romance the austrian court had at such expense to the parties and to itself achieved the first problem of stifling the harmless doublemarriage and now the wind having changed it is actually trying its hand the opposite way  wind is changed consummate robinson has managed to do his thricesalutary treaty of vienna 16th march 1731 the tail of it accession of the dutch of spain c not quite coiled up till 20th february 1732 scholl i 218222 to clout up all differences between the seapowers and the kaiser and restore the old law of naturekaiser to fight the french seapowers to feed and pay him while engaged in that necessary job and now it would be gratifying to the kaiser if there remained on this side of the matter no rent anywhere if between his chief sea ally and his chief land one the britannic majesty and the prussian there prevailed a complete understanding with no grudge left  the honor of this fine resuscitation project is ascribed to robinson by the vienna people robinsons suggestion they always say how far it was or whether at all it was or not nobody at present knows guess rather if necessary it had been the kaisers own robinson as the thing proceeds is instructed from st jamess to look on and not interfere despatches in statepaper office prince eugene too we can observe is privately against it though officially urgent and doing his best who knowsor need know  enough that high heads are set upon it that the diplomatic wigs are all wagging with it from about the beginning of october 1732 and rumors are rife and eager occasionally spurting out into the newspapers doublemarriage after all hint the old rumors doublemarriage somehow or other crownprince to have his english princess prince fred of england to console the brunswick one for loss of her crownprince or else prince karl of brunswick toand half a dozen other ways which rumor cannot settle to its satisfaction the whispers upon it from hanover from vienna at berlin and from the diplomatic world in general occasionally whistling through the newspapers are manifold and incessantnot worthy of the least attention from us here forster iii 111 120 108 113 122 what is certain is seckendorf in the end of october is corresponding on it with prince eugene has got instructions to propose the matter in tobaccoparliament and does not like it at all grumkow who perhaps has seen dangerous clouds threatening to mount upon him and never been quite himself again in the royal mind since that questionable nosti business dissuades earnestly constantly nothing but mischief will come of such a proposal says grumkow steadily and for his own share absolutely declines concern in it  but prince eugenes orders are express remonstrances cunctations only strengthen the determination of the high heads or head forward with this beautiful scheme seckendorf puckered into dangerous anxieties but summoning all his cunning has at length after six weeks hesitation to open it as if casually in some favorable hour to his prussian majesty december 5th 1732 as we computea kind of epoch in his majestys life prussian majesty stares wideeyed the breath as if struck out of him repeats julich and berg absolutely secured say you buthm naand has not yet taken in the unspeakable dimensions of the occurrence what imperial majesty will make me break my word before all the world imperial majesty has been whirling me about face now to the east face straightway round to the west imperial majesty does not feel that i am a man and king at all takes me for a mere machine to be seesawed and whirled hither and thither like a rotatory clotheshorse to dry his imperial majestys linen upon tausend himmel  the full dimensions of all this did not rise clear upon the intellect of prussian majestya slow intellect but a true and deep with terrible earthquakes and poetic fires lying under itnot at once or for months perhaps years to come but they had begun to dawn upon him painfully here they rose gradually into perfect clearness all things seen at last as what they werewith huge submarine earthquake for consequence and total change of mind towards imperial majesty and the drying of his pragmatic linen in friedrich wilhelm amiable orson true to the heart amiable though terrible when too much put upon  this dawning process went on for above two years to come painfully reluctantly with explosions even with tears but here directly on the back of seckendorfs proposal and recorded from a sure hand is what we may call the peepofday in that matter first session of tobaccoparliament close after that event event is on the 5th december 1732 tobacco session is of the 6thglimpse of it is given by speaker grumkow himself authentic to the bone     session of tobaccoparliament 6th december 1732  grumkow shattered into headache by this session writes report of it to seckendorf before going to bed look reader into one of the strangest political establishments and how a strange majesty comports himself there directly after such proposal from vienna to marry with england stillschwerin is incidentally in from frankfurtonoder where his regiment and business usually lie the other honorable members we sufficiently know majesty has been a little out of health lately perceptibly worse the last two days syberg is a goldcook alchemical gentleman of very high professions came to berlin some time ago whom his majesty after due investigation took the liberty to hang forster iii 126 readers can now understand what speaker grumkow writes and despatches by his lackey in such haste  i never saw such a scene as this evening derschau schwerin buddenbrock rochow flanz were present we had been about an hour in the red room languidly doing our tobacco off and on when he the king had us shifted into the little room drove out the servants and cried looking fixedly at me no i cannot endure it any longer es stosset mir das herz ab cried he breaking into german it crushes the heart out of me to make me do a bit of scoundrelism me me i say no never those damned intrigues may the devil take them  ego grumkow of course i know of nothing but i do not comprehend your majestys inquietude coming thus on the sudden after our common indifferent mood  king what make me a villain i will tell it right out certain damned scoundrels have been about betraying me people that should have known me better have been trying to lead me into a dishonorable scrapehere i called in the hounds je rompis les chiens reports grumkow for he was going to blab everything i interrupted saying  ego but your majesty what is it ruffles you so i know not what you talk of your majesty has honorable people about you and the man who lets himself be employed in things against your majesty must be a traitor  king yes ja ja i will do things that will surprise them i  and in short a torrent of exclamations which i strove to soften by all manner of incidents and contrivances succeeding at lastby dexterity and time but at this point the light is now blown out and we see no moreso that he grew quite calm again and the rest of the evening passed gently enough  well you see what the effect of your fine proposal is which you said he would like i can tell you it is the most detestable incident that could have turned up i know you had your orders but you may believe and depend on it he has got his heart driven rabid by the business and says who knows now whether that villain syberg goldcook that was hanged the other day was not set on by some people to poison me in a word he was like a madman  what struck me most was when he repeated only think think who would have expected it of people that should have known me and whom i know and have known better than they fancypleasant passage for seckendorf to chew the cud upon through the nightwatches  in fine as i was somewhat confused and anxious above all to keep him from exploding with the secret i cannot remember everything but derschau who was more at his ease will be able to give you a full account he the king said more than once this was his sickness the thing that ailed him this it gnawed his heart and would be the death of him he certainly did not affect he was in a very convulsive condition jarnibleu here is a piece of work herr seckendorfadieu i have a headache whereupon to bed  grumkow  forster iii 135 136  this hansard report went off direct to prince eugene and ought to have been a warning to the high vienna heads and him but they persisted not the less to please robinson or themselves considering his prussian majesty to be in fact a mere rotatory clotheshorse for drying the imperial linen on and to have no intellect at all because he was without guile and had no vulpinism at all in which they were very much mistaken indeed history is proud to report that the guileless prussian majesty steadily attending to his own affairs in a wise manner though hoodwinked and led about by blackartists as he had been turned out when fact and nature subsequently pronounced upon it to have had more intellect than the whole of them togetherto have been in a manner the only one of them that had any real intellect or insight into fact and nature at all consummate blackart diplomacies overnetting the universe went entirely to water running down the gutters to the last drop and a prosperous drilled prussia compact organic in every part from diligent ploughsock to shining bayonet and iron ramrod remained standing a full treasury and 200000 welldrilled men would be the one guarantee to your pragmatic sanction prince eugene had said but that bit of insight was not accepted at vienna blackart and diplomatic spiderwebs from pole to pole being thought the preferable method  enough seckendorf was ordered to manipulate and soothe down the prussian majesty as surely would be easy to continue his galvanic operations on the doublematch or produce a rotation in the purposes of the royal breast which he diligently strove to do when once admitted to speech againgrumkow steadily declining to meddle and only queen sophie as we can fancy auguring joyfully of it seckendorf admitted to speech the third day after that explosive session snuffles his softest his cunningestcontinues to ride diligently the concluding portion such it proved of his 25000 miles with the prussian majesty up and down through winter and spring but makes not the least progress the reverse rather  their dialogues and arguings on the matter here and elsewhere are lost in air or gone wholly to a single point unexpectedly preserved for us one day riding through some village priort some say his majesty calls it some give another nameadvocate seckendorf in the fervor of pleading and arguing said some word which went like a sudden flash of lightning through the dark places of his majestys mind and never would go out of it again while he lived after in passionate moments his majesty spoke of it sometimes a clangorous pathos in his tones as of a thing hideous horrible never to be forgotten which had killed himdeath from a friends hand it was the 17th of april 1733 all the books forster ii 142 for one mention this utterance of his majesty on what occasion we shall see farther on and give the date 1732 not 1733 but except as amended above it refuses to have any sense visible at this distance the village of priort is in the potsdam region riding through priort a man said something to me it was as if you had turned a dagger about in my heart that man was he that killed me there and then i got my death  a strange passion in that utterance the deep dumb soul of his majesty of dumbpoetic nature suddenly brought to a fatal clearness about certain things o kaiser kaiser of the holy roman empire and this is your return for my loyal faith in you i had nearly killed my fritz my wilhelmina broken my feekins heart and my own and reduced the world to ruins for your sake and because i was of faith more than human you took me for a dog o kaiser kaiserpoor friedrich wilhelm he spoke of this often in excited moments in his later years the tears running down his cheeks and the whole man melted into tragic emotion but if fritz were there the precious fritz whom he had almost killed for their sake he would say flashing out into proud rage there is one that will avenge me though that one da steht einer der mich rachen wird forster ii 153 yes your majesty perhaps that one and it will be seen whether you were a rotatory clotheshorse to dry their pragmatic linen upon or something different a good deal     chapter vi  king august meditating great things for poland  in the newyears days of 1733 the topic among diplomatic gentlemen which set many big wigs wagging and even tremulously came out in the gray leaves of gazetteers and garreteers of the period was a royal drama dimly supposed to be getting itself up in poland at this time nothing known about it for certain much guessed something in the rumor nods this wig nothing wags that slightly oscillating and gazetteers who would earn their wages and have a peck of coals apiece to glad them in the cold weather had to watch with all eagerness the movements of king august our poor old friend the dilapidatedstrong who is in saxony at present but bound for warsaw shortlyjust about lifting the curtain on important events it is thought and not thought here are the certainties of it now clear enough so far as they deserve a glance from us  january 10th 1733 august the dilapidatedstrong of poland has been in saxony looking after his poor electorate a little and is on the road from dresden homewards againwill cross a corner of the prussian dominions as his wont is on such occasions prussian majesty if not appearing in person will as usual by some official of rank send a polite wellspeedyou as the brother majesty passes this time however it was more than politeness the polish majesty having as was thought such intricate affairs in the wind let grumkow the fittest man in all ways go and do the greeting to his old patroon greeting or whatever else may be needed  patroon left dresdenhaving just opened the carnival or fashionable season there opened and nothing morejanuary 10th 1733 fassmann leben friedrich augusti des grossen p 994 being in haste home for a polish diet close at hand on which same day grumkow we suppose drives forth from berlin to intersect him in the neumark about crossen and have a friendly word again in those localities over jolly wine intersection took place dulythere was exuberant joy on the part of the patroon and such a dinner and night of drinking as has seldom been abstruse things lie close ahead of august the dilapidatedstrong important to prussia and for which prussia is important let grumkow try if he can fish the matter into clearness out of these winecups and then august on his side wishes to know what the kaiser said at kladrup lately there is much to be fished into clearness  many are the times august the strong has made this journey many are the carousals on such and other occasions grumkow and he have had but there comes an end to all things this was their last meeting over flowing liquor or otherwise in the world satirical history says they drank all night endeavoring to pump one another and with such enthusiasm that they never recovered it drank themselves to death at crossen on that occasion oeuvres de frederic memoires de brandenbourg i 163 it is certain august died within three weeks and people said of grumkow who lived six years longer he was never well after this bout is it worth any human creatures while to look into the plans of this precious pair of individuals without the least expense of drinking the secrets they were pumping out of each other are now accessible enoughif it were of importance now one glance i may perhaps commend to the reader out of these multifarious notebooks in my possession  august by change of his religion and other sad operations got to be what they called the king of poland thirty five years ago but though looking glorious to the idle public it has been a crown of stingingnettles to the poor mana sedanchair running on rapidly with the bottom broken out to say nothing of the scourgings he got and poor saxony along with him from charles xii on account of this sovereignty so called what has the thing itself been to him in poland for these thirtyfive years the individual who had least of his real will done in public matters has been with infinite management and display of such goodhumor as at least deserves credit the nominal sovereign majesty of poland anarchic grandees have been kings over him ambitious contentious unmanageablevery fanatical too and never persuaded that augusts apostasy was more than a sham one not even when he made his prince apostatize too their sovereignty has been a mere peck of troubles disgraces and vexations for those thirtyfive years an everboiling pot of mutiny contradiction insolence hardly tolerable even to such nerves as augusts  august for a long time back has been thinking of schemes to clap some lid upon all that to make the sovereignty hereditary in his house that with the good saxon troops we have would be a remedyand in fact it is the only remedy john casimir who abdicated long ago in the great electors time and went to parismuch charmed with ninon de lenclos there told the polish diets with their liberum veto and right of confederation and rebellion they would bring the country down under the feet of mankind and reduce their republic to zero one day if they persisted they have not failed to persist with some hereditary king over it and a regulated saxony to lean upon truly might it not be a change to the better to the worse it could hardly be thinks august the strong and goes intent upon that method this long while backand at length hopes now in few days longer at the diet just assembling to see fruits appear and the thing actually begin  the difficulties truly are many internal and externalbut there are calculated methods too for the internal get up by bribery persuasion some visible minority to countenance you with these manoeuvre in the diets on the back of these the 30000 saxon troops but then what will the neighboring kings say the neighboring kings with their bigmouthed manifestoes pities for an oppressed republic overwhelming forces and invitations to confederate and revolt without their tolerance first had nothing can be done that is the external difficulty for which too there is a remedy cut off sufficient outlying slices of poland fling these to the neighboring kings to produce consent partition of poland in fact large sections of its territory sliced away that will be the method thinks king august  neighboring kings kaiser prussia russia to them it is not grievous that poland should remain in perennial anarchy in perennial impotence the reverse rather a dead horse or a dying in the next stallhe at least will not kick upon us think the neighboring kings and yetunder another similitudeyou do not like your nextdoor neighbor to be always on the point of catching fire smoke issuing thicker or thinner through the slates of his roof as a perennial phenomenon august will conciliate the neighboring kings russia bigcheeked anne czarina there shall have not only courland peaceably henceforth but the ukraine lithuania and other large outlying slices that surely will conciliate russia to austria on its hungarian border let us give the country of zipsnay there are other sops we have for austria pragmatic sanction hitherto refused as contrary to plain rights of oursthat if conceded to a spectrehunting kaiser to friedrich wilhelm we could give westpreussen westpreussen torn away three hundred years ago and leaving a hiatus in the very continuity of friedrich wilhelm would not that conciliate him of all enemies or friends friedrich wilhelm close at hand with 80000 men capable of fighting at a weeks notice is by far the most important  these are augusts plans westpreussen for the nearest neighbor zips for austria ukraine lithuania and appendages for the russian czarina handsome sections to be sliced off and flung to good neighbors as it were all the outlying limbs and wings of the polish territory sliced off compact body to remain and become by means of august and saxon troops a kingdom with government not an imaginary republic without government any longer in fact it was the partition of poland such as took effect forty years after and has kept the newspapers weeping ever since partition of polandminus the compact interior held under government by a king with saxon troops or otherwise compact interior in that effective partition forty years after was left as anarchic as ever and had to be again partitioned and cut away altogetherwith new torrents of loud tears from the newspapers refusing to be comforted to this day  it is not said that friedrich wilhelm had the least intention of countenancing august in these dangerous operations still less of going shares with august but he wished much through grumkow to have some glimpse into the dim program of them and august wished much to know friedrich wilhelms and grumkows humor towards them grumkow and august drank copiously or copiously pressed drink on one another all night 11th12th january 1733 as i compute some say at crossen some say at frauendorf a royal domain near by with the view of mutually fishing out those secretsand killed one another in the business as is rumored  what were grumkows news at homecoming i did not hear but he continues very low and shakyrefuses almost with horror to have the least hand in seckendorfs mad project of resuscitating the english doublemarriage and breaking off the brunswick one at the eleventh hour and after word pledged seckendorf himself continues to dislike and dissuade but the high heads at vienna are bent on it and command new strenuous attemptsliterally at the last moment which is now come     chapter vii  crownprinces marriage  since november last wilhelmina is on visit at berlinfirst visit since her marriageshe stays there for almost ten months not under the happiest auspices poor child mammas reception of her just off the long winter journey and extenuated with fatigues and sickly chagrins was of the most cutting cruelty what do you want here what is a mendicant like you come hither for and next night when papa himself came home it was little better ha ha said he here you are i am glad to see you then holding up a light to take view of me how changed you are said he what is little frederika my little baby at baireuth doing and on my answering continued i am sorry for you on my word you have not bread to eat and but for me you might go begging i am a poor man myself not able to give you much but i will do what i can i will give you now and then a twenty or a thirty shillings par dix ou douze florins as my affairs permit it will always be something to assuage your want and you madam said he turning to the queen you will sometimes give her an old dress for the poor child has nt a shift to her back wilhelmina ii 85 this rugged paternal banter was taken too literally by wilhelmina in her weak state and she was like to burst in her skin poor princess  so thatexcept her own good hereditary prince who was here over from pasewalk and his regimental duties waiting to welcome her in whose true heart full of honest human sunshine towards her she could always find shelter and defencenative country and court offer little to the brave wilhelmina chagrins enough are here chagrins also were there at baireuth our old father margraf has his crotchets his infirmities and outbreaks takes more and more to liquor and does always keep us frightfully bare in money no help from papa here either on the finance side no real hope anywhere thinks seckendorf when we consult him except only in the margrafs death old margraf will soon drink himself dead thinks seckendorf and in the mean while there is vienna and a noble kaiserinn who knows her friends in case of extremity thinks he wilhelmina ii 81111 poor princess in her weak shattered state she has a heavy time of it but there is a tough spirit in her bright sharp like a swift sabre not to be quenched in any coil but always cutting its way and emerging unsubdued  one of the blessings reserved for her here which most of all concerns us was the occasional sight of her brother brother in a day or two 18th november she says which date is wrong if it were of moment see oeuvres de frederic xxvii part 1st where their correspondence is ran over from ruppin on short leave and had his first interview very kind and affectionate quite the old brother again and blushed when at supper mamma and the princesses especially that wicked charlotte papa not present tore up his poor bride at such a rate has not a word to answer you but yes or no said they stupid as a block but were you ever at her toilette said the wicked charlotte out of shape completely considerable waddings i promise you and thenstill worse features from that wicked charlotte in presence of the domestics here wicked charlotte who is to be her sisterinlaw soonand who is always flirting with my husband as if she liked that bettercrownprince retired directly after supper as did i to my apartment where in a minute or two he joined me  to the question how with the king and you he answered that his situation was changing every moment that sometimes he was in favor sometimes in disgracethat his chief happiness consisted in absence that he led a soft and tranquil life with his regiment at ruppin study and music his principal occupations he had built himself a house there and laid out a garden where he could read and walk about then as to his bride i begged him to tell me candidly if the portrait the queen and my sister had been making of her was the true one we are alone replied he and i will conceal nothing from you the queen by her miserable intrigues has been the source of our misfortunes scarcely were you gone when she began again with england wished to substitute our sister charlotte for you would have had me undertake to contradict the kings will again and flatly refuse the brunswick matchwhich i declined that is the source of her venom against this poor princess as to the young lady herself i do not hate her so much as i pretend i affect complete dislike that the king may value my obedience more she is pretty a complexion lilyandrose her features delicate face altogether of a beautiful person true she has no breeding and dresses very ill but i flatter myself when she comes hither you will have the goodness to take her in hand i recommend her to you my dear sister and beg your protection for her it is easy to judge my answer would be such as he desired wilhelmina ii 89  for which small glimpse of the fact itself at firsthand across a whirlwind of distracted rumors new and old about the fact let us be thankful to wilhelmina seckendorfs hopeless attempts to resuscitate extinct english things and make the prussian majesty break his word continue to the very last but are worth no notice from us grumkows drinkingbout with the dilapidatedstrong at crossen which follows now in january has been already noticed by us and the dilapidatedstrongs farewell next morningadieu dear grumkow i think i shall not see you again as he rolled off towards warsaw and the dietwill require farther notice but must stand over till this marriage be got done of which latter eventwilhelmina once more kindling the old dark books into some light for usthe essential particulars are briefly as follows  monday 8th june 1733 the crownprince is again over from ruppin king queen and crownprince are rendezvoused at potsdam and they set off with due retinues towards wolfenbuttel towards salzdahlum the ducal schloss there sister wilhelmina sending blessings if she had them on a poor brother in such interesting circumstances mamma was plunged in black melancholy king not the least in the crownprince nothing particular to be remarked they reached salzdahlum duke ludwig rudolf the grandfathers palace one of the finest palaces with gardens with antiques with picturegalleries no end a mile or two from wolfenbuttel built by old anton ulrich and still the ornament of those partsreached salzdahlum wednesday the 10th where bride with father mother much more grandfather grandmother and all the sublimities interested are waiting in the highest gala wedding to be on friday next  friday morning this incident fell out notable and somewhat contemptible seckendorf who is of the retinue following his bad trade visits his majesty who is still in bedpardon your majesty what shall i say for excuse here is a letter just come from vienna in prince eugenes handprince eugene or a higher will say something while it is still time majesty not in impatience reads the little princes and the kaisers letter give up this we entreat you for the last time marry with england after all majesty reads quiet as a lamb lays the letter under his pillow will himself answer it and does straightway with much simple dignity to the effect for certain never my always respected prince account of the interview by seckendorf in forster iii 148155 copy of the answer itself is in the statepaper office here seckendorf having thus shot his last bolt does not stay many hours longer at salzdahlummay as well quit friedrich wilhelm altogether for any good he will henceforth do upon him this is the one incident between the arrival at salzdahlum and the wedding there  same friday 12th june 1733 at a more advanced hour the wedding itself took effect wedding which in spite of the mad rumors and whispers in the newspapers diplomatic despatches and elsewhere went off in all respects precisely as other weddings do a quite human wedding now and afterwards officiating clergyman was the reverend herr mosheim readers know with approval the ecclesiastical history of mosheim he in the beautiful chapel of the schloss with majesties and brunswick sublimities looking on performed the ceremony and crownprince friedrich of prussia has fairly wedded the serene princess elizabeth christina of brunswickbevern age eighteen coming manners rather awkward complexion lilyandroseand history is right glad to have done with the wearisome affair and know it settled on any tolerable terms whatever here is a note of friedrichs to his dear sister which has been preserved  to princess wilhelmina of baireuth at berlin  salzdahlum noon 19th june 1733  my dear sistera minute since the whole ceremony was got finished and god be praised it is over i hope you will take it as a mark of my friendship that i give you the first news of it  i hope i shall have the honor to see you again soon and to assure you my dear sister that i am wholly yours tout a vous i write in great haste and add nothing that is merely formal adieu oeuvres xxvii part 1st p 9  frederic  one keyserling the princes favorite gentleman came over express with this letter and the more private news wilhelmina being full of anxieties keyserling said the prince was inwardly well content with his lot though he had kept up the old farce to the last and pretended to be in frightful humor on the very morning bursting out upon his valets in the kings presence who reproved him and looked rather pensiverecognizing one hopes what a sacrifice it was the queens majesty keyserling reported was charmed with the style and ways of the brunswick court but could not endure the princessroyal new wife and treated the two

short at salzdahlum all goes if not as merry as some marriagebells yet without jarring to the ear  on tuesday both the majesties set out towards potsdam again where his majesty having business waiting

harangues tedious scenic evolutions at magdeburg and the intervening townsgrand entrance of the princessroyal into berlin is not till the 27th last day of the week following that was such a day as wilhelmina never saw no sleep the night before no breakfast can one taste between charlottenburg and berlin there is a review of unexampled splendor above eighty carriages of us and only a tent or two against the flaming june sun think of it review begins at four ampoor wilhelmina thought she would verily have died of heat and thirst and hunger in the crowded tent under the flaming june sun before the review could end itself and march into berlin trumpeting and salvoing with the princessroyal at the head of it wilhelmina ii 127129  of which grand flaming day and of the unexampled balls and effulgent festivities that followed all berlin ruining itself in dresses and equipages we will say nothing farther but give only what may still have some significance for readers wilhelminas portrait of the princessroyal on their first meeting which had taken place at potsdam two days before the princessroyal had arrived at potsdam too on that occasion across a grand review majesty himself riding out majesty and crownprince who had preceded her a little to usher in the poor young creaturethursday june 25th 1733  the king led her into the queens apartment then seeing after she had saluted us all that she was much heated and dispowdered depoudree he bade my brother take her to her own room i followed them thither my brother said to her introducing me this is a sister i adore and am obliged to beyond measure she has had the goodness to promise me that she will take care of you and help you with her good counsel i wish you to respect her beyond even the king and queen and not to take the least step without her advice do you understand i embraced the princessroyal and gave her every assurance of my attachment but she remained like a statue not answering a word her people not being come i repowdered her myself and readjusted her dress a little without the least sign of thanks from her or any answer to all my caressings my brother got impatient at last and said aloud devils in the blockhead peste soit de la bete thank my sister then she made me a courtesy on the model of that of agnes in the ecole des femmes i took her back to the queens apartment little edified by such a display of talent  the princessroyal is tall her figure is not fine stooping slightly or hanging forward as she walks or stands which gives her an awkward air her complexion is of dazzling whiteness heightened by the liveliest colors her eyes are pale blue and not of much promise for spiritual gifts mouth small features generally smalldainty mignons rather than beautifuland the countenance altogether is so innocent and infantine you would think this head belonged to a child of twelve her hair is blond plentiful curling in natural locks teeth are unhappily very bad black and ill set which are a disfigurement in this fine face she has no manners nor the least vestige of tact has much difficulty in speaking and making herself understood for most part you are obliged to guess what she means which is very embarrassing wilhelmina ii 119121  the berlin gayetiesfor karl heirapparent of brunswick brother to this princessroyal wedded his charlotte too about a week hence 2d july

apart for his support the amt of ruppin where his business lies what the exact revenues of ruppin are is not communicated but we can justly fear they were far too frugaland excused the underhand borrowing which is evident enough as a painful shadow in the princes life henceforth he does not seem to have been wasteful but he borrows all round under sevenfold secrecy from benevolent courts from austria russia england and the only pleasant certainty we notice in such painful business is that on his accession he pays with exactitudesends his uncle george of england for example the complete amount in rouleaus of new coin by the first courier that goes despatch of adjacent date in the statepaper office here  a thought too frugal his prussian majesty but he means to be kind bountiful and occasionally launches out into handsome munificence this very autumn hearing that the crownprince and his princess fancied reinsberg an old castle in their amt ruppin some miles north of themhis majesty without word spoken straightway purchased reinsberg schloss and territory from the owner gave it to his crownprince and gave him money to newbuild it according to his mind 23d oct 173316th

records it as during the marriage festivities oeuvres memoires de brandenbourg i 163 but it was four good months earlier event we must now look at for a moment  in the end of january last we left grumkow in a low and hypochondriacal state much shaken by that drinkingbout at crossen when the polish majesty and he were so anxious to pump one another by copious priming with hungary wine about a fortnight after in the first days of february following day is not given grumkow reported something curious in my presence says wilhelmina and that of forty persons for the thing was much talked about grumkow said to the king one morning ah sire i am in despair the poor patroon is dead i was lying broad awake last night all on a sudden the curtains of my bed flew asunder i saw him he was in a shroud he gazed fixedly at me i tried to start up being dreadfully taken but the phantom disappeared here was an illustrious ghoststory for berlin in a day or two when the courier came died at the

warsaw and good trains laid in the diet capable of fortunate explosion under a good engineer engineer alas the grumkow drinkingbout had awakened that old sore in his foot he came to warsaw eager enough for business but with his stock of strength all out and death now close upon him the diet met 26th27th january engineer all alert about the good trains laid and the fortunate exploding of them when almost on the morrowinflammation has come on said the doctors and were futile to help farther the strong body and its life was done and nothing remained but to call in the archbishop with his extreme unctions and soulapparatus  august made no moaning or recalcitrating took on the prescribed terms the inevitable that had come has been a very great sinner he confesses to the archbishop i have not at present strength to name my many and great sins to your reverence said he i hope for mercy on theon the usual rash terms terms perhaps known to august to be rash to have been frightfully rash but what can he now do archbishop thereupon gives absolution of his sins archbishop doesa baddish unlikely kind of man as august well knows august laid his hand on his eyes during such sad

presentlya new polish election crisis having come  what individual the polish grandees would have chosen for king if entirely left alone to do it is a question not important and indeed was never asked in this or in late elections not the individual who could have been a king among them were they for a long time back in the habit of seeking after not him but another and indeed reverse kind of individualthe one in whom there lay most nourishment nourishment of any kind even of the cash kind for a practical polish grandee so that the question was no longer of the least importance to poland or the universe and in point of fact the frugal destinies had ceased to have it put in that quarter not grandees of poland but intrusive neighbors carrying grandees of poland in their breechespocket as our phrase is were the voting parties to that pass it was come under such stern penalty had poland and its grandees fallen by dint of false voting the frugal destinies had ceased to ask about their vote and they were become machines for voting with or pistols for fighting with by bad neighbors who cared to vote nor did the frugal destinies consider that the proper method either but had as we shall see determined to abolish that too in about forty years more     of the candidates of the conditions how the election went  it was under such omens that the polish election of 1733 had to transact itself austria russia prussia as next neighbors were the chief voting parties if they cared to intrudewhich austria and russia were clear for doing prussia not clear or not beyond the indispensable or evidently profitable seckendorf and one lowenwolde the russian ambassador at berlin had some time ago in foresight of this event done their utmost to bring friedrich wilhelm into cooperationoffering fine baits berg and julich again among othersbut nothing definite came of it peaceable reasonably safe election in poland other interest friedrich wilhelm has not in the matter and compliance not cooperation is what can be expected of him by the kaiser and czarina cooperating or even complying these three could have settled it and wouldhad no other neighbor interfered but other neighbors can interfere any neighbor that has money to spend or likes to bully in such a matter and that proved to be the case in this unlucky instance  austria aud russia with prussia complying hada year ago before the late augusts decease his life seeming then an extremely uncertain one and foresight being always goodprivately come to an understanding 31st december 1731 treaty of lowenwolde which never got completed or became valid scholl ii 223 in case of a polish election  1 that france was to have no hand in it whateverno tool of france to be king or as they more politely expressed it having their eye upon stanislaus no piast or native pole could be eligible  2 that neither could augusts son the new august who would then be kurfurst of saxony be admitted king of polandand on the whole  3 that an emanuel prince of portugal would be the eligible man emanuel of portugal king of portugals brother a gentleman without employment as his very title tells us gentleman never heard of before or since in those parts or elsewhere but doubtless of the due harmless quality as portugal itself was he is to be the polish kingvote these intrusive neighbors what the vote of poland itself may be the destinies do not of late ask finding it a superfluous question  so had the three neighbors settled this matteror rather i should say so had two of them for friedrich wilhelm wanted now or afterwards nothing in this election but that it should not take fire and kindle him two of the neighbors and of these two perhaps we might guess the kaiser was the principal contriver and suggester france and saxony being both hateful to himobstinate refusers of the pragmatic sanction to say nothing more what the czarina anne with the big cheek specially wanted i do not learnunless it were peaceable hold of courland or perhaps merely to produce herself in these parts as a kind of regulating pallas along with the jupiter kaiser of western europewhich might have effects by and by  emanuel of portugal was not elected nor so much as spoken of in the diet nor did one of these three regulations take effect but much the contraryother neighbors having the power to interfere france saw good to interfere a rather distant neighbor austria russia could not endure the french vote at all and so the whole world got on fire by the business  france is not a near neighbor but it has a stanislaus much concerned who is eminently under the protection of francewho may be called the father of france in a sense or even the grandfather his daughter being mother of a young creature they call dauphin or child of france fleury and the french court decide that stanislaus grandfather of france was once king of poland that it will behoove for various reasons he be king again some say old fleury did not care for stanislaus merely wanted a quarrel with the kaiserhaving got himself in readiness with lorraine in his eye and seeing the kaiser not ready it is likelier the hot young spirits belleisle and others controlled old fleury into it at all events stanislaus is summoned from his rustication the french ambassador at warsaw gets his instructions french ambassador opens himself largely at warsaw by eloquent speech by copious money on the subject of stanislaus finds large audience enthusiastic receptivityand readers will now understand the following chronological phenomena of the polish election  august 25th 1733 this day the polish election begins so has the preliminary diet kind of polish caucus ordered itpreliminary diet itself a very stormy matter minority like to be thrown out of window to be shot through the head on some occasions history of stanislaus cited above p 136 actual election begins continues sub dio in the field of wola in a very tempestuous fashion bound to conclude within six weeks kaiser has his troops assembled over the border in silesia to protect the freedom of election czarina has 30000 under marshal lacy lying on the edge of lithuania bent on a like object will increase them to 50000 as the plot thickens  so that emanuel of portugal is not heard of and french interference is with a vengeanceand stanislaus a born piast is overwhelmingly the favorite intolerable to austria to russia the reverse to friedrich wilhelm who privately thinks him the right man and kurfurst august of saxony is the other candidatewith troops of his own in the distance but without support in poland and depending wholly on the kaiser and czarina for his chance and our three settled points are gone to water in this manner  august seeing there was not the least hope in polands own vote judiciously went to the kaiser first of all imperial majesty i will accept your pragmatic sanction root and branch swallow it whole make me king of polanddone answers imperial majesty 16th july 1733 treaty in scholl ii 224231 brings the czarina over by good offers of augusts and hisand now there is an effective opposition candidate in the field with strength of his own and good backing close at hand austrian russian ambassadors at warsaw lift up their voice like the french one open their purse and bestir themselves but with no success in the field of wola except to the stirring up of noise and tumult there they must look to other fields for success the voice of wola and of poland if it had now a voice is enthusiastic for stanislaus  september 7th a couple of quietlooking merchants arrive in warsawone of whom is stanislaus in person newspapers say he is in the french fleet of war which is sailing minatory towards these coasts and there is in truth a gentleman in stanislauss clothes on board thereto make the newspapers believe stanislaus himself drove through berlin a day or two ago gave the sentry a ducat at the gate to be speedy with the passportswhom friedrich wilhelm affected to put under arrest for such negligent speed and so on the 10th of the month stanislaus being now rested and trimmed makes his appearance on the field of wola itself and captivates all hearts by the kind look of him so that on the second day after 12th september 1733 he is as it were unanimously elected with acclamation with enthusiasm and sees himself actual king of polandif france send proper backing to continue him there as surely she will not failbut there are alarming news that the russians are advancing marshal lacy with 30000 and reinforcements in the rear of him  september 22d russians advancing more and more no french help arrived yet and the enthusiastic polish chivalry being good for nothing against regular musketryking stanislaus finds that he will have to quit warsaw and seek covert somewhere quits warsaw this day gets covert in dantzig and in fact from this 22d of september day of the autumnal equinox 1733 is a fugitive blockaded besieged stanislaus an imaginary king thenceforth his real kingship had lasted precisely ten days  october 3d lacy and his russians arrive in the suburbs of warsaw intent upon protecting freedom of election bridges being broken they do not yet cross the river but invite the free electors to come across and vote a real king is very necessarystanislaus being an imaginary one brought in by compulsion by threats of flinging people out of window and the like the free electors do not cross whereupon a small handful now free enough and not to be thrown out of window whom lacy had about him proceed to elect august of saxony he on the 5th of october still one day within the legal six weeks is chosen and declared the real kingtwelve senators and about six hundred gentlemen voting for him there free they in lacys quarters the rest of poland having lain under compulsion when voting for stanislaus that is the polish election so far as poland can settle it we said the destinies had ceased some time since to ask poland for its vote it is other people who have now got the real power of voting but that is the correct state of the poll at warsaw if important to anybody  august is crowned in cracow before long august iii whom we shall meet again in important circumstances lacy and his russians have voted for august able they to disperse all manner of enthusiastic polish chivalry which indeed we observe usually stands but one volley from the russian musketry and flies elsewhither to burn and plunder its own domestic enemies far and wide robbery and arson are prevalent in poland stanislaus lying under covert in dantzigan imaginary king ever since the equinox but well trusting that the french will give him a plumper vote french warfleet is surely under way hither     poland on fire dantzig stands siege  these are the news our crownprince hears at ruppin in the first months of his wedded life there with what interest we may fancy brandenburg is next neighbor and these polish troubles reach far enoughthe eversmoking house having taken fire and all the street threatening to get on blaze friedrich wilhelm nearest neighbor stands anxious to quench carefully sweeping the hot coals across again from his own borders and will not interfere on one or the other side for any persuasion  dantzig strong in confidence of french help refuses to give up stanislaus when summoned will stand siege rather stands siege furious lengthy siegewith enthusiastic defence a lady of rank firing off the first gun against the russian batteries of the siege of dantzig which made the next spring and summer loud for mankind februaryjune 1734 we shall say nothingour own poor field which also grows loud enough lying far away from dantzigexcept  first that no french help came or as good as none the minatory warfleet having landed a poor 1500 men headed by the comte de plelo who had volunteered along with them that they attempted one onslaught on the russian lines and that plelo was shot and the rest were blown to miscellaneous ruin and had to disappear not once getting into dantzig  secondly that the saxons under weissenfels our poor old friend with proper siegeartillery though not with enough did by effort end of may get upon the scene in which this is to be remarked that weissenfelss siegeartillery came by post two big mortars expressly passing through berlin marked as part of the duke of weissenfelss luggage and  thirdly that munnich who had succeeded lacy as besieging general and was in hot haste and had not artillery enough made unheardof assaults 2000 men some say 4000 lost in one nightattack upon a post they call the hagelberg rash attack much blamed by military men oeuvres de frederic xxvii part 2d p 31but nevertheless having now by russian fleet middle of june got siegeartillery enough advances irrepressibly day by day  so that at length things being now desperate stanislaus disguised as a cattledealer privately quitted dantzig night of 27th june 1734 got across the intricate mudandwater difficulties of the weichsel and its mouths flying perilously towards preussen and friedrich wilhelms protection narrative by himself in history pp 235248 whereby the siege of dantzig ended in chamade and levying of penalties penalties severe to a degree though friedrich wilhelm interceded what he could and with the siege of dantzig the blazing polish election went out in like manner clear account especially of siege in mannstein pp 7183 who was there as munnichs aidededamphaving already kindled in quarters far away from it conflagrations quite otherwise interesting to us whitherward we now hasten     chapter ix  kaisers shadowhunt has caught fire  franz of lorraine the young favorite of fortune whom we once saw at berlin on an interesting occasion was about this time to have married his imperial archduchess kaisers consent to be formally demanded and given nothing but joy and splendor looked for in the court of vienna at present nothing to prevent ithad there been no polish election had not the kaiser in his shadowhunt coursing the pragmatic sanction chiefly as he has done these twenty years past gone rashly into that combustible foreign element but so it is this was the fatal limit the poor kaisers shadowhunt going scotfree this long while and merely tormenting other people has at this point by contact with inflammable poland unexpectedly itself caught fire goes now plunging all in mad flame over precipices one knows not how deep and there will be a lamentable singeing and smashing before the kaiser get out of this if he ever get kaiser karl from this point plunges down and down all his days and except in that shadow of a pragmatic sanction if he can still save that has no comfort left marriages are not the thing to be thought of at present  scarcely had the news of augusts election and stanislauss flight to dantzig reached france when france all in a state of readiness informed the kaiser ready for nothing his force lying in silesia doing the election functions on the polish borders there that he the kaiser had by such treatment of the grandfather of france and the polish kingdom fairly fallen to him insulted the most christian majesty that in consequence the most christian majesty did hereby declare war against the said kaiserand in fact had that very day 14th of october 1733 begun it had marched over into lorraine namely secured lorraine against accidents and more specially gone across from strasburg to the german side of the rhine and laid siege to kehl kehl fortress a dilapidated outpost of the reich there which cannot resist many hours here is news for the kaiser with his few troops all on the polish borders minding his neighbors business or chasing pragmatic sanction in those inflammable localities  pacific fleury it must be owned if he wanted a quarrel with the kaiser could not have managed it on more advantageous terms generals a duc de berwick a noailles belleisle generals troops artillery munitions nothing is wanting to fleury to the kaiser all things it is surmised the french had their eye on lorraine not on stanislaus from the first for many centuries especially for these last twoever since that siege of metz which we once saw under kaiser karl v and albert alcibiadesfrance has been wrenching and screwing at this lorraine wriggling it off bit by bit till now as we perceived on lyttelton junior of hagleys visit lorraine seems all lying unscrewed and france by any good opportunity could stick it in her pocket such opportunity sly fleury contrived they sayor more likely it might be belleisle and the other adventurous spirits that urged it on pacific fleurybut at all events he has got it dilapidated kehl yields

done their stroke on lombardy taken milan citadel taken pizzighetone the milanese in whole and appropriated it swept the poor unprepared kaiser clear out of those parts baby carlos and the spaniards

fourscore soon died of those fatigues various marshals broglio coigny noailles succeeding him some of whom are slightly notable to us and there was one maillebois still a subordinate under them whose name also may reappear in this history     subsequent course of the war in the italian part of it  the frenchaustrian war which had now broken out lasted a couple of years the kaiser steadily losing though he did his utmost not so much a war on his part as a being beaten and being stript the scene was italy and the upperrhine country of germany italy the deciding scene where except as it bears on germany our interest is nothing as indeed in germany too it is not much the principal events on both stages are chronologically somewhat as followsbeginning with italy  march 29th 1734 baby carlos with a duke of montemar for general a difficult impetuous gentleman very haughty to the french allies and others lands in naples territory intending to seize the two sicilies according to bargain they find the kaiser quite unprepared and their enterprise extremely feasible  may 10th baby carloswhom we ought to call don carlos who is now eighteen gone and able to ride the great horsemakes triumphant entry into naples having easily swept the road clear styles himself king of the two sicilies papa having surrendered him his right there whom naples in all ranks of it willingly homages as such wrecks of kaisers forces intrench themselves rather strongly at a place called bitonto in apulia not far off  may 25th montemar in an impetuous manner storms them therewhich feat procures for him the title duke of bitonto and finishes off the first of the sicilies and indeed we may say finishes both the sicilies our poor kaiser having no considerable force in either nor means of sending any the seapowers having buttoned their pockets and the combined fleet of france and spain being on the waters there  we need only add on this head that for ten months more baby carlos and montemar went about besieging gaeta messina syracuse and making triumphal entriesand that on the 30th of june 1735 baby carlos had himself fairly crowned at palermo fastes de louis xv i 278 king of the two sicilies de facto in which eminent post he and his continue not with much success to this day  that will suffice for the two sicilies as to lombardy again now that villars is out of it and the coignys and

by the kaisers people after eight hours hot fighting who are then obliged to hurry across the secchia againand in fact do not succeed in fighting any more in that quarter this year or afterwards for next year 1735 montemar is so advanced with the two sicilies he can assist in these northern operations and noailles a better marechal replaces the broglio and coigny there who with learned strategic movements sieges threatenings of siege sweeps the wrecks of austria to a satisfactory degree into the tyrol without fighting or event mentionable thenceforth  this is the kaisers war of two campaigns in the italian which was the decisive part of it a continual being beaten as the reader sees a being stript till one was nearly bare in that quarter     course of the war in the german part of it  in germany the mentionable events are still fewer and indeed but for one small circumstance binding on us we might skip them altogether for there is nothing comfortable in it to the human memory otherwise  marechal duc de berwick a cautious considerable general marlboroughs nephew on what terms is known to readers having taken kehl and plundered the swabian outskirts last winter had extensive plans of operating in the heart of germany and ruining the kaiser there but first he needs and the kaiser is aware of it a basis on the rhine free bridge over the rhine not by strasburg and kehl alone and for this reason he will have to besiege and capture philipsburg first of all strong town of philipsburg well down towards speyerandheidelberg quarter on the german side of the rhine see map here will be our bridge lorraine is already occupied since the first day of the war trarbach strongplace of the moselle and electorate of trier cannot be difficult to get thus were the rhine country on the french side secure to france and so berwick calculates he will have a basis on the rhine from which to shoot forth into the very heart of the kaiser  berwick besieged philipsburg accordingly summer and autumn kaiser doing his feeble best to hinder at the siege berwick lost his life but philipsburg surrendered to his successor all the samekaiser striving to hinder but in a most paralyzed manner and to no purpose whatever andand this properly was the german war the sum of all done in it during those two years  seizure of nanci that is of lorraine seizure of kehl we already heard of then prior to philipsburg there was siege or seizure of trarbach by the french and posterior to it seizure of worms by them and by the germans there was burning of a magazine in speyer by bombs and in brief on both sides there was marching and manoeuvring under various generals our old rusty seckendorf one of them till the end of 1735 when the italian decision arrived and truce and peace along with it but there was no other action worth naming even in the newspapers as a wonder of nine days the siege of philipsburg and what hung flickering round that operation before and after was the sumtotal of the german war  philipsburg key of the rhine in those parts has had many sieges nor would this one merit the least history from us were it not for one circumstance that our crownprince was of the opposing army and made his first experience of arms there a siege of philipsburg slightly memorable to us on that one account what friedrich did there which in the military way was as good as nothing what he saw and experienced there which with some eighty princes of the reich a prince eugene for general and three months under canvas on the field may have been something this in outline by such obscure indications as remain we would fain make conceivable to the reader indications in the historybooks we have as good as none but must gather what there is from wilhelmina and the crownprinces lettersmuch studying to be brief were it possible     chapter x  crownprince goes to the rhine campaign  the kaiserwith kehl snatched from him the rhine open and louis xv singing te deum in the christmas time for what villars in italy had doneapplied in passionate haste to the reich the reich though fleury tried to cajole it and apologize for taking kehl from it declares for the kaisers quarrel war against france on his behalf 13th march 1734 buchholz i 131it was in this way that friedrich wilhelm and our crownprince came to be concerned in the rhine campaign the kaiser will have a reichsarmy were it good for much as is not likely to join to his own austrian one and if prince eugene who is reichsfeldmarschall one of the two feldmarschalls get the generalship as men hope it is not doubted but there will be great work on the rhine this summer of 1734  unhappily the reichsarmy raised frommultifarious contingents and guided and provided for by many heads is usually good for little not to say that old kurpfalz with an eye to french help in the bergandjulich matter old kurpfalz and the bavarian set kurbaiern and kurkoln bavaria and cologne who are brothers and of old cousinship to kurpfalzquite refuse their contingents protest in the diet and openly have french leanings these are bad omens for the reichsarmy and in regard to the reichsfeldmarschall office there also is a difficulty the reich as we hinted keeps two supreme feldmarschalls one catholic one protestant for equilibriums sake illustrious prince eugenio von savoye is the catholicbut as to the protestant it is a difficulty worth observing for a moment  old duke eberhard ludwig of wurtemberg the unfortunate old gentleman bewitched by the gravenitz deliver us from evil used to be the reichsfeldmarschall of protestant persuasioncommanderinchief for the reich when it tried fighting old eberhard had been at blenheim and had marched up and down i never heard he was much of a general perhaps good enough for the reich whose troops were always bad but now that poor duke as we intimated once or more is dead there must be of protestant type a new reichsfeldmasschall had one catholic unequalled among captains we already have but where is the protestant duke eberhard being dead  duke eberhards successor in wurtemberg karl alexander by name whom we once dined with at prag on the kladrup journey he a general of some worth would be a natural person unluckily duke karl alexander had while an austrian officer and without outlooks upon protestant wurtemberg gone over to papacy and is now catholic two catholic feldmarschalls cries the corpus evangelicorum that will never do  well on the other or protestant side there appear two candidates one of them not much expected by the reader no other than ferdinand duke of brunswickbevern our crownprinces fatherinlaw whom we knew to be a worthy man but did not know to be much of a soldier or capable of these ambitious views he is candidate first then there is a second much more entitled our gunpowder friend the old dessauer who to say nothing of his soldier qualities has promises from the kaiserhe surely were the man if it did not hurt other peoples feelings but it surely does and will there is ferdinand of bevern applying upon the score of old promises too how can peoples feelings be saved protestants these two last but they cannot both have it and what will wurtemberg say to either of them the reich was in very great affliction about this preliminary matter but friedrich wilhelm steps in with a healing recipe let there be four reichsfeldmarschalls said friedrich wilhelm two protestant and two catholic wont that doexcellent answers the reich and there are four feldmarschalls for the time being no lack of commanders to the reichsarmy brunswickbevern tried it first but only till prince eugene were ready and indeed he had of himself come to nothing before that date prince eugene next then karl alexander next and in fact they all might have had a stroke at commanding and at coming to nothing or littleonly the old dessauer sulked at the office in this its fourfold state and never would fairly have it till by decease of occupants it came to be twofold again this glimpse into the distracted effete interior of the poor old reich and its politics with friends of ours concerned there let it be welcome to the reader leopoldi von anhaltdessau leben by ranfft p 127 buchholz i 131  friedrich wilhelm was without concern in this war or in what had led to it practical share in the polish election after that preliminary theoretic program of the kaisers and czarinas went to smoke friedrich wilhelm steadily refused to take though considerable offers were made him on both sidesoffer of west preussen polish part of prussia which once was known to us on the french side by de la chetardie french ambassador at berlin buchholz i 130 but his primary fixed resolution was to stand out of the quarrel and he abides by that suppresses any wishes of his own in regard to the polish electionkeeps ward on his own frontiers with good military besom in hand to sweep it out again if it intruded there what king you like in gods name only dont come over my threshold with his brabbles and him  but seeing the kaiser got into actual french war with the reich consenting he is bound by treaty of old date date older than wusterhausen though it was confirmed on that famous occasion to assist the kaiser with ten thousand men and this engagement he intends amply to fulfil no sooner therefore had the reich given sure signs of assenting reichs assent is the condition of the ten thousand than friedrich wilhelms orders were out be in readiness friedrich wilhelm by the time of the reichs actual assent or declaration of war on the kaisers behalf has but to lift his finger squadrons and battalions out of pommern out of magdeburg out of preussen to the due amount will get on march whitherward you bid and be with you there at the day you indicate almost at the hour captains not of an imaginary nature these are always busy and the king himself is busy over them from big guns and wagonhorses down to gunflints and gaiterstraps all is marked in registers nothing is wanting nothing out of its place at any time in friedrich wilhelms army  from an early period the french intentions upon philipsburg might be foreseen or guessed and in the end of march marechal berwick in three divisions fairly appears in that quarter his purpose evident so that the reichsarmy were it in the least ready ought to rendezvous and reinforce the handful of austrians there friedrich wilhelms part of the reichsarmy does accordingly straightway get on march leaves berlin after the due reviewing 8th april fassmann p

quarter fortified under difficulties by old bishops of speyer who sometimes resided there kohler munzbelustigungen vi 169 has been dismantled and refortified has had its rhinebridge torn down and set up again been garrisoned now by this party now by that who had right of garrison there nay france has sometimes had the right of garrisonand the poor little town has suffered much and been tumbled sadly about in the successionwars and perpetual controversies between france and germany in that quarter in the time we are speaking of it has a flyingbridge of i know not what structure with fortified bridgehead tetedepont on the western or franceward side of the river towns bulwarks and complex engineering defences are of good strength all put in repair for this occasion reich and kaiser have an effective garrison there and a commandant determined on defence to the uttermost what the unfortunate inhabitants perhaps a thousand or so in number thought or did under such a visitation of ruin and bombshells history gives not the least hint anywhere quite used to it thinks history and attends to other points  the rhine valley here is not of great breadth eastward the heights rise to be mountainous in not many miles by way of defence to this valley in the eugenemarlborough wars there was about forty miles southward or higher up the river than philipsburg a military line or chain of posts going from stollhofen a boggy hamlet on the rhine with cunning indentations and learned concatenation of bog and bluff up into the inaccessibilitieslines of stollhofen the name of itwhich welldevised barrier did good service for certain years it was not till i think the fourth year of their existence year 1707 that villars the same villars who is now in italy stormed the lines of stollhofen which made him famous that year  the lines of stollhofen have now in 1734 fallen flat again but eugene remembers them and i could guess it was he who suggests a similar expedient at all events there is a similar expedient fallen upon lines of ettlingen this time onehalf nearer philipsburg running from muhlburg on the rhinebrink up to ettlingen in the hills see map nearer by twenty miles and i guess much more slightly done we shall see these lines of ettlingen one point of them for a momentand they would not be worth mentioning at all except that in careless books they too are called lines of stollhofen wilhelmina ii 206 for instance who or whose printer call them lines of stokoff even and the ingenuous reader is sent wandering on his map to no purpose  lines of ettlingen they are related as now said to the stollhofen set duke ferdinand of brunswickbevern one of the four feldmarschalls has some ineffectual handful of imperial troops dotted about within these lines and

little hero once on the ground  on mayday marechal berwick who has been awake in this quarter in three divisions for a month pastvery impatient till belleisle with the first division should have taken trarbach and made the western interior parts securedid actually cross the rhine with his second division at fort louis well up the river well south of philipsburg intending to attack the lines of ettlingen and so get in upon the town there is a third division about to lay pontoons for itself a good way farther down which will attack the lines simultaneously from withinthat is to say shall come upon the back of poor bevern and his defensive handful of troops and astonish him there all prospers to berwick in this matter noailles his lieutenant not yet gone to italy till next year with whom is

collection iii 207 this is not like storming the lines of stollhofen a thing to make noailles famous in the newspapers for a year but it was a useful small feat and well enough performed on his part the truth is berwick was about attacking the lines simultaneously on the other or muhlburg end of them had not noailles now victorious galloped to forbid and what was far more considerable those other

thrown up strong lines behind him strongly manned to defend himself from eugene across the river berwick has one bridge and at the farther end one battery with which he plays upon the rear of

usual there which inundations berwick had well foreseen though the warminister at paris would not haste answered the warminister always we shall be in right time i tell you there have fallen no snows this winter how can inundation bedepends on the heat said berwick there are snows enough always in stock up there  and so it proves though the warminister would not believe and berwick has to take the inundations and to take the circumstancesand to try if by his own continual best exertions he can but get philipsburg into the bargain on the 12th of june visiting his posts as he daily does the first thing berwick stept out of the trenches anxious for clear view of something stept upon the crest of the sap a place exposed to both french and austrian batteries and which had been forbidden to the soldiersand there as he anxiously scanned matters through his glass a cannonball unknown whether french or austrian shivered away the head of berwick left others to deal with the criticisms and the inundations and the operations big or little at philipsburg and elsewhere siege went on better or worse under the next in command paris in great anxiety say the books  it is a hot siege a stiff

in about a week he has given strict order against waste of time not to part company go together and not by anspach or baireuththough they lie almost straight for you  this latter was a sore clause to friedrich who had counted all along on seeing his dear faithful wilhelmina as he passed therefore as the papas orders dangerous penalty lying in them cannot be literally disobeyed the question rises

ten the heat was excessive i found myself quite worn out with the little journey i had done i alighted at the house which had been got ready for my brother we waited for him and in vain waited till three in the afternoon at three we lost patience had dinner served without him whilst we were at table there came on a frightful thunderstorm i have witnessed nothing so terrible the thunder roared and reverberated among the rocky cliffs which begirdle berneck and it seemed as if the world was going to perish a deluge of rain succeeded the thunder  it was four oclock and i could not understand what had become of my brother i had sent out several persons on horseback to get tidings of him and none of them came back at length in spite of all my prayers the hereditary prince my excellent husband himself would go in search i remained waiting till nine at night and nobody returned i was in cruel agitations these cataracts of rain are very dangerous in the mountain countries the roads get suddenly overflowed and there often happen misfortunes i thought for certain there had one happened to my brother or to the hereditary prince such a 2d of july to poor wilhelmina  at last about nine somebody brought word that my brother had changed his route and was gone to culmbach a house of ours lying westward known to readers there to stay overnight i was for setting out thitherculmbach

angry brooks the horses could not cross but by swimming  i arrived at last about one in the morning i instantly threw myself on a bed i was like to die with weariness and in mortal terrors that something had happened to my brother or the hereditary prince this latter relieved me on his own score he arrived at last about four oclockhad still no news farther of my brother i was beginning to doze a little when they came to warn me that m von knobelsdorf wished to speak with me from the princeroyal i darted out of bed and ran to him he handing me a letter brought word that  but let us now give letter second which has turned up lately and which curiously completes the picture here friedrich on rising refreshed with sleep at hof had taken a cheerfuler view and the generals still lagging rearward he thinks it possible to see wilhelmina after all possible and yet so very dangerousperhaps not possible here is a second letter written from munchberg some fifteen miles farther on at an

off north of us near by the rhine there is a steeple there from which one can see the french camp from this point i will ride down between the two lines french and ours to see what they are like  there are quantities of hurdles and fascines being made which as i hear are to be employed in one of two different plans the first plan is to attack the french retrenchment generally the ditch which is before it and the morass which lies on our left wing to be made passable with these fascines the other plan is to amuse the enemy by a false attack and throw succor into the townone thing is certain in a few days we shall have a stroke of work here happen what may my allgracious father may be assured that c and that i will do nothing unworthy of him  friedrich  oeuvres xxvii part 3d p 79  neither of those fine plans took effect nor did anything take effect as we shall see but in regard to that survey from the steeple of waghausel and ride home again between the linesin regard to that here is an authentic fraction of anecdote curiously fitting in which should not be omitted a certain herr van suhm saxon minister at berlin occasionally mentioned here stood in much correspondence with the crownprince in the years now following correspondence which was all published at the due distance of time suhm having at his decease left the princes letters carefully assorted with that view and furnished with a prefatory character of the princeroyal portrait du princeroyal par m de suhm of which preface this is a small paragraph relating to the siege of philipsburg offering us a momentary glance into one fibre of the futile war now going on there of suhm and how exact he was we shall know a little by and by of prince von lichtenstein an austrian man and soldier of much distinction afterwards we have only to say that he came to berlin next year on diplomatic business and that probably enough he had been eyewitness to the little factfact credible perhaps without much proving one rather regretted there was no date to it no detail to give it whereabout and fixity in our conception that the poor little anecdote though indubitable had to hang vaguely in the air now however the above dated letter does by accident date suhms anecdote too date july 8 as good as certain for it the siege itself having ended july 18 in ten days more herr von suhm writes not for publication till after friedrichs death and his own  it was remarked in the rhine campaign of 1734 that this prince has a great deal of intrepidity beaucoup de valeur on one occasion among others to all appearance this very day july 8 riding home from waghausel between the lines when he had gone to reconnoitre the lines of philipsburg with a good many people about himpassing on his return along a strip of very thin wood the cannonshot from the lines accompanied him incessantly and crashed down several trees at his side during all which he walked his horse along at the old pace precisely as if nothing were happening nor in his hand upon the bridle was there the least trace of motion perceptible those who gave attention to the matter remarked on the contrary that he did not discontinue speaking very tranquilly to some generals who accompanied him and who admired his bearing in a kind of danger with which he had not yet had occasion to familiarize himself it is from the prince von

fred now falling into much discrepancy with his father and at a loss for a career to himself appeared on a sudden in the antechamber at st jamess one day and solemnly demanded an interview with his majesty which his indignant majesty after some conference with walpole decided to grant prince fred when admitted made three demands 1 to be allowed to go upon the rhine campaign by way of a temporary career for himself 2 that he might have something definite to live upon a fixed revenue being suitable in his circumstances 3 that after those sad prussian disappointments some suitable consort might be chosen for himheart and household lying in such waste condition poor fred who of us knows what of sense might be in these demands few creatures more absurdly situated are to be found in this world to go where his equals were and learn soldiering a little might really have been useful paternal majesty received fred and his three demands with fulminating look answered to the first two nothing to

almost and becoming parliamentary fireship to his majestys opposition  friedrich wilhelm stayed a month campaigning here graciously declined prince eugenes invitation to lodge in headquarters under a roof and within built walls preferred a tent among his own people and took the common hardshipswith great hurt to his weak health as was afterwards found  in these weeks the big czarina who has set a price 100000 rubles say 15000 pounds upon the head of poor stanislaus hears that his prussian majesty protects him and thereupon signifies in high terms that she by her feldmarschall munnich will come across the frontiers and seize the said stanislaus to which his prussian majesty answers positively though in proper diplomatic tone madam i will in no wise permit it perhaps his majestys remarkablest transaction here on the rhine was this concerning stanislaus for seckendorf the feldzeugmeister was here also on military function not forgetful of the diplomacies who busily assailed his majesty on the kaisers part in the same direction give up stanislaus your majesty how ridiculous lacherlich to be perhaps ruined for stanislaus but without the least effect now or afterwards  poor stanislaus in the beginning of july got across into preussen as we intimated and there he continued safe against any amount of rubles and feldmarschalls entreaties and menaces at angerburg on the prussian frontier

doorpost alike to the menaces and the entreaties of kaiser and czarina strictly intimating to munnich what the laws of neutrality are and that they must be observed which by his majestys good arrangements munnich willing enough to the contrary had it been feasible found himself obliged to comply with prussian majesty like a king and a gentleman would listen to no terms about dismissing or delivering up or otherwise failing in the sacred rites to stanislaus but honorably kept him there till the times and routes cleared themselves again forster ii 132 134136 a plain piece of duty punctually done the beginning of it falls here in the camp at philipsburg julyaugust 1734 in may 1736 we shall see some glimpse of the end  his prussian majesty in camp at philipsburgso distinguished

speak nothing to be consulted of fascines and hurdles lay useless no attempt was made to relieve philipsburg on the third day after his majestys arrival july 18th philipsburg after a stiff defence of six weeks growing hopeless of relief had to surrenderfrench then proceeded to repair philipsburg no attempt on eugenes part to molest them there if they try ulterior operations on this side the river he countertries and that is all  our crownprince somewhat of a judge in after years is maturely of opinion that the french lines were by no means inexpugnable that the french army might have been ruined under an attack of the proper kind oeuvres de frederic i 167 their position was bad no room to unfold themselves for fight except with the towns cannon playing on them all the while only one bridge to get across by in case of coming to the worse defeat of them probable and ruin to them inevitable in case of defeat but prince eugene with an army little to his mind reichscontingents not to be depended on thought eugene durst not venture seventeen victorious battles and if we should be defeated in the eighteenth and last  it is probable the old dessauer had he been generalissimo with this same armyin which even in the reichs part of it we know ten thousand of an effective characterwould have done some stroke upon the french but prince eugene would not try much dimmed from his former self this old hero age now 73a good deal wearied with the long march through time and this very summer his brothers son the last male of his house had suddenly died of inflammatory fever left the old man very mournful alone alone at the end of ones long march laurels have no fruit then he stood cautious on the defensive and in this capacity is admitted to have shown skilful management  but

following nor in friedrichs own letters or in other documents is there on the best examination anything considerable to be gleaned respecting his procedures there he hears of the illsuccess in italy battle of parma at the due date with the natural feelings speaks with a sorrowful gayety of the muddy fatigues futilities here on the rhinehas the sense however not to blame his superiors unreasonably here from one of his letters to colonel camas is a passage worth quoting for the credit of the writer with camas a distinguished prussian frenchman whom we mentioned elsewhere still more with madame camas in time coming he corresponded much often in a fine filial manner  the present campaign is a school where profit may be reaped from observing the confusion and disorder which reigns in this army it has been a field very barren in laurels and those who have been used all their life to gather such and on seventeen distinguished occasions have done so can get none this time next year we all hope to be on the moselle and to find that a fruitfuler field i am afraid dear camas you think i am going to put on the cothurnus to set up for a small eugene and pronouncing with a doctoral tone what each should have done and not have done condemn and blame to right and left no my dear camas far from carrying my arrogance to that point i admire the conduct of our chief and do not disapprove that of his worthy adversary and far from forgetting the esteem and consideration due to persons who scarred with wounds have by years and long service gained a consummate experience i shall hear them more willingly than ever as my teachers and try to learn from them how to arrive at honor and what is the shortest road into the secret of this profession camp at heidelberg 11th september 1734 oeuvres xvi

ourselves heroic thou sittest thou devil at home  duc de bouillon has lost his equipage our hussars took it at landau other side the rhine a while ago here we stand in mud to the ears fifteen of the

same at a frightful rate adieu if the devil dont get thee he ought therefore vale oeuvres de frederic xxvii part 3d p 181  friedrich  no laurels to be gained here but plenty of mud and laborious hardshipmet as we perceive with youthful stoicism of the derisive and perhaps of better forms friedrich is twentytwo and some months when he makes his first campaign the general physiognomy of his behavior in it we have to guess from these few indications no doubt he profited by it on the military side and would study with quite new light and vivacity after such contact with the fact studied of very didactic to witness even the confusions of this army and what comes of them to armies for the rest the society of eugene lichtenstein and so many princes of the reich and chiefs of existing mankind could not but be entertaining to the young man and silently if he wished to read the actual time as sure enough he with human and with royal eagerness did wishthey were here as the alphabet of it to him important for years coming nay it is not doubted the insight he here got into the condition of the austrian army and its managementarmy left seven days without bread for one instancegave him afterwards the highly important notion that such army could be beaten if necessary  wilhelmina says his chief comrade was margraf heinrichthe ill margraf who was cut by friedrich in after years for some unknown bad behavior margraf heinrich led him into all manner of excesses says wilhelminaprobably in the language of exaggeration he himself tells her in one of his letters a day or two before papas departure the camp is soon to be close on mainz nothing but the rhine between mainz and our right wing where my place is and so soon as serenissimus goes le serenissime so he irreverently names papa i mean to be across for some sport oeuvres de frederic xxvii part 1st p 17 10th augustno doubt the ill margraf with me with the elder margraf little sophies betrothed whom he called big clown in a letter we read he is at this date in open quarrelbrouille a toute outrance with the mad soninlaw who is the wildest wildbeast of all this camp ibid  wilhelminas husband had come in the beginning of august but was not so happy as he expected considerably cut out by the ill heinrich here is a small adventure they had mentioned by friedrich and copiously recorded by wilhelmina adventure on some riverwhich we could guess if it were worth guessing to have been the neckar not the rhine french had a fortified post on the farther side of this river crownprince ill margraf and wilhelminas husband were quietly looking about them riding up the other side wilhelminas husband decided to take a pencildrawing of the french post and paused for that object drawing was proceeding unmolested when his foolish baireuth hussar having an excellent rifle arquebuse rayee with him took it into his head to have a shot at the french sentries at long range his shot hit nothing but it awakened the french animosity as was natural the french began diligently firing and might easily have done mischief my husband volleying out some rebuke upon the blockhead of a hussar finished his drawing in spite of the french bullets then rode up to the crownprince and ill margraf who had got their share of what was going and were in no goodhumor with him ill margraf rounded things into the crownprinces ear in an unmannerly way with glances at my husbandwho understood it well enough and promptly coerced such illbred procedures intimating in a polite impressive way that they would be dangerous if persisted in which reduced the ill margraf to a spiteful but silent condition no other harm was done at that time the french bullets all went awry or even fell short being sucked in by the river thinks wilhelmina wilhelmina ii 208 209 oeuvres de frederic xxvii part 1st p 19  a more important feature of the crownprinces life in these latter weeks is the news he gets of his father friedrich wilhelm after quitting the electoral yacht did his reviewing at wesel at bielefeld all his reviewing in those rhine and weser countries then turned aside to pay a promised visit to ginkel the berlin dutch ambassador who has a fine house in those parts and there his majesty has fallen seriously ill obliged to pause at ginkels and then at his own schloss of moyland for some time does not reach potsdam till the 14th september and then in a weak worsening and altogether dangerous condition which lasts for months to come fassmann pp 512533 september 1734january 1735 wrecks of gout they say and of all manner of nosological mischief falling to dropsy case desperate think all the newspapers in a cautious form which is friedrich wilhelms own opinion pretty much and that of those better informed here are thoughts for a crownprince well affected to his father yet suffering much from him which is grievous to bystanders one now makes a different figure a crownprince who may be king one of these dayswhom a little adulation were well spent upon from within and from without come agitating influences thoughts which must be rigorously repressed and which are not wholly repressible the soldiering crownprince from about the end of september for the last week or two of this campaign is secretly no longer quite the same to himself or to others     glimpse of lieutenant chasot and of other acquisitions  we have still two little points to specify or to bring up from the rearward whither they are fallen in regard to this campaign after which the wearisome campaign shall terminate crownprince leading his ten thousand to frankfurt towards their winterquarters in westphalia and then himself running across from frankfurt october 5th to see wilhelmina for a day or two on the way homewardswith much pleasure to all parties my readers and me included  first point is that some time in this campaign probably towards the end of it the crownprince old dessauer and some others with them procured passports went across and saw the french camp and what new phenomena were in it for them where when how or with what impression left on either side we do not learn it was not much of a camp for military admiration this of the french memoires de noailles passim there were old soldiers of distinction in it here and there a few young soldiers diligently studious of their art and a great many young fops of high birth and high ways strutting about in redheeled shoes with commissions got from court for this war and nothing of the soldier but the epaulettes and plumagesapt to be insolent among their poorer comrades from all parties young and old even from that insolent redheel party nothing but the highest finish of politeness could be visible on this particular occasion doubtless all passed in the usual satisfactory manner and the crownprince got his pleasant excursion and materials more or less for after thought and comparison but as there is nothing whatever of it on record for us but the bare fact we leave it to the readers imaginationfact being indubitable and details not inconceivable to lively readers among the french dignitaries doing the honors of their camp on this occasion he was struck by the generals adjutant a count de rottembourg properly von rothenburg of german birth kinsman to the rothenburg whom we have seen as french ambassador at berlin long since a promising young soldier whom he did not lose sight of again but acquired in due time to his own service and found to be of eminent worth there a count von schmettau two brothers von schmettau here in the austrian service superior men prussian by birth and very fit to be acquired by and by these the crownprince had already noticed in this rhine campaignhaving always his eyes open to phenomena of that kind  the second little point is of date perhaps two months anterior to that of the french camp and is marked sufficiently in this excerpt from our confused manuscripts  before quitting philipsburg there befell one slight adventure which though it seemed to be nothing is worth recording here one day date not given a young french officer of ingenuous prepossessing look though much flurried at the moment came across as involuntary deserter flying from a great peril in his own camp the name of him is chasot lieutenant of such and such a regiment take me to prince eugene he entreats which is done peril was this a high young gentleman one of those fops in red heels ignorant and capable of insolence to a poorer comrade of studious turn had fixed a duel upon chasot chasot ran him through in fair duel dead and is thought to have deserved it but duc de boufflers is his kinsman run or you are lost cried everybody the officers of his regiment hastily redacted some certificate for chasot hastily signed it and chasot ran scarcely waiting to pack his baggage  will not your serene highness protect mecertainly said eugenegave chasot a lodging among his own people and appointed one of them herr brender by name to show him about and teach him the nature of his new quarters chasot a brisk ingenuous young fellow soon became a favorite eager to be useful where possible and very pleasant in discourse said everybody  by and bystill at philipsburg as would seem though it is not saidthe crownprince heard of chasot asked brender to bring him over here is chasots own account through which as through a small eyelethole we peep once more and for the last time direct into the crownprinces campaignlife on this occasion  next morning at ten oclock the appointed hour brender having ordered out one of his horses for me i accompanied him to the prince who received us in his tentbehind which he had hollowed out to the depth of three or four feet a large diningroom with windows and a roof i hope of good height thatched with straw his royal highness after two hours conversation in which he had put a hundred questions to me a prince desirous of knowing the facts dismissed us and at parting bade me return often to him in the evenings  it was in this diningroom at the end of a great dinner the day after next that the prussian guard introduced a trumpet from monsieur dasfeld french commanderinchief since berwicks death with my three horses sent over from the french army prince eugene who was present and in good humor said we must sell those horses they dont speak german brender will take care to mount you some way or other prinoe lichtenstein immediately put a price on my horses and they were sold on the spot at three times their worth the prince of orange who was of this dinner slightly crookbacked witty gentleman english honeymoon well over said to me in a halfwhisper monsieur there is nothing like selling horses to people who have dined well  after this sale i found myself richer than i had ever been in my life the princeroyal sent me almost daily a groom and led horse that i might come to him and sometimes follow him in his excursions at last he had it proposed to me by m de brender and even by prince eugene to accompany him to berlin which of course i did taking ruppin first i arrived at berlin from ruppin in 1734 two days after the marriage of friedrich wilhelm margraf of schwedt ill margrafs elder brother wildest wildbeast of this camp with the princess sophiethat is to say 12th of november marriage having been on the 10th as the books teach us chasot remembers that on the 14th the crownprince gave in his berlin mansion a dinner to all the royal family in honor of that auspicious wedding kurd vou schlozer  chasot berlin 1856 pp 2022 a pleasant little book tolerably accurate and of very readable quality  thus is chasot established with the crownprince he will turn up fighting well in subsequent parts of this history and again duelling fatally though nothing of a quarrelsome man as he asserts     crownprinces visit to baireuth on the way home  october 4th the crownprince has parted with prince eugenenot to meet again in this world an old hero gone to the shadow of himself says the crownprince oeuvres memoires de brandebourg i 167and is giving his prussian warcaptains a farewell dinner at frankfurtonmayn having himself led the ten thousand so far towards winterquarters and handing them over now to their usual commanders they are to winter in westphalia these ten thousand in the paderbornmunster country where they are nothing like welcome to the ruling powers nor are intended to be sokurkoln proprietor there and his brother of bavaria having openly french leanings the prussian ten thousand will have to help themselves to the essential therefore without welcomeand things are not pleasant and the ruling powers by protocolling still more the commonalty if it try at mobbing 28th march 1735 fassmann p 547 buchholz i 136 can only make them worse indeed it is said the ten thousand though their bearing was so perfect otherwise generally behaved rather ill in their marches over germany during this warand always worst it was remarked by observant persons in the countries bamberg and wurzburg for instance where their officers had in past years been in recruiting troubles whereby observant persons explained the phenomenon to themselves but we omit all that our concern lying elsewhere directly after dinner at frankfurt the crownprince drives off rapidly as his wont is towards baireuth he arrives there on the morrow october 5th says wilhelminawho again illuminates him to us though with oblique lights for an instant  wilhelmina was in low spiritsweak health add funeral of the prince of culmbach killed in the battle of parma illness of papa and other sombre eventsand was by no means content with the crownprince on this occasion strangely altered since we met him in july last it may be the crownprince looking with an airy buoyancy of mind towards a certain event probably near has got his young head inflated a little and carries himself with a height new to this beloved sisterbut probably the sad humor of the princess herself has a good deal to do with it alas the contrast between a heart knowing secretly its own bitterness and a friends heart conscious of joy and triumph is harsh and shocking to the former of the two here is the princesss account with the subtrahend twentyfive or seventyfive per cent not deducted from it  my brother arrived the 5th of october he seemed to me put out decontenance and to break off conversation with me he said he had to write to the king and queen i ordered him pen and paper he wrote in my room and spent more than a good hour in writing a couple of letters of a line or two each he then had all the court one after the other introduced to him said nothing to any of them looked merely with a mocking air at them after which we went to dinner  here his whole conversation consisted in quizzing turlupiner whatever he saw and repeating to me above a hundred times over the words little prince little court i was shocked and could not understand how he had changed so suddenly towards me the etiquette of all courts in the empire is that nobody who has not at the least the rank of captain can sit at a princes table my brother put a lieutenant there who was in his suite saying to me a kings lieutenants are as good as a margrafs ministers i swallowed this incivility and showed no sign  after dinner being alone with me he saidturning up the flippant side of his thoughts truly in a questionable wayour sire is going to end tire a sa fin he will not live out this month i know i have made you great promises but i am not in a condition to keep them i will give you up the half of the sum which the late king our grandfather lent you supra pp 161 162 i think you will have every reason to be satisfied with that i answered that my regard for him had never been of an interested nature that i would never ask anything of him but the continuance of his friendship and did not wish one sou if it would in the least inconvenience him no no said he you shall have those 100000 thalers i have destined them for youpeople will be much surprised continued he to see me act quite differently from what they had expected they imagine i am going to lavish all my treasures and that money will become as common as pebbles at berlin but they will find i know better i mean to increase my army and to leave all other things on the old footing i will have every consideration for the queen my mother and will sate her rassasierai with honors but i do not mean that she shall meddle in my affairs and if she try it she will find so what a speech what an outbreak of candor in the young man preoccupied with his own great thoughts and difficultiesto the exclusion of any other persons  i fell from the clouds on hearing all that and knew not if i was sleeping or waking he then questioned me on the affairs of this country i gave him the detail of them he said to me when your goose benet of a fatherinlaw dies i advise you to break up the whole court and reduce yourselves to the footing of a private gentlemans establishment in order to pay your debts in real truth you have no need of so many people and you must try also to reduce the wages of those whom you cannot help keeping you have been accustomed to live at berlin with a table of four dishes that is all you want here and i will invite you now and then to berlin which will spare table and housekeeping  for a long while my heart had been getting big i could not restrain my tears at hearing all these indignities why do you cry said he ah ah you are in low spirits i see we must dissipate that dark humor the music waits us i will drive that fit out of you by an air or two on the flute he gave me his hand and led me into the other room i sat down to the harpsichord which i inundated inondai with my tears marwitz my artful demoiselle datours perhaps too artful in time coming placed herself opposite me so as to hide from the others what disorder i was in wilhelmina ii 216218  for the last two days of the visit wilhelmina admits her brother was a little kinder but on the fourth day there came by estafette a letter from the queen conjuring him to return without delay the king growing worse and worse wilhelmina who loved her father and whose outlooks in case of his decease appeared to be so little flattering was overwhelmed with sorrow of her brother however she strove to forget that strange outbreak of candor and parted with him as if all were mended between them again nay the day after his departure there goes a beautifully affectionate letter to him which we could give if there were room oeuvres xxvii part 1st p 23 the happiest time i ever in my life had my heart so full of gratitude and so sensibly touched every one repeating the words dear brother and charming princeroyala letter in very lively contrast to what we have just been reading a princeroyal not without charm in spite of the hard practicalities he is meditating obliged to meditate  as to the outbreak of candor offensive to wilhelmina and us we suppose her report of it to be in substance true though of exaggerated perhaps perverted tone and it is worth the readers note with these deductions the truth is our charming princess is always liable to a certain subtrahend in 1744 when she wrote those memoires in a summerhouse at baireuth her brother and she owing mainly to gobetweens acting on the susceptible female heart were again in temporary quarrel the longest and worst they ever had and hardly on speaking terms which of itself made her heart very heavynot to say that marwitz the too artful demoiselle seemed to have stolen her husbands affections from the poor princess and made the world look all a little grim to her these circumstances have given their color to parts of her narrative and are not to be forgotten by readers  the crownprincewho goes by dessau lodging for a night with the old dessauer and writes affectionately to his sister from that place their letters crossing on the roadgets home on the 12th to potsdam october 12th 1734 he has ended his rhine campaign in that mannerand sees his poor father with a great many other feelings besides those expressed in the dialogue at baireuth     chapter xi  in papas sickroom prussian inspections end of war  it appears friedrich met a cordial reception in the sickroom at potsdam and in spite of his levities to wilhelmina was struck to the heart by what he saw there for months to come he seems to be continually running between potsdam and ruppin eager to minister to his sick father when military leave is procurable other fact about him other aspect of him in those months is not on record for us  of his young madam or princessroyal peaceably resident at berlin or at schonhausen and doing the vacant officialities formal visitings and the like we hear nothing of queen sophie and the others nothing anxious all of them no doubt about the event at potsdam and otherwise silent to us his majestys illness comes and goes now hope and again almost none margraf of schwedt and his young bride we already know were married in november and lieutenant chasot two days old in berlin told us there was dinner by the crownprince to all the royal family on that occasionpoor majesty out at potsdam languishing in the background meanwhile  his carnival the crownprince passes naturally at berlin we find he takes a good deal to the french ambassador one marquis de la chetardie a showy restless character of fame in the gazettes of that time who did much intriguing at petersburg some years hence first in a signally triumphant way and then in a signally untriumphant and is not now worth any knowledge but a transient accidental one chetardie came hither about stanislaus and his affairs tried hard but in vain to tempt friedrich wilhelm into interferenceis naturally anxious to captivate the crownprince in present circumstances  friedrich wilhelm lay at potsdam between death and life for almost four months to come the newspapers speculating much on his situation political people extremely anxious what would become of himor in fact when he would die for that was considered the likely issue fassmann gives dolorous clippings from the leyden gazette all in a blubber of tears according to the then fashion but full of impertinent curiosity withal and from the seckendorf private papers there are extracts of a still more inquisitive and notable character seckendorf and the kaiser having an intense interest in this painful occurrence  seckendorf is not now himself at berlin but running much about on other errands can only see friedrich wilhelm if at all in a passing way and even this will soon ceaseand in fact to us it is by far the most excellent result of this frenchaustrian war that it carries seckendorf clear away who now quits berlin and the diplomatic line and obligingly goes out of our sight henceforth the old ordnancemaster as an imperial general of rank is needed now for warservice if he has any skill that way in those late months he was duly in attendance at philipsburg and the rhinecampaign in a subaltern torpid capacity like brunswickbevern and the others ready for work had there been any but next season he expects to have a division of his own and to do something considerablein regard to berlin and the diplomacies he has appointed a nephew of his a seckendorf junior to take his place there to keep the old machinery in gear if nothing more and furnish copious reports during the present crisis these reports of seckendorf juniorfull of eavesdroppings got from a kammermohr nigger lackey who waits in the sickroom at potsdam and is sensible to bribeshave been printed and we mean to glance slightly into them but as to seckendorf senior readers can entertain the fixed hope that they have at length done with him that in these our premises we shall never see him againnay shall see him on extraneous dim fields far enough away smarting and suffering till even we are almost sorry for the old knave  friedrich wilhelms own prevailing opinion is that he cannot recover his bodily sufferings are great dropsically swollen sometimes like to be choked no bed that he can bear to lie onoftenest rolls about in a bathchair very heavyladen indeed and i think of tenderer humor than in former sicknesses to the old dessauer he writes few days after getting home to potsdam i am ready to quit the world as your dilection knows and has various times heard me say one ship sails faster another slower but they come all to one haven let it be with me then as the most high has determined for me orlich geschichte der schlesischen kriege berlin 1841 i 14 from the dessau archives date 21st september 1734 he has settled his affairs fassmann says so far as possible settled the order of his funeral how he is to be buried in the garrison church of potsdam without pomp or fuss like a prussian soldier and what regiment or regiments it is that are to do the triple volley over him by way of finis and long farewell his souls interests toowe need not doubt he is in deep conference in deep consideration about these though nothing is said on that point a serious man always much feeling what immense facts he was surrounded with and here is now the summing up of all facts occasionally again he has hopes orders up two hundred of his potsdam giants to march through the sickroom since he cannot get out to them or old generals buddenbrock waldau come and take their pipe there in reminiscence of a tabagie here direct from the fountainhead or nigger lackey bribed by seckendorf junior is a notice or two  potsdam september 30th 1734 yesterday for half an hour the

the rest so that it was feared apoplexy would take him  this will suffice for the physiological part let us now hear our poor friend on the crownprince and his arrival  october 12th return of the princeroyal to potsdam tender receptionoctober 21st things look ill in potsdam the other leg is now also begun running and above a quart maas of water has come from it without a miracle the king

to contrive a commodious bed for the king wouldnt go away from potsdam king forced him away he is to return saturday afternoon the princeroyal has been heard to say if the king will let me live in my own way i would give an arm to lengthen his life for twenty years king always calls him fritzchen but fritzchen thinks seckendorf junior knows nothing about business the king is aware of it and said in the face of him one day if thou begin at the wrong end with things and all go topsyturvy after i am gone i will laugh at thee out of my grave seckendorf baron journal secret cited in forster ii 142  so friedrich wilhelm laboring amid the mortal quicksands looking into the inevitable in various moods but the memorablest speech he made to fritzchen or to anybody at present was that covert one about the kaiser and seckendorf and the sudden flash of insight he got from some word of seckendorfs into what they had been meaning with him all along riding through the village of priort in debate about vienna politics of a strange nature seckendorf said something which illuminated his majesty dark for so many years and showed him where he was a ghastly horror of a country yawning indisputable there revealed to one as if by momentary lightning in that manner this is a speech which all the ambassadors report and which was already mentioned by usin reference to that opprobrious proposal about the crownprinces marriage marry with england after all never mind breaking your word here is the manner of it with time and place  sunday last sunday 17th october 1734 reports seckendorf junior through the nigger or some better witness the king said to the princeroyal my dear son i tell thee i got my death at priort i entreat thee above all things in the world dont trust those people denen leuten however many promises they make that day it was april 17th 1733 there was a man said something to me it was as if you had turned a dagger round in my heart seckendorf baron journal secret cited in forster ii 142  figure that spoken from amid the dark sick whirlpools the mortal quicksands in friedrich wilhelms voice clangorously plaintive what a wild sincerity almost pathos is in it and whether fritzchen with his eyes all bewept even for what papa had suffered in that matter felt lively gratitudes to the house of austria at this moment  it was four months after 21st january 1735 fassmann p 533 when the king first got back to berlin to enlighten the eyes of the carnival a little as his wont had been the crisis of his majestys illness is over present danger gone and the carnival people not without some real gladness though probably with less than they pretend can report him well again which is far from being the fact if they knew it friedrich wilhelm is on his feet again but he never more was well nor has he forgotten that word at priort like the turning of a dagger in ones heartand indeed gets himself continually reminded of it by practical commentaries from the vienna quarter  in april prince lichtenstein arrives on embassy with three requests or demands from vienna 1 that besides the ten thousand due by treaty his majesty would send his reichs contingent not comprehended in those ten thousand thinks the kaiser 2 that he would have the goodness to dismiss marquis de la chetardie the french ambassador as a plainly superfluous person at a wellaffected german court in present circumstancesperson excessively dangerous should the present majesty die crownprince being so fond of that chetardie 3 that his prussian majesty do give up the false polish majesty stanislaus and no longer harbor him in east preussen or elsewhere the whole of which demands his prussian majesty refuses the latter two especially as something notably high on the kaisers part or on any mortals to a free sovereign and gentleman prince lichtenstein is eloquent conciliatory but it avails not he has to go home emptyhanded manages to leave with herr von suhm who took care of it for us that anecdote of the crownprinces behavior under cannonshot from philipsburg last year and does nothing else recordable in berlin  the crownprinces hopes were set with all eagerness on getting to the rhinecampaign next ensuing nor did the king refuse for a long while but still less did he consent and in the end there came nothing of it from an early period of the year friedrich wilhelm sees too well what kind of campaigning the kaiser will now make at a certain weddingdinner where his majesty wasprecisely a fortnight after his majestys arrival in berlinseckendorf

usually necessary owing to the russianpolish troubles on this errand which is clearly a promotion though in present circumstances not a welcome one for the crownprince he sets out without delay and passes there the equinoctial and autumnal season in a much more useful way than he could have done in the rhinecampaign  in the rhinemoselle country and elsewhere the poor kaiser does exert himself to make a campaign of it but without the least success having not a groschen of money how could he succeed noailles as foreseen manoeuvres him hitch after hitch out of italy french are greatly superior more especially when montemar having once got carlos crowned in naples and put secure comes to assist the french kaiser has to lean for shelter on the tyrol alps as predicted italy all but some

hideously waste one sees nothing but women and a few children it is said the people are mostly running awayowing to the russianpolish procedures there in consequence of the blessed election they have had king august whom your majesty is not in love with has prevailed at this rate of expense king stanislaus protected by your majesty in spite of kaisers and czarinas waits in konigsberg till the peace now supposed to be coming say what is to become of him once in konigsberg i shall have the pleasure to see him a detachment of fiveandtwenty saxon dragoons of the regiment arnstedt marching towards dantzig met me their horses were in tolerable case but some are piebald some sorrel and some brown among them which will be shocking to your majesty and the people did not look well  got hither to marienwerder last night have inspected the two companies which are here that is to say lieutenantcol meiers and rittmeister hauss in very good trim both of them and though neither the men nor their horses are of extraordinary size they are handsome welldrilled fellows and a fine set of stiffbuilt horses gedrungenen pferden the fellows sit them like pictures reiten wie die puppen i saw them do their wheelings meier has some fine recruits in particular twonor has the rittmeister been wanting in that respect young horses too are coming well on sleek of skin in short all is right on the military side oeuvres de frederic xxvii part 3d p 97  civil business too of all kinds the crownprince looked into with a sharp intelligent eyegave praise gave censure in the right place put various things on a straight footing which were awry when he found them in fact it is papas second self looks into the bottom of all things quite as papa would have done and is fatal to mendacities practical or vocal wherever he meets them what a joy to papa here after all is one that can replace me in case of accident this apprentice of mine after all he has fairly learned the art and will continue it when i am gone  yes your majesty it is a princeroyal wise to recognize your majestys rough wisdom on all manner of points will not be a devilsfriend i think any more than your majesty was here truly are rare talents like your majesty and unlikeand has a steady swiftness in him as of an eagle over and above such powers of practical judgment of skilful action are rare in ones twentythird year and still rarer have readers noted what a power of holding his peace this young man has fruit of his sufferings of the hard life he has had most important power under which all other useful ones will more and more ripen for him this prince already knows his own mind on a good many points privately amid the worlds vague clamor jargoning round him to no purpose he is capable of having his mind made up into definite yes and noso as will surprise us one day  friedrich wilhelm we perceive his letter 24th october 1735 ib p 99 was in a high degree content with this performance of the prussian mission a very great comfort to his sick mind in those months and afterwards here are talents here are qualitiesvisibly the friedrichwilhelm stuff throughout but cast in an infinitely improved typewhat a blessing we did not cut off that young head at the kaisers dictation in former years  at konigsberg as we learn in a dim indirect manner the crownprince sees king stanislaus twice or thricenot formally lest there be political offence taken but incidentally at the houses of thirdpartiesand is much pleased with the old gentleman who is of cultivated goodnatured ways and has surely many curious things from charles xii downwards to tell a young man came 8th october went 21st oeuvres de frederic xxvii part 3d p 98 stanislaus has abundance of useless refugee polish magnates about him with their useless crowds of servants and no money in pocket konigsberg all on flutter with their draperies and them like a little warsaw so that stanislauss big french pension moderate prussian monthly allowance and all resources are inadequate and in fact in the end these magnates had to vanish many of them without settling their accounts in konigsberg history of stanislaus  for the present they wait here stanislaus and they till fleury and the kaiser shaking the urn of doom in abstruse treaty after battle decide what is to become of them  friedrich returned to dantzig saw that famous city and late scene of war tracing with lively interest the footsteps of munnich and his siege operationssome of which are much blamed by judges and by this young soldier among the rest there is a pretty letter of his from dantzig turning mainly on those points letter written to his young brotherinlaw karl of brunswick who is now become duke there grandfather and father both dead grandfather 1st march 1735 father who lost the lines of ettlingen lately in our sight 3d september 1735 supra vol vi p 372 and has just been blessed with an heir to boot congratulation on the birth of this heir is the formal purport of the letter though it runs ever and anon into a military strain here are some sentences in a condensed form  dantzig 26th october 1735 thank my dear sister for her services i am charmed that she has made you papa with so good a grace i fear you wont stop there but will go on peopling the worldone knows not to what extentwith your amiable race would have written sooner but i am just returning from the depths of the barbarous countries and having been charged with innumerable commissions which i did not understand too well had no good possibility to think or to write  i have viewed all the russian labors in these parts have had the assault on the hagelsberg narrated to me been on the groundsand own i had a better opinion of marshal munnich than to think him capable of so distracted an enterprise oeuvres de frederic xxvii part 2d p 31 pressed for time and in want of batteringcannon he attempted to seize this hagelsberg one of the outlying defences of dantzig by nocturnal storm lost two thousand men and retired without doing what was flatly impossible thinks the crownprince see mannstein pp 7779 for an account of it adieu my dear brother my compliments to the amiable young mother tell her i beg you that her proofessays are masterpieces coups dessai sont des coups de maitre  your most c  frederic  the brunswick masterpiece achieved on this occasion grew to be a man and duke famous enough in the newspapers in time coming champagne 1792 jena 1806 george ivs queen caroline these and other distracted phenomena pretty much blotting out the earlier better sort still keep him hanging painfully in mens memory from his birth now in this prussian journey of our crownprince to his deathstroke on the field of jena what a seventyone years  fleury and the kaiser though it is long before the signature and last finish can take place are come to terms of settlement at the crownprinces return and it is known in political circles what the kaisers polishelection damages will probably amount to here are in substance the only conditions that could be got for him  1 baby carlos crowned in naples cannot be pulled out again naples the two sicilies are gone without return that is the first loss please heaven it be the worst on the other hand baby carlos will as some faint compensation surrender to your imperial majesty his parma and piacenza apanages and you shall get back your lombardyall but a scantling which we fling to the sardinian majesty who is a good deal huffed having had possession of the milanese these two years past in terms of his bargain with fleury pacific fleury says to him bargain cannot be kept your majesty please to quit the milanese again and put up with this scantling  2 the crown of poland august iii has got it by russian bombardings and other measures crown shall stay with augustall the rather as there would be no dispossessing him at this stage he was your imperial majestys candidate let him be the winner there for your imperial majestys comfort  3 and then as to poor stanislaus well let stanislaus be titular majesty of poland for lifewhich indeed will do little for himbut in addition we propose that the dukedom of lorraine being now in our hands majesty stanislaus have the liferent of lorraine to subsist upon andand that lorraine fall to us of france on his deceaselorraine exclaim the kaiser and the reich and the kaisers intended soninlaw franz duke of lorraine there is indeed a loss and a disgrace a heavy item in the election damages  4 as to duke franz there is a remedy the old duke of florence last of the medici is about to die childless let the now duke of lorraine your imperial majestys intended soninlaw have florence insteadand so it had to be settled lorraine to stanislaus to france exclaimed the poor kaiser still more the poor reich and poor duke franz this was the bitterest cut of all but there was no getting past it this too had to be allowed this item for the election breakages in poland and so france after nibbling for several centuries swallows lorraine whole duke franz attempted to stand out remonstrated much with kaiser and hofrath at vienna on this unheardof proposal but they told him it was irremediable told him at last one bartenstein a famed aulic official told him no lorraine no archduchess your serenityand franz had to comply lorraine is gone cunning fleury has swallowed it whole that was what he meant in picking this quarrel said teutschland mournfully fleury was very pacific candid in aspect to the seapowers and others and did not crow afflictively did not say what he had meant  5 one immense consolation for the kaiser if for no other is france guarantees the pragmatic sanctionthough with very great difficulty spending a couple of years chiefly on this latter point as was thought treaty on it not signed till 18th november 1738 scholl ii 246 how it kept said guarantee will be seen in the sequel  and these were the damages the poor kaiser had to pay for meddling in polish electionsfor galloping thither in chase of his shadows no such account of broken windows was ever presented to a man before this may be considered as the consummation of the kaisers shadowhunt or at least its igniting and exploding point his duel with the termagant has at last ended in total defeat to him on every point shadowhunt does not end though it is now mostly vanished exploded in fire shadowhunt is now gone all to pragmatic sanction as it were that now is the one thing left in nature for a kaiser and that he will love and chase as the summary of all things from this point he steadily goes down and at a rapid rategetting into disastrous turk wars with as little preparation for war or fact as a lifelong hunt of shadows presupposes eugene gone from him and nothing but seckendorfs to manage for himand sinks to a low pitch indeed we will leave him here shall hope to see but little more of him  in the summer of 1736 in consequence of these arrangementswhich were completed so far though difficulties on pragmatic sanction and other points retarded the final signature for many months longerthe titular majesty stanislaus girt himself together for departure towards his new dominion or liferent quitted konigsberg traversed prussian poland safe this time under escort of lieutenantgeneral von katte our poor katte of custrins father and fifty cuirassiers reached berlin in the middle of may under flowerier aspects than usual he travelled under the title of count something and alighted at the french ambassadors in berlin but friedrich wilhelm treated him like a real majesty almost like a real brother had him over to the palace rushed out to meet him there i forget how many steps beyond the proper limits and was hospitality itself and munificence itselfand in fact that night and all the other nights they smoked above thirty pipes together for one item may 21st 1736 forster i 227 following loose pollnitz ii 478 dates it 1735 a more considerable error if looked into than is usual in herr forster who is not an illinformed nor inexact manthough alas in respect of method that is to say want of visible method indication or human arrangement probably the most confused of all the germans exmajesty stanislaus went on his way again towards francetowards meudon a quiet royal house in francetill luneville nanci and their lorraine palaces are quite ready there in these latter he at length does find restingplace poor innocent insipid mortal after such tossings to and fro and m de voltaire and others of mark having sometimes enlivened the insipid court there titular king stanislaus has still a kind of remembrance among mankind  of his prussian majesty we said that though the berlin populations reported him well again it was not so the truth is his majesty was never well again from this point age only fortyseven he continues broken in bodily constitution clogged more and more with physical impediments and his history personal and political withal is as that of an old man finishing his day to the last he pulls steadily neglecting no business suffering nothing to go wrong building operations go on at berlin pushed more than ever in these years by the rigorous derschau who has got that in charge no man of money or rank in berlin but derschau is upon him with heavier and heavier compulsion to build which is felt to be tyrannous and occasions an everdeepening grumble among the moneyed classes at potsdam his majesty himself is the builder and gives the houses away to persons of merit pollnitz ii 469  nor is the army less an object perhaps almost more nay at one time old kurpfalz being reckoned in a dying condition friedrich wilhelm is about ranking his men prepared to fight for his rights in julich and berg kaiser having openly gone over and joined with france against his majesty in that matter however the old kurpfalz did not die and there came nothing of fight in friedrich wilhelms time but his history on the political side is henceforth mainly a commentary to him on that word he heard in priort which was as if you had turned a dagger in my heart with the kaiser he has fallen out there arise unfriendly passages between them sometimes sarcastic on friedrich wilhelms part in reference to this very war now ended thus when complaint rose about the prussian misbehaviors on their late marches misbehaviors notable in countries where their recruiting operations had been troubled the kaiser took a high severe tone not assuaging rather aggravating the matter and for his own share winded up by a strict prohibition of prussian recruiting in any and every part of the imperial dominions which friedrich wilhelm took extremely ill this is from a letter of his to the crownprince and after the first gust of wrath had spent itself it is a clear disadvantage this prohibition of recruiting in the kaisers countries that is our thanks for the ten thousand men sent him and for all the deference i have shown the kaiser at all times and by this you may see that it would be of no use if one even sacrificed oneself to him so long as they need us they continue to flatter but no sooner is the strait thought to be over and help not wanted than they pull off the mask and have not the least acknowledgment the considerations that will occur to you on this matter may put it in your power to be prepared against similar occasions in time coming 6th february 1736 oeuvres de frederic xxvii part 3d p 102  thus again in regard to the winterquarters of the ziethen hussars prussian majesty we recollect had sent a supernumerary squadron to the last campaign on the rhine they were learning their business friedrich wilhelm knew but also were fighting for the kaiserthat was what the kaiser knew about them somewhat to his surprise in the course of next year friedrich wilhelm received from the vienna waroffice a little bill of 10284 florins 1028 pounds 8 shillings charged to him for the winterquarters of these hussars he at once paid the little bill with only this observation heartily glad that i can help the imperial aerarium with that 1028 pounds 8 shillings with the sincerest wishes for hundredthousandfold increase to it in said aerarium otherwise it wont go very far letter to seckendorf senior forster ii 150  at a later period in the course of his disastrous turk war the kaiser famishing for money set about borrowing a million gulden 100000 pounds from the banking house splittgerber and daun at berlin splittgerber and daun had not the money could not raise it advance us that sum in their name your majesty proposes the vienna court there shall be threepercent bonus interest six per cent and security beyond all question to which fine offer his majesty answers addressing seckendorf junior touching the proposal of my giving the bankers splittgerber and daun a lift with a million gulden to assist in that loan of theirssaid proposal as i am not a merchant accustomed to deal in profits and percentages cannot in that form take effect out of old friendship however i am on their imperial majestys request extremely ready to pay down once and away a fond perdu a couple of million gulden provided the imperial majesty will grant me the conditions known to your uncle fulfilment of that now oldish julichandberg promise namely which are fair in such case the thing shall be rapidly completed forster ii 151 without date there  in a word friedrich wilhelm falls out with the kaiser more and more experiences more and more what a kaiser this has been towards him queen sophie has fallen silent in the history books both the majesties may look remorsefully but perhaps best in silence over the breakages and wrecks this kaiser has brought upon them friedrich wilhelm does not meanly hate the kaiser good man he sometimes pities him sometimes we perceive has a touch of authentic contempt for him but his thoughts in that quarter premature old age aggravating them are generally of a tragic nature not to be spoken without tears and the tears have a flash at the bottom of them when he looks round on fritz and says there is one though that will avenge me friedrich wilhelm to the last a broad strong phenomenon keeps wending downward homeward from this point the kaiser too we perceive is rapidly consummating his enormous spectrehunts and duels with termagants and before long will be at rest we have wellnigh done with both these majesties  the crownprince by his judicious obedient procedures in these four years at ruppin at a distance from papa has as it were completed his apprenticeship and especially by this last inspectionjourney into preussen may be said to have delivered his proofessay with a distinguished success he is now out of his apprenticeship entitled to take up his indentures whenever need shall be the rugged old master cannot but declare him competent qualified to try his own hand without supervisionafter all those unheardof confusions like to set the shop on fire at one time it is a blessedly successful apprenticeship let him now theoretically at least in the realms of art literature spiritual improvement do his wanderjahre over at reinsberg still in the old regionstill well apart from papa who agrees best not in immediate contactand be happy in the new domesticities and larger opportunities provided for him there till a certain time come which none of us are in haste for
