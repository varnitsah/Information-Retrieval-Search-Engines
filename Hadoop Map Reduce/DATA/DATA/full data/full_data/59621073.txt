reddy fox whos afraid of that fellow  then he braced himself and pulled with all his might  reddy wouldnt have believed that it was alive  drop him he grunted  i see you are up to your old tricks prickly porky he shouted     the adventures of prickly porky     i  happy jack squirrel makes a find   happy jack squirrel had had a wonderful day he had found some big chestnuttrees that he had never seen before and which promised to give him all the nuts he would want for all the next winter now he was thinking of going home for it was getting late in the afternoon he looked out across the open field where mr goshawk had nearly caught him that morning his home was on the other side  its a long way round said happy jack to himself but it is best to be safe and sure  so happy jack started on his long journey around the open field now happy jacks eyes are bright and there is very little that happy jack does not see so as he was jumping from one tree to another he spied something down on the ground which excited his curiosity  i must stop and see what that is said happy jack so down the tree he ran and in a few minutes he had found the queer thing which had caught his eyes it was smooth and black and white and at one end it was very sharp with a tiny little barb happy jack found it out by pricking himself with it  ooch he cried and dropped the queer thing pretty soon he noticed there were a lot more on the ground  i wonder what they are said happy jack they dont grow for they havent any roots they are not thorns for there is no plant from which they could come they are not alive so what can they be  now happy jacks eyes are bright but sometimes he doesnt use them to the very best advantage he was so busy examining the queer things on the ground that he never once thought to look up in the tops of the trees if he had perhaps he would not have been so much puzzled as it was he just gathered up three or four of the queer things and started on again on the way he met peter rabbit and showed peter what he had now you know peter rabbit is very curious he just couldnt sit still but must scamper over to the place happy jack squirrel told him about  youd better be careful peter rabbit theyre very sharp shouted happy jack  but as usual peter was in too much of a hurry to heed what was said to him lippertylippertylip lippertylippertylip went peter rabbit through the woods as fast as his long legs would take him then suddenly he squealed and sat down to nurse one of his feet but he was up again in a flash with another squeal louder than before peter rabbit had found the queer things that happy jack squirrel had told him about one was sticking in his foot and one was in the white patch on the seat of his trousers     ii  the stranger from the north   the merry little breezes of old mother west wind were excited yes sir they certainly were excited they had met happy jack squirrel and peter rabbit and they were full of the news of the queer things that happy jack and peter rabbit had found over in the green forest they hurried this way and that way over the green meadows and told every one they met finally they reached the smiling pool and excitedly told grandfather frog all about it  grandfather frog smoothed down his white and yellow waistcoat and looked very wise for you know that grandfather frog is very old  pooh said grandfather frog i know what they are  what cried all the merry little breezes together happy jack says he is sure they do not grow for there are no strange plants over there  grandfather frog opened his big mouth and snapped up a foolish green fly that one of the merry little breezes blew over to him  chugarum said grandfather frog things do not have to be on plants in order to grow now i am sure that those things grew and that they did not grow on a plant  the merry little breezes looked puzzled what is there that grows and doesnt grow on a plant asked one of them  how about the claws on peter rabbits toes and the hair of happy jacks tail asked grandfather frog  the merry little breezes looked foolish of course they cried we didnt think of that but we are quite sure that these queer things that prick so are not claws and certainly they are not hair  dont you be too sure said grandfather frog you go over to the green forest and look up in the treetops instead of down on the ground then come back and tell me what you find  away raced the merry little breezes to the green forest and began to search among the treetops presently way up in the top of a big poplar they found a stranger he was bigger than any of the little meadow people and he had long sharp teeth with which he was stripping the bark from the tree the hair of his coat was long and out of it peeped a thousand little spears just like the queer things that happy jack and peter rabbit had told them about  good morning said the merry little breezes politely  mornin grunted the stranger in the treetop  may we ask where you come from said one of the merry little breezes politely  i come from the north woods said the stranger and then went on about his business which seemed to be to strip every bit of the bark from the tree and eat it     iii  prickly porky makes friends   the merry little breezes soon spread the news over the green meadows and through the green forest that a stranger had come from the north at once all the little meadow people and forest folk made some excuse to go over to the big poplar tree where the stranger was so busy eating at first he was very shy and had nothing to say he was a queer fellow and he was so big and his teeth were so sharp and so long that his visitors kept their distance  reddy fox who you know is a great boaster and likes to brag of how smart he is and how brave he is came with the rest of the little meadow people  pooh exclaimed reddy fox whos afraid of that fellow  just then the stranger began to come down the tree reddy backed away  it looks as if you were afraid reddy fox said peter rabbit  im not afraid of anything said reddy fox and swelled himself up to look twice as big as he really is  it seems to me i hear bowser the hound piped up striped chipmunk  illustration pooh exclaimed reddy fox whos afraid of that fellow page 10  now striped chipmunk had not heard bowser the hound at all when he spoke but just then there was the patter of heavy feet among the dried leaves and sure enough there was bowser himself my how everybody did runeverybody but the stranger from the north he kept on coming down the tree just the same bowser saw him and stopped in surprise he had never seen anything quite like this big dark fellow  bow wow wow shouted bowser in his deepest voice  now when bowser used that great deep voice of his he was accustomed to seeing all the little meadow people and forest folk run but this stranger did not even hurry bowser was so surprised that he just stood still and stared then he growled his deepest growl still the stranger paid no attention to him bowser did not know what to make of it  ill teach that fellow a lesson said bowser to himself ill shake him and shake him and shake him until he hasnt any breath left  by this time the stranger was down on the ground and starting for another tree minding his own business then something happened bowser made a rush at him and instead of running what do you suppose the stranger did he just rolled himself up in a tight ball with his head tucked down in his waistcoat when he was rolled up that way all the little spears hidden in the hair of his coat stood right out until he looked like a great chestnutburr bowser stopped short then he reached out his nose and sniffed at this queer thing slap the tail of the stranger struck bowser the hound right across the side of his face and a dozen of those little spears were left sticking there just like pins in a pincushion  wow wow wow wow yelled bowser at the top of his lungs and started for home with his tail between his legs and yelling with every jump then the stranger unrolled himself and smiled and all the little meadow people and forest folk who had been watching shouted aloud for joy  and this is the way that prickly porky the porcupine made friends     iv  peter rabbit has some startling news   little mrs peter rabbit who used to be little miss fuzzytail sat at the edge of the dear old briarpatch anxiously looking over towards the green forest she was worried there was no doubt about it little mrs peter was very much worried why didnt peter come home she did wish that he would be content to stay close by the dear old briarpatch for her part she couldnt see why under the sun he wanted to go way over to the green forest he was always having dreadful adventures and narrow escapes over there and yet in spite of all she could say he would persist in going there she didnt feel easy in her mind one minute while he was out of her sight to be sure he always turned up all right but she couldnt help feeling that sometime his dreadful curiosity would get him into trouble that he couldnt get out of and so every time he went to the green forest she was sure absolutely sure that she would never see him again  peter used to laugh at her and tell her that she was a foolish little dear and that he was perfectly able to take care of himself then when he saw how worried she was he would promise to be very very careful and never do anything rash or foolish but he wouldnt promise not to go to the green forest no sir peter wouldnt promise that you see he has so many friends over there and there is always so much news to be gathered that he just couldnt keep away once or twice he had induced mrs peter to go with him but she had been frightened almost out of her skin every minute for it seemed to her that there was danger lurking behind every tree and under every bush it was all very well for chatterer the red squirrel and happy jack the gray squirrel who could jump from tree to tree but she didnt think it a safe and proper place for a sensible rabbit and she said so  this particular morning she was unusually anxious peter had been gone all night usually he was home by the time old mother west wind came down from the purple hills and emptied her children the merry little breezes out of her big bag to play all day on the green meadows but this morning old mother west wind had been a long time gone about her business and still there was no sign of peter  something has happened i just know something has happened she wailed      oh peter peter peter rabbit       why will you be so heedless     why will you take such dreadful risks       so foolish and so needless  dont worry peter is smart enough to take care of himself cried one of the merry little breezes who happened along just in time to overhear her hell be home pretty soon in fact i think i see him coming now  mrs peter looked in the direction that the merry little breeze was looking and sure enough there was peter he was heading straight for the dear old briarpatch and he was running as if he were trying to show how fast he could run mrs peters heart gave a frightened thump it must be that reddy or granny fox or old man coyote is right at his heels thought she but look as hard as she would she could see nothing to make peter run so  in a few minutes he reached her side his eyes were very wide and it was plain to see that he was bursting with important news  what is it peter do tell me quick have you had another narrow escape gasped little mrs peter  peter nodded while he panted for breath theres another stranger in the green forest a terrible looking fellow without legs or head or tail and he almost caught me panted peter     v  peter rabbit tells his story   when peter rabbit could get his breath after his long hard run from the green forest to the dear old briarpatch he had a wonderful story to tell it was all about a stranger in the green forest and to have heard peter tell about it you would have thought as mrs peter did that it was a very terrible stranger for it had no legs and it had no head and it had no tail at least that is what peter said  you see it was this way declared peter i had stopped longer than i meant to in the green forest for you know my dear i always try to be home by the time jolly round red mr sun gets out of bed and old mother west wind gets down on the green meadows mrs peter nodded but somehow time slipped away faster than i thought for or else mr sun got up earlier than usual continued peter then he stopped that last idea was a new one and it struck peter as a good one i do believe that that is just what happenedmr sun must have made a mistake and crawled out of bed earlier than usual he cried  mrs peter looked as if she very much doubted it but she didnt say anything and so peter went on with his story  i had just realized how light it was and had started for home hurrying with all my might when i heard a little noise at the top of the hill where prickly porky the porcupine lives of course i thought it was prickly himself starting out for his breakfast and i looked up with my mouth open to say hello but i didnt say hello no sir i didnt say a word i was too scared there just starting down the hill straight towards me was the most dreadful creature that ever has been seen in the green forest it didnt have any legs and it didnt have any head and it didnt have any tail and it was coming straight after me so fast that i had all i could do to get out of the way peters eyes grew very round and wide as he said this i took one good look and then i jumped my gracious how i did jump he continued then i started for home just as fast as ever i could make my legs go and here i am and mighty glad to be here  mrs peter had listened with her mouth wide open when peter finished she closed it with a snap and hopped over and felt of his head  are you sick peter she asked anxiously  peter stared at her sick me sick not a bit of it he exclaimed never felt better in my life save that i am a little tired from my long run what a silly question do i look sick  noo replied little mrs peter slowly noo you dont look sick but you talk as if there were something the matter with your head i think you must be just a little lightheaded peter or else you have taken a nap somewhere and had a bad dream did i understand you to say that this dreadful creature has no legs and yet that it chased you  thats what i said snapped peter a wee bit crossly for he saw that mrs peter didnt believe a word of his story  will you please tell me how any creature in the green forest or out of it for that matter can possibly chase any one unless it has legs or wings and you didnt say anything about its having wings demanded mrs peter  peter scratched his head in great perplexity suddenly he had a happy thought mr blacksnake runs fast enough but he doesnt have legs does he he asked in triumph  little mrs peter looked a bit discomfited noo she admitted slowly he doesnt have legs but i never could understand how he runs without them  well then snapped peter if he can run without legs why cant other creatures besides this one didnt run exactly it rolled now ive told you all im going to i need a long nap after all ive been through so dont let any one disturb me  i wont replied mrs peter meekly but peter if i were you i wouldnt tell that story to any one else     vi  peter has to tell his story many times      once you start a story you cannot call it back     it travels on and on and on and ever on alack   that is the reason why you should always be sure that a story you repeat is a good story then you will be glad to have it travel on and on and on and will never want to call it back but if you tell a story that isnt true or nice the time is almost sure to come when you will want to call it back and cannot you see stories are just like riversthey run on and on forever little mrs peter rabbit knew this and that is why she advised peter not to tell any one else the strange story he had told her of the dreadful creature without legs or head or tail that had chased him in the green forest peter knew by that that she didnt believe a word of it but he was too tired and sleepy to argue with her then so he settled himself comfortably for a nice long nap  when peter awoke the first thing he thought of was the terrible creature he had seen in the green forest the more he thought about it the more impossible it seemed and he didnt wonder that mrs peter had advised him not to repeat it  i wont said peter to himself i wont repeat it to a soul no one will believe it the truth is i can hardly believe it myself ill just keep my tongue still  but unfortunately for peter one of the merry little breezes of old mother west wind had heard peter tell the story to mrs peter and it was such a wonderful and curious and unbelievable story that the merry little breeze straightway repeated it to everybody he met and soon peter rabbit began to receive callers who wanted to hear the story all over again from peter himself so peter was obliged to repeat it ever so many times and every time it sounded to him more foolish than before he had to tell it to jimmy skunk and to johnny chuck and to danny meadow mouse and to digger the badger and to sammy jay and to blacky the crow and to striped chipmunk and to happy jack squirrel and to bobby coon and to unc billy possum and to old mr toad  now strange to say no one laughed at peter queer as the story sounded you see they all remembered how they had laughed at him and made fun of him when he told about the great footprints he had found deep in the green forest and how later it had been proven that he really did see them for they were made by buster bear who had come down from the great woods to live in the green forest then it had been peters turn to laugh at them so now impossible as this new story sounded they didnt dare laugh at it  i never heard of such a creature said jimmy skunk and i cant quite believe that there is such a one but it is very clear to me that peter has seen something strange you know the old saying that he laughs best who laughs last and im not going to give peter another chance to have the last laugh and say i told you so  that is very true replied old mr toad solemnly probably peter has seen something out of the ordinary and in his excitement he has exaggerated it the thing to do is to make sure whether or not there is a stranger in the green forest peter says that it came down the hill where prickly porky the porcupine lives some one ought to go ask him what he knows about it if there is such a terrible creature up there he ought to have seen it why dont you go up there and ask him jimmy skunk youre not afraid of anybody or anything  i will replied jimmy promptly and off he started you see he felt very much flattered by old mr toads remark and he couldnt very well refuse for that would look as if he were afraid after all     vii  jimmy skunk calls on prickly porky   a plague upon old mr toad grumbled jimmy as he ambled up the lone little path through the green forest on his way to the hill where prickly porky lives of course im not afraid but just the same i dont like meddling with things i dont know anything about im not afraid of anybody i know of because everybody has the greatest respect for me but it might be different with a creature without legs or head or tail whoever heard of such a thing it gives me a queer feeling inside  however he kept right on and as he reached the foot of the hill where prickly porky lives he looked sharply in every direction and listened with all his might for strange sounds but there was nothing unusual to be seen the green forest looked just as it always did it was very still and quiet there save for the cheerful voice of redeye the vireo telling over and over how happy he was  that doesnt sound as if there were any terrible stranger around here muttered jimmy  then he heard a queer grunting sound a very queer sound that seemed to come from somewhere on the top of the hill jimmy grinned as he listened thats prickly porky telling himself how good his dinner tastes laughed jimmy funny how some people do like to hear their own voices  the contented sound of prickly porkys voice made jimmy feel very sure that there could be nothing very terrible about just then anyway and so he slowly ambled up the hill for you know he never hurries it was an easy matter to find the tree in which prickly porky was at work stripping off bark and eating it because he made so much noise  hello said jimmy skunk  prickly porky took no notice he was so busy eating and making so much noise about it that he didnt hear jimmy at all  hello shouted jimmy a little louder hello there are you deaf of course this wasnt polite at all but jimmy was feeling a little out of sorts because he had had to make this call this time prickly porky looked down  hello yourself and see how you like it jimmy skunk he cried come on up and have some of this nice bark with me then prickly porky laughed at his own joke for he knew perfectly well that jimmy couldnt climb and that he wouldnt eat bark if he could  jimmy made a face at him thank you ive just dined come down here where i can talk to you without straining my voice he replied  wait until i get another bite replied prickly porky stripping off a long piece of bark then with this to chew on he came half way down the tree and made himself comfortable on a big limb now what is it youve got on your mind he demanded  at once jimmy told him the queer story peter rabbit had told ive been sent up here to find out if you have seen this legless headless tailess creature have you he concluded  prickly porky slowly shook his head no said he ive been right here all the time and i havent seen any such creature  thats all i want to know replied jimmy peter rabbits got something the matter with his eyes and im going straight back to the old briarpatch to tell him so much obliged with that jimmy started back the way he had come grumbling to himself     viii  prickly porky nearly chokes   hardly was jimmy skunk beyond sight and hearing after having made his call than redeye the vireo whose home is in a tree just at the foot of the hill where prickly porky lives heard a very strange noise he was very busy was redeye telling all who would listen how happy he was and what a beautiful world this is redeye seems to think that this is his special mission in life that he was put in the green forest for this one special purposeto sing all day long even in the hottest weather when other birds forget to sing his little song of gladness and happiness it never seems to enter his head that he is making other people happy just by being happy himself and saying so  at first he hardly noticed the strange noise but when he stopped singing for a bit of a rest he heard it very plainly and it sounded so very queer that he flew up the hill towards the place from which it seemed to come and there his bright eyes soon discovered prickly porky right away he saw that prickly porky was in some kind of trouble and that it was he who was making the queer noise prickly porky was on the ground at the foot of a tree and he was rolling over and kicking and clawing at his mouth from which a little piece of bark was hanging it was such a strange performance that redeye simply stared for a minute then in a flash it came to him what it meant prickly porky was choking and if something wasnt done to help him he might choke to death  now there was nothing that redeye himself could do to help for he was too small he must get help somewhere else and he must do it quickly anxiously he looked this way and that way but there was no one in sight then he remembered that unc billy possums hollow tree was not far away perhaps unc billy could help he hoped that unc billy was at home and he wasted no time in finding out unc billy was at home and when he heard that his old friend prickly porky was in trouble he hurried up the hill as fast as ever he could he saw right away what was the trouble  yo keep still just a minute brer porky he commanded for he did not dare go very near while prickly porky was rolling and kicking around so for fear that he would get against some of the thousand little spears prickly porky carries hidden in his coat prickly porky did as he was told indeed he was so weak from his long struggle that he was glad to unc billy caught hold of the piece of bark hanging from prickly porkys mouth then he braced himself and pulled with all his might for a minute the piece of bark held then it gave way so suddenly that unc billy fell over flat on his back unc billy scrambled to his feet and looked reprovingly at prickly porky who lay panting for breath and with big tears rolling down his face  illustration then he braced himself and pulled with all his might page 30  ah certnly am surprised brer porky ah certnly am surprised that yo should be so greedy that yo choke yoself said unc billy shaking his head  prickly porky grinned weakly and rather foolishly it wasnt greed unc billy it wasnt greed at all he replied  then what was it may ah ask demanded unc billy severely  i thought of something funny right in the middle of my meal and i laughed just as i started to swallow and the piece of bark went down the wrong way explained prickly porky and then as if the mere thought of the thing that had made him laugh before was too much for him he began to laugh again he laughed and laughed and laughed until finally unc billy quite lost patience  yo certnly have lost your manners brer porky he snapped  prickly porky wiped the tears from his eyes come closer so that i can whisper unc billy said he  a little bit suspiciously unc billy came near enough for prickly porky to whisper and when he had finished unc billy was wiping tears of laughter from his own eyes     ix  jimmy skunk and unc billy possum tell different stories   the little people of the green meadows and the green forest didnt know what to believe first came peter rabbit with the strangest kind of a story about being chased by a terrible creature without legs head or tail he said that it had come down the hill where prickly porky the porcupine lives in the green forest jimmy skunk had been sent to call on prickly porky and ask him if he had seen any strange creature such as peter rabbit had told about prickly porky had said that he hadnt seen any stranger in that part of the green forest and jimmy had straightway returned to the green meadows and told all his friends there that peter rabbit must have had something the matter with his eyes or else was crazy for prickly porky hadnt been away from home and yet had seen nothing unusual  at the same time unc billy possum was going about in the green forest telling everybody whom he met that he had called on prickly porky and that prickly porky had told him that peter rabbit undoubtedly had seen something strange of course jimmy skunks story soon spread through the green forest and unc billy possums story soon spread over the green meadows and so nobody knew what to believe or think if jimmy skunk was right why peter rabbits queer story wasnt to be believed at all if unc billy was right why peters story wasnt as crazy as it sounded  of course all this aroused a great deal of talk and curiosity and those who had the most courage began to make visits to the hill where prickly porky lives to see if they could see for themselves anything out of the ordinary but they always found that part of the green forest just as usual and always if they saw prickly porky at all he seemed to be fast asleep and no one liked to wake him to ask questions little by little they began to think that jimmy skunk was right and that peter rabbits terrible creature existed only in peters imagination  about this time unc billy told of having just such an experience as peter had it happened exactly as it did with peter very early in the morning when he was passing the foot of the hill where prickly porky lives  ah was just passing along minding mah own business when ah heard a noise up on the hill behind me said unc billy and when ah looked up there was something coming straight down at me and ah couldnt see any legs or head or tail  what did you do unc billy asked bobby coon  what did ah do ah did just what yoalls would have doneah done run replied unc billy looking around the little circle of forest and meadow people listening with round eyes and open mouths yes sah ah done run and ah didnt turn around until ah was safe in mah holler tree  pooh sneered reddy fox who had been listening youre a coward i wouldnt have run i would have waited and found out what it was you and peter rabbit would run away from your own shadows  you dont dare go there yourself at daybreak tomorrow retorted unc billy  i do too declared reddy angrily though he didnt have the least intention of going  all right ahm going to be in a tree where ah can watch tomorrow moning and see if yo are as brave as yo talk declared unc billy  then reddy knew that he would have to go or else be called a coward ill be there he snarled angrily as he slunk away     x  unc billy possum tells jimmy skunk a secret      be sure before you drop a friend     that youve done nothing to offend   a friend is always worth keeping unc billy possum says so and he knows he ought to for he has made a lot of them in the green forest and on the green meadows in spite of the pranks he has cut up and the tricks he has played and when unc billy makes a friend he keeps him he says that it is easier and a lot better to keep a friend than to make a new one and this is the way he goes about it whenever he finds that a friend is angry with him he refuses to be angry himself instead he goes to that friend finds out what the trouble is explains it all away and then does something nice  jimmy skunk and unc billy had been friends from the time that unc billy came up from ol virginny to live in the green forest in fact they had been partners in stealing eggs from the henhouse of farmer browns boy so when jimmy skunk who had made a special call on prickly porky to find out if he had seen the strange creature without head tail or legs told everybody that prickly porky had seen nothing of such a creature he was very much put out and quite offended to hear that unc billy was telling how prickly porky had said that peter might really have some reason for his queer story it seemed to him that either prickly porky had told an untruth or that unc billy was telling an untruth it made him very angry  the afternoon of the day when unc billy had dared reddy fox to go at sunup the next morning to the hill where prickly porky lives he met jimmy skunk coming down the crooked little path jimmy scowled and was going to pass without so much as speaking unc billys shrewd little eyes twinkled and he grinned as only unc billy can grin howdy brer skunk said he  jimmy just frowned harder than ever and tried to pass  howdy brer skunk repeated unc billy possum yo must have something on your mind  jimmy skunk stopped i have he snapped i want to know whether it is you or prickly porky who has been telling an untruth he told me that he hadnt seen anything like what peter rabbit said chased him and youve been telling around how he told you that peter may have had good grounds for that foolish story if peter saw that thing prickly porky would know it for he hasnt been away from home this summer why would he tell me that he hasnt seen it if he has  don be hasty brer skunk don be hasty replied unc billy soothingly ah havent said that brer porky told me that he had seen the thing that peter says chased him he told the truth when he told you that he hadnt seen any stranger around his hill what he told me was that here unc billy whispered  jimmy skunks face cleared thats different said he  of course it is replied unc billy yo see peter did see something strange even if brer porky didnt ah have seen it mahself and now ah invites yo to be over at the foot of brer porkys hill at sunup tomorrow moning and see what happens when brer fox tries to show how brave he is only don forget that its a secret  jimmy was chuckling by this time i wont forget and ill be there he promised im glad to know that nobody has been telling untruths and i beg your pardon unc billy for thinking you might have been  don mention it brer skunk don mention it ahll be looking fo yo tomorrow moning replied unc billy with a sly wink that made jimmy laugh aloud     xi  what happened to reddy fox   reddy fox wished with all his might that he had kept his tongue still about not being afraid to meet the strange creature that had given peter rabbit such a fright when he had boasted that he would stop and find out all about it if he happened to meet it he didnt have the least intention of doing anything of the kind he was just idly boasting and nothing more you see reddy is one of the greatest boasters in the green forest or on the green meadows he likes to strut around and talk big but like most boasters he is a coward at heart  unc billy possum knew this and that is why he dared reddy to go the next morning to the foot of the hill where prickly porky the porcupine lives and where peter rabbit had had his strange adventure and where unc billy himself claimed to have seen the same strange creature without head tail or legs which had so frightened peter unc billy had said that he would be there himself up in a tree where he could see whether reddy really did come or not and so there was nothing for reddy to do but to go and make good his foolish boast if the strange creature should appear you see a number of little people had heard him boast and had heard unc billy dare him and he knew that if he didnt make good he would never hear the end of it and would be called a coward by everybody  reddy didnt sleep at all well that afternoon and when at dusk he started to hunt for his supper he found that he had lost his appetite instead of hunting he spent most of the night in trying to think of some good reason for not appearing at prickly porkys hill at daybreak but think as he would he couldnt think of a single excuse that would sound reasonable if only bowser the hound wasnt chained up at night i would get him to chase me and then i would have the very best kind of an excuse thought he but he knew that bowser was chained nevertheless he did go up to farmer browns dooryard to make sure it was just as he expectedbowser was chained  reddy sneaked away without even a look at farmer browns henhouse he didnt see that the door had carelessly been left open and even if he had it would have made no difference he hadnt a bit of appetite no sir reddy fox wouldnt have eaten the fattest chicken there if it had been right before him all he could think of was that queer story told by peter rabbit and unc billy possum and the scrape he had got himself into by his foolish boasting he just wandered about restlessly waiting for daybreak and hoping that something would turn up to prevent him from going to prickly porkys hill he didnt dare to tell old granny fox about it he knew just what she would say it seemed as if he could hear her sharp voice and the very words  serves you right for boasting about something you dont know anything about how many times have i told you that no good comes of boasting a wise fox never goes near strange things until he has found out all about them that is the only way to keep out of trouble and live to a ripe old age wisdom is nothing but knowledge and a wise fox always knows what he is doing  so reddy wandered about all the long night it seemed as if it never would pass and yet he wished it would last forever the more he thought about it the more afraid he grew at last he saw the first beams from jolly round red mr sun creeping through the green forest the time had come and he must choose between making his boast good or being called a coward by everybody very very slowly reddy fox began to walk towards the hill where prickly porky lives     xii  what reddy fox saw and did      who guards his tongue as he would keep       a treasure rich and rare     will keep himself from trouble free       and dodge both fear and care   the trouble with a great many people is that they remember this too late reddy fox is one of these reddy is smart and sly and clever in some ways but he hasnt learned yet to guard his tongue and half the trouble he gets into is because of that unruly member you see it is a boastful tongue and an untruthful tongue and that is the worst combination for making trouble that i know of it has landed him in all kinds of scrapes in the past and here he was in another all on account of that tongue  jolly round red mr sun had kicked his rosy blankets off and was smiling down on the great world as he began his daily climb up in the blue blue sky the jolly little sunbeams were already dancing through the green forest chasing out the black shadows and reddy knew that it was high time for him to be over by the hill where prickly porky the porcupine lives with lagging steps he sneaked along from tree to tree peering out from behind each anxiously afraid to go on and still more afraid not to for fear that he would be called a coward  he had almost reached the foot of the hill without seeing anything out of the usual and without any signs of unc billy possum he was just beginning to hope that unc billy wasnt there as he had said he would be when a voice right over his head said  ah certnly am glad to see that yo are as good as your word brer fox fo we need some one brave like yo to find out what this strange creature is that has been chasing weuns  reddy looked up with a sickly grin there sat unc billy possum in a pine tree right over his head he knew now that there was no backing out he had got to go on he tried to swagger and look very bold and brave  i told you im not afraid if theres anything queer around here ill find out what it is he once more boasted but unc billy noticed that his voice sounded just a wee bit trembly  keep right on to the foot of the hill thats where ah saw it yesterday my ahm glad that weve got some one so truly brave replied unc billy  reddy looked at him sharply but there wasnt a trace of a smile on unc billys face and reddy couldnt tell whether unc billy was making fun of him or not so there being nothing else to do he went on he reached the foot of the hill without seeing or hearing a thing out of the usual the green forest seemed just as it always had seemed redeye the vireo was pouring out his little song of gladness quite as if everything was just as it should be reddys courage began to come back nothing had happened and nothing was going to happen of course not it was all some of peter rabbits foolishness some day he would catch peter rabbit and put an end to such silly tales  ah what was that reddys sharp ears had caught a sound up near the top of the hill he stopped short and looked up for just a little wee minute reddy couldnt believe that his eyes saw right coming down the hill straight towards him was the strangest thing he ever had seen he couldnt see any legs he couldnt see any head he couldnt see any tail it was round like a ball but it was the strangest looking ball that ever was it was covered with old leaves reddy wouldnt have believed that it was alive but for the noises it was making for just a wee minute he stared and then what do you think he did why he gave a frightened yelp put his tail between his legs and ran just as fast as he could make his legs go yes sir thats just what reddy fox did  illustration reddy wouldnt have believed that it was alive page 69     xiii  reddy fox is very miserable   when reddy fox put his tail between his legs and started away from that terrible creature coming down the hill where prickly porky lives he thought of nothing but of getting as far away as he could in the shortest time that he could and so with a little frightened yelp with every jump he ran as he seldom had run before he forgot all about unc billy possum watching from the safety of a big pinetree he didnt see jimmy skunk poking his head out from behind an old stump and laughing fit to kill himself when he reached the edge of the green forest he didnt even see peter rabbit jump out of his path and dodge into a hollow log  when reddy was safely past peter came out he sat up very straight with his ears pointing right up to the sky and his eyes wide open with surprise as he stared after reddy why why my gracious i do believe reddy has had a fright exclaimed peter then being peter he right away began to wonder what could have frightened reddy so and in a minute he thought of the strange creature which had frightened him a few days before i do believe that was it he cried i do believe it was reddy is coming from the direction of prickly porkys and that was where i got my fright ii  peter hesitated the truth is he was wondering if he dared go up there and see if that strange creature without head tail or legs really was around again he knew it would be a foolish thing to do for he might walk right into danger he knew that little mrs peter was waiting for him over in the dear old briarpatch and that she would worry for he ought to be there this very blessed minute but he was very curious to know what had frightened reddy so and his curiosity which has led him into so many scrapes grew greater with every passing minute  it wont do any harm to go part way up there thought peter perhaps i will find out something without going way up there  so instead of starting for home as he should have done he turned back through the green forest and stopping every few hops to look and listen made his way clear to the foot of the hill where prickly porky lives there he hid under a little hemlocktree and looked in every direction for the strange creature which had frightened him so the last time he was there but nobody was to be seen but prickly porky jimmy skunk and unc billy possum rolling around in the leaves at the top of the hill and laughing fit to kill themselves  theres no danger here that is sure thought peter shrewdly and i believe those fellows have been up to some trick  with that he boldly hopped up the hill and joined them whats the joke he demanded  did you meet reddy fox asked jimmy skunk wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes  did i meet him why he almost ran into me and didnt see me at all i guess hes running yet now whats the joke peter demanded  when the others could stop laughing long enough they gathered around peter and told him something that sent peter off into such a fit of laughter that it made his sides ache thats a good one on reddy and it was just as good a one on me he declared now who else can we scare  all of which shows that there was something very like mischief being planned on the hill where prickly porky the porcupine lives     xiv  reddy fox tries to keep out of sight   never in all his life was reddy fox more uncomfortable in his mind he knew that by this time everybody in the green forest on the green meadows around the smiling pool and along the laughing brook knew how he had put his tail between his legs and run with all his might at the first glimpse of the strange creature which had rolled down the hill of prickly porky and he was right everybody did know it and everybody was laughing about it unc billy possum jimmy skunk prickly porky and peter rabbit had seen him run and you may be sure they told everybody they met about it and news like that travels very fast  it wouldnt have been so bad if he hadnt boasted beforehand that if he met the strange creature he would wait for it and find out what it was as it was he had run just as peter rabbit had run when he saw it and he had been just as much frightened as peter had now as he sneaked along trying to find something to eat for he was hungry he did his very best to keep out of sight usually he is very proud of his handsome red coat but now he wished that he could get rid of it it is very hard to keep out of sight when you have bright colored clothes presently sammy jays sharp eyes spied him as he tried to crawl up on the young family of mrs grouse at once sammy flew over there screaming at the top of his lungs      reddy fox is very brave when theres no danger near     but where there is alas alack he runs away in fear  reddy looked up at sammy and snarled it was of no use at all now to try to surprise and catch any of the family of mrs grouse so he turned around and hurried away trying to escape from sammys sharp eyes he had gone only a little way when a sharp voice called coward coward coward it was chatterer the red squirrel  no sooner had he got out out of chatterers sight than he heard another voice it was saying over and over      dee dee dee oh me me     some folks can talk so very brave     and then such cowards be  it was tommy tit the chickadee reddy couldnt think of a thing to say in reply and so he hurried on trying to find a place where he would be left in peace but nowhere that he could go was he free from those taunting voices not even when he had crawled into his house was he free from them for buzzing around his doorway was bumble bee and bumble was humming      bumble grumble rumble hum     reddy surely can run some  late that afternoon old granny fox called him out and it was clear to see that granny was very much put out about something what is this i hear everywhere i go about you being a coward she demanded sharply as soon as he put his head out of the doorway  reddy hung his head and in a very shamefaced way he told her about the terrible fright he had had and all about the strange creature without legs head or tail that had rolled down the hill where prickly porky lives  serves you right for boasting snapped granny how many times have i told you that no good comes of boasting probably somebody has played a trick on you ive lived a good many years and i never before heard of such a creature if there were one id have seen it before now you go back into the house and stay there you are a disgrace to the fox family i am going to have a look about and find out what is going on if this is some trick theyll find that old granny fox isnt so easily fooled     xv  old granny fox investigates   investigate is a great big word but its meaning is very simple to investigate is to look into and try to find out all about something that is what old granny fox started to do after reddy had told her about the terrible fright he had had at the hill where prickly porky lives  now old granny fox is very sly and smart and clever as you all know compared with her reddy fox is almost stupid he may be as sly and smart and clever some day but he has got a lot to learn before then now if it had been reddy who was going to investigate he would have gone straight over to prickly porkys hill and looked around and asked sly questions and everybody whom he met would have known that he was trying to find out something  but old granny fox did nothing of the kind oh my no she went about hunting her dinner just as usual and didnt appear to be paying the least attention to what was going on about her with her nose to the ground she ran this way and ran that way as if hunting for a trail she peered into old hollow logs and looked under little brush piles and so in course of time she came to the hill where prickly porky lives  now reddy had told granny that the terrible creature that had so frightened him had rolled down the hill at him for he was at the bottom granny had heard that the same thing had happened to peter rabbit and to unc billy possum so instead of coming to the hill along the hollow at the bottom she came to it from the other way if there is anything there ill be behind it instead of in front of it she thought shrewdly  as she drew near where prickly porky lives she kept eyes and ears wide open all the time pretending to pay attention to nothing but the hunt for her dinner no one would ever have guessed that she was thinking of anything else she ran this way and that way all over the hill but nothing out of the usual did she see or hear excepting one thing she did find some queer marks down the hill as if something might have rolled there she followed these down to the bottom but there they disappeared  as she was trotting home along the lone little path through the green forest she met unc billy possum no she didnt exactly meet him because he saw her before she saw him and he promptly climbed a tree  ah suppose yoall heard of the terrible creature that scared reddy almost out of his wits early this moning said unc billy  granny stopped and looked up it doesnt take much to scare the young and innocent mr possum she replied i dont believe all i hear ive just been hunting all over the hill where prickly porky lives and i couldnt find so much as a wood mouse for dinner do you believe such a foolish tale mr possum  unc billy coughed behind one hand yes mrs fox ah confess ah done have to believe it he replied yo see ah done see that thing mah own self and ah just naturally has to believe mah own eyes  huh id like to see it maybe id believe it then snapped granny fox  the only time to see it is just at sunup replied unc billy anybody that comes along through that hollow at the foot of brer porkys hill at sunup is likely never to forget it ah wouldnt do it again no sah once is enough fo your unc billy  huh snorted granny and trotted on  unc billy watched her out of sight and grinned broadly as sho as brer sun gets up tomorrow moning ol granny fox will be there he chuckled ah must get word to brer porky and brer skunk and brer rabbit     xvi  old granny fox loses her dignity   unc billy possum had passed the word along to jimmy skunk peter rabbit and prickly porky that old granny fox would be on hand at sunup to see for herself the strange creature which had frightened reddy fox at the foot of the hill where prickly porky lives how did unc billy know well he just guessed he is quite as shrewd and clever as granny fox herself and when he told her that the only time the strange creature everybody was talking about was seen was at sunup he guessed by the very way she sniffed and pretended not to believe it at all that she would visit prickly porkys hill the next morning  the ol lady suspects that there is some trick and weuns have got to be very careful warned unc billy as he and his three friends put their heads together in the early evening she is done bound to come snooping around before sunup he continued and weuns must be out of sight all excepting brer porky shell come just the way she did this afternoonfrom back of the hill instead of along the holler  unc billy was quite right old granny fox felt very sure that some one was playing tricks so she didnt wait until jolly round red mr sun was out of bed she was at the top of the hill where prickly porky lives a full hour before sunup and there she sat down to wait she couldnt see or hear anything in the least suspicious you see unc billy possum was quite out of sight as he sat in the thickest part of a hemlocktree and peter rabbit was sitting perfectly still in a hollow log and jimmy skunk wasnt showing so much as the tip of his nose as he lay just inside the doorway of an old house under the roots of a big stump only prickly porky was to be seen and he seemed to be asleep in his favorite tree everything seemed to be just as old granny fox had seen it a hundred times before  at last the jolly little sunbeams began to dance through the green forest chasing out the black shadows redeye the vireo awoke and at once began to sing as is his way not even waiting to get a mouthful of breakfast prickly porky yawned and grunted then he climbed down from the tree he had been sitting in walked slowly over to another started to climb it changed his mind and began to poke around in the dead leaves old granny fox arose and slowly stretched she glanced at prickly porky contemptuously she had seen him act in this stupid uncertain way dozens of times before then slowly watching out sharply on both sides of her without appearing to do so she walked down the hill to the hollow at the foot  now old granny fox can be very dignified when she wants to be and she was now she didnt hurry the least little bit she carried her big plumey tail just so and she didnt once look behind her for she felt sure that there was nothing out of the way there and to have done so would have been quite undignified she had reached the bottom of the hill and was walking along the hollow smiling to herself to think how easily some people are frightened when her sharp ears caught a sound on the hill behind her she turned like a flash and thenwell for a minute old granny fox was too surprised to do anything but stare there rolling down the hill straight towards her was the very thing reddy had told her about  at first granny decided to stay right where she was and find out what this thing was but the nearer it got the stranger and more terrible it seemed it was just a great ball all covered with dried leaves and yet somehow granny felt sure that it was alive although she could see no head or tail or legs the nearer it got the stranger and more terrible it seemed then granny forgot her dignity yes sir she forgot her dignity in fact she quite lost it altogether granny fox ran just as reddy had run     xvii  granny fox catches peter rabbit      now listen to this little tale       that deals somewhat with folly     and shows how sometimes one may be       a little bit too jolly   no sooner was old granny fox out of sight running as if she thought that every jump might be her last than jimmy skunk came out from the hole under a big stump where he had been hiding peter rabbit came out of the hollow log from which he had been peeping and unc billy possum dropped down from the hemlocktree in which he had so carefully kept out of sight and all three began to dance around prickly porky laughing as if they were trying to split their sides  ho ho ho shouted jimmy skunk i wonder what reddy fox would have said if he could have seen old granny go down that hollow  ha ha ha shouted peter rabbit did you see how her eyes popped out  hee hee hee squeaked unc billy possum in his funny cracked voice ah reckons she am bound to have sore feet if she keeps on running the way she started  prickly porky didnt say a word he just smiled in a quiet sort of way as he slowly climbed up to the top of the hill  now old granny fox had been badly frightened who wouldnt have been at seeing a strange creature without head tail or legs rolling down hill straight towards them but granny was too old and wise to run very far without cause she was hardly out of sight of the four little scamps who had been watching her when she stopped to see if that strange creature were following her it didnt take her long to decide that it wasnt then she did some quick thinking  i said beforehand that there was some trick and now im sure of it she muttered i have an idea that that goodfornothing old billy possum knows something about it and im just going back to find out  she wasted no time thinking about it but began to steal back the way she had come now no one is lighter of foot than old granny fox and no one knows better how to keep out of sight from tree to tree she crawled sometimes flat on her stomach until at last she reached the foot of the hill where she had just had such a fright there was nothing to be seen there but up at the top of the hill she saw something that made a fierce angry gleam come into her yellow eyes then she smiled grimly the last laugh always is the best laugh and this time i guess it is going to be mine she said to herself very slowly and carefully so as not to so much as rustle a leaf she began to crawl around so as to come up on the back side of the hill  now what old granny fox had seen was peter rabbit and jimmy skunk and unc billy possum rolling over and over in the dried leaves turning somersaults and shouting and laughing while prickly porky sat looking on and smiling granny knew well enough what was tickling them so and she knew too that they didnt dream but that she was still running away in fright at last they were so tired with their good time that they just had to stop for a rest  oh dear im all out of breath panted peter as he threw himself flat on the ground that was the funniest thing i ever saw i wonder who we  peter didnt finish no sir peter didnt finish instead he gave a frightened shriek as something red flashed out from under a lowgrowing hemlocktree close behind him and two black paws pinned him down and sharp teeth caught him by the back of the neck old granny fox had caught peter rabbit at last     xviii  a friend in need is a friend indeed      the friendship which is truest best     is that which meets the trouble test   no one really knows who his best friends are until he gets in trouble when everything is lovely and there is no sign of trouble anywhere one may have ever and ever so many friends at least it may seem so but let trouble come and all too often these seeming friends disappear as if by magic until only a few sometimes a very few are left these are the real friends the true friends and they are worth more than all the others put together remember that if you are a true friend to any one you will stand by him and help him no matter what happens sometimes it is almost worth while getting into trouble just to find out who your real friends are  peter rabbit found out who some of his truest friends are when because of his own carelessness old granny fox caught him peter has been in many tight places and had many terrible frights in his life but never did he feel quite so helpless and hopeless as when he felt the black paws of old granny fox pinning him down and grannys sharp teeth in the loose skin on the back of his neck all he could do was to kick with all his might and kicking was quite useless for granny took great care to keep out of the way of those stout hind legs of his  many many times granny fox had tried to catch peter and always before peter had been too smart for her and had just made fun of her and laughed at her now it was her turn to laugh all because he had been careless and foolish you see peter had been so sure that granny had had such a fright when she ran away from the strange creature that rolled down prickly porkys hill at her that she wouldnt think of coming back and so he had just given himself up to enjoying grannys fright at peters scream of fright unc billy possum scampered for the nearest tree and jimmy skunk dodged behind a big stump you see it was so sudden that they really didnt know what had happened but prickly porky whom some people call stupid made no move to run away he happened to be looking at peter when granny caught him and so he knew just what it meant a spark of anger flashed in his usually dull eyes and for once in his life prickly porky moved quickly the thousand little spears hidden in his coat suddenly stood on end and prickly porky made a fierce little rush forward  illustration drop him he grunted page 89  drop him he grunted  granny fox just snarled and backed away dragging peter with her and keeping him between prickly porky and herself  by this time jimmy skunk had recovered himself you know he is not afraid of anybody or anything he sprang out from behind the stump looking a wee bit shamefaced and started for old granny fox you let peter rabbit go he commanded in a very threatening way now the reason jimmy skunk is afraid of nobody is because he carries with him a little bag of very strong perfume which makes everybody sick but himself granny fox knows all about this for just a minute she hesitated then she thought that if jimmy used it it would be as bad for peter as for her and she didnt believe jimmy would use it so she kept on backing away dragging peter with her then unc billy possum took a hand and his was the bravest deed of all for he knew that granny was more than a match for him in a fight he slipped down from the tree where he had sought safety crept around behind granny and bit her sharply on one heel granny let go of peter to turn and snap at unc billy this was peters chance he slipped out from under grannys paws and in a flash was behind prickly porky     xix  jimmy skunk takes word to mrs peter   when old granny fox found prickly porky with his thousand little spears all pointing at her standing between her and peter rabbit she was the angriest old fox ever seen she didnt dare touch prickly porky for she knew well enough what it would mean to get one of those sharp barbed little spears in her skin to think that she actually had caught peter rabbit and then lost him was too provoking it was more than her temper never of the best could stand in her anger she dug up the leaves and earth with her hind feet and all the time her tongue fairly flew as she called prickly porky jimmy skunk and unc billy possum everything bad she could think of her yellow eyes snapped so that it seemed almost as if sparks of fire flew from them it made peter shiver just to look at her  unc billy possum who by slipping up behind her and biting one of her heels had made her let go of peter grinned down at her from a safe place in a tree jimmy skunk stood grinning at her in the most provoking manner and she couldnt do a thing about it because she had no desire to have jimmy use his little bag of perfume so she talked herself out and then with many parting threats of what she would do she started for home unc billy noticed that she limped a little with the foot he had nipped so hard and he couldnt help feeling just a little bit sorry for her  when she had gone the others turned to peter rabbit to see how badly he had been hurt they looked him all over and found that he wasnt much the worse for his rough experience he was rather stiff and lame and the back of his neck was very sore where granny fox had seized him but he would be quite himself in a day or two  i must get home now said he in a rather faint voice mrs peter will be sure that something has happened to me and will be worried almost to death  no you dont declared jimmy skunk you are going to stay right here where we can take care of you it wouldnt be safe for you to try to go to the old briarpatch now because if you should meet old man coyote or reddy fox or whitetail the marshhawk you would not be able to run fast enough to get away i will go down and tell mrs peter and you will make yourself comfortable in the old house behind that stump where i was hiding  peter tried to insist on going home but the others wouldnt hear of it and jimmy skunk settled the matter by starting for the dear old briarpatch he found little mrs peter anxiously looking towards the green forest for some sign of peter  oh she cried you have come to bring me bad news do tell me quickly what has happened to peter  nothing much has happened to peter replied jimmy promptly then in the drollest way he told all about the fright of granny fox when she first saw the terrible creature rolling down the hill and all that happened after but he took great care to make light of peters escape and explained that he was just going to rest up there on prickly porkys hill for that day and would be home the next night but little mrs peter wasnt wholly satisfied  ive begged him and begged him to keep away from the green forest said she but now if he is hurt so that he cant come home he needs me and im going straight up there myself  nothing that jimmy could say had the least effect and so at last he agreed to take her to peter and so hopping behind jimmy skunk timid little mrs peter rabbit actually went into the green forest of which she was so much afraid which shows how brave love can be sometimes     xx  a plot to frighten old man coyote      mischief leads to mischief for it is almost sure     to never never be content without a little more   now you would think that after peter rabbits very very narrow escape from the clutches of old granny fox that jimmy skunk unc billy possum peter rabbit and prickly porky would have been satisfied with the pranks they already had played no sir they were not you see when danger is over it is quickly forgotten no sooner had peter been made comfortable in the old house behind the big stump on the hill where prickly porky lives than the four scamps began to wonder who else they could scare with the terrible creature without head legs or tail which had so frightened reddy and old granny fox  there is old man coyote he is forever frightening those smaller and weaker than himself id just love to see him run said peter rabbit  the very one cried jimmy skunk i wonder if he would be afraid you know he is even smarter than granny fox and though she was frightened at first she soon got over it how do you suppose we can get him over here  weuns will take brer jay into our secret brer jay will tell brer coyote that brer rabbit is up here on brer porkys hill hurt so that he cant get home said unc billy possum thats all brer jay need to say brer coyote is gwine to come up here hot foot with his tongue hanging out fo that dinner hes sho is waiting fo him here  you wont do anything of the kind spoke up little mrs peter who you know had bravely left the dear old briarpatch and come up here in the green forest to take care of peter peter has had trouble enough already and im not going to let him have any more so there  peter isnt going to get into any trouble spoke up jimmy skunk peter and you are going to be just as safe as if you were over in the old briarpatch for you will be in that old house where nothing can harm you now please mrs peter dont be foolish you dont like old man coyote do you youd like to see him get a great scare to make up for the scares he has given peter and you wouldnt you  little mrs peter was forced to admit that she would and after a little more teasing she finally agreed to let them try their plan for giving old man coyote a scare sammy jay happened along just as jimmy skunk was starting out to look for him and when he was told what was wanted of him he agreed to do his part you know sammy is always ready for any mischief just as he started to look for old man coyote unc billy possum made another suggestion  weuns have had a lot of fun with reddy and granny fox said he and now it seems to me that it is no more than fair to invite them over to see old man coyote and what he will do when he first sees the terrible creature that has frightened them so granny knows now that there is nothing to be afraid of and perhaps she will forget her anger if she has a chance to see old man coyote run away yo know she isnt wasting any love on him what do yo alls say  peter and mrs peter said no right away but jimmy skunk and prickly porky thought it a good idea and of course sammy jay was willing after a little when it was once more pointed out to them how they would be perfectly safe in the old house behind the big stump peter and mrs peter agreed and sammy started off on his errand     xxi  sammy jay delivers his message   sammy jay has been the bearer of so many messages that no one knows better than he how to deliver one he knows when to be polite and no one can be more polite than he first he went over to the home of reddy and granny fox and invited them to come over to the hill where prickly porky lives and see the terrible creature which had frightened them so give old man coyote a scare both reddy and granny promptly said they would do nothing of the kind that probably sammy was engaged in some kind of mischief and that anyway they knew that there was no such creature without head legs or tail and though they had been fooled once they didnt propose to be fooled again  all right replied sammy quite as if it made no difference to him you admit that smart as you are you were fooled and we thought you might like to see the same thing happen to old man coyote  with this he flew on his way to the green meadows to look for old man coyote and as he flew he chuckled to himself theyll be there he muttered i know them well enough to know that nothing would keep them away when there is a chance to see some one else frightened especially old man coyote theyll try to keep out of sight but theyll be there  sammy found old man coyote taking a sunbath good morning mr coyote i hope you are feeling well said sammy in his politest manner  fairly fairly thank you replied old man coyote all the time watching sammy sharply out of the corners of his shrewd eyes whats the news in the green forest  there isnt any that is none to amount to anything declared sammy i never did see such a dull summer is there any news down here on the green meadows i hear danny meadow mouse has found his lost baby  so i hear replied old man coyote i tried to find it for him you know i believe in being neighborly  sammy grinned for as he said this old man coyote had winked one eye ever so little and sammy knew very well that if he had found that lost baby danny meadow mouse would never have seen him again by the way said sammy in the most matteroffact tone as i was coming through the green forest i saw peter rabbit over on the hill where prickly porky lives and peter seems to have been in some kind of trouble he was so lame that he said he didnt dare try to go home to the old briarpatch for fear that he might meet some one looking for a rabbit dinner and he knew that feeling as he did he wouldnt be able to save himself peter is going to come to a bad end some day if he doesnt watch out  that depends on what you call a bad end replied old man coyote with a sly grin it might be bad for peter and at the same time be very good for some one else  sammy laughed right out thats one way of looking at it said he well i should hate to have anything happen to peter because i have lots of fun quarreling with him and should miss him dreadfully i think ill go up to the old orchard and see what is going on there  off flew sammy in the direction of the old orchard and once more he chuckled as he flew he had seen old man coyotes ears prick up ever so little when he had mentioned that peter was over in the green forest so lame that he didnt dare go home old man coyote will start for the green forest as soon as i am out of sight thought sammy and that is just what old man coyote did     xxii  old man coyote loses his appetite   hardly was sammy jay out of sight flying towards the old orchard before old man coyote started for the green forest he is very sharp is old man coyote so sharp that it is not very often that he is fooled if sammy jay had gone to him and told him what a splendid chance he would have to catch peter rabbit if he hurried up to the green forest right away old man coyote would have suspected a trick of some kind sammy had been clever enough to know this so he had just mentioned in the most matteroffact way that he had seen peter over on prickly porkys hill and that peter appeared to have been in trouble so that he was too lame to go to his home in the dear old briarpatch there wasnt even a hint that old man coyote should go over there this was what made him sure that the news about peter was probably true  now as soon as sammy was sure that old man coyote couldnt see him he headed straight for the green forest and the hill where prickly porky jimmy skunk unc billy possum and peter and mrs peter rabbit were waiting as he flew he saw reddy fox and old granny fox stretched flat behind an old log some distance away but where they could see all that might happen  i knew they would be on hand he chuckled  when he reached the others he reported that he had delivered the message to old man coyote and that he was very sure in fact he was positive that old man coyote was already on his way there in the hope that he would be able to catch peter rabbit it was decided that everybody but peter should get out of sight at once so unc billy possum climbed a tree jimmy skunk crawled into a hollow log sammy jay hid in the thickest part of a hemlock tree prickly porky got behind a big stump right at the top of the hill little mrs peter with her heart going pitapat crept into the old house between the roots of this same old stump and only peter was to be seen when at last old man coyote came tiptoeing along the hollow at the foot of the hill as noiseless as a gray shadow  he saw peter almost as soon as peter saw him and the instant he saw him he stopped as still as if he were made of stone peter took a couple of steps and it was very plain to see that he was lame just as sammy jay had said  that goodfornothing jay told the truth for once thought old man coyote with a hungry gleam in his eyes  whenever old man coyote thought that peter was not looking his way he would crawl on his stomach from one tree to another always getting a little nearer to peter he would lie perfectly still when peter seemed to be looking towards him now of course peter knew just what was going on and he took the greatest care not to get more than a couple of jumps away from the old house under the big stump where mrs peter was hiding and wishing with all her might that she and peter were back in the dear old briarpatch it was very still in the green forest save for the song of happiness of redeye the vireo who if he knew what was going on made no sign my but it was exciting to those who were watching  old man coyote had crept halfway up the hill and peter was wondering how much nearer he could let him get with safety when a sudden grunting broke out right behind him peter knew what it meant and jumped to one side then down the hill rolling straight towards old man coyote started the strange headless tailess legless creature that had so frightened reddy and granny fox  old man coyote took one good look hesitated looked again and then turned tail and started for the green meadows as fast as his long legs would take him it was plain to see that he was afraid very much afraid quite suddenly he had lost his appetite     xxiii  buster bear gives it all away   it was very clear that old man coyote wasnt thinking about his stomach just then but about his legs and how fast they could go he had been halfway up the hill when he first saw the terrible creature without head tail or legs rolling down straight at him he stopped only long enough for one good look and then he started for the bottom of the hill as fast as he could make his legs go now it is a very bad plan to run fast downhill yes sir it is a very bad plan you see once you are started it is not the easiest thing in the world to stop and then again you are quite likely to stub your toes  this is what old man coyote did he stubbed his toes and turned a complete somersault he looked so funny that the little scamps watching him had all they could do to keep from shouting right out old granny fox and reddy fox looking on from a safe distance did laugh you know they had not been friendly with old man coyote since he came to live on the green meadows and as they had themselves had a terrible fright when they first saw the strange creature they rejoiced in seeing him frightened  but old man coyote didnt stop for a little thing like a tumble oh my no he just rolled over on to his feet and was off again harder than before now there are very few people who can see behind them without turning their heads as peter rabbit can and old man coyote is not one of them trying to watch behind him he didnt see where he was going and the first thing he knew he ran bump intoguess who why buster bear to be sure  where buster had come from nobody knew but there he was as big as life when old man coyote ran into him he growled a deep provoked growl and whirled around with one big paw raised to cuff whoever had so nearly upset him old man coyote more frightened than ever yelped and ran harder than before so that by the time buster bear saw who it was who had run into him he was safely out of reach and still running  then it was that buster bear first saw rolling down the hill the strange creature which had so frightened old man coyote unc billy possum jimmy skunk sammy jay peter rabbit and mrs peter watching from safe hiding places wondered if buster would run too if he did it would be almost too good to be true but he didnt he looked first at the strange creature rolling down the hill then at old man coyote running as hard as ever he could and his shrewd little eyes began to twinkle then he began to laugh  ha ha ha ho ho ho ha ha ho i see you are up to your old tricks prickly porky he shouted as the strange creature rolled past almost over his toes and brought up against a little tree at the foot of the hill  illustration i see you are up to your old tricks prickly porky he shouted page 114  old man coyote heard him and stopped short and turned to see what it meant very slowly the strange creature unrolled and turned over there was a head now and a tail and four legs it was none other than prickly porky himself there was no doubt about it though he still looked very strange for he was covered with dead leaves which clung to the thousand little spears hidden in his coat prickly porky grinned  you shouldnt have given me away buster bear just because you have seen me roll down hill before in the great woods where we both came from said he  i think it was high time i did replied buster bear still chuckling you might have scared somebody to death down here where they dont know you  then everybody came out of their hiding places laughing and talking all at once as they told buster bear of the joke they had played on old man coyote and how it had all grown out of the fright peter rabbit had received when he just happened along as prickly porky was rolling down hill just for fun as for old man coyote he sneaked away grinding his teeth angrily like a great many other people he couldnt take a joke on himself  so prickly porky made himself at home in the green forest and took his place among the little people who live there in just the same way old man coyote came as a stranger to the green meadows and established himself there in the next book you may read all about how he came to the green meadows and of some of his adventures there and in the green forest     the end
