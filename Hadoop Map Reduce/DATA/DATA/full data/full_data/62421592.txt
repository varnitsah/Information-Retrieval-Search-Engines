acquaintancesfirst visit to new england    bibliographical  long before i began the papers which make up this volume i had meant to write of literary history in new england as i had known it in the lives of its great exemplars during the twentyfive years i lived near them in fact i had meant to do this from the time i came among them but i let the days in which i almost constantly saw them go by without record save such as i carried in a memory retentive indeed beyond the common but not so full as i could have wished when i began to invoke it for my work  still upon insistent appeal it responded in sufficient abundance and though i now wish i could have remembered more instances i think my impressions were accurate enough  i am sure of having tried honestly to impart them in the ten years or more when i was desultorily endeavoring to share them with the reader  the papers were written pretty much in the order they have here beginning with my first visit to new england which dates from the earliest eighteennineties if i may trust my recollection of reading it from the manuscript to the editor of harpers magazine where we lay under the willows of magnolia one pleasant summer morning in the first years of that decade  it was printed no great while after in that periodical but i was so long in finishing the study of lowell that it had been anticipated in harpers by other reminiscences of him and it was therefore first printed in scribners magazine  it was the paper with which i took the most pains and when it was completed i still felt it so incomplete that i referred it to his closest and my best friend the late charles eliot norton for his criticism  he thought it wanting in unity it was a group of studies instead of one study he said i must do something to draw the different sketches together in a single effect of portraiture and this i did my best to do  it was the latest written of the three articles which give the volume substance and it represents mare finally and fully than the others my sense of the literary importance of the men whose like we shall not look upon again  longfellow was easily the greatest poet of the three holmes often the most brilliant and felicitous but lowell in spite of his forays in politics was the finest scholar and the most profoundly literary as he was above the others most deeply and thoroughly new england in quality  while i was doing these sketches sometimes slighter and sometimes less slight of all those poets and essayists and novelists i had known in cambridge and boston and concord and new york i was doing many other things half a dozen novels as many more novelettes and shorter stories with essays and criticisms and verses so that in january 1900 i had not yet done the paper on lowell which with another was to complete my reminiscences of american literary life as i had witnessed it  when they were all done at last they were republished in a volume which found instant favor beyond my deserts if not its own  there was a good deal of trouble with the name but literary friends and acquaintance was an endeavor for modest accuracy with which i remained satisfied until i thought long too late of literary friends and neighbors  then i perceived that this would have been still more accurate and quite as modest and i gladly give any reader leave to call the book by that name who likes  since the collection was first made i have written little else quite of the kind except the paper on bret harte which was first printed shortly after his death and the study of mark twain which i had been preparing to make for forty years and more and wrote in two weeks of the spring of 1910  others of my time and place have now passed whither there is neither time nor place and there are moments when i feel that i must try to call them back and pay them such honor as my sense of their worth may give but the impulse has as yet failed to effect itself and i do not know how long i shall spare myself the supreme pleasurepain the hochst angenehmer schmerz of seeking to live here with those who live here no more  w d h       literary friends and acquaintancemy first visit to new england    my first visit to new england   if there was any one in the world who had his being more wholly in literature than i had in 1860 i am sure i should not have known where to find him and i doubt if he could have been found nearer the centres of literary activity than i then was or among those more purely devoted to literature than myself  i had been for three years a writer of news paragraphs book notices and political leaders on a daily paper in an inland city and i do not know that my life differed outwardly from that of any other young journalist who had begun as i had in a country printingoffice and might be supposed to be looking forward to advancement in his profession or in public affairs  but inwardly it was altogether different with me  inwardly i was a poet with no wish to be anything else unless in a moment of careless affluence i might so far forget myself as to be a novelist  i was with my friend j j piatt the halfauthor of a little volume of very unknown verse and mr lowell had lately accepted and had begun to print in the atlantic monthly five or six poems of mine  besides this i had written poems and sketches and criticisms for the saturday press of new york a longforgotten but once very lively expression of literary intention in an extinct bohemia of that city and i was always writing poems and sketches and criticisms in our own paper  these as well as my feats in the renowned periodicals of the east met with kindness if not honor in my own city which ought to have given me grave doubts whether i was any real prophet but it only intensified my literary ambition already so strong that my veins might well have run ink rather than blood and gave me a higher opinion of my fellowcitizens if such a thing could be  they were indeed very charming people and such of them as i mostly saw were readers and lovers of books  society in columbus at that day had a pleasant refinement which i think i do not exaggerate in the fond retrospect  it had the finality which it seems to have had nowhere since the war it had certain fixed ideals which were none the less graceful and becoming because they were the simple old american ideals now vanished or fast vanishing before the knowledge of good and evil as they have it in europe and as it has imparted itself to american travel and sojourn  there was a mixture of many strains in the capital of ohio as there was throughout the state  virginia kentucky pennsylvania new york and new england all joined to characterize the manners and customs i suppose it was the south which gave the social tone the intellectual taste among the elders was the southern taste for the classic and the standard in literature but we who were younger preferred the modern authors we read thackeray and george eliot and hawthorne and charles reade and de quincey and tennyson and browning and emerson and longfellow and ii read heine and evermore heine when there was not some new thing from the others  now and then an immediate french book penetrated to us we read michelet and about i remember  we looked to england and the east largely for our literary opinions we accepted the saturday review as law if we could not quite receive it as gospel  one of us took the cornhill magazine because thackeray was the editor the atlantic monthly counted many readers among us and a visiting young lady from new england who screamed at sight of the periodical in one of our houses why have you got the atlantic monthly out here could be answered with cold superiority there are several contributors to the atlantic in columbus  there were in fact two my roommate who wrote browning for it while i wrote heine and longfellow  but i suppose two are as rightfully several as twenty are     ii  that was the heyday of lecturing and now and then a literary light from the east swam into our skies  i heard and saw emerson and i once met bayard taylor socially at the hospitable house where he was a guest after his lecture  heaven knows how i got through the evening  i do not think i opened my mouth to address him a word it was as much as i could do to sit and look at him while he tranquilly smoked and chatted with our host and quaffed the beer which we had very good in the nest  all the while i did him homage as the first author by calling whom i had met i longed to tell him how much i liked his poems which we used to get by heart in those days and i longed how much more i longed to have him know that            auch ich war in arkadien geboren  that i had printed poems in the atlantic monthly and the saturday press and was the potential author of things destined to eclipse all literature hitherto attempted  but i could not tell him and there was no one else who thought to tell him  perhaps it was as well so i might have perished of his recognition for my modesty was equal to my merit  in fact i think we were all rather modest young fellows we who formed the group wont to spend some part of every evening at that house where there was always music or whist or gay talk or all three  we had our opinions of literary matters but perhaps because we had mostly accepted them from england or new england as i have said we were not vain of them and we would by no means have urged them before a living literary man like that  i believe none of us ventured to speak except the poet my roommate who said he believed so and so was the original of so and so and was promptly told he had no right to say such a thing naturally we came away rather critical of our hosts guest whom i afterwards knew as the kindliest heart in the world  but we had not shone in his presence and that galled us and we chose to think that he had not shone in ours     iii  at that time he was filling a large space in the thoughts of the young people who had any thoughts about literature  he had come to his full repute as an agreeable and intelligent traveller and he still wore the halo of his early adventures afoot in foreign lands when they were yet really foreign  he had not written his novels of american life once so welcomed and now so forgotten it was very long before he had achieved that incomparable translation of faust which must always remain the finest and best and which would keep his name alive with goethes if he had done nothing else worthy of remembrance  but what then most commended him to the regard of us stareyed youth now blinking sadly toward our seventies was the poetry which he printed in the magazines from time to time in the first putnams where there was a dashing picture of him in an arab burnoose and a turban and in harpers and in the atlantic  it was often very lovely poetry i thought and i still think so and it was rightfully his though it paid the inevitable allegiance to the manner of the great masters of the day  it was graced for us by the pathetic romance of his early love which some of its sweetest and saddest numbers confessed for the young girl he married almost in her death hour and we who were hoping to have our hearts broken or already had them so would have been glad of something more of the obvious poet in the popular lecturer we had seen refreshing himself after his hour on the platform  he remained for nearly a year the only author i had seen and i met him once again before i saw any other  our second meeting was far from columbus as far as remote quebec when i was on my way to new england by way of niagara and the canadian rivers and cities  i stopped in toronto and realized myself abroad without any signal adventures but at montreal something very pretty happened to me  i came into the hotel office the evening of a first days lonely sightseeing and vainly explored the register for the name of some acquaintance as i turned from it two smartly dressed young fellows embraced it and i heard one of them say to my great amaze and happiness hello heres howells  oh i broke out upon him i was just looking for some one i knew  i hope you are some one who knows me  only through your contributions to the saturday press said the young fellow and with these golden words the precious first personal recognition of my authorship i had ever received from a stranger and the rich reward of all my literary endeavor he introduced himself and his friend  i do not know what be came of this friend or where or how he eliminated himself but we two others were inseparable from that moment he was a young lawyer from new york and when i came back from italy four or five years later i used to see his sign in wall street with a neverfulfilled intention of going in to see him  in whatever world he happens now to be i should like to send him my greetings and confess to him that my art has never since brought me so sweet a recompense and nothing a thousandth part so much like fame as that outcry of his over the hotel register in montreal we were comrades for four or five rich days and shared our pleasures and expenses in viewing the monuments of those ancient canadian capitals which i think we valued at all their picturesque worth  we made jokes to mask our emotions we giggled and made giggle in the right way we fell in and out of love with all the pretty faces and dresses we saw and we talked evermore about literature and literary people  he had more acquaintance with the one and more passion for the other but he could tell me of pfaffs lagerbeer cellar on broadway where the saturday press fellows and the other bohemians met and this for the time was enough i resolved to visit it as soon as i reached new york in spite of the tobacco and beer which i was given to understand were de rigueur though they both so far as i had known them were apt to make me sick  i was very desolate after i parted from this good fellow who returned to montreal on his way to new york while i remained in quebec to continue later on mine to new england  when i came in from seeing him off in a calash for the boat i discovered bayard taylor in the readingroom where he sat sunken in what seemed a somewhat weary muse  he did not know me or even notice me though i made several errands in and out of the readingroom in the vain hope that be might do so doubly vain for i am aware now that i was still flown with the pride of that pretty experience in montreal and trusted in a repetition of something like it  at last as no chance volunteered to help me i mustered courage to go up to him and name myself and say i had once had the pleasure of meeting him at doctor s in columbus  the poet gave no sign of consciousness at the sound of a name which i had fondly begun to think might not be so all unknown  he looked up with an unkindling eye and asked ah how was the doctor  and when i had reported favorably of the doctor our conversation ended  he was probably as tired as he looked and he must have classed me with that multitude all over the country who had shared the pleasure i professed in meeting him before it was surely my fault that i did not speak my name loud enough to be recognized if i spoke it at all but the courage i had mustered did not quite suffice for that  in after years he assured me first by letter and then by word of his grief for an incident which i can only recall now as the untoward beginning of a cordial friendship  it was often my privilege in those days as reviewer and editor to testify my sense of the beautiful things he did in so many kinds of literature but i never liked any of them better than i liked him  he had a fervent devotion to his art and he was always going to do the greatest things in it with an expectation of effect that never failed him  the things he actually did were none of them mean or wanting in quality and some of them are of a lasting charm that any one may feel who will turn to his poems but no doubt many of them fell short of his hopes of them with the reader  it was fine to meet him when he was full of a new scheme he talked of it with a singlehearted joy and tried to make you see it of the same colors and proportions it wore to his eyes  he spared no toil to make it the perfect thing he dreamed it and he was not discouraged by any disappointment he suffered with the critic or the public  he was a tireless worker and at last his health failed under his labors at the newspaper desk beneath the midnight gas when he should long have rested from such labors  i believe he was obliged to do them through one of those business fortuities which deform and embitter all our lives but he was not the man to spare himself in any case  he was always attempting new things and he never ceased endeavoring to make his scholarship reparation for the want of earlier opportunity and training i remember that i met him once in a cambridge street with a book in his hand which he let me take in mine  it was a greek author and he said he was just beginning to read the language at fifty a patriarchal age to me of the early thirties  i suppose i intimated the surprise i felt at his taking it up so late in the day for he said with charming seriousness oh but you know i expect to use it in the other world  yea that made it worth while i consented but was he sure of the other world  as sure as i am of this he said and i have always kept the impression of the young faith which spoke in his voice and was more than his words  i saw him last in the hour of those tremendous adieux which were paid him in new york before he sailed to be minister in germany  it was one of the most graceful things done by president hayes who most of all our presidents after lincoln honored himself in honoring literature by his appointments to give that place to bayard taylor  there was no one more fit for it and it was peculiarly fit that he should be so distinguished to a people who knew and valued his scholarship and the service he had done german letters  he was as happy in it apparently as a man could be in anything here below and he enjoyed to the last drop the many cups of kindness pressed to his lips in parting though i believe these farewells at a time when he was already fagged with work and excitement were notably harmful to him and helped to hasten his end  some of us who were near of friendship went down to see him off when he sailed as the dismal and futile wont of friends is and i recall the kind great fellow standing in the cabin amid those sad flowers that heaped the tables saying goodby to one after another and smiling fondly smiling wearily upon all  there was champagne of course and an odious hilarity without meaning and without remission till the warning bell chased us ashore and our brave poet escaped with what was left of his life     iv  i have followed him far from the moment of our first meeting but even on my way to venerate those new england luminaries which chiefly drew my eyes i could not pay a less devoir to an author who if curtis was not was chief of the new york group of authors in that day  i distinguished between the newenglanders and the newyorkers and i suppose there is no question but our literary centre was then in boston wherever it is or is not at present  but i thought taylor then and i think him now one of the first in our whole american province of the republic of letters in a day when it was in a recognizably flourishing state whether we regard quantity or quality in the names that gave it lustre  lowell was then in perfect command of those varied forces which will long if not lastingly keep him in memory as first among our literary men and master in more kinds than any other american  longfellow was in the fulness of his worldwide fame and in the ripeness of the beautiful genius which was not to know decay while life endured  emerson had emerged from the popular darkness which had so long held him a hopeless mystic and was shining a lambent star of poesy and prophecy at the zenith  hawthorne the exquisite artist the unrivalled dreamer whom we still always liken this one and that one to whenever this one or that one promises greatly to please us and still leave without a rival without a companion had lately returned from his long sojourn abroad and had given us the last of the incomparable romances which the world was to have perfect from his hand  doctor holmes had surpassed all expectations in those who most admired his brilliant humor and charming poetry by the invention of a new attitude if not a new sort in literature  the turn that civic affairs had taken was favorable to the widest recognition of whittiers splendid lyrical gift and that heart of fire doubly snowbound by quaker tradition and puritan environment was penetrating every generous breast with its flamy impulses and fusing all wills in its noble purpose  mrs stowe who far outfamed the rest as the author of the most renowned novel ever written was proving it no accident or miracle by the fiction she was still writing  this great new england group might be enlarged perhaps without loss of quality by the inclusion of thoreau who came somewhat before his time and whose drastic criticism of our expediential and mainly futile civilization would find more intelligent acceptance now than it did then when all resentment of its defects was specialized in enmity to southern slavery  doctor edward everett hale belonged in this group too by virtue of that humor the most inventive and the most fantastic the sanest the sweetest the truest which had begun to find expression in the atlantic monthly and there a wonderful young girl had written a series of vivid sketches and taken the heart of youth everywhere with amaze and joy so that i thought it would be no less an event to meet harriet prescott than to meet any of those i have named  i expected somehow to meet them all and i imagined them all easily accessible in the office of the atlantic monthly which had lately adventured in the fine air of high literature where so many other periodicals had gasped and died before it  the best of these hitherto and better even than the atlantic for some reasons the lamented putnams magazine had perished of inanition at new york and the claim of the commercial capital to the literary primacy had passed with that brilliant venture  new york had nothing distinctive to show for american literature but the decrepit and doting knickerbocker magazine  harpers new monthly though curtis had already come to it from the wreck of putnams and it had long ceased to be eclectic in material and had begun to stand for native work in the allied arts which it has since so magnificently advanced was not distinctively literary and the weekly had just begun to make itself known  the century scribners the cosmopolitan mcclures and i know not what others were still unimagined by five and ten and twenty years and the galaxy was to flash and fade before any of them should kindle its more effectual fires the nation which was destined to chastise rather than nurture our young literature had still six years of dreamless potentiality before it and the nation was always more bostonian than newyorkish by nature whatever it was by nativity  philadelphia had long counted for nothing in the literary field grahams magazine at one time showed a certain critical force but it seemed to perish of this expression of vitality and there remained godeys ladys book and petersons magazine publications really incredible in their insipidity  in the south there was nothing but a mistaken social ideal with the moral principles all standing on their heads in defence of slavery and in the west there was a feeble and foolish notion that western talent was repressed by eastern jealousy at boston chiefly if not at boston alone was there a vigorous intellectual life among such authors as i have named  every young writer was ambitious to join his name with theirs in the atlantic monthly and in the lists of ticknor  fields who were literary publishers in a sense such as the business world has known nowhere else before or since  their imprint was a warrant of quality to the reader and of immortality to the author so that if i could have had a book issued by them at that day i should now be in the full enjoyment of an undying fame     v  such was the literary situation as the passionate pilgrim from the west approached his holy land at boston by way of the grand trunk railway from quebec to portland  i have no recollection of a sleepingcar and i suppose i waked and watched during the whole of that long rough journey but i should hardly have slept if there had been a car for the purpose i was too eager to see what new england was like and too anxious not to lose the least glimpse of it to close my eyes after i crossed the border at island pond  i found that in the elmdotted levels of maine it was very like the western reserve in northern ohio which is indeed a portion of new england transferred with all its characteristic features and flattened out along the lake shore  it was not till i began to run southward into the older regions of the country that it lost this look and became gratefully strange to me  it never had the effect of hoary antiquity which i had expected of a country settled more than two centuries with its woodbuilt farms and villages it looked newer than the coalsmoked brick of southern ohio  i had prefigured the new england landscape bare of forests relieved here and there with the tees of orchards or plantations but i found apparently as much woodland as at home  at portland i first saw the ocean and this was a sort of disappointment tides and salt water i had already had at quebec so that i was no longer on the alert for them but the color and the vastness of the sea i was still to try upon my vision  when i stood on the promenade at portland with the kind young unitarian minister whom i had brought a letter to and who led me there for a most impressive first view of the ocean i could not make more of it than there was of lake erie and i have never thought the color of the sea comparable to the tender blue of the lake i did not hint my disappointment to my friend i had too much regard for the feelings of an eastern man to decry his ocean to his face and i felt besides that it would be vulgar and provincial to make comparisons  i am glad now that i held my tongue for that kind soul is no longer in this world and i should not like to think he knew how far short of my expectations the sea he was so proud of had fallen  i went up with him into a tower or belvedere there was at hand and when he pointed to the eastern horizon and said now there was nothing but sea between us and africa i pretended to expand with the thought and began to sound myself for the emotions which i ought to have felt at such a sight  but in my heart i was empty and heaven knows whether i saw the steamer which the ancient mariner in charge of that tower invited me to look at through his telescope  i never could see anything but a vitreous glare through a telescope which has a vicious habit of dodging about through space and failing to bring down anything of less than planetary magnitude  but there was something at portland vastly more to me than seas or continents and that was the house where longfellow was born  i believe now i did not get the right house but only the house he went to live in later but it served and i rejoiced in it with a rapture that could not have been more genuine if it had been the real birthplace of the poet  i got my friend to show me                the breezy dome of groves                the shadows of deerings woods  because they were in one of longfellows loveliest and tenderest poems and i made an errand to the docks for the sake of the                black wharves and the slips                and the seatides tossing free                and spanish sailors with bearded lips                and the beauty and mystery of the ships                and the magic of the sea  mainly for the reason that these were colors and shapes of the fond vision of the poets past  i am in doubt whether it was at this time or a later time that i went to revere                the dead captains as they lay                in their graves oerlooking the tranquil bay                where they in battle died  but i am quite sure it was now that i wandered under                the trees which shadow each wellknown street                as they balance up and down  for when i was next in portland the great fire had swept the city avenues bare of most of those beautiful elms whose gothic arches and traceries i well remember  the fact is that in those days i was bursting with the most romantic expectations of life in every way and i looked at the whole world as material that might be turned into literature or that might be associated with it somehow  i do not know how i managed to keep these preposterous hopes within me but perhaps the trick of satirizing them which i had early learnt helped me to do it  i was at that particular moment resolved above all things to see things as heinrich heine saw them or at least to report them as he did no matter how i saw them and i went about framing phrases to this end and trying to match the objects of interest to them whenever there was the least chance of getting them together     vi  i do not know how i first arrived in boston or whether it was before or after i had passed a day or two in salem  as salem is on the way from portland i will suppose that i stopped there first and explored the quaint old town quainter then than now but still quaint enough for the memorials of hawthorne and of the witches which united to form the salem i cared for  i went and looked up the house of seven gables and suffered an unreasonable disappointment that it had not a great many more of them but there was no loss in the deathwarrant of bridget bishop with the sheriffs return of execution upon it which i found at the courthouse if anything the pathos of that witness of one of the cruelest delusions in the world was rather in excess of my needs i could have got on with less  i saw the pins which the witches were sworn to have thrust into the afflicted children and i saw gallows hill where the hapless victims of the perjury were hanged  but that deathwarrant remained the most vivid color of my experience of the tragedy i had no need to invite myself to a sense of it and it is still like a stain of red in my memory  the kind old ships captain whose guest i was and who was transfigured to poetry in my sense by the fact that he used to voyage to the african coast for palmoil in former days led me all about the town and showed me the customhouse which i desired to see because it was in the preface to the scarlet letter  but i perceived that he did not share my enthusiasm for the author and i became more and more sensible that in salem air there was a cool undercurrent of feeling about him  no doubt the place was not altogether grateful for the celebrity his romance had given it and would have valued more the uninterrupted quiet of its own flattering thoughts of itself but when it came to hearing a young lady say she knew a girl who said she would like to poison hawthorne it seemed to the devout young pilgrim from the west that something more of love for the great romancer would not have been too much for him hawthorne had already had his say however and he had not used his native town with any great tenderness  indeed the advantages to any place of having a great genius born and reared in its midst are so doubtful that it might be well for localities designing to become the birthplaces of distinguished authors to think twice about it  perhaps only the largest capitals like london and paris and new york and chicago ought to risk it  but the authors have an unaccountable perversity and will seldom come into the world in the large cities which are alone without the sense of neighborhood and the personal susceptibilities so unfavorable to the practice of the literary art i dare say that it was owing to the local indifference to her greatest name or her reluctance from it that i got a clearer impression of salem in some other respects than i should have had if i had been invited there to devote myself solely to the associations of hawthorne  for the first time i saw an old new england town i do not know but the most characteristic and took into my young western consciousness the fact of a more complex civilization than i had yet known  my whole life had been passed in a region where men were just beginning ancestors and the conception of family was very imperfect  literature of course was full of it and it was not for a devotee of thackeray to be theoretically ignorant of its manifestations but i had hitherto carelessly supposed that family was nowhere regarded seriously in america except in virginia where it furnished a joke for the rest of the nation  but now i found myself confronted with it in its ancient houses and heard its names pronounced with a certain consideration which i dare say was as much their due in salem as it could be anywhere  the names were all strange and all indifferent to me but those fine square wooden mansions of a tasteful architecture and a pale buffcolor withdrawing themselves in quiet reserve from the quiet street gave me an impression of family as an actuality and a force which i had never had before but which no westerner can yet understand the east without taking into account  i do not suppose that i conceived of family as a fact of vital import then i think i rather regarded it as a color to be used in any aesthetic study of the local conditions  i am not sure that i valued it more even for literary purposes than the steeple which the captain pointed out as the first and last thing he saw when he came and went on his long voyages or than the great palmoil casks which he showed me and which i related to the tree that stood                 auf brennender felsenwand  whether that was the kind of palm that gives the oil or was a sort only suitable to be the dream of a lonely firtree in the north on a cold height i am in doubt to this day  i heard not without concern that the neighboring industry of lynn was penetrating salem and that the ancient haunt of the witches and the birthplace of our subtlest and somberest wizard was becoming a great shoetown but my concern was less for its memories and sensibilities than for an odious duty which i owed that industry together with all the others in new england  before i left home i had promised my earliest publisher that i would undertake to edit or compile or do something literary to a work on the operation of the more distinctive mechanical inventions of our country which he had conceived the notion of publishing by subscription  he had furnished me the most immechanical of humankind with a letter addressed generally to the great mills and factories of the east entreating their managers to unfold their mysteries to me for the purposes of this volume  his letter had the effect of shutting up some of them like clams and others it put upon their guard against my researches lest i should seize the secret of their special inventions and publish it to the world  i could not tell the managers that i was both morally and mentally incapable of this that they might have explained and demonstrated the properties and functions of their most recondite machinery and upon examination afterwards found me guiltless of having anything but a few verses of heine or tennyson or longfellow in my head  so i had to suffer in several places from their unjust anxieties and from my own weariness of their ingenious engines or else endure the pangs of a bad conscience from ignoring them  as long as i was in canada i was happy for there was no industry in canada that i saw except that of the peasant girls in their evangeline hats and kirtles tossing the hay in the wayside fields but when i reached portland my troubles began  i went with that young minister of whom i have spoken to a large foundry where they were casting some sort of ironmongery and inspected the process from a distance beyond any chance spurt of the molten metal and came away sadly uncertain of putting the rather fine spectacle to any practical use a manufactory where they did something with coaloil which i now heard for the first time called kerosene refused itself to me and i said to myself that probably all the other industries of portland were as reserved and i would not seek to explore them but when i got to salem my conscience stirred again  if i knew that there were shoeshops in salem ought not i to go and inspect their processes  this was a question which would not answer itself to my satisfaction and i had no peace till i learned that i could see shoemaking much better at lynn and that lynn was such a little way from boston that i could readily run up there if i did not wish to examine the shoe machinery at once i promised myself that i would run up from boston but in order to do this i must first go to boston     vii  i am supposing still that i saw salem before i saw boston but however the fact may be i am sure that i decided it would be better to see shoemaking in lynn where i really did see it thirty years later  for the purposes of the present visit i contented myself with looking at a machine in haverhill which chewed a shoe sole full of pegs and dropped it out of its iron jaws with an indifference as great as my own and probably as little sense of how it had done its work  i may be unjust to that machine heaven knows i would not wrong it and i must confess that my head had no room in it for the conception of any machinery but the mythological which also i despised in my revulsion from the eighteenth century poets to those of my own day  i cannot quite make out after the lapse of so many years just how or when i got to haverhill or whether it was before or after i had been in salem  there is an apparitional quality in my presences at this point or that in the dim past but i hope that for the credit of their order ghosts are not commonly taken with such trivial things as i was  for instance in haverhill i was much interested by the sight of a young man coming gayly down the steps of the hotel where i lodged in pegtop trousers so much more peg top than my own that i seemed to be wearing mere springbottoms in comparison and in a day when every one who respected himself had a necktie as narrow as he could get this youth had one no wider than a shoestring and red at that while mine measured almost an inch and was black  to be sure he was one of a band of negro minstrels who were to give a concert that night and he had a light to excel in fashion  i will suppose for convenience sake that i visited haverhill too before i reached boston somehow that shoepegging machine must come in and it may as well come in here  when i actually found myself in boston there were perhaps industries which it would have been well for me to celebrate but i either made believe there were none or else i honestly forgot all about them  in either case i released myself altogether to the literary and historical associations of the place  i need not say that i gave myself first to the first and it rather surprised me to find that the literary associations of boston referred so largely to cambridge  i did not know much about cambridge except that it was the seat of the university where lowell was and longfellow had been professor and somehow i had not realized it as the home of these poets that was rather stupid of me but it is best to own the truth and afterward i came to know the place so well that i may safely confess my earlier ignorance  i had stopped in boston at the tremont house which was still one of the first hostelries of the country and i must have inquired my way to cambridge there but i was sceptical of the direction the cambridge horsecar took when i found it and i hinted to the driver my anxieties as to why he should be starting east when i had been told that cambridge was west of boston  he reassured me in the laconic and sarcastic manner of his kind and we really reached cambridge by the route he had taken  the beautiful elms that shaded great part of the way massed themselves in the groves of academe at the square and showed pleasant glimpses of old harvards scholar factories red then far fewer than now  it must have been in vacation for i met no one as i wandered through the college yard trying to make up my mind as to how i should learn where lowell lived for it was he whom i had come to find  he had not only taken the poems i sent him but he had printed two of them in a single number of the atlantic and had even written me a little note about them which i wore next my heart in my breast pocket till i almost wore it out and so i thought i might fitly report myself to him  but i have always been helpless in finding my way and i was still depressed by my failure to convince the horsecar driver that he had taken the wrong road  i let several people go by without questioning them and those i did ask abashed me farther by not knowing what i wanted to know  when i had remitted my search for the moment an ancient man with an open mouth and an inquiring eye whom i never afterwards made out in cambridge addressed me with a hospitable offer to show me the washington elm i thought this would give me time to embolden myself for the meeting with the editor of the atlantic if i should ever find him and i went with that kind old man who when he had shown me the tree and the spot where washington stood when he took command of the continental forces said that he had a branch of it and that if i would come to his house with him he would give me a piece  in the end i meant merely to flatter him into telling me where i could find lowell but i dissembled my purpose and pretended a passion for a piece of the historic elm and the old man led me not only to his house but his woodhouse where he sawed me off a block so generous that i could not get it into my pocket  i feigned the gratitude which i could see that he expected and then i took courage to put my question to him  perhaps that patriarch lived only in the past and cared for history and not literature  he confessed that he could not tell me where to find lowell but he did not forsake me he set forth with me upon the street again and let no man pass without asking him in the end we met one who was able to say where mr lowell was and i found him at last in a little study at the rear of a pleasant oldfashioned house near the delta  lowell was not then at the height of his fame he had just reached this thirty years after when he died but i doubt if he was ever after a greater power in his own country or more completely embodied the literary aspiration which would not and could not part itself from the love of freedom and the hope of justice  for the sake of these he had been willing to suffer the reproach which followed their friends in the earlier days of the antislavery struggle he had outlived the reproach long before but the fear of his strength remained with those who had felt it and he had not made himself more generally loved by the fable for critics than by the biglow papers probably  but in the vision of sir launfal and the legend of brittany he had won a liking if not a listening far wider than his humor and his wit had got him and in his lectures on the english poets given not many years before he came to the charge of the atlantic he had proved himself easily the wisest and finest critic in our language  he was already more than any american poet                 dowered with the hate of hate the scorn of scorn                                    the love of love  and he held a place in the public sense which no other author among us has held  i had myself never been a great reader of his poetry when i met him though when i was a boy of ten years i had heard my father repeat passages from the biglow papers against war and slavery and the war for slavery upon mexico and later i had read those criticisms of english poetry and i knew sir launfal must be lowell in some sort but my love for him as a poet was chiefly centred in my love for his tender rhyme auf wiedersehen which i can not yet read without something of the young pathos it first stirred in me  i knew and felt his greatness some how apart from the literary proofs of it he ruled my fancy and held my allegiance as a character as a man and i am neither sorry nor ashamed that i was abashed when i first came into his presence and that in spite of his words of welcome i sat inwardly quaking before him  he was then fortyone years old and nineteen my senior and if there had been nothing else to awe me i might well have been quelled by the disparity of our ages  but i have always been willing and even eager to do homage to men who have done something and notably to men who have done something  in the sort i wished to do something in myself  i could never recognize any other sort of superiority but that i am proud to recognize and i had before lowell some such feeling as an obscure subaltern might have before his general  he was by nature a bit of a disciplinarian and the effect was from him as well as in me i dare say he let me feel whatever difference there was as helplessly as i felt it at the first encounter with people he always was apt to have a certain frosty shyness a smiling cold as from the long highsunned winters of his puritan race he was not quite himself till he had made you aware of his quality then no one could be sweeter tenderer warmer than he then he made you free of his whole heart but you must be his captive before he could do that  his whole personality had now an instant charm for me i could not keep my eyes from those beautiful eyes of his which had a certain starry serenity and looked out so purely from under his white forehead shadowed with auburn hair untouched by age or from the smile that shaped the auburn beard and gave the face in its form and color the christlook which pages portrait has flattered in it  his voice had as great a fascination for me as his face  the vibrant tenderness and the crisp clearness of the tones the perfect modulation the clear enunciation the exquisite accent the elect dictioni did not know enough then to know that these were the gifts these were the graces of one from whose tongue our rough english came music such as i should never hear from any other  in this speech there was nothing of our slipshod american slovenliness but a truly italian conscience and an artistic sense of beauty in the instrument  i saw before he sat down across his writingtable from me that he was not far from the medium height but his erect carriage made the most of his five feet and odd inches  he had been smoking the pipe he loved and he put it back in his mouth presently as if he found himself at greater ease with it when he began to chat or rather to let me show what manner of young man i was by giving me the first word  i told him of the trouble i had in finding him and i could not help dragging in something about heines search for borne when he went to see him in frankfort but i felt at once this was a false start for lowell was such an impassioned lover of cambridge which was truly his patria in the italian sense that it must have hurt him to be unknown to any one in it he said a little dryly that he should not have thought i would have so much difficulty but he added forgivingly that this was not his own house which he was out of for the time  then he spoke to me of heine and when i showed my ardor for him he sought to temper it with some judicious criticisms and told me that he had kept the first poem i sent him for the long time it had been unacknowledged to make sure that it was not a translation  he asked me about myself and my name and its welsh origin and seemed to find the vanity i had in this harmless enough when i said i had tried hard to believe that i was at least the literary descendant of sir james howels he corrected me gently with james howel and took down a volume of the familiar letters from the shelves behind him to prove me wrong  this was always his habit as i found afterwards when he quoted anything from a book he liked to get it and read the passage over as if he tasted a kind of hoarded sweetness in the words  it visibly vexed him if they showed him in the least mistaken but                 the love he bore to learning was at fault  for this foible and that other of setting people right if he thought them wrong  i could not assert myself against his version of howelss name for my edition of his letters was far away in ohio and i was obliged to own that the name was spelt in several different ways in it he perceived no doubt why i had chosen the form liked my own with the title which the pleasant old turncoat ought to have had from the many masters he served according to their many minds but never had except from that erring edition  he did not afflict me for it though probably it amused him too much he asked me about the west and when he found that i was as proud of the west as i was of wales he seemed even better pleased and said he had always fancied that human nature was laid out on rather a larger scale there than in the east but he had seen very little of the west  in my heart i did not think this then and i do not think it now human nature has had more ground to spread over in the west that is all but it was not for me to bandy words with my sovereign  he said he liked to hear of the differences between the different sections for what we had most to fear in our country was a wearisome sameness of type  he did not say now or at any other time during the many years i knew him any of those slighting things of the west which i had so often to suffer from eastern people but suffered me to praise it all i would  he asked me what way i had taken in coming to new england and when i told him and began to rave of the beauty and quaintness of french canada and to pour out my joy in quebec he said with a smile that had now lost all its frost yes quebec was a bit of the seventeenth century it was in many ways more french than france and its people spoke the language of voltaire with the accent of voltaires time  i do not remember what else he talked of though once i remembered it with what i believed an ineffaceable distinctness  i set nothing of it down at the time i was too busy with the letters i was writing for a cincinnati paper and i was severely bent upon keeping all personalities out of them  this was very well but i could wish now that i had transgressed at least so far as to report some of the things that lowell said for the paper did not print my letters and it would have been perfectly safe and very useful for the present purpose  but perhaps he did not say anything very memorable to do that you must have something positive in your listener and i was the mere response the hollow echo that youth must be in like circumstances  i was all the time afraid of wearing my welcome out and i hurried to go when i would so gladly have staid  i do not remember where i meant to go or why he should have undertaken to show me the way acrosslots but this was what he did and when we came to a fence which i clambered gracelessly over he put his hands on the top and tried to take it at a bound  he tried twice and then laughed at his failure but not with any great pleasure and he was not content till a third trial carried him across  then he said i commonly do that the first time as if it were a frequent habit with him while i remained discreetly silent and for that moment at least felt myself the elder of the man who had so much of the boy in him  he had indeed much of the boy in him to the last and he parted with each hour of his youth reluctantly pathetically     viii  we walked across what must have been jarvis field to what must have been north avenue and there he left me  but before he let me go he held my hand while he could say that he wished me to dine with him only he was not in his own house and he would ask me to dine with him at the parker house in boston and would send me word of the time later  i suppose i may have spent part of the intervening time in viewing the wonders of boston and visiting the historic scenes and places in it and about it  i certainly went over to charleston and ascended bunker hill monument and explored the navyyard where the immemorial manofwar begun in jacksons time was then silently stretching itself under its long shed in a poetic arrest as if the failure of the appropriation for its completion had been some kind of enchantment  in boston i early presented my letter of credit to the publisher it was drawn upon not that i needed money at the moment but from a young eagerness to see if it would be honored and a literary attache of the house kindly went about with me and showed me the life of the city  a great city it seemed to me then and a seething vortex of business as well as a whirl of gaiety as i saw it in washington street and in a promenade concert at copelands restaurant in tremont row  probably i brought some idealizing force to bear upon it for i was not all so strange to the world as i must seem perhaps i accounted for quality as well as quantity in my impressions of the new england metropolis and aggrandized it in the ratio of its literary importance  it seemed to me old even after quebec and very likely i credited the actual town with all the dead and gone bostonians in my sentimental census  if i did not it was no fault of my cicerone who thought even more of the city he showed me than i did  i do not know now who he was and i never saw him after i came to live there with any certainty that it was he though i was often tormented with the vision of a spectacled face like his but not like enough to warrant me in addressing him  he became part of that ghostly boston of my first visit which would sometimes return and possess again the city i came to know so familiarly in later years and to be so passionately interested in  some color of my prime impressions has tinged the fictitious experiences of people in my books but i find very little of it in my memory  this is like a web of frayed old lace which i have to take carefully into my hold for fear of its fragility and make out as best i can the figure once so distinct in it  there are the narrow streets stretching saltworks to the docks which i haunted for their quaintness and there is faunal hall which i cared to see so much more because wendell phillips had spoken in it than because otis and adams had  there is the old colonial house and there is the state house which i dare say i explored with the common sloping before it  there is beacon street with the hancock house where it is incredibly no more and there are the beginnings of commonwealth avenue and the other streets of the back bay laid out with their basements left hollowed in the made land which the gravel trains were yet making out of the westward hills  there is the public garden newly planned and planted but without the massive bridge destined to make so ungratefully little of the lake that occasioned it  but it is all very vague and i could easily believe now that it was some one else who saw it then in my place  i think that i did not try to see cambridge the same day that i saw lowell but wisely came back to my hotel in boston and tried to realize the fact  i went out another day with an acquaintance from ohio whom i ran upon in the street  we went to mount auburn together and i viewed its monuments with a reverence which i dare say their artistic quality did not merit  but i am not sorry for this for perhaps they are not quite so bad as some people pretend  the gothic chapel of the cemetery unsorted as it was gave me with its halfdozen statues standing or sitting about an emotion such as i am afraid i could not receive now from the acropolis westminster abbey and santa crocea in one  i tried hard for some aesthetic sense of it and i made believe that i thought this thing and that thing in the place moved me with its fitness or beauty but the truth is that i had no taste in anything but literature and did not feel the effect i would so willingly have experienced  i did genuinely love the elmy quiet of the dear old cambridge streets though and i had a real and instant pleasure in the yellow colonial houses with their white corners and casements and their green blinds that lurked behind the shrubbery of the avenue i passed through to mount auburn  the most beautiful among them was the most interesting for me for it was the house of longfellow my companion who had seen it before pointed it out to me with an air of custom and i would not let him see that i valued the first sight of it as i did  i had hoped that somehow i might be so favored as to see longfellow himself but when i asked about him of those who knew they said oh he is at nahant and i thought that nahant must be a great way off and at any rate i did not feel authorized to go to him there  neither did i go to see the author of the amber gods who lived at newburyport i was told as if i should know where newburyport was i did not know and i hated to ask  besides it did not seem so simple as it had seemed in ohio to go and see a young lady simply because i was infatuated with her literature even as the envoy of all the infatuated young people of columbus i could not quite do this and when i got home i had to account for my failure as best i could  another failure of mine was the sight of whittier which i then very much longed to have  they said oh whittier lives at amesbury but that put him at an indefinite distance and without the introduction i never would ask for i found it impossible to set out in quest of him in the end i saw no one in new england whom i was not presented to in the regular way except lowell whom i thought i had a right to call upon in my quality of contributor and from the acquaintance i had with him by letter  i neither praise nor blame myself for this it was my shyness that with held me rather than my merit  there is really no harm in seeking the presence of a famous man and i doubt if the famous man resents the wish of people to look upon him without some measure great or little of affectation  there are bores everywhere but he is likelier to find them in the wonted figures of society than in those young people or old people who come to him in the love of what he has done  i am well aware how furiously tennyson sometimes met his worshippers and how insolently carlyle but i think these facts are little specks in their sincerity  our own gentler and honester celebrities did not forbid approach and i have known some of them caress adorers who seemed hardly worthy of their kindness but that was better than to have hurt any sensitive spirit who had ventured too far by the rules that govern us with common men     ix  my business relations were with the house that so promptly honored my letter of credit  this house had published in the east the campaign life of lincoln which i had lately written and i dare say would have published the volume of poems i had written earlier with my friend piatt if there had been any public for it at least i saw large numbers of the book on the counters  but all my literary affiliations were with ticknor  fields and it was the old corner bookstore on washington street that drew my heart as soon as i had replenished my pocket in cornhill  after verifying the editor of the atlantic monthly i wised to verify its publishers and it very fitly happened that when i was shown into mr fieldss little room at the back of the store with its window looking upon school street and its scholarly keeping in books and prints he had just got the magazine sheets of a poem of mine from the cambridge printers  he was then lately from abroad and he had the zest for american things which a foreign sojourn is apt to renew in us though i did not know this then and could not account for it in the kindness he expressed for my poem  he introduced me to mr ticknor who i fancied had not read my poem but he seemed to know what it was from the junior partner and he asked me whether i had been paid for it  i confessed that i had not and then he got out a chamoisleather bag and took from it five halfeagles in gold and laid them on the green cloth top of the desk in much the shape and of much the size of the great bear  i have never since felt myself paid so lavishly for any literary work though i have had more for a single piece than the twentyfive dollars that dazzled me in this constellation  the publisher seemed aware of the poetic character of the transaction he let the pieces lie a moment before he gathered them up and put them into my hand and said i always think it is pleasant to have it in gold  but a terrible experience with the poem awaited me and quenched for the moment all my pleasure and pride  it was the pilots story which i suppose has had as much acceptance as anything of mine in verse i do not boast of a vast acceptance for it and i had attempted to treat in it a phase of the national tragedy of slavery as i had imagined it on a mississippi steamboat  a young planter has gambled away the slavegirl who is the mother of his child and when he tells her she breaks out upon him with the demand       what will you say to our boy when he cries for me there in saint      louis  i had thought this very well and natural and simple but a fatal proofreader had not thought it well enough or simple and natural enough and he had made the line read       what will you say to our boy when he cries for ma there in saint      louis  he had even had the inspiration to quote the word he preferred to the one i had written so that there was no merciful possibility of mistaking it for a misprint and my blood froze in my veins at sight of it  mr fields had given me the sheets to read while he looked over some letters and he either felt the chill of my horror or i made some sign or sound of dismay that caught his notice for he looked round at me  i could only show him the passage with a gasp  i dare say he might have liked to laugh for it was cruelly funny but he did not he was concerned for the magazine as well as for me  he declared that when he first read the line he had thought i could not have written it so and he agreed with me that it would kill the poem if it came out in that shape  he instantly set about repairing the mischief so far as could be  he found that the whole edition of that sheet had been printed and the air blackened round me again lighted up here and there with baleful flashes of the newspaper wit at my cost which i previsioned in my misery i knew what i should have said of such a thing myself if it had been anothers  but the publisher at once decided that the sheet must be reprinted and i went away weak as if in the escape from some deadly peril  afterwards it appeared that the line had passed the first proofreader as i wrote it but that the final reader had entered so sympathetically into the realistic intention of my poem as to contribute the modification which had nearly been my end     x  as it fell out i lived without farther difficulty to the day and hour of the dinner lowell made for me and i really think looking at myself impersonally and remembering the sort of young fellow i was that it would have been a great pity if i had not  the dinner was at the oldfashioned boston hour of two and the table was laid for four people in some little upper room at parkers which i was never afterwards able to make sure of  lowell was already there when i came and he presented me to my inexpressible delight and surprise to dr holmes who was there with him  holmes was in the most brilliant hour of that wonderful second youth which his fame flowered into long after the world thought he had completed the cycle of his literary life  he had already received full recognition as a poet of delicate wit nimble humor airy imagination and exquisite grace when the autocrat papers advanced his name indefinitely beyond the bounds which most immortals would have found range enough  the marvel of his invention was still fresh in the minds of men and time had not dulled in any measure the sense of its novelty his readers all fondly identified him with his work and i fully expected to find myself in the autocrats presence when i met dr  holmes  but the fascination was none the less for that reason and the winning smile the wise and humorous glance the whole genial manner was as important to me as if i had foreboded something altogether different  i found him physically of the napoleonic height which spiritually overtops the alps and i could look into his face without that unpleasant effort which giants of inferior mind so often cost the man of five feet four  a little while after fields came in and then our number and my pleasure were complete  nothing else so richly satisfactory indeed as the whole affair could have happened to a like youth at such a point in his career and when i sat down with doctor holmes and mr fields on lowells right i felt through and through the dramatic perfection of the event  the kindly autocrat recognized some such quality of it in terms which were not the less precious and gracious for their humorous excess  i have no reason to think that he had yet read any of my poor verses or had me otherwise than wholly on trust from lowell but he leaned over towards his host and said with a laughing look at me well james this is something like the apostolic succession this is the laying on of hands  i took his sweet and caressing irony as he meant it but the charm of it went to my head long before any drop of wine together with the charm of hearing him and lowell calling each other james and wendell and of finding them still cordially boys together  i would gladly have glimmered before those great lights in the talk that followed if i could have thought of anything brilliant to say but i could not and so i let them shine without a ray of reflected splendor from me  it was such talk as i had of course never heard before and it is not saying enough to say that i have never heard such talk since except from these two men  it was as light and kind as it was deep and true and it ranged over a hundred things with a perpetual sparkle of doctor holmess wit and the constant glow of lowells incandescent sense  from time to time fields came in with one of his delightful stories sketches of character they were which he sometimes did not mind caricaturing or with some criticism of the literary situation from his standpoint of both lover and publisher of books  i heard fames that i had accepted as proofs of power treated as factitious and witnessed a frankness concerning authorship far and near that i had not dreamed of authors using  when doctor holmes understood that i wrote for the saturday press which was running amuck among some bostonian immortalities of the day he seemed willing that i should know they were not thought so very undying in boston and that i should not take the notion of a mutual admiration society too seriously or accept the new york bohemian view of boston as true  for the most part the talk did not address itself to me but became an exchange of thoughts and fancies between himself and lowell  they touched i remember on certain matters of technique and the doctor confessed that he had a prejudice against some words that he could not overcome for instance he said nothing could induce him to use neath for beneath no exigency of versification or stress of rhyme  lowell contended that he would use any word that carried his meaning and i think he did this to the hurt of some of his earlier things  he was then probably in the revolt against too much literature in literature which every one is destined sooner or later to share there was a certain roughness very like crudeness which he indulged before his thought and phrase mellowed to one music in his later work  i tacitly agreed rather with the doctor though i did not swerve from my allegiance to lowell and if i had spoken i should have sided with him i would have given that or any other proof of my devotion fields casually mentioned that he thought the dandelion was the most popularly liked of lowells briefer poems and i made haste to say that i thought so too though i did not really think anything about it and then i was sorry for i could see that the poet did not like it quite and i felt that i was duly punished for my dishonesty  hawthorne was named among other authors probably by fields whose house had just published his marble faun and who had recently come home on the same steamer with him  doctor holmes asked if i had met hawthorne yet and when i confessed that i had hardly yet even hoped for such a thing he smiled his winning smile and said ah well i dont know that you will ever feel you have really met him  he is like a dim room with a little taper of personality burning on the corner of the mantel  they all spoke of hawthorne and with the same affection but the same sense of something mystical and remote in him and every word was priceless to me  but these masters of the craft i was prentice to probably could not have said anything that i should not have found wise and well and i am sure now i should have been the loser if the talk had shunned any of the phases of human nature which it touched  it is best to find that all men are of the same make and that there are certain universal things which interest them as much as the supernal things and amuse them even more  there was a saying of lowells which he was fond of repeating at the menace of any form of the transcendental and he liked to warn himself and others with his homely remember the dinnerbell  what i recall of the whole effect of a time so happy for me is that in all that was said however high however fine we were never out of hearing of the dinnerbell and perhaps this is the best effect i can leave with the reader  it was the first dinner served in courses that i had sat down to and i felt that this service gave it a romantic importance which the older fashion of the west still wanted even at governor chases table in columbus the governor carved i knew of the dinner a la russe as it was then called only from books and it was a sort of literary flavor that i tasted in the successive dishes when it came to the black coffee and then to the petits verres of cognac with lumps of sugar set fire to atop it was something that so far transcended my homekept experience that it began to seem altogether visionary  neither fields nor doctor holmes smoked and i had to confess that i did not but lowell smoked enough for all three and the spark of his cigar began to show in the waning light before we rose from the table  the time that never had nor can ever have its fellow for me had to come to an end as all times must and when i shook hands with lowell in parting he overwhelmed me by saying that if i thought of going to concord he would send me a letter to hawthorne  i was not to see lowell again during my stay in boston but doctor holmes asked me to tea for the next evening and fields said i must come to breakfast with him in the morning     xi  i recall with the affection due to his friendly nature and to the kindness afterwards to pass between us for many years the whole aspect of the publisher when i first saw him  his abundant hair and his full beard as broad as ony spade that flowed from his throat in homeric curls were touched with the first frost  he had a fine color and his eyes as keen as they were kind twinkled restlessly above the wholesome russetred of his cheeks  his portly frame was clad in those scotch tweeds which had not yet displaced the traditional broadcloth with us in the west though i had sent to new york for a rough suit and so felt myself not quite unworthy to meet a man fresh from the hands of the london tailor  otherwise i stood as much in awe of him as his jovial soul would let me and if i might i should like to suggest to the literary youth of this day some notion of the importance of his name to the literary youth of my day  he gave aesthetic character to the house of ticknor  fields but he was by no means a silent partner on the economic side  no one can forecast the fortune of a new book but he knew as well as any publisher can know not only whether a book was good but whether the reader would think so and i suppose that his house made as few bad guesses along with their good ones as any house that ever tried the uncertain temper of the public with its ventures  in the minds of all who loved the plain brown cloth and tasteful print of its issues he was more or less intimately associated with their literature and those who were not mistaken in thinking de quincey one of the delightfulest authors in the world were especially grateful to the man who first edited his writings in book form and proud that this edition was the effect of american sympathy with them  at that day i believed authorship the noblest calling in the world and i should still be at a loss to name any nobler the great authors i had met were to me the sum of greatness and if i could not rank their publisher with them by virtue of equal achievement i handsomely brevetted him worthy of their friendship and honored him in the visible measure of it  in his house beside the charles and in the close neighborhood of doctor holmes i found an odor and an air of books such as i fancied might belong to the famous literary houses of london  it is still there that friendly home of lettered refinement and the gracious spirit which knew how to welcome me and make the least of my shyness and strangeness and the most of the little else there was in me illumines it still though my host of that rapturous moment has many years been of those who are only with us unseen and unheard  i remember his burlesque pretence that morning of an inextinguishable grief when i owned that i had never eaten blueberry cake before and how he kept returning to the pathos of the fact that there should be a region of the earth where blueberry cake was unknown  we breakfasted in the pretty room whose windows look out through leaves and flowers upon the rivers coming and going tides and whose walls were covered with the faces and the autographs of all the contemporary poets and novelists  the fieldses had spent some days with tennyson in their recent english sojourn and mrs fields had much to tell of him how he looked how he smoked how he read aloud and how he said when he asked her to go with him to the tower of his house come up and see the sad english sunset which had an instant value to me such as some rich verse of his might have had  i was very new to it all how new i could not very well say but i flattered myself that i breathed in that atmosphere as if in the return from lifelong exile  still i patriotically bragged of the west a little and i told them proudly that in columbus no book since uncle toms cabin had sold so well as the marble faun  this made the effect that i wished but whether it was true or not heaven knows i only know that i heard it from our leading bookseller and i made no question of it myself  after breakfast fields went away to the office and i lingered while mrs fields showed me from shelf to shelf in the library and dazzled me with the sight of authors copies and volumes invaluable with the autographs and the pencilled notes of the men whose names were dear to me from my love of their work  everywhere was some souvenir of the living celebrities my hosts had met and whom had they not met in that english sojourn in days before england embittered herself to us during our civil war  not tennyson only but thackeray but dickens but charles reade but carlyle but many a minor fame was in my ears from converse so recent with them that it was as if i heard their voices in their echoed words  i do not remember how long i stayed i remember i was afraid of staying too long and so i am sure i did not stay as long as i should have liked but i have not the least notion how i got away and i am not certain where i spent the rest of a day that began in the clouds but had to be ended on the common earth  i suppose i gave it mostly to wandering about the city and partly to recording my impressions of it for that newspaper which never published them  the summer weather in boston with its sunny heat struck through and through with the coolness of the sea and its clear air untainted with a breath of smoke i have always loved but it had then a zest unknown before and i should have thought it enough simply to be alive in it  but everywhere i came upon something that fed my famine for the old the quaint the picturesque and however the day passed it was a banquet a festival  i can only recall my breathless first sight of the public library and of the athenaeum gallery great sights then which the vatican and the pitti hardly afterwards eclipsed for mere emotion  in fact i did not see these elder treasuries of literature and art between breakfasting with the autocrats publisher in the morning and taking tea with the autocrat himself in the evening and that made a whole worlds difference     xii  the tea of that simpler time is wholly inconceivable to this generation which knows the thing only as a mild form of afternoon reception but i suppose that in 1860 very few dined late in our whole pastoral republic tea was the meal people asked people to when they wished to sit at long leisure and large ease it came at the end of the day at six oclock or seven and one went to it in morning dress  it had an unceremonied domesticity in the abundance of its light dishes and i fancy these did not vary much from east to west except that we had a southern touch in our fried chicken and corn bread but at the autocrats tea table the cheering cup had a flavor unknown to me before that day  he asked me if i knew it and i said it was english breakfast tea for i had drunk it at the publishers in the morning and was willing not to seem strange to it  ah yes he said but this is the flower of the souchong it is the blossom the poetry of tea and then he told me how it had been given him by a friend a merchant in the china trade which used to flourish in boston and was the poetry of commerce as this delicate beverage was of tea  that commerce is long past and i fancy that the plant ceased to bloom when the traffic fell into decay  the autocrats windows had the same outlook upon the charles as the publishers and after tea we went up into a back parlor of the same orientation and saw the sunset die over the water and the westering flats and hills  nowhere else in the world has the day a lovelier close and our talk took something of the mystic coloring that the heavens gave those mantling expanses  it was chiefly his talk but i have always found the best talkers are willing that you should talk if you like and a quick sympathy and a subtle sense met all that i had to say from him and from the unbroken circle of kindred intelligences about him  i saw him then in the midst of his family and perhaps never afterwards to better advantage or in a finer mood  we spoke of the things that people perhaps once liked to deal with more than they do now of the intimations of immortality of the experiences of morbid youth and of all those messages from the tremulous nerves which we take for prophecies  i was not ashamed before his tolerant wisdom to acknowledge the effects that had lingered so long with me in fancy and even in conduct from a time of broken health and troubled spirit and i remember the exquisite tact in him which recognized them as things common to all however peculiar in each which left them mine for whatever obscure vanity i might have in them and yet gave me the companionship of the whole race in their experience  we spoke of forebodings and presentiments we approached the mystic confines of the world from which no traveller has yet returned with a passport en regle and properly vise and he held his light course through these filmy impalpabilities with a charming sincerity with the scientific conscience that refuses either to deny the substance of things unseen or to affirm it  in the gathering dusk so weird did my fortune of being there and listening to him seem that i might well have been a blessed ghost for all the reality i felt in myself  i tried to tell him how much i had read him from my boyhood and with what joy and gain and he was patient of these futilities and i have no doubt imagined the love that inspired them and accepted that instead of the poor praise  when the sunset passed and the lamps were lighted and we all came back to our dear little firmset earth he began to question me about my native region of it  from many forgotten inquiries i recall his asking me what was the fashionable religion in columbus or the church that socially corresponded to the unitarian church in boston he had first to clarify my intelligence as towhat unitarianism was we had universalists but not unitarians but when i understood i answered from such vantage as my own wholly outside swedenborgianism gave me that i thought most of the most respectable people with us were of the presbyterian church some were certainly episcopalians but upon the whole the largest number were presbyterians  he found that very strange indeed and said that he did not believe there was a presbyterian church in boston that the new england calvinists were all of the orthodox church  he had to explain oxthodoxy to me and then i could confess to one congregational church in columbus  probably i failed to give the autocrat any very clear image of our social frame in the west but the fault was altogether mine if i did  such lecturing tours as he had made had not taken him among us as those of emerson and other newenglanders had and my report was positive rather than comparative  i was full of pride in journalism at that day and i dare say that i vaunted the brilliancy and power of our newspapers more than they merited i should not have been likely to wrong them otherwise it is strange that in all the talk i had with him and lowell or rather heard from them i can recall nothing said of political affairs though lincoln had then been nominated by the republicans and the civil war had practically begun  but we did not imagine such a thing in the north we rested secure in the belief that if lincoln were elected the south would eat all its fiery words perhaps from the mere love and inveterate habit of fireeating  i rent myself away from the autocrats presence as early as i could and as my evening had been too full of happiness to sleep upon at once i spent the rest of the night till two in the morning wandering about the streets and in the common with a harvard senior whom i had met  he was a youth of like literary passions with myself but of such different traditions in every possible way that his deeply schooled and definitely regulated life seemed as anomalous to me as my own desultory and selffound way must have seemed to him  we passed the time in the delight of trying to make ourselves known to each other and in a promise to continue by letter the effort which duly lapsed into silent patience with the necessarily insoluble problem     xiii  i must have lingered in boston for the introduction to hawthorne which lowell had offered me for when it came with a little note of kindness and counsel for myself such as only lowell had the gift of writing it was already so near sunday that i stayed over till monday before i started  i do not recall what i did with the time except keep myself from making it a burden to the people i knew and wandering about the city alone  nothing of it remains to me except the fortune that favored me that sunday night with a view of the old granary buryingground on tremont street  i found the gates open and i explored every path in the place wreaking myself in such meagre emotion as i could get from the tomb of the franklin family and rejoicing with the whole soul of my western modernity in the evidence of a remote antiquity which so many of the dim inscriptions afforded  i do not think that i have ever known anything practically older than these monuments though i have since supped so full of classic and mediaeval ruin  i am sure that i was more deeply touched by the epitaph of a poor little puritan maiden who died at sixteen in the early sixteenthirties than afterwards by the tomb of caecilia metella and that the heartache which i tried to put into verse when i got back to my room in the hotel was none the less genuine because it would not lend itself to my literary purpose and remains nothing but pathos to this day  i am not able to say how i reached the town of lowell where i went before going to concord that i might ease the unhappy conscience i had about those factories which i hated so much to see and have it clean for the pleasure of meeting the fabricator of visions whom i was authorized to molest in any aircastle where i might find him  i only know that i went to lowell and visited one of the great mills which with their whirring spools the ceaseless flight of their shuttles and the bewildering sight and sound of all their mechanism have since seemed to me the death of the joy that ought to come from work if not the captivity of those who tended them  but then i thought it right and well for me to be standing by                 with sick and scornful looks averse  while these others toiled i did not see the tragedy in it and i got my pitiful literary antipathy away as soon as i could no wiser for the sight of the ingenious contrivances i inspected and i am sorry to say no sadder  in the cool of the evening i sat at the door of my hotel and watched the long files of the workworn factorygirls stream by with no concern for them but to see which was pretty and which was plain and with no dream of a truer order than that which gave them ten hours work a day in those hideous mills and lodged them in the barracks where they rested from their toil  i wonder if there is a stage that still runs between lowell and concord past meadow walls and under the caressing boughs of wayside elms and through the birdhaunted gloom of woodland roads in the freshness of the summer morning  by a blessed chance i found that there was such a stage in 1860 and i took it from my hotel instead of going back to boston and up to concord as i must have had to do by train  the journey gave me the intimacy of the new england country as i could have had it in no other fashion and for the first time i saw it in all the summer sweetness which i have often steeped my soul in since  the meadows were newly mown and the air was fragrant with the grass stretching in long winrows among the brown bowlders or capped with canvas in the little haycocks it had been gathered into the day before  i was fresh from the affluent farms of the western reserve and this care of the grass touched me with a rude pity which i also bestowed on the meagre fields of corn and wheat but still the land was lovelier than any i had ever seen with its old farmhouses and brambled gray stone walls its stony hillsides its staggering orchards its wooded tops and its thickbrackened valleys from west to east the difference was as great as i afterwards found it from america to europe and my impression of something quaint and strange was no keener when i saw old england the next year than when i saw new england now  i had imagined the landscape bare of trees and i was astonished to find it almost as full of them as at home though they all looked very little as they well might to eyes used to the primeval forests of ohio  the road ran through them from time to time and took their coolness on its smooth hard reaches and then issued again in the glisten of the open fields  i made phrases to myself about the scenery as we drove along and yes i suppose i made phrases about the young girl who was one of the inside passengers and who when the common strangeness had somewhat worn off began to sing and sang most of the way to concord  perhaps she was not very sage and i am sure she was not of the caste of vere de vere but she was pretty enough and she had a voice of a birdlike tunableness so that i would not have her out of the memory of that pleasant journey if i could  she was long ago an elderly woman if she lives and i suppose she would not now point out her fellowpassenger if he strolled in the evening by the house where she had dismounted upon her arrival in concord and laugh and pull another girl away from the window in the high excitement of the prodigious adventure     xv  her fellowpassenger was in far other excitement he was to see hawthorne and in a manner to meet priscilla and zenobia and hester prynne and little pearl and miriam and hilda and hollingsworth and coverdale and chillingworth and dimmesdale and donatello and kenyon and he had no heart for any such poor little reality as that who could not have been got into any story that one could respect and must have been difficult even in a heinesque poem  i wasted that whole evening and the next morning in fond delaying and it was not until after the indifferent dinner i got at the tavern where i stopped that i found courage to go and present lowells letter to hawthorne  i would almost have foregone meeting the weird genius only to have kept that letter for it said certain infinitely precious things of me with such a sweetness such a grace as lowell alone could give his praise  years afterwards when hawthorne was dead i met mrs hawthorne and told her of the pang i had in parting with it and she sent it me doubly enriched by hawthornes keeping  but now if i were to see him at all i must give up my letter and i carried it in my hand to the door of the cottage he called the wayside  it was never otherwise than a very modest place but the modesty was greater then than today and there was already some preliminary carpentry at one end of the cottage which i saw was to result in an addition to it  i recall pleasant fields across the road before it behind rose a hill wooded with low pines such as is made in septimius felton the scene of the involuntary duel between septimius and the young british officer  i have a sense of the woods coming quite down to the house but if this was so i do not know what to do with a grassy slope which seems to have stretched part way up the hill  as i approached i looked for the tower which the author was fabled to climb into at sight of the coming guest and pull the ladder up after him and i wondered whether he would fly before me in that sort or imagine some easier means of escaping me  the door was opened to my ring by a tall handsome boy whom i suppose to have been mr julian hawthorne and the next moment i found myself in the presence of the romancer who entered from some room beyond  he advanced carrying his head with a heavy forward droop and with a pace for which i decided that the word would be pondering  it was the pace of a bulky man of fifty and his head was that beautiful head we all know from the many pictures of it  but hawthornes look was different from that of any picture of him that i have seen  it was sombre and brooding as the look of such a poet should have been it was the look of a man who had dealt faithfully and therefore sorrowfully with that problem of evil which forever attracted forever evaded hawthorne  it was by no means troubled it was full of a dark repose  others who knew him better and saw him oftener were familiar with other aspects and i remember that one night at longfellows table when one of the guests happened to speak of the photograph of hawthorne which hung in a corner of the room lowell said after a glance at it yes its good but it hasnt his fine accipitral pertaining to the look of a bird of prey hawklike  dw look  in the face that confronted me however there was nothing of keen alertness but only a sort of quiet patient intelligence for which i seek the right word in vain  it was a very regular face with beautiful eyes the mustache still entirely dark was dense over the fine mouth hawthorne was dressed in black and he had a certain effect which i remember of seeming to have on a black cravat with no visible collar he was such a man that if i had ignorantly met him anywhere i should have instantly felt him to be a personage  i must have given him the letter myself for i have no recollection of parting with it before but i only remember his offering me his hand and making me shyly and tentatively welcome  after a few moments of the demoralization which followed his hospitable attempts in me he asked if i would not like to go up on his hill with him and sit there where he smoked in the afternoon  he offered me a cigar and when i said that i did not smoke he lighted it for himself and we climbed the hill together  at the top where there was an outlook in the pines over the concord meadows we found a log and he invited me to a place on it beside him and at intervals of a minute or so he talked while he smoked heaven preserved me from the folly of trying to tell him how much his books had been to me and though we got on rapidly at no time i think we got on better for this interposition  he asked me about lowell i dare say for i told him of my joy in meeting him and doctor holmes and this seemed greatly to interest him  perhaps because he was so lately from europe where our great men are always seen through the wrong end of the telescope he appeared surprised at my devotion and asked me whether i cared as much for meeting them as i should care for meeting the famous english authors  i professed that i cared much more though whether this was true i now have my doubts and i think hawthorne doubted it at the time  but he said nothing in comment and went on to speak generally of europe and america  he was curious about the west which be seemed to fancy much more purely american and said he would like to see some part of the country on which the shadow or if i must be precise the damned shadow of europe had not fallen  i told him i thought the west must finally be characterized by the germans whom we had in great numbers and purely from my zeal for german poetry i tried to allege some proofs of their present influence though i could think of none outside of politics which i thought they affected wholesomely  i knew hawthorne was a democrat and i felt it well to touch politics lightly but he had no more to say about the fateful election then pending than holmes or lowell had  with the abrupt transition of his talk throughout he began somehow to speak of women and said he had never seen a woman whom he thought quite beautiful  in the same way he spoke of the new england temperament and suggested that the apparent coldness in it was also real and that the suppression of emotion for generations would extinguish it at last  then he questioned me as to my knowledge of concord and whether i had seen any of the notable people  i answered that i had met no one but himself as yet but i very much wished to see emerson and thoreau  i did not think it needful to say that i wished to see thoreau quite as much because he had suffered in the cause of john brown as because he had written the books which had taken me and when he said that thoreau prided himself on coming nearer the heart of a pinetree than any other human being i could say honestly enough that i would rather come near the heart of a man  this visibly pleased him and i saw that it did not displease him when he asked whether i was not going to see his next neighbor mr alcott and i confessed that i had never heard of him that surprised as well as pleased him be remarked with whatever intention that there was nothing like recognition to make a man modest and he entered into some account of the philosopher whom i suppose i need not be much ashamed of not knowing then since his influence was of the immediate sort that makes a man important to his townsmen while he is still strange to his countrymen  hawthorne descanted a little upon the landscape and said certain of the pleasant fields below us be longed to him but he preferred his hilltop and if he could have his way those arable fields should be grown up to pines too  he smoked fitfully and slowly and in the hour that we spent together his whiffs were of the desultory and unfinal character of his words  when we went down he asked me into his house again and would have me stay to tea for which we found the table laid  but there was a great deal of silence in it all and at times in spite of his shadowy kindness i felt my spirits sink  after tea he showed me a book case where there were a few books toppling about on the halffilled shelves and said coldly this is my library  i knew that men were his books and though i myself cared for books so much i found it fit and fine that he should care so little or seem to care so little  some of his own romances were among the volumes on these shelves and when i put my finger on the blithedale romance and said that i preferred that to the others his face lighted up and he said that he believed the germans liked that best too  upon the whole we parted such good friends that when i offered to take leave he asked me how long i was to be in concord and not only bade me come to see him again but said he would give me a card to emerson if i liked  i answered of course that i should like it beyond all things and he wrote on the back of his card something which i found when i got away to be i find this young man worthy  the quaintness the little stiffness of it if one pleases to call it so was amusing to one who was not without his sense of humor but the kindness filled me to the throat with joy  in fact i entirely liked hawthorne  he had been as cordial as so shy a man could show himself and i perceived with the repose that nothing else can give the entire sincerity of his soul  nothing could have been further from the behavior of this very great man than any sort of posing apparently or a wish to affect me with a sense of his greatness  i saw that he was as much abashed by our encounter as i was he was visibly shy to the point of discomfort but in no ignoble sense was he conscious and as nearly as he could with one so much his younger he made an absolute equality between us  my memory of him is without alloy one of the finest pleasures of my life  in my heart i paid him the same glad homage that i paid lowell and holmes and he did nothing to make me think that i had overpaid him  this seems perhaps very little to say in his praise but to my mind it is saying everything for i have known but few great men especially of those i met in early life when i wished to lavish my admiration upon them whom i have not the impression of having left in my debt  then a defect of the puritan quality which i have found in many newenglanders is that wittingly or unwittingly they propose themselves to you as an example or if not quite this that they surround themselves with a subtle ether of potential disapprobation in which at the first sign of unworthiness in you they helplessly suffer you to gasp and perish they have good hearts and they would probably come to your succor out of humanity if they knew how but they do not know how  hawthorne had nothing of this about him he was no more tacitly than he was explicitly didactic i thought him as thoroughly in keeping with his romances as doctor holmes had seemed with his essays and poems and i met him as i had met the autocrat in the supreme hour of his fame  he had just given the world the last of those incomparable works which it was to have finished from his hand the marble faun had worthily followed at a somewhat longer interval than usual the blithedale romance and the house of seven gables and the scarlet letter and had perhaps carried his name higher than all the rest and certainly farther  everybody was reading it and more or less bewailing its indefinite close but yielding him that full honor and praise which a writer can hope for but once in his life  nobody dreamed that thereafter only precious fragments sketches more or less faltering though all with the divine touch in them were further to enrich a legacy which in its kind is the finest the race has received from any mind  as i have said we are always finding new hawthornes but the illusion soon wears away and then we perceive that they were not hawthornes at all that he had some peculiar difference from them which by andby we shall no doubt consent must be his difference from all men evermore  i am painfully aware that i have not summoned before the reader the image of the man as it has always stood in my memory and i feel a sort of shame for my failure  he was so altogether simple that it seems as if it would be easy to do so but perhaps a spirit from the other world would be simple too and yet would no more stand at parle or consent to be sketched than hawthorne  in fact he was always more or less merging into the shadow which was in a few years wholly to close over him there was nothing uncanny in his presence there was nothing even unwilling but he had that apparitional quality of some great minds which kept shakespeare largely unknown to those who thought themselves his intimates and has at last left him a sort of doubt  there was nothing teasing or wilfully elusive in hawthornes impalpability such as i afterwards felt in thoreau if he was not there to your touch it was no fault of his it was because your touch was dull and wanted the use of contact with such natures  the hand passes through the veridical phantom without a sense of its presence but the phantom is none the less veridical for all that     xvi  i kept the evening of the day i met hawthorne wholly for the thoughts of him or rather for that reverberation which continues in the young sensibilities after some important encounter  it must have been the next morning that i went to find thoreau and i am dimly aware of making one or two failures to find him if i ever really found him at all  he is an author who has fallen into that abeyance awaiting all authors great or small at some time or another but i think that with him at least in regard to his most important book it can be only transitory i have not read the story of his hermitage beside walden pond since the year 1858 but i have a fancy that if i should take it up now i should think it a wiser and truer conception of the world than i thought it then  it is no solution of the problem men are not going to answer the riddle of the painful earth by building themselves shanties and living upon beans and watching antfights but i do not believe tolstoy himself has more clearly shown the hollowness the hopelessness the unworthiness of the life of the world than thoreau did in that book  if it were newly written it could not fail of a far vaster acceptance than it had then when to those who thought and felt seriously it seemed that if slavery could only be controlled all things else would come right of themselves with us  slavery has not only been controlled but it has been destroyed and yet things have not begun to come right with us but it was in the order of providence that chattel slavery should cease before industrial slavery and the infinitely crueler and stupider vanity and luxury bred of it should be attacked  if there was then any prevision of the struggle now at hand the seers averted their eyes and strove only to cope with the less evil  thoreau himself who had so clear a vision of the falsity and folly of society as we still have it threw himself into the tide that was already in kansas and virginia reddened with war he aided and abetted the john brown raid i do not recall how much or in what sort and he had suffered in prison for his opinions and actions  it was this inevitable heroism of his that more than his literature even made me wish to see him and revere him and i do not believe that i should have found the veneration difficult when at last i met him in his insufficient person if he had otherwise been present to my glowing expectation  he came into the room a quaint stump figure of a man whose effect of long trunk and short limbs was heightened by his fashionless trousers being let down too low  he had a noble face with tossed hair a distraught eye and a fine aquilinity of profile which made me think at once of don quixote and of cervantes but his nose failed to add that foot to his stature which lamb says a nose of that shape will always give a man  he tried to place me geographically after he had given me a chair not quite so far off as ohio though still across the whole room for he sat against one wall and i against the other but apparently he failed to pull himself out of his revery by the effort for he remained in a dreamy muse which all my attempts to say something fit about john brown and walden pond seemed only to deepen upon him i have not the least doubt that i was needless and valueless about both and that what i said could not well have prompted an important response but i did my poor best and i was terribly disappointed in the result the truth is that in those days i was a helplessly concrete young person and all forms of the abstract the airdrawn afflicted me like physical discomforts  i do not remember that thoreau spoke of his books or of himself at all and when he began to speak of john brown it was not the warm palpable loving fearful old man of my conception but a sort of john brown type a john brown ideal a john brown principle which we were somehow with long pauses between the vague orphic phrases to cherish and to nourish ourselves upon  it was not merely a defeat of my hopes it was a rout and i felt myself so scattered over the field of thought that i could hardly bring my forces together for retreat  i must have made some effort vain and foolish enough to rematerialize my old demigod but when i came away it was with the feeling that there was very little more left of john brown than there was of me  his body was not mouldering in the grave neither was his soul marching on his ideal his type his principle alone existed and i did not know what to do with it  i am not blaming thoreau his words were addressed to a far other understanding than mine and it was my misfortune if i could not profit by them  i think or i venture to hope that i could profit better by them now but in this record i am trying honestly to report their effect with the sort of youth i was then     xvii  such as i was i rather wonder that i had the courage after this experiment of thoreau to present the card hawthorne had given me to emerson  i must have gone to him at once however for i cannot make out any interval of time between my visit to the disciple and my visit to the master  i think it was emerson himself who opened his door to me for i have a vision of the fine old man standing tall on his threshold with the card in his hand and looking from it to me with a vague serenity while i waited a moment on the doorstep below him  he must then have been about sixty but i remember nothing of age in his aspect though i have called him an old man  his hair i am sure was still entirely dark and his face had a kind of marble youthfulness chiselled to a delicate intelligence by the highest and noblest thinking that any man has done  there was a strange charm in emersons eyes which i felt then and always something like that i saw in lincolns but shyer but sweeter and less sad  his smile was the very sweetest i have ever beheld and the contour of the mask and the line of the profile were in keeping with this incomparable sweetness of the mouth at once grave and quaint though quaint is not quite the word for it either but subtly not unkindly arch which again is not the word  it was his great fortune to have been mostly misunderstood and to have reached the dense intelligence of his fellowmen after a whole lifetime of perfectly simple and lucid appeal and his countenance expressed the patience and forbearance of a wise man content to bide his time  it would be hard to persuade people now that emerson once represented to the popular mind all that was most hopelessly impossible and that in a certain sort he was a national joke the type of the incomprehensible the byword of the poor paragrapher  he had perhaps disabused the community somewhat by presenting himself here and there as a lecturer and talking face to face with men in terms which they could not refuse to find as clear as they were wise he was more and more read by certain persons here and there but we are still so far behind him in the reach of his farthinking that it need not be matter of wonder that twenty years before his death he was the most misunderstood man in america yet in that twilight where he dwelt he loomed large upon the imagination the minds that could not conceive him were still aware of his greatness i myself had not read much of him but i knew the essays he was printing in the atlantic and i knew certain of his poems though by no means many yet i had this sense of him that he was somehow beyond and above my ken a presence of force and beauty and wisdom uncompanioned in our literature  he had lately stooped from his ethereal heights to take part in the battle of humanity and i suppose that if the truth were told he was more to my young fervor because he had said that john brown had made the gallows glorious like the cross than because he had uttered all those truer and wiser things which will still a hundred years hence be leading the thought of the world  i do not know in just what sort he made me welcome but i am aware of sitting with him in his study or library and of his presently speaking of hawthorne whom i probably celebrated as i best could and whom he praised for his personal excellence and for his fine qualities as a neighbor  but his last book he added reflectively is a mere mush and i perceived that this great man was no better equipped to judge an artistic fiction than the groundlings who were then crying out upon the indefinite close of the marble faun  apparently he had read it as they had for the story but it seems to me now if it did not seem to me then that as far as the problem of evil was involved the book must leave it where it found it  that is forever insoluble and it was rather with that than with his more or less shadowy people that the romancer was concerned  emerson had in fact a defective sense as to specific pieces of literature he praised extravagantly and in the wrong place especially among the new things and he failed to see the worth of much that was fine and precious beside the line of his fancy  he began to ask me about the west and about some unknown man in michigan who had been sending him poems and whom he seemed to think very promising though he has not apparently kept his word to do great things  i did not find what emerson had to say of my section very accurate or important though it was kindly enough and just enough as to what the west ought to do in literature  he thought it a pity that a literary periodical which had lately been started in cincinnati should be appealing to the east for contributions instead of relying upon the writers nearer home and he listened with what patience he could to my modest opinion that we had not the writers nearer home  i never was of those westerners who believed that the west was kept out of literature by the jealousy of the east and i tried to explain why we had not the men to write that magazine full in ohio  he alleged the man in michigan as one who alone could do much to fill it worthily and again i had to say that i had never heard of him  i felt rather guilty in my ignorance and i had a notion that it did not commend me but happily at this moment mr emerson was called to dinner and he asked me to come with him  after dinner we walked about in his pleached garden a little and then we came again into his library where i meant to linger only till i could fitly get away  he questioned me about what i had seen of concord and whom besides hawthorne i had met and when i told him only thoreau he asked me if i knew the poems of mr william ellery channing  i have known them since and felt their quality which i have gladly owned a genuine and original poetry but i answered then truly that i knew them only from poes criticisms cruel and spiteful things which i should be ashamed of enjoying as i once did  whose criticisms asked emerson  poes i said again  oh he cried out after a moment as if he had returned from a far search for my meaning you mean the jingleman  i do not know why this should have put me to such confusion but if i had written the criticisms myself i do not think i could have been more abashed  perhaps i felt an edge of reproof of admonition in a characterization of poe which the world will hardly agree with though i do not agree with the world about him myself in its admiration  at any rate it made an end of me for the time and i remained as if already absent while emerson questioned me as to what i had written in the atlantic monthly  he had evidently read none of my contributions for he looked at them in the bound volume of the magazine which he got down with the effect of being wholly strange to them and then gravely affixed my initials to each  he followed me to the door still speaking of poetry and as he took a kindly enough leave of me he said one might very well give a pleasant hour to it now and then  a pleasant hour to poetry  i was meaning to give all time and all eternity to poetry and i should by no means have wished to find pleasure in it i should have thought that a proof of inferior quality in the work i should have preferred anxiety anguish even to pleasure  but if emerson thought from the glance he gave my verses that i had better not lavish myself upon that kind of thing unless there was a great deal more of me than i could have made apparent in our meeting no doubt he was right  i was only too painfully aware of my shortcoming but i felt that it was shortercoming than it need have been  i had somehow not prospered in my visit to emerson as i had with hawthorne and i came away wondering in what sort i had gone wrong  i was not a forthputting youth and i could not blame myself for anything in my approaches that merited withholding indeed i made no approaches but as i must needs blame myself for something i fell upon the fact that in my confused retreat from emersons presence i had failed in a certain slight point of ceremony and i magnified this into an offence of capital importance i went home to my hotel and passed the afternoon in pure misery  i had moments of wild question when i debated whether it would be better to go back and own my error or whether it would be better to write him a note and try to set myself right in that way  but in the end i did neither and i have since survived my mortal shame some forty years or more  but at the time it did not seem possible that i should live through the day with it and i thought that i ought at least to go and confess it to hawthorne and let him disown the wretch who had so poorly repaid the kindness of his introduction by such misbehavior  i did indeed walk down by the wayside in the cool of the evening and there i saw hawthorne for the last time  he was sitting on one of the timbers beside his cottage and smoking with an air of friendly calm  i had got on very well with him and i longed to go in and tell him how ill i had got on with emerson i believed that though he cast me off he would understand me and would perhaps see some hope for me in another world though there could be none in this  but i had not the courage to speak of the affair to any one but fields to whom i unpacked my heart when i got back to boston and he asked me about my adventures in concord  by this time i could see it in a humorous light and i did not much mind his lying back in his chair and laughing and laughing till i thought he would roll out of it  he perfectly conceived the situation and got an amusement from it that i could get only through sympathy with him  but i thought it a favorable moment to propose myself as the assistant editor of the atlantic monthly which i had the belief i could very well become with advantage to myself if not to the magazine  he seemed to think so too he said that if the place had not just been filled i should certainly have had it and it was to his recollection of this prompt ambition of mine that i suppose i may have owed my succession to a like vacancy some four years later he was charmingly kind he entered with the sweetest interest into the story of my economic life which had been full of changes and chances already  but when i said very seriously that now i was tired of these fortuities and would like to be settled in something he asked with dancing eyes  why how old are you  i am twentythree i answered and then the laughing fit took him again  well he said you begin young out there  in my heart i did not think that twentythree was so very young but perhaps it was and if any one were to say that i had been portraying here a youth whose aims were certainly beyond his achievements who was morbidly sensitive and if not conceited was intolerably conscious who had met with incredible kindness and had suffered no more than was good for him though he might not have merited his pain any more than his joy i do not know that i should gainsay him for i am not at all sure that i was not just that kind of youth when i paid my first visit to new england       literary friends and acquaintancesfirst impressions of literary new york  by william dean howells    first impressions of literary new york  it was by boat that i arrived from boston on an august morning of 1860 which was probably of the same quality as an august morning of 1900 i used not to mind the weather much in those days it was hot or it was cold it was wet or it was dry but it was not my affair and i suppose that i sweltered about the strange city with no sense of anything very personal in the temperature until nightfall  what i remember is being high up in a hotel long since laid low listening in the summer dark after the long day was done to the niagara roar of the omnibuses whose tide then swept broadway from curb to curb for all the miles of its length  at that hour the other city noises were stilled or lost in this vaster volume of sound which seemed to fill the whole night  it had a solemnity which the modern comer to new york will hardly imagine for that tide of omnibuses has long since ebbed away and has left the air to the strident discords of the elevated trains and the irregular alarum of the gripcar gongs which blend to no such harmonious thunder as rose from the procession of those ponderous and innumerable vans  there was a sort of inner quiet in the sound and when i chose i slept off to it and woke to it in the morning refreshed and strengthened to explore the literary situation in the metropolis     i  not that i think i left this to the second day  very probably i lost no time in going to the office of the saturday press as soon as i had my breakfast after arriving and i have a dim impression of anticipating the earliest of the bohemians whose gay theory of life obliged them to a good many hardships in lying down early in the morning and rising up late in the day  if it was the officeboy who bore me company during the first hour of my visit byandby the editors and contributors actually began to come in  i would not be very specific about them if i could for since that bohemia has faded from the map of the republic of letters it has grown more and more difficult to trace its citizenship to any certain writer  there are some living who knew the bohemians and even loved them but there are increasingly few who were of them even in the fond retrospect of youthful follies and errors  it was in fact but a sickly colony transplanted from the mother asphalt of paris and never really striking root in the pavements of new york it was a colony of ideas of theories which had perhaps never had any deep root anywhere what these ideas these theories were in art and in life it would not be very easy to say but in the saturday press they came to violent expression not to say explosion against all existing forms of respectability  if respectability was your bete noire then you were a bohemian and if you were in the habit of rendering yourself in prose then you necessarily shredded your prose into very fine paragraphs of a sentence each or of a very few words or even of one word  i believe this fashion prevailed till very lately with some of the dramatic critics who thought that it gave a quality of epigram to the style and i suppose it was borrowed from the more spasmodic moments of victor hugo by the editor of the press  he brought it back with him when he came home from one of those sojourns in paris which possess one of the french accent rather than the french language i long desired to write in that fashion myself but i had not the courage  this editor was a man of such open and avowed cynicism that he may have been for all i know a kindly optimist at heart some say however that he had really talked himself into being what he seemed  i only know that his talk the first day i saw him was of such a sort that if he was half as bad he would have been too bad to be  he walked up and down his room saying what lurid things he would directly do if any one accused him of respectability so that he might disabuse the minds of all witnesses there were four or five of his assistants and contributors listening to the dreadful threats which did not deceive even so great innocence as mine but i do not know whether they found it the sorry farce that i did they probably felt the fascination for him which i could not disown in spite of my inner disgust and were watchful at the same time for the effect of his words with one who was confessedly fresh from boston and was full of delight in the people he had seen there  it appeared with him to be proof of the inferiority of boston that if you passed down washington street half a dozen men in the crowd would know you were holmes or lowell or longfellow or wendell phillips but in broadway no one would know who you were or care to the measure of his smallest blasphemy  i have since heard this more than once urged as a signal advantage of new york for the aesthetic inhabitant but i am not sure yet that it is so  the unrecognized celebrity probably has his mind quite as much upon himself as if some one pointed him out and otherwise i cannot think that the sense of neighborhood is such a bad thing for the artist in any sort  it involves the sense of responsibility which cannot be too constant or too keen  if it narrows it deepens and this may be the secret of boston     ii  it would not be easy to say just why the bohemian group represented new york literature to my imagination for i certainly associated other names with its best work but perhaps it was because i had written for the saturday press myself and had my pride in it and perhaps it was because that paper really embodied the new literary life of the city  it was clever and full of the wit that tries its teeth upon everything  it attacked all literary shams but its own and it made itself felt and feared  the young writers throughout the country were ambitious to be seen in it and they gave their best to it they gave literally for the saturday press never paid in anything but hopes of paying vaguer even than promises  it is not too much to say that it was very nearly as well for one to be accepted by the press as to be accepted by the atlantic and for the time there was no other literary comparison  to be in it was to be in the company of fitz james obrien fitzhugh ludlow mr aldrich mr stedman and whoever else was liveliest in prose or loveliest in verse at that day in new york  it was a power and although it is true that as henry giles said of it man cannot live by snappingturtle alone the press was very good snappingturtle  or it seemed so then i should be almost afraid to test it now for i do not like snapping turtle so much as i once did and i have grown nicer in my taste and want my snappingturtle of the very best  what is certain is that i went to the office of the saturday press in new york with much the same sort of feeling i had in going to the office of the atlantic monthly in boston but i came away with a very different feeling  i had found there a bitterness against boston as great as the bitterness against respectability and as boston was then rapidly becoming my second country i could not join in the scorn thought of her and said of her by the bohemians  i fancied a conspiracy among them to shock the literary pilgrim and to minify the precious emotions he had experienced in visiting other shrines but i found no harm in that for i knew just how much to be shocked and i thought i knew better how to value certain things of the soul than they  yet when their chief asked me how i got on with hawthorne and i began to say that he was very shy and i was rather shy and the king of bohemia took his pipe out to break in upon me with oh a couple of shysters and the rest laughed i was abashed all they could have wished and was not restored to myself till one of them said that the thought of boston made him as ugly as sin then i began to hope again that men who took themselves so seriously as that need not be taken very seriously by me  in fact i had heard things almost as desperately cynical in other newspaper offices before that and i could not see what was so distinctively bohemian in these anime prave these souls so baleful by their own showing  but apparently bohemia was not a state that you could well imagine from one encounter and since my stay in new york was to be very short i lost no time in acquainting myself further with it  that very night i went to the beercellar once very far up broadway where i was given to know that the bohemian nights were smoked and quaffed away it was said so far west as ohio that the queen of bohemia sometimes came to pfaffs a young girl of a sprightly gift in letters whose name or pseudonym had made itself pretty well known at that day and whose fate pathetic at all times outtragedies almost any other in the history of letters  she was seized with hydrophobia from the bite of her dog on a railroad train and made a long journey home in the paroxysms of that agonizing disease which ended in her death after she reached new york  but this was after her reign had ended and no such black shadow was cast forward upon pfaffs whose name often figured in the verse and the epigrammatically paragraphed prose of the saturday press  i felt that as a contributor and at least a brevet bohemian i ought not to go home without visiting the famous place and witnessing if i could not share the revels of my comrades  as i neither drank beer nor smoked my part in the carousal was limited to a german pancake which i found they had very good at pfaffs and to listening to the whirling words of my commensals at the long board spread for the bohemians in a cavernous space under the pavement there were writers for the saturday press and for vanity fair a hopefully comic paper of that day and some of the artists who drew for the illustrated periodicals  nothing of their talk remains with me but the impression remains that it was not so good talk as i had heard in boston  at one moment of the orgy which went but slowly for an orgy we were joined by some belated bohemians whom the others made a great clamor over i was given to understand they were just recovered from a fearful debauch their locks were still damp from the wet towels used to restore them and their eyes were very frenzied i was presented to these types who neither said nor did anything worthy of their awful appearance but dropped into seats at the table and ate of the supper with an appetite that seemed poor  i stayed hoping vainly for worse things till eleven oclock and then i rose and took my leave of a literary condition that had distinctly disappointed me  i do not say that it may not have been wickeder and wittier than i found it i only report what i saw and heard in bohemia on my first visit to new york and i know that my acquaintance with it was not exhaustive  when i came the next year the saturday press was no more and the editor and his contributors had no longer a common centre  the best of the young fellows whom i met there confessed in a pleasant exchange of letters which we had afterwards that he thought the pose a vain and unprofitable one and when the press was revived after the war it was without any of the old bohemian characteristics except that of not paying for material it could not last long upon these terms and again it passed away and still waits its second palingenesis  the editor passed away too not long after and the thing that he had inspired altogether ceased to be  he was a man of a certain sardonic power and used it rather fiercely and freely with a joy probably more apparent than real in the pain it gave  in my last knowledge of him he was much milder than when i first knew him and i have the feeling that he too came to own before he died that man cannot live by snappingturtle alone  he was kind to some neglected talents and befriended them with a vigor and a zeal which he would have been the last to let you call generous  the chief of these was walt whitman who when the saturday press took it up had as hopeless a cause with the critics on either side of the ocean as any man could have  it was not till long afterwards that his english admirers began to discover him and to make his countrymen some noisy reproaches for ignoring him they were wholly in the dark concerning him when the saturday press which first stood his friend and the young men whom the press gathered about it made him their cult no doubt he was more valued because he was so offensive in some ways than he would have been if he had been in no way offensive but it remains a fact that they celebrated him quite as much as was good for them  he was often at pfaffs with them and the night of my visit he was the chief fact of my experience  i did not know he was there till i was on my way out for he did not sit at the table under the pavement but at the head of one farther into the room  there as i passed some friendly fellow stopped me and named me to him and i remember how he leaned back in his chair and reached out his great hand to me as if he were going to give it me for good and all  he had a fine head with a cloud of jovian hair upon it and a branching beard and mustache and gentle eyes that looked most kindly into mine and seemed to wish the liking which i instantly gave him though we hardly passed a word and our acquaintance was summed up in that glance and the grasp of his mighty fist upon my hand  i doubt if he had any notion who or what i was beyond the fact that i was a young poet of some sort but he may possibly have remembered seeing my name printed after some very heinesque verses in the press  i did not meet him again for twenty years and then i had only a moment with him when he was reading the proofs of his poems in boston  some years later i saw him for the last time one day after his lecture on lincoln in that city when he came down from the platform to speak with some handshaking friends who gathered about him  then and always he gave me the sense of a sweet and true soul and i felt in him a spiritual dignity which i will not try to reconcile with his printing in the forefront of his book a passage from a private letter of emersons though i believe he would not have seen such a thing as most other men would or thought ill of it in another  the spiritual purity which i felt in him no less than the dignity is something that i will no more try to reconcile with what denies it in his page but such things we may well leave to the adjustment of finer balances than we have at hand  i will make sure only of the greatest benignity in the presence of the man  the apostle of the rough the uncouth was the gentlest person his barbaric yawp translated into the terms of social encounter was an address of singular quiet delivered in a voice of winning and endearing friendliness  as to his work itself i suppose that i do not think it so valuable in effect as in intention  he was a liberating force a very imperial anarch in literature but liberty is never anything but a means and what whitman achieved was a means and not an end in what must be called his verse  i like his prose if there is a difference much better there he is of a genial and comforting quality very rich and cordial such as i felt him to be when i met him in person  his verse seems to me not poetry but the materials of poetry like ones emotions yet i would not misprize it and i am glad to own that i have had moments of great pleasure in it  some french critic quoted in the saturday press i cannot think of his name said the best thing of him when he said that he made you a partner of the enterprise for that is precisely what he does and that is what alienates and what endears in him as you like or dislike the partnership  it is still something neighborly brotherly fatherly and so i felt him to be when the benign old man looked on me and spoke to me     iii  that night at pfaffs must have been the last of the bohemians for me and it was the last of new york authorship too for the time  i do not know why i should not have imagined trying to see curtis whom i knew so much by heart and whom i adored but i may not have had the courage or i may have heard that he was out of town bryant i believe was then out of the country but at any rate i did not attempt him either  the bohemians were the beginning and the end of the story for me and to tell the truth i did not like the story  i remember that as i sat at that table  under the pavement in pfaffs beercellar and listened to the wit that did not seem very funny i thought of the dinner with lowell the breakfast with fields the supper at the autocrats and felt that i had fallen very far  in fact it can do no harm at this distance of time to confess that it seemed to me then and for a good while afterwards that a person who had seen the men and had the things said before him that i had in boston could not keep himself too carefully in cotton and this was what i did all the following winter though of course it was a secret between me and me  i dare say it was not the worst thing i could have done in some respects  my sojourn in new york could not have been very long and the rest of it was mainly given to viewing the monuments of the city from the windows of omnibuses and the platforms of horsecars  the world was so simple then that there were perhaps only a halfdozen cities that had horsecars in them and i travelled in those conveyances at new york with an unfaded zest even after my journeys back and forth between boston and cambridge i have not the least notion where i went or what i saw but i suppose that it was up and down the ugly east and west avenues then lying open to the eye in all the hideousness now partly concealed by the elevated roads and that i found them very stately and handsome  indeed new york was really handsomer then than it is now when it has so many more pieces of beautiful architecture for at that day the skyscrapers were not yet and there was a fine regularity in the streets that these brute bulks have robbed of all shapeliness  dirt and squalor there were a plenty but there was infinitely more comfort  the long succession of cross streets was yet mostly secure from business after you passed clinton place commerce was just beginning to show itself in union square and madison square was still the home of the mcflimsies whose kin and kind dwelt unmolested in the brownstone stretches of fifth avenue  i tried hard to imagine them from the acquaintance mr butlers poem had given me and from the knowledge the gentle satire of the potiphar papers had spread broadcast through a community shocked by the excesses of our best society it was not half so bad then as the best now probably  but i do not think i made very much of it perhaps because most of the people who ought to have been in those fine mansions were away at the seaside and the mountains  the mountains i had seen on my way down from canada but the seaside not and it would never do to go home without visiting some famous summer resort  i must have fixed upon long branch because i must have heard of it as then the most fashionable and one afternoon i took the boat for that place  by this means i not only saw seabathing for the first time but i saw a storm at sea a squall struck us so suddenly that it blew away all the campstools of the forward promenade it was very exciting and i long meant to use in literature the black wall of cloud that settled on the water before us like a sort of portable midnight i now throw it away upon the reader as it were it never would come in anywhere  i stayed all night at long branch and i had a bath the next morning before breakfast an extremely cold one with a lifeline to keep me against the undertow  in this rite i had the company of a young new yorker whom i had met on the boat coming down and who was of the light hopeful adventurous business type which seems peculiar to the city and which has always attracted me  he told me much about his life and how he lived and what it cost him to live  he had a large room at a fashionable boardinghouse and he paid fourteen dollars a week in columbus i had such a room at such a house and paid three and a half and i thought it a good deal  but those were the days before the war when america was the cheapest country in the world and the west was incredibly inexpensive  after a day of lonely splendor at this scene of fashion and gaiety i went back to new york and took the boat for albany on my way home i noted that i had no longer the vivid interest in nature and human nature which i had felt in setting out upon my travels and i said to myself that this was from having a mind so crowded with experiences and impressions that it could receive no more and i really suppose that if the happiest phrase had offered itself to me at some moments i should scarcely have looked about me for a landscape or a figure to fit it to i was very glad to get back to my dear little city in the west i found it seething in an august sun that was hot enough to have calcined the limestone state house and to all the friends i was so fond of     iv  i did what i could to prove myself unworthy of them by refusing their invitations and giving myself wholly to literature during the early part of the winter that followed and i did not realize my error till the invitations ceased to come and i found myself in an unbroken intellectual solitude  the worst of it was that an ungrateful muse did little in return for the sacrifices i made her and the things i now wrote were not liked by the editors i sent them to  the editorial taste is not always the test of merit but it is the only one we have and i am not saying the editors were wrong in my case  there were then such a very few places where you could market your work the atlantic in boston and harpers in new york were the magazines that paid though the independent newspaper bought literary material the saturday press printed it without buying and so did the old knickerbocker magazine though there was pecuniary goodwill in both these cases  i toiled much that winter over a story i had long been writing and at last sent it to the atlantic which had published five poems for me the year before after some weeks or it may have been months i got it back with a note saying that the editors had the less regret in returning it because they saw that in the may number of the knickerbocker the first chapter of the story had appeared  then i remembered that years before i had sent this chapter to that magazine as a sketch to be printed by itself and afterwards had continued the story from it  i had never heard of its acceptance and supposed of course that it was rejected but on my second visit to new york i called at the knickerbocker office and a new editor of those that the magazine was always having in the days of its failing fortunes told me that he had found my sketch in rummaging about in a barrel of his predecessors  manuscripts and had liked it and printed it  he said that there were fifteen dollars coming to me for that sketch and might he send the money to me  i said that he might though i do not see to this day why he did not give it me on the spot and he made a very small minute in a very large sheet of paper really like dick swiveller and promised i should have it that night but i sailed the next day for liverpool without it  i sailed without the money for some verses that vanity fair bought of me but i hardly expected that for the editor who was then artemus ward had frankly told me in taking my address that ducats were few at that moment with vanity fair i was then on my way to be consul at venice where i spent the next four years in a vigilance for confederate privateers which none of them ever surprised  i had asked for the consulate at munich where i hoped to steep myself yet longer in german poetry but when my appointment came i found it was for rome  i was very glad to get rome even but the income of the office was in fees and i thought i had better go on to washington and find out how much the fees amounted to  people in columbus who had been abroad said that on five hundred dollars you could live in rome like a prince but i doubted this and when i learned at the state department that the fees of the roman consulate came to only three hundred i perceived that i could not live better than a baron probably and i despaired  the kindly chief of the consular bureau said that the presidents secretaries mr john nicolay and mr john hay were interested in my appointment and he advised my going over to the white house and seeing them  i lost no time in doing that and i learned that as young western men they were interested in me because i was a young western man who had done something in literature and they were willing to help me for that reason and for no other that i ever knew  they proposed my going to venice the salary was then seven hundred and fifty but they thought they could get it put up to a thousand  in the end they got it put up to fifteen hundred and so i went to venice where if i did not live like a prince on that income i lived a good deal more like a prince than i could have done at rome on a fifth of it  if the appointment was not present fortune it was the beginning of the best luck i have had in the world and i am glad to owe it all to those friends of my verse who could have been no otherwise friends of me they were then beginning very early careers of distinction which have not been wholly divided  mr nicolay could have been about twentyfive and mr hay nineteen or twenty  no one dreamed as yet of the opportunity opening to them in being so constantly near the man whose life they have written and with whose fame they have imperishably interwrought their names  i remember the sobered dignity of the one and the humorous gaiety of the other and how we had some young mens joking and laughing together in the anteroom where they received me with the great soul entering upon its travail beyond the closed door  they asked me if i had ever seen the president and i said that i had seen him at columbus the year before but i could not say how much i should like to see him again and thank him for the favor which i had no claim to at his hands except such as the slight campaign biography i had written could be thought to have given me  that day or another as i left my friends i met him in the corridor without and he looked at the space i was part of with his ineffably melancholy eyes without knowing that i was the indistinguishable person in whose integrity and abilities he had reposed such special confidence as to have appointed him consul for venice and the ports of the lombardovenetian kingdom though he might have recognized the terms of my commission if i had reminded him of them i faltered a moment in my longing to address him and then i decided that every one who forebore to speak needlessly to him or to shake his hand did him a kindness and i wish i could be as sure of the wisdom of all my past behavior as i am of that piece of it  he walked up to the watercooler that stood in the corner and drew himself a full goblet from it which he poured down his throat with a backward tilt of his head and then went wearily within doors  the whole affair so simple has always remained one of a certain pathos in my memory and i would rather have seen lincoln in that unconscious moment than on some statelier occasion     v  i went home to ohio and sent on the bond i was to file in the treasury department but it was mislaid there and to prevent another chance of that kind i carried on the duplicate myself  it was on my second visit that i met the generous young irishman william d oconnor at the house of my friend piatt and heard his ardent talk  he was one of the promising men of that day and he had written an antislavery novel in the heroic mood of victor hugo which greatly took my fancy and i believe he wrote poems too  he had not yet risen to be the chief of walt whitmans champions outside of the saturday press but he had already espoused the theory of bacons authorship of shakespeare then newly exploited by the poor lady of bacons name who died constant to it in an insane asylum  he used to speak of the reputed dramatist as the fat peasant of stratford and he was otherwise picturesque of speech in a measure that consoled if it did not convince  the great war was then full upon us and when in the silences of our literary talk its awful breath was heard and its shadow fell upon the hearth where we gathered round the first fires of autumn oconnor would lift his beautiful head with a fine effect of prophecy and say friends i feel a sense of victory in the air  he was not wrong only the victory was for the other aide  who beside oconnor shared in these saddened symposiums i cannot tell now but probably other young journalists and officeholders intending litterateurs since more or less extinct  i make certain only of the young boston publisher who issued a very handsome edition of leaves of grass and then failed promptly if not consequently  but i had already met in my first sojourn at the capital a young journalist who had given hostages to poetry and whom i was very glad to see and proud to know mr stedman and i were talking over that meeting the other day and i can be surer than i might have been without his memory that i found him at a friends house where he was nursing himself for some slight sickness and that i sat by his bed while our souls launched together into the joyful realms of hope and praise  in him i found the quality of boston the honor and passion of literature and not a mere pose of the literary life and the world knows without my telling how true he has been to his ideal of it  his earthly mission then was to write letters from washington for the new york world which started in life as a good young evening paper with a decided religious tone so that the saturday press could call it the nightblooming serious  i think mr stedman wrote for its editorial page at times and his relation to it as a washington correspondent had an authority which is wanting to the function in these days of perfected telegraphing  he had not yet achieved that seat in the stock exchange whose possession has justified his recourse to business and has helped him to mean something more single in literature than many more singly devoted to it  i used sometimes to speak about that with another eager young author in certain middle years when we were chafing in editorial harness and we always decided that stedman had the best of it in being able to earn his living in a sort so alien to literature that he could come to it unjaded and with a gust unspoiled by kindred savors but no man shapes his own life and i dare say that stedman may have been all the time envying us our tripods from his high place in the stock exchange  what is certain is that he has come to stand for literature and to embody new york in it as no one else does  in a community which seems never to have had a conscious relation to letters he has kept the faith with dignity and fought the fight with constant courage  scholar and poet at once he has spoken to his generation with authority which we can forget only in the charm which makes us forget everything else  but his fame was still before him when we met and i could bring to him an admiration for work which had not yet made itself known to so many but any admirer was welcome  we talked of what we had done and each said how much he liked certain thing of the others i even seized my advantage of his helplessness to read him a poem of mine which i had in my pocket he advised me where to place it and if the reader will not think it an unfair digression i will tell here what became of that poem for i think its varied fortunes were amusing and i hope my own sufferings and final triumph with it will not be without encouragement to the young literary endeavorer  it was a poem called with no prophetic sense of fitness forlorn and i tried it first with the atlantic monthly which would not have it  then i offered it in person to a former editor of harpers monthly but he could not see his advantage in it and i carried it overseas to venice with me  from that point i sent it to all the english magazines as steadily as the post could carry it away and bring it back  on my way home four years later i took it to london with me where a friend who knew lewes then just beginning with the fortnightly review sent it to him for me  it was promptly returned with a letter wholly reserved as to its quality but full of a poetic gratitude for my wish to contribute to the fortnightly  then i heard that a certain mr lucas was about to start a magazine and i offered the poem to him  the kindest letter of acceptance followed me to america and i counted upon fame and fortune as usual when the news of mr lucass death came  i will not poorly joke an effect from my poem in the fact but the fact remains  by this time i was a writer in the office of the nation newspaper and after i left this place to be mr fieldss assistant on the atlantic i sent my poem to the nation where it was printed at last  in such scant measure as my verses have pleased it has found rather unusual favor and i need not say that its misfortunes endeared it to its author  but all this is rather far away from my first meeting with stedman in washington  of course i liked him and i thought him very handsome and fine with a full beard cut in the fashion he has always worn it and with poets eyes lighting an aquiline profile  afterwards when i saw him afoot i found him of a worldly splendor in dress and envied him as much as i could envy him anything the new york tailor whose art had clothed him i had a new york tailor too but with a difference  he had a worldly dash along with his supermundane gifts which took me almost as much and all the more because i could see that he valued himself nothing upon it  he was all for literature and for literary men as the superiors of every one  i must have opened my heart to him a good deal for when i told him how the newspaper i had written for from canada and new england had ceased to print my letters he said think of a man like sitting in judgment on a man like you i thought of it and was avenged if not comforted and at any rate i liked stedmans standing up so stiffly for the honor of a craft that is rather too limp in some of its votaries  i suppose it was he who introduced me to the stoddards whom i met in new york just before i sailed and who were then in the glow of their early fame as poets  they knew about my poor beginnings and they were very very good to me  stoddard went with me to franklin square and gave the sanction of his presence to the ineffectual offer of my poem there but what i relished most was the long talks i had with them both about authorship in all its phases and the exchange of delight in this poem and that this novel and that with gay wilful runs away to make some wholly irrelevant joke or fire puns into the air at no mark whatever stoddard had then a fame with the sweetness of personal affection in it from the lyrics and the odes that will perhaps best keep him known and mrs stoddard was beginning to make her distinct and special quality felt in the magazines in verse and fiction  in both it seems to me that she has failed of the recognition which her work merits  her tales and novels have in them a foretaste of realism which was too strange for the palate of their day and is now too familiar perhaps  it is a peculiar fate and would form the scheme of a pretty study in the history of literature  but in whatever she did she left the stamp of a talent like no other and of a personality disdainful of literary environment  in a time when most of us had to write like tennyson or longfellow or browning she never would write like any one but herself  i remember very well the lodging over a corner of fourth avenue and some downtown street where i visited these winning and gifted people and tasted the pleasure of their racy talk and the hospitality of their goodwill toward all literature which certainly did not leave me out we sat before their grate in the chill of the last october days and they set each other on to one wild flight of wit after another and again i bathed my delighted spirit in the atmosphere of a realm where for the time at least no                rumor of oppression or defeat                of unsuccessful or successful war  could penetrate  i liked the stoddards because they were frankly not of that bohemia which i disliked so much and thought it of no promise or validity and because i was fond of their poetry and found them in it i liked the absolutely literary keeping of their lives  he had then and for long after a place in the custom house but he was no more of that than lamb was of india house  he belonged to that better world where there is no interest but letters and which was as much like heaven for me as anything i could think of  the meetings with the stoddards repeated themselves when i came back to sail from new york early in november  mixed up with the cordial pleasure of them in my memory is a sense of the cold and wet outdoors and the misery of being in those infamous new york streets then as for long afterwards the squalidest in the world  the last night i saw my friends they told me of the tragedy which had just happened at the camp in the city hall park  fitz james obrien the brilliant young irishman who had dazzled us with his story of the diamond lens and frozen our blood with his ingenious tale of a ghostwhat was ita ghost that could be felt and heard but not seenhad enlisted for the war and risen to be an officer with the swift process of the first days of it in that camp he had just then shot and killed a man for some infraction of discipline and it was uncertain what the end would be  he was acquitted however and it is known how he afterwards died of lockjaw from a wound received in battle     vi  before this last visit in new york there was a second visit to boston which i need not dwell upon because it was chiefly a revival of the impressions of the first  again i saw the fieldses in their home again the autocrat in his and lowell now beneath his own roof beside the study fire where i was so often to sit with him in coming years  at dinner which we had at two oclock the talk turned upon my appointment and he said of me to his wife think of his having got stillmans place we ought to put poison in his wine and he told me of the wish the painter had to go to venice and follow up ruskins work there in a book of his own  but he would not let me feel very guilty and i will not pretend that i had any personal regret for my good fortune  the place was given me perhaps because i had not nearly so many other gifts as he who lost it and who was at once artist critic journalist traveller and eminently each  i met him afterwards in rome which the powers bestowed upon him instead of venice and he forgave me though i do not know whether he forgave the powers  we walked far and long over the campagna and i felt the charm of a most uncommon mind in talk which came out richest and fullest in the presence of the wild nature which he loved and knew so much better than most other men  i think that the book he would have written about venice is forever to be regretted and i do not at all console myself for its loss with the book i have written myself  at lowells table that day they spoke of what sort of winter i should find in venice and he inclined to the belief that i should want a fire there  on his study hearth a very brisk one burned when we went back to it and kept out the chill of a cold easterly storm  we looked through one of the windows at the rain and he said he could remember standing and looking out of that window at such a storm when he was a child for he was born in that house and his life had kept coming back to it  he died in it at last  in a lifting of the rain he walked with me down to the village as he always called the denser part of the town about harvard square and saw me aboard a horsecar for boston  before we parted he gave me two charges to open my mouth when i began to speak italian and to think well of women  he said that our race spoke its own tongue with its teeth shut and so failed to master the languages that wanted freer utterance as to women he said there were unworthy ones but a good woman was the best thing in the world and a man was always the better for honoring women     etext editors bookmarks  abstract the airdrawn afflicted me like physical

to new england by william dean howells       literary friends and acquaintancesroundabout to boston  by william dean howells    roundabout to boston  during the four years of my life in venice the literary intention was present with me at all times and in all places  i wrote many things in verse which i sent to the magazines in every part of the english speaking world but they came unerringly back to me except in three instances only when they were kept by the editors who finally printed them  one of these pieces was published in the atlantic monthly another in harpers magazine the third was got into the new york ledger through the kindness of doctor edward everett hale who used i know not what mighty magic to that end  i had not yet met him but he interested himself in my ballad as if it had been his own  his brother charles hale later consulgeneral for egypt whom i saw almost every moment of the two visits he paid venice in my time had sent it to him after copying it in his own large fair hand so that it could be read he was not quite of that literary boston which i so fondly remembered my glimpses of he was rather of a journalistic and literary boston which i had never known but he was of boston after all  he had been in lowells classes at harvard he had often met longfellow in cambridge he knew doctor holmes of course and he let me talk of my idols to my hearts content  i think he must have been amused by my raptures most people would have been but he was kind and patient and he listened to me with a sweet intelligence which i shall always gratefully remember he died too young with his lifes possibilities mainly unfulfilled but none who knew him could fail to imagine them or to love him for what he was     i  besides those few pitiful successes i had nothing but defeats in the sort of literature which i supposed was to be my calling and the defeats threw me upon prose for some sort of literary thing if not one then another i must do if i lived and i began to write those studies of venetian life which afterwards became a book and which i contributed as letters to the boston advertiser after vainly offering them to more aesthetic periodicals  however i do not imagine that it was a very smiling time for any literary endeavorer at home in the lifeanddeath civil war then waging  some few young men arose who made themselves heard amid the din of arms even as far as venice but most of these were hushed long ago  i fancy theodore winthrop who began to speak as it were from his soldiers grave so soon did his death follow the earliest recognition by the public and so many were his posthumous works was chief of these but there were others whom the present readers must make greater effort to remember  forceythe willson who wrote the old sergeant became known for the rare quality of his poetry and now and then there came a poem from aldrich or stedman or stoddard  the great new series of the biglow papers gathered volume with the force they had from the beginning  the autocrat was often in the pages of the atlantic where one often found whittier and emerson with many a fresh name now faded  in washington the piatts were writing some of the most beautiful verse of the war and brownell was sounding his battle lyrics like so many trumpet blasts  the fiction which followed the war was yet all to come  whatever was done in any kind had some hint of the war in it inevitably though in the very heart of it longfellow was setting about his great version of dante peacefully prayerfully as he has told in the noble sonnets which register the mood of his undertaking  at venice if i was beyond the range of literary recognition i was in direct relations with one of our greatest literary men who was again of that literary boston which mainly represented american literature to me the official chief of the consul at venice was the united states minister at vienna and in my time this minister was john lothrop motley the historian  he was removed later by that johnson administration which followed lincolns so forgottenly that i name it with a sense of something almost prehistoric  among its worst errors was the attempted discredit of a man who had given lustre to our name by his work and who was an ardent patriot as well as accomplished scholar  he visited venice during my first year which was the darkest period of the civil war and i remember with what instant security not to say severity he rebuked my scarcely whispered misgivings of the end when i ventured to ask him what he thought it would be  austria had never recognized the secessionists as belligerents and in the complications with france and england there was little for our minister but to share the home indignation at the sympathy of those powers with the south  in motley this was heightened by that feeling of astonishment of wounded faith which all americans with english friendships experienced in those days and which he whose english friendships were many experienced in peculiar degree  i drifted about with him in his gondola and refreshed myself long ahungered for such talk with his talk of literary life in london through some acquaintance i had made in venice i was able to be of use to him in getting documents copied for him in the venetian archives especially the relations of the venetian ambassadors at different courts during the period and events he was studying  all such papers passed through my hands in transmission to the historian though now i do not quite know why they need have done so but perhaps he was willing to give me the pleasure of being a partner however humble in the enterprise my recollection of him is of courtesy to a far younger man unqualified by patronage and of a presence of singular dignity and grace  he was one of the handsomest men i ever saw with beautiful eyes a fine blond beard of modish cut and a sensitive nose straight and fine  he was altogether a figure of worldly splendor and i had reason to know that he did not let the credit of our nation suffer at the most aristocratic court in europe for want of a fit diplomatic costume when some of our ministers were trying to make their office do its full effect upon all occasions in the dress of an american gentleman  the morning after his arrival mr motley came to me with a handful of newspapers which according to the austrian custom at that day had been opened in the venetian postoffice  he wished me to protest against this on his behalf as an infringement of his diplomatic extraterritoriality and i proposed to go at once to the director of the post i had myself suffered in the same way and though i knew that a mere consul was helpless i was willing to see the doubleheaded eagle trodden under foot by a minister plenipotentiary  mr motley said that he would go with me and we put off in his gondola to the postoffice  the director received us with the utmost deference  he admitted the irregularity which the minister complained of and declared that he had no choice but to open every foreign newspaper to whomsoever addressed  he suggested however that if the minister made his appeal to the lieutenantgovernor of venice count toggenburg would no doubt instantly order the exemption of his newspapers from the general rule  mr motley said he would give himself the pleasure of calling upon the lieutenantgovernor and how fortunate he added when we were got back into the gondola that i should have happened to bring my court dress with me i did not see the encounter of the high contending powers but i know that it ended in a complete victory for our minister  i had no further active relations of an official kind with mr motley except in the case of a naturalized american citizen whose property was slowly but surely wasting away in the keeping of the venetian courts an order had at last been given for the surrender of the remnant to the owner but the lombardovenetian authorities insisted that this should be done through the united states minister at vienna and mr motley held as firmly that it must be done through the united states consul at venice i could only report to him from time to time the unyielding attitude of the civil tribunal and at last he consented as he wrote to act officiously not officially in the matter and the hapless claimant got what was left of his estate  i had a glimpse of the historian afterwards in boston but it was only for a moment just before his appointment to england where he was made to suffer for sumner in his quarrel with grant  that injustice crowned the injuries his country had done a most faithful patriot and high spirited gentleman whose fame as an historian once filled the ear of the englishspeaking world  his books seemed to have been written in a spirit already no longer modern and i did not find the greatest of them so moving as i expected when i came to it with all the ardor of my admiration for the historian  william the silent seemed to me by his worshippers own showing scarcely level with the popular movement which he did not so much direct as follow but it is a good deal for a prince to be able even to follow his people and it cannot be said that motley does not fully recognize the greatness of the dutch people though he may see the prince of orange too large  the study of their character made at least a theoretical democrat of a scholar whose instincts were not perhaps democratic and his sympathy with that brave little republic between the dikes strengthened him in his fealty to the great commonwealth between the oceans  i believe that so far as he was of any political tradition he was of the old boston whig tradition but when i met him at venice he was in the glow of a generous pride in our war as a war against slavery  he spoke of the negroes and their simplehearted singleminded devotion to the union cause in terms that an original abolitionist might have used at a time when original abolitionists were not so many as they have since become  for the rest i fancy it was very well for us to be represented at vienna in those days by an ideal democrat who was also a real swell and who was not likely to discredit us socially when we so much needed to be well thought of in every way   at a court where the family of count schmerling the prime minister could not be received for want of the requisite descents it was well to have a minister who would not commit the mistake of inviting the first society to meet the second society as a former envoy extraordinary had done with the effect of finding himself left entirely to the second society during the rest of his stay in vienna     ii  one of my consular colleagues under motley was another historian of no such popularity indeed nor even of such success but perhaps not of inferior powers  this was richard hildreth at trieste the author of one of the sincerest if not the truest histories of the united states according to the testimony both of his liking and his misliking critics i have never read his history and i speak of it only at second hand but i had read before i met him his novel of archy moore or the white slave which left an indelible impression of his imaginative verity upon me  the impression is still so deep that after the lapse of nearly forty years since i saw the book i have no misgiving in speaking of it as a powerful piece of realism  it treated passionately intensely though with a superficial coldness of wrongs now so remote from us in the abolition of slavery that it is useless to hope it will ever beg generally read hereafter but it can safely be praised to any one who wishes to study that bygone condition and the literature which grew out of it  i fancy it did not lack recognition in its time altogether for i used to see it in italian and french translations on the bookstalls i believe neither his history nor his novel brought the author more gain than fame  he had worn himself out on a newspaper when he got his appointment at trieste and i saw him in the shadow of the cloud that was wholly to darken him before he died  he was a tall thin man absent silent already a phantom of himself but with a scholarly serenity and dignity amidst the ruin when the worst came  i first saw him at the pretty villa where he lived in the suburbs of trieste and where i passed several days and i remember him always reading reading reading  he could with difficulty be roused from his book by some strenuous appeal from his family to his conscience as a host  the last night he sat with paradise lost in his hand and nothing could win him from it till he had finished it  then he rose to go to bed  would not he bid his parting guest goodbye  the idea of farewell perhaps dimly penetrated to him  he responded without looking round                they hand in hand with wandering steps and slow                through eden took their solitary way  and so left the room  i had earlier had some dealings with him as a fellowconsul concerning a deserter from an american ship whom i inherited from my predecessor at venice  the man had already been four or five months in prison and he was in a fair way to end his life there for it is our law that a deserting sailor must be kept in the consuls custody till some vessel of our flag arrives when the consul can oblige the master to take the deserter and let him work his passage home  such a vessel rarely came to venice even in times of peace and in times of war there was no hope of any  so i got leave of the consul at trieste to transfer my captive to that port where now and then an american ship did touch  the flag determines the nationality of the sailor and this unhappy wretch was theoretically our fellowcitizen but when he got to trieste he made a clean breast of it to the consul  he confessed that when he shipped under our flag he was a deserter from a british regiment at malta and he begged piteously not to be sent home to america where he had never been in his life nor ever wished to be  he wished to be sent back to his regiment at malta and to whatever fate awaited him there  the case certainly had its embarrassments but the american consul contrived to let our presumptive compatriot slip into the keeping of the british consul who promptly shipped him to malta  in view of the strained relations between england and america at that time this was a piece of masterly diplomacy  besides my old ohiotime friend moncure d conway who paid us a visit and in his immediate relations with literary boston seemed to bring the mountain to mahomet i saw no one else more literary than henry ward beecher  he was passing through venice on his way to those efforts in england in behalf of the union which had a certain great effect at the time and in the tiny parlor of our apartment on the grand canal i can still see him sitting athletic almost pugilistic of presence with his strong face but kind framed in long hair that swept above his massive forehead and fell to the level of his humorously smiling mouth  his eyes quaintly gleamed at the things we told him of our life in the strange place but he only partly relaxed from his strenuous pose and the hands that lay upon his knees were clinched  afterwards as he passed our balcony in a gondola he lifted the brave red fez he was wearing many people wore the fez for one caprice or another and saluted our eagle and us we were often on the balcony behind the shield to attest the authenticity of the american eagle     iii  before i left venice however there came a turn in my literary luck and from the hand i could most have wished to reverse the adverse wheel of fortune  i had labored out with great pains a paper on recent italian comedy which i sent to lowell then with his friend professor norton jointly editor of the north american review and he took it and wrote me one of his loveliest letters about it consoling me in an instant for all the defeat i had undergone and making it sweet and worthy to have lived through that misery  it is one of the hard conditions of this state that while we can mostly make out to let people taste the last drop of bitterness and illwill that is in us our love and gratitude are only semiarticulate at the best and usually altogether tonguetied  as often as i tried afterwards to tell lowell of the benediction the salvation his letter was to me i failed  but perhaps he would not have understood if i had spoken out all that was in me with the fulness i could have given a resentment  his message came after years of thwarted endeavor and reinstated me in the belief that i could still do something in literature  to be sure the letters in the advertiser had begun to make their impression among the first great pleasures they brought me was a recognition from my diplomatic chief at vienna but i valued my admission to the north american peculiarly because it was lowell let me in and because i felt that in his charge it must be the place of highest honor  he spoke of the pay for my article in his letter and asked me where he should send it and i answered to my fatherinlaw who put it in his savingsbank where he lived in brattleboro vermont  there it remained and i forgot all about it so that when his affairs were settled some years later and i was notified that there was a sum to my credit in the bank i said with the confidence i have nearly always felt when wrong that i had no money there  the proof of my error was sent me in a check and then i bethought me of the pay for recent italian comedy  it was not a day when i could really afford to forget money due me but then it was not a great deal of money  the review was as poor as it was proud and i had two dollars a printed page for my paper  but this was more than i got from the advertiser which gave me five dollars a column for my letters printed in a type so fine that the money when translated from greenbacks into gold at a discount of 280 must have been about a dollar a thousand words  however i was richly content with that and would gladly have let them have the letters for nothing  before i left venice i had made my sketches into a book which i sent on to messrs trubner  co in london  they had consented to look at it to oblige my friend conway who during his sojourn with us in venice before his settlement in london had been forced to listen to some of it  they answered me in due time that they would publish an edition of a thousand at half profits if i could get some american house to take five hundred copies  when i stopped in london i had so little hope of being able to do this that i asked the trubners if i might without losing their offer try to get some other london house to publish my book  they said yes almost joyously and i began to take my manuscript about  at most places they would not look at me or it and they nowhere consented to read it the house promptest in refusing to consider it afterwards pirated one of my novels and with some expressions of good intention in that direction never paid me anything for it though i believe the english still think that this sort of behavior was peculiar to the american publisher in the old buccaneering times  i was glad to go back to the trubners with my book and on my way across the atlantic i met a publisher who finally agreed to take those five hundred copies  this was mr m m hurd of hurd  houghton a house then newly established in new york and cambridge  we played ringtoss and shuffleboard together and became of a friendship which lasts to this day  but it was not till some months later when i saw him in new york that he consented to publish my book i remember how he said with an air of vague misgiving and an effect of trying to justify himself in an imprudence that it was not a great matter anyway  i perceived that he had no faith in it and to tell the truth i had not much myself  but the book had an instant success and it has gone on from edition to edition ever since  there was just then the interest of a not wholly generous surprise at american things among the english  our success in putting down the great confederate rebellion had caught the fancy of our cousins and i think it was to this mood of theirs that i owed largely the kindness they showed my book  there were long and cordial reviews in all the great london journals which i used to carry about with me like loveletters when i tried to show them to other people i could not understand their coldness concerning them  at boston where we landed on our return home there was a moment when it seemed as if my small destiny might be linked at once with that of the city which later became my home  i ran into the office of the advertiser to ask what had become of some sketches of italian travel i had sent the paper and the managing editor made me promise not to take a place anywhere before i had heard from him  i gladly promised but i did not hear from him and when i returned to boston a fortnight later i found that a fatal partner had refused to agree with him in engaging me upon the paper  they even gave me back half a dozen unprinted letters of mine and i published them in the nation of new york and afterwards in the book called italian journeys  but after i had encountered fortune in this frowning disguise i had a most joyful little visit with lowell which made me forget there was anything in the world but the delight and glory of sitting with him in his study at elmwood and hearing him talk  it must have been my freshness from italy which made him talk chiefly of his own happy days in the land which so sympathetically brevets all its lovers fellowcitizens at any rate he would talk of hardly anything else and he talked late into the night and early into the morning  about two oclock when all the house was still he lighted a candle and went down into the cellar and came back with certain bottles under his arms  i had not a very learned palate in those days or in these for that matter but i knew enough of wine to understand that these bottles had been chosen upon that principle which longfellow put in verse and used to repeat with a humorous lifting of the eyebrows and hollowing of the voice                if you have a friend to dine                give him your best wine                if you have two                the secondbest will do  as we sat in their mellow afterglow lowell spoke to me of my own life and prospects wisely and truly as he always spoke  he said that it was enough for a man who had stuff in him to be known to two or three people for they would not suffer him to be forgotten and it would rest with himself to get on  i told him that though i had not given up my place at venice i was not going back if i could find anything to do at home and i was now on my way to ohio where i should try my best to find something at the worst i could turn to my trade of printer  he did not think it need ever come to that and he said that he believed i should have an advantage with readers if not with editors in hailing from the west i should be more of a novelty  i knew very well that even in my own west i should not have this advantage unless i appeared there with an eastern imprint but i could not wish to urge my misgiving against his faith  was i not already richly successful  what better thing personally could befall me if i lived forever after on milk and honey than to be sitting there with my hero my master and having him talk to me as if we were equal in deed and in fame  the catbird called in the syringa thicket at his door before we said the goodnight which was good morning using the sweet italian words and bidding each other the dorma bene which has the quality of a benediction  he held my hand and looked into my eyes with the sunny kindness which never failed me worthy or unworthy and i went away to bed  but not to sleep only to dream such dreams as fill the heart of youth when the recognition of its endeavor has come from the achievement it holds highest and best     iv  i found nothing to do in ohio some places that i heard of proved impossible one way or another in columbus and cleveland and cincinnati there was always the fatal partner and after three weeks i was again in the east  i came to new york resolved to fight my way in somewhere and i did not rest a moment before i began the fight  my notion was that which afterwards became bartley hubbards  get a basis said the softening cynic of the saturday press when i advised with him among other acquaintances  get a salaried place something regular on some paper and then you can easily make up the rest  but it was a month before i achieved this vantage and then i got it in a quarter where i had not looked for it  i wrote editorials on european and literary topics for different papers but mostly for the times and they paid me well and more than well but i was nowhere offered a basis though once i got so far towards it as to secure a personal interview with the editorinchief who made me feel that i had seldom met so busy a man  he praised some work of mine that he had read in his paper but i was never recalled to his presence and now i think he judged rightly that i should not be a lastingly good journalist  my point of view was artistic i wanted time to prepare my effects  there was another and clearer prospect opened to me on a literary paper then newly come to the light but long since gone out in the dark  here again my work was taken and liked so much that i was offered the basis at twenty dollars a week that i desired i was even assigned to a desk where i should write in the office and the next morning i came joyfully down to spruce street to occupy it  but i was met at the door by one of the editors who said lightly as if it were a trifling affair well weve concluded to waive the idea of an engagement and once more my bright hopes of a basis dispersed themselves  i said with what calm i could that they must do what they thought best and i went on skirmishing baselessly about for this and the other papers which had been buying my material  i had begun printing in the nation those letters about my italian journeys left over from the boston advertiser they had been liked in the office and one day the editor astonished and delighted me by asking how i would fancy giving up outside work to come there and write only for the nation  we averaged my gains from all sources at forty dollars a week and i had my basis as unexpectedly as if i had dropped upon it from the skies  this must have been some time in november and the next three or four months were as happy a time for me as i have ever known  i kept on printing my italian material in the nation i wrote criticisms for it not very good criticisms i think now and i amused myself very much with the treatment of social phases and events in a department which grew up under my hand  my associations personally were of the most agreeable kind  i worked with joy with ardor and i liked so much to be there in that place and in that company that i hated to have each day come to an end  i believed that my lines were cast in new york for good and all and i renewed my relations with the literary friends i had made before going abroad  i often stopped on my way up town at an apartment the stoddards had in lafayette place or near it i saw stedman and reasoned high to my hearts content of literary things with them and him  with the winter bayard taylor came on from his home in kennett and took an apartment in east twelfth street and once a week mrs taylor and he received all their friends there with a simple and charming hospitality there was another house which we much resorted tothe house of james lorrimer graham afterwards consulgeneral at florence where he died i had made his acquaintance at venice three years before and i came in for my share of that love for literary men which all their perversities could not extinguish in him  it was a veritable passion which i used to think he could not have felt so deeply if he had been a literary man himself  there were delightful dinners at his house where the wit of the stoddards shone and taylor beamed with joyous goodfellowship and overflowed with invention and huntington long paris correspondent of the tribune humorously tried to talk himself into the resolution of spending the rest of his life in his own country  there was one evening when c p cranch always of a most pensive presence and aspect sang the most killingly comic songs and there was another evening when after we all went into the library something tragical happened  edwin booth was of our number a gentle rather silent person in company or with at least little social initiative who as his fate would went up to the cast of a huge hand that lay upon one of the shelves  whose hand is this lorry he asked our host as he took it up and turned it over in both his own hands  graham feigned not to hear and booth asked again whose hand is this  then there was nothing for graham but to say its lincolns hand and the man for whom it meant such unspeakable things put it softly down without a word     v  it was one of the disappointments of a time which was nearly all joy that i did not then meet a man who meant hardly less than lowell himself for me  george william curtis was during my first winter in new york away on one of the long lecturing rounds to which he gave so many of his winters and i did not see him till seven years afterwards at mr nortons in cambridge  he then characteristically spent most of the evening in discussing an obscure point in brownings poem of my last duchess i have long forgotten what the point was but not the charm of curtiss personality his fine presence his benign politeness his almost deferential tolerance of difference in opinion  afterwards i saw him again and again in boston and new york but always with a sense of something elusive in his graciousness for which something in me must have been to blame  cold he was not even to the youth that in those days was apt to shiver in any but the higher temperatures and yet i felt that i made no advance in his kindness towards anything like the friendship i knew in the cambridge men  perhaps i was so thoroughly attuned to their mood that i could not be put in unison with another and perhaps in curtis there was really not the material of much intimacy  he had the potentiality of publicity in the sort of welcome he gave equally to all men and if i asked more i was not reasonable  yet he was never far from any man of goodwill and he was the intimate of multitudes whose several existence he never dreamt of  in this sort he had become my friend when he made his first great speech on the kansas question in 1855 which will seen as remote to the young men of this day as the thermopylae question to which he likened it  i was his admirer his lover his worshipper before that for the things he had done in literature for the howadji books and for the lovely fantasies of prue and i and for the soundhearted satire of the potiphar papers and now suddenly i learnt that this brilliant and graceful talent this travelled and accomplished gentleman this star of society who had dazzled me with his splendor far off in my western village obscurity was a man with the heart to feel the wrongs of men so little friended then as to be denied all the rights of men  i do not remember any passage of the speech or any word of it but i remember the joy the pride with which the soul of youth recognizes in the greatness it has honored the goodness it may love  mere politicians might be proslavery or antislavery without touching me very much but here was the citizen of a world far greater than theirs a light of the universal republic of letters who was willing and eager to stand or fall with the just cause and that was all in all to me  his country was my country and his kindred my kindred and nothing could have kept me from following after him  his whole life taught the lesson that the world is well lost whenever the world is wrong but never i think did any life teach this so sweetly so winningly  the wrong world itself might have been entreated by him to be right for he was one of the few reformers who have not in some measure mixed their love of man with hate of men his quarrel was with error and not with the persons who were in it  he was so gently steadfast in his opinions that no one ever thought of him as a fanatic though many who held his opinions were assailed as fanatics and suffered the shame if they did not win the palm of martyrdom  in early life he was a communist and then when he came out of brook farm into the world which he was so well fitted to adorn and which would so gladly have kept him all its own he became an abolitionist in the very teeth of the world which abhorred abolitionists  he was a believer in the cause of womens rights which has no picturesqueness and which chiefly appeals to the sense of humor in the men who never dreamt of laughing at him  the man who was in the last degree amiable was to the last degree unyielding where conscience was concerned the soul which was so tender had no weakness in it his lenity was the divination of a finer justice  his honesty made all men trust him when they doubted his opinions his good sense made them doubt their own opinions when they had as little question of their own honesty  i should not find it easy to speak of him as a man of letters only for humanity was above the humanities with him and we all know how he turned from the fairest career in literature to tread the thorny path of politics because he believed that duty led the way and that good citizens were needed more than good romancers  no doubt they are and yet it must always be a keen regret with the men of my generation who witnessed with such rapture the early proofs of his talent that he could not have devoted it wholly to the beautiful and let others look after the true  now that i have said this i am half ashamed of it for i know well enough that what he did was best but if my regret is mean i will let it remain for it is faithful to the mood which many have been in concerning him  there can be no dispute i am sure as to the value of some of the results he achieved in that other path  he did indeed create anew for us the type of goodcitizenship wellnigh effaced in a sordid and selfish time and of an honest politician and a pureminded journalist  he never really forsook literature and the world of actual interests and experiences afforded him outlooks and perspectives without which aesthetic endeavor is selflimited and purblind  he was a great man of letters he was a great orator he was a great political journalist he was a great citizen he was a great philanthropist  but that last word with its conventional application scarcely describes the brave and gentle friend of men that he was  he was one that helped others by all that he did and said and was and the circle of his use was as wide as his fame  there are other great men plenty of them common great men whom we know as names and powers and whom we willingly let the ages have when they die for living or dead they are alike remote from us  they have never been with us where we live but this great man was the neighbor the contemporary and the friend of all who read him or heard him and even in the swift forgetting of this electrical age the stamp of his personality will not be effaced from their minds or hearts     vi  of those evenings at the taylors in new york i can recall best the one which was most significant for me and even fatefully significant mr and mrs fields were there from boston and i renewed all the pleasure of my earlier meetings with them  at the end fields said mockingly dont despise boston and i answered as we shook hands few are worthy to live in boston  it was newyears eve and that night it came on to snow so heavily that my horsecar could hardly plough its way up to fortyseventh street through the drifts  the next day and the next i wrote at home because it was so hard to get downtown  the third day i reached the office and found a letter on my desk from fields asking how i should like to come to boston and be his assistant on the atlantic monthly  i submitted the matter at once to my chief on the nation and with his frank goodwill i talked it over with mr osgood of ticknor  fields who was to see me further about it if i wished when he came to new york and then i went to boston to see mr fields concerning details  i was to sift all the manuscripts and correspond with contributors i was to do the literary proofreading of the magazine and i was to write the four or five pages of booknotices which were then printed at the end of the periodical in finer type and i was to have forty dollars a week  i said that i was getting that already for less work and then mr fields offered me ten dollars more  upon these terms we closed and on the 1st of march which was my twentyninth birthday i went to boston and began my work  i had not decided to accept the place without advising with lowell he counselled the step and gave me some shrewd and useful suggestions  the whole affair was conducted by fields with his unfailing tact and kindness but it could not be kept from me that the qualification i had as practical printer for the work was most valued if not the most valued and that as proof reader i was expected to make it avail on the side of economy  somewhere in lifes feast the course of humblepie must always come in and if i did not wholly relish this bit of it i dare say it was good for me and i digested it perfectly     etext editors bookmarks  act officiously not officially confidence i have nearly always felt when wrong

literary friends and acquaintancesliterary boston as i knew it  by william dean howells    literary boston as i knew it  among my fellowpassengers on the train from new york to boston when i went to begin my work there in 1866 as the assistant editor of the atlantic monthly was the late samuel bowles of the springfield republican who created in a subordinate city a journal of metropolitan importance  i had met him in venice several years earlier when he was suffering from the cruel insomnia which had followed his overwork on that newspaper and when he told me that he was sleeping scarcely more than one hour out of the twentyfour  his worn face attested the misery which this must have been and which lasted in some measure while he lived though i believe that rest and travel relieved him in his later years he was always a man of cordial friendliness and he now expressed a most gratifying interest when i told him what i was going to do in boston he gave himself the pleasure of descanting upon the dramatic quality of the fact that a young newspaper man from ohio was about to share in the destinies of the great literary periodical of new england     i  i do not think that such a fact would now move the fancy of the liveliest newspaper man so much has the west since returned upon the east in a refluent wave of authorship  but then the west was almost an unknown quality in our literary problem and in fact there was scarcely any literature outside of new england  even this was of new england origin for it was almost wholly the work of new england men and women in the splendid exile of new york  the atlantic monthly which was distinctively literary was distinctively a new england magazine though from the first it had been characterized by what was more national what was more universal in the new england temperament  its chief contributors for nearly twenty years were longfellow lowell holmes whittier emerson doctor hale colonel higginson mrs stowe whipple rose terry cooke mrs julia ward howe mrs prescott spofford mrs phelps ward and other new england writers who still lived in new england and largely in the region of boston  occasionally there came a poem from bryant at new york from mr stedman from mr stoddard and mrs stoddard from mr aldrich and from bayard taylor  but all these except the last were not only of new england race but of new england birth  i think there was no contributor from the south but mr m d conway and as yet the west scarcely counted though four young poets from ohio who were not immediately or remotely of puritan origin had appeared in early numbers alice cary living with her sister in new york had written now and then from the beginning  mr john hay solely represented illinois by a single paper and he was of rhode island stock it was after my settlement at boston that mark twain of missouri became a figure of worldwide fame at hartford and longer after that mr bret harte made that progress eastward from california which was telegraphed almost from hour to hour as if it were the progress of a prince miss constance f  woolson had not yet begun to write  mr james whitcomb riley mr maurice thompson miss edith thomas octave thanet mr charles warren stoddard mr h b fuller mrs catherwood mr hamlin garland all whom i name at random among other western writers were then as unknown as mr cable miss murfree mrs rives chanler miss grace king mr joel chandler harris mr thomas nelson page in the south which they by no means fully represent  the editors of the atlantic had been eager from the beginning to discover any outlying literature but as i have said there was in those days very little good writing done beyond the borders of new england  if the case is now different and the best known among living american writers are no longer newenglanders still i do not think the south and west have yet trimmed the balance and though perhaps the news writers now more commonly appear in those quarters i should not be so very sure that they are not still characterized by new england ideals and examples on the other hand i am very sure that in my early day we were characterized by them and wished to be so we even felt that we failed in so far as we expressed something native quite in our own way the literary theories we accepted were new england theories the criticism we valued was new england criticism or more strictly speaking boston theories boston criticism  of those more constant contributors to the atlantic whom i have mentioned it is of course known that longfellow and lowell lived in cambridge emerson at concord and whittier at amesbury  colonel higginson was still and for many years afterwards at newport mrs stowe was then at andover miss prescott of newburyport had become mrs spofford and was presently in boston where her husband was a member of the general court mrs phelps ward as miss elizabeth stuart phelps dwelt in her fathers house at andover  the chief of the bostonians were mrs julia ward howe doctor holmes and doctor hale  yet boston stood for the whole massachusetts group and massachusetts in the literary impulse meant new england  i suppose we must all allow whether we like to do so or not that the impulse seems now to have pretty well spent itself  certainly the city of boston has distinctly waned in literature though it has waxed in wealth and population  i do not think there are in boston today even so many talents with a literary coloring in law science theology and journalism as there were formerly though i have no belief that the boston talents are fewer or feebler than before i arrived in boston however when all talents had more or less a literary coloring and when the greatest talents were literary  these expressed with ripened fulness a civilization conceived in faith and brought forth in good works but that moment of maturity was the beginning of a decadence which could only show itself much later  new england has ceased to be a nation in itself and it will perhaps never again have anything like a national literature but that was something like a national literature and it will probably be centuries yet before the life of the whole country the american life as distinguished from the new england life shall have anything so like a national literature it will be long before our larger life interprets itself in such imagination as hawthornes such wisdom as emersons such poetry as longfellows such prophecy as whittiers such wit and grace as holmess such humor and humanity as lowells  the literature of those great men was if i may suffer myself the figure the socinian graft of a calvinist stock  their faith in its varied shades was unitarian but their art was puritan  so far as it was imperfectand great and beautiful as it was i think it had its imperfectionsit was marred by the intense ethicism that pervaded the new england mind for two hundred years and that still characterizes it they or their fathers had broken away from orthodoxy in the great schism at the beginning of the century but as if their heterodoxy were consciencestricken they still helplessly pointed the moral in all they did some pointed it more directly some less directly but they all pointed it  i should be far from blaming them for their ethical intention though i think they felt their vocation as prophets too much for their good as poets  sometimes they sacrificed the song to the sermon though not always nor nearly always  it was in poetry and in romance that they excelled in the novel so far as they attempted it they failed  i say this with the names of all the bostonian group and those they influenced in mind and with a full sense of their greatness it may be ungracious to say that they have left no heirs to their peculiar greatness but it would be foolish to say that they left an estate where they had none to bequeath  one cannot take account of such a fantasy as judds margaret  the only newenglander who has attempted the novel on a scale proportioned to the work of the newenglanders in philosophy in poetry in romance is mr de forest who is of new haven and not of boston  i do not forget the fictions of doctor holmes or the vivid inventions of doctor hale but i do not call them novels and i do not forget the exquisitely realistic art of miss jewett or miss wilkins which is free from the ethicism of the great new england group but which has hardly the novelistss scope  new england in hawthornes work achieved supremacy in romance but the romance is always an allegory and the novel is a picture in which the truth to life is suffered to do its unsermonized office for conduct and new england yet lacks her novelist because it was her instinct and her conscience in fiction to be true to an ideal of life rather than to life itself  even when we come to the exception that proves the rule even to such a signal exception as uncle toms cabin i think that what i say holds true  that is almost the greatest work of imagination that we have produced in prose and it is the work of a new england woman writing from all the inspirations and traditions of new england  it is like begging the question to say that i do not call it a novel however but really is it a novel in the sense that war and peace is a novel or madame flaubert or lassommoir or phineas finn or dona perfecta or esther waters or marta y maria or the return of the native or virgin soil or david grieve  in a certain way it is greater than any of these except the first but its chief virtue or its prime virtue is in its address to the conscience and not its address to the taste to the ethical sense not the aesthetical sense  this does not quite say the thing but it suggests it and i should be sorry if it conveyed to any reader a sense of slight for i believe no one has felt more deeply than myself the value of new england in literature  the comparison of the literary situation at boston to the literary situation at edinburgh in the times of the reviewers has never seemed to me accurate or adequate and it holds chiefly in the fact that both seem to be of the past  certainly new york is yet no london in literature and i think boston was once vastly more than edinburgh ever was at least in quality  the scotch literature of the palmy days was not wholly scotch and even when it was rooted in scotch soil it flowered in the air of an alien speech  but the new england literature of the great day was the blossom of a new england root and the language which the bostonians wrote was the native english of scholars fitly the heirs of those who had brought the learning of the universities to massachusetts bay two hundred years before and was of as pure a lineage as the english of the mothercountry     iii  the literary situation which confronted me when i came to boston was then as native as could well be and whatever value i may be able to give a personal study of it will be from the effect it made upon me as one strange in everything but sympathy  i will not pretend that i saw it in its entirety and i have no hope of presenting anything like a kinetoscopic impression of it  what i can do is to give here and there a glimpse of it and i shall wish the reader to keep in mind the fact that it was in a state of transition as everything is always and everywhere  it was no sooner recognizably native than it ceased to be fully so and i became a witness of it after the change had begun  the publishing house which so long embodied new england literature was already attempting enterprises out of the line of its traditions and one of these had brought mr t b aldrich from new york a few weeks before i arrived upon the scene in that dramatic quality which i think never impressed any one but mr bowles  mr aldrich was the editor of every saturday when i came to be assistant editor of the atlantic monthly we were of nearly the same age but he had a distinct and distinguished priority of reputation insomuch that in my western remoteness i had always ranged him with such elders and betters of mine as holmes and lowell and never imagined him the blond slight youth i found him with every imaginable charm of contemporaneity  it is no part of the office which i have intended for these slight and sufficiently wandering glimpses of the past to show any writer in his final place and above all i do not presume to assign any living man his rank or station  but i should be false to my own grateful sense of beauty in the work of this poet if i did not at all times recognize his constancy to an ideal which his name stands for  he is known in several kinds but to my thinking he is best in a certain nobler kind of poetry a serious sort in which the thought holds him above the scrupulosities of the art he loves and honors so much  sometimes the file slips in his hold as the file must and will it is but an instrument at the best but there is no mistouch in the hand that lays itself upon the readers heart with the pulse of the poets heart quick and true in it  there are sonnets of his grave and simple and lofty which i think of with the glow and thrill possible only from very beautiful poetry and which impart such an emotion as we can feel only                when a great thought strikes along the brain                and flushes all the cheek  when i had the fortune to meet him first i suppose that in the employ of the kindly house we were both so eager to serve our dignities were about the same for if the atlantic monthly was a somewhat prouder affair than an eclectic weekly like every saturday he was supreme in his place and i was subordinate in mine  the house was careful in the attitude of its senior partner not to distinguish between us and we were not slow to perceive the tact used in managing us we had our own joke of it we compared notes to find whether we were equally used in this thing or that and we promptly shared the fun of our discovery with fields himself  we had another impartial friend no less a friend of joy in the life which seems to have been pretty nearly all joy as i look back upon it in the partner who became afterwards the head of the house and who forecast in his bold enterprises the change from a new england to an american literary situation  in the end james r osgood failed though all his enterprises succeeded  the anomaly is sad but it is not infrequent  they were greater than his powers and his means and before they could reach their full fruition they had to be enlarged to men of longer purse and longer patience  he was singularly fitted both by instinct and by education to become a great publisher and he early perceived that if a leading american house were to continue at boston it must be hospitable to the talents of the whole country  he founded his future upon those generous lines but he wanted the qualities as well as the resources for rearing the superstructure  changes began to follow each other rapidly after he came into control of the house  misfortune reduced the size and number of its periodicals  the young folks was sold outright and the north american review long before mr rice bought it and carried it to new york was cut down onehalf so that aldrich said it looked as if destiny had sat upon it  his own periodical every saturday was first enlarged to a stately quarto and illustrated and then under stress of the calamities following the great boston fire it collapsed to its former size  then both the atlantic monthly and every saturday were sold away from their old ownership and every saturday was suppressed altogether and we two ceased to be of the same employ  there was some sort of evening rite more funereal than festive the day after they were sold and we followed osgood away from it under the lamps  we all knew that it was his necessity that had caused him to part with the periodicals but he professed that it was his pleasure and he said he had not felt so lighthearted since he was a boy  we asked him how could he feel gay when he was no longer paying us our salaries and how could he justify it to his conscience  he liked our mocking and limped away from us with a rheumatic easing of his weight from one foot to another a figure pathetic now that it has gone the way to dusty death and dear to memory through benefactions unalloyed by one unkindness     iv  but when i came to boston early in 1866 the atlantic monthly and harpers then divided our magazine world between them the north american review in the control of lowell and professor norton had entered upon a new life every saturday was an instant success in the charge of mr aldrich who was by taste and training one of the best editors and our young folks had the field of juvenile periodical literature to itself  it was under the direction of miss lucy larcom and of mr j t trowbridge who had come from western new york where he was born and must be noted as one of the first returners from the setting to the rising sun  he naturalized himself in boston in his later boyhood and he still breathes boston air where he dwells in the street called pleasant on the shore of spy pond at arlington and still weaves the magic web of his satisfying stories for boys  he merges in their popularity the fame of a poet which i do not think will always suffer that eclipse for his poems show him to have looked deeply into the heart of common humanity with a true and tender sense of it  miss larcom scarcely seemed to change from date to date in the generation that elapsed between the time i first saw her and the time i saw her last a year or two before her death  a goodness looked out of her comely face which made me think of the madonnas in titians assumption and her whole aspect expressed a mild and friendly spirit which i find it hard to put in words  she was never of the fine world of literature she dwelt where she was born in that unfashionable beverly which is not beverly farms and was of a simple seafaring godfearing race as she has told in one of the loveliest autobiographies i know a new england girlhood  she was the author of many poems whose number she constantly enlarged but she was chiefly and will be most lastingly famed for the one poem hannah binding shoes which years before my days in boston had made her so widely known  she never again struck so deep or so true a note but if one has lodged such a note in the ear of time it is enough and if we are to speak of eternity one might very well hold up ones head in the fields of asphodel if one could say to the great others there i wrote hannah binding shoes  her poem is very very sad as all who have read it will remember but miss larcom herself was above everything cheerful and she had a laugh of mellow richness which willingly made itself heard  she was not only of true new england stock and a boston author by right of race but she came up to that city every winter from her native town  by the same right and on the same terms another new england poetess whom i met those first days in boston was a boston author  when i saw celia thaxter she was just beginning to make her effect with those poems and sketches which the sea sings and flashes through as it sings and flashes around the isles of shoals her summer home where her girlhood had been passed in a freedom as wild as the curlews  she was a most beautiful creature still very young with a slender figure and an exquisite perfection of feature she was in presence what her work was fine frank finished  i do not know whether other witnesses of our literary history feel that the public has failed to keep her as fully in mind as her work merited but i do not think there can be any doubt but our literature would be sensibly the poorer without her work  it is interesting to remember how closely she kept to her native field and it is wonderful to consider how richly she made those seabeaten rocks to blossom  something strangely full and bright came to her verse from the mystical environment of the ocean like the luxury of leaf and tint that it gave the narrower flowerplots of her native isles  her gift indeed could not satisfy itself with the terms of one art alone however varied and she learned to express in color the thoughts and feelings impatient of the pallor of words  she remains in my memories of that far boston a distinct and vivid personality as the authoress of amber gods and in a cellar and circumstance and those other wild romantic tales remains the gentle and somewhat evanescent presence i found her  miss prescott was now mrs spofford and her husband was a rising young politician of the day  it was his duties as member of the general court that had brought them up from newburyport to boston for that first winter and i remember that the evening when we met he was talking of their some time going to italy that she might study for imaginative literature certain italian cities he named  i have long since ceased to own those cities but at the moment i felt a pang of expropriation which i concealed as well as i could and now i heartily wish she could have fulfilled that purpose if it was a purpose or realized that dream if it was only a dream  perhaps however that sumptuous and glowing fancy of hers which had taken the fancy of the young readers of that day needed the cold new england background to bring out all its intensities of tint all its splendors of light  its effects were such as could not last or could not be farther evolved they were the expression of youth musing away from its environment and smitten with the glories of a world afar and beyond the great world the fine world the impurpled world of romantic motives and passions  but for what they were i can never think them other than what they appeared the emanations of a rarely gifted and singularly poetic mind  i feel better than i can say how necessarily they were the emanations of a new england mind and how to the subtler sense they must impart the pathos of revolt from the colorless rigidities which are the long result of puritanism in the physiognomy of new england life  their author afterwards gave herself to the stricter study of this life in many tales and sketches which showed an increasing mastery but they could not have the flush the surprise the delight of a young talent trying itself in a kind native and so far as i know peculiar to it from time to time i still come upon a poem of hers which recalls that earlier strain of music of color and i am content to trust it for my abiding faith in the charm of things i have not read for thirty years     v  i speak of this one and that as it happens and with no thought of giving a complete prospect of literary boston thirty years ago  i am aware that it will seem sparsely peopled in the effect i impart and i would have the reader always keep in mind the great fames at cambridge and at concord which formed so large a part of the celebrity of boston i would also like him to think of it as still a great town merely where every one knew every one else and whose metropolitan liberation from neighborhood was just begun  most distinctly of that yet uncitified boston was the critic edwin p whipple whose sympathies were indefinitely wider than his traditions he was a most generous lover of all that was excellent in literature and though i suppose we should call him an oldfashioned critic now i suspect it would be with no distinct sense of what is newer fashioned he was certainly as friendly to what promised well in the younger men as he was to what was done well in their elders and there was no one writing in his day whose virtues failed of his recognition though it might happen that his foibles would escape whipples censure  he wrote strenuously and of course conscientiously his point of view was solely and always that which enabled him best to discern qualities  i doubt if he had any theory of criticism except to find out what was good in an author and praise it and he rather blamed what was ethically bad than what was aesthetically bad  in this he was strictly of new england and he was of new england in a certain general intelligence which constantly grew with an interrogative habit of mind  he liked to talk to you of what he had found characteristic in your work to analyze you to yourself and the very modesty of the man which made such a study impersonal as far as he was concerned sometimes rendered him insensible to the sufferings of his subject  he had a keen perception of humor in others but he had very little humor he had a love of the beautiful in literature which was perhaps sometimes greater than his sense of it  i write from a cursory acquaintance with his work not recently renewed of the presence of the man i have a vivider remembrance a slight short ecclesiasticized figure in black with a white neckcloth and a silk hat of strict decorum and between the two a square face with square features intensified in their regard by a pair of very large glasses and the prominent myopic eyes staring through them  he was a type of outdated new england scholarship in these aspects but in the hospitable qualities of his mind and heart the sort of man to be kept fondly in the memory of all who ever knew him  out of the vague of that faroff time another face and figure as essentially new enland as this and yet so different relieve themselves  charles f browne whose drollery wafted his pseudonym as far as the english speech could carry laughter was a westernized yankee he added an ohio way of talking to the maine way of thinking and he so became a literary product of a rarer and stranger sort than our literature had otherwise known  he had gone from cleveland to london with intervals of new york and the lecture platform four or five years before i saw him in boston shortly after i went there  we had met in ohio and he had personally explained to me the ducatless wellmeaning of vanity fair in new york but many men had since shaken the weary hand of artemus ward when i grasped it one day in front of the tremont temple he did not recognize me but he gave me at once a greeting of great impersonal cordiality with how do you do  when did you come and other questions that had no concern in them till i began to dawn upon him through a cloud of other half remembered faces  then he seized my hand and wrung it all over again and repeated his friendly demands with an intonation that was now why how are you how are you for me alone it was a bit of comedy which had the fit pathetic relief of his impending doom this was already stamped upon his wasted face and his gay eyes had the deathlook  his large loose mouth was drawn for all its laughter at the fact which he owned his profile which burlesqued an eagles was the profile of a drooping eagle his lank length of limb trembled away with him when we parted  i did not see him again i scarcely heard of him till i heard of his death and this sad image remains with me of the humorist who first gave the world a taste of the humor which characterizes the whole american people  i was meeting all kinds of distinguished persons in my relation to the magazine and early that winter i met one who remains in my mind above all others a person of distinction  he was scarcely a celebrity but he embodied certain social traits which were so characteristic of literary boston that it could not be approached without their recognition the muses have often been acknowledged to be very nice young persons but in boston they were really ladies in boston literature was of good family and good society in a measure it has never been elsewhere it might be said even that reform was of good family in boston and literature and reform equally shared the regard of edmund quincy whose race was one of the most aristocratic in new england  i had known him by his novel of wensley it came so near being a firstrate novel and by his life of josiah quincy then a new book but still better by his boston letters to the new york tribune  these dealt frankly in the old antislavery days between 1850 and 1860 with other persons of distinction in boston who did not see the right so clearly as quincy did or who at least let their interests darken them to the ugliness of slavery  their fault was all the more comical because it was the error of men otherwise so correct of characters so stainless of natures so upright and the quincy letters got out of it all the fun there was in it  quincy himself affected me as the finest patrician type i had ever met  he was charmingly handsome with a nose of most fit aquilinity smoothshaven lips educated whiskers and perfect glasses his manner was beautiful his voice delightful when at our first meeting he made me his reproaches in terms of lovely kindness for having used in my venetian life the briticism directly for as soon as  lowell once told me that quincy had never had any calling or profession because when he found himself in the enjoyment of a moderate income on leaving college he decided to be simply a gentleman  he was too much of a man to be merely that and he was an abolitionist a journalist and for conscience sake a satirist  of that political mood of society which he satirized was an eminent man whom it was also my good fortune to meet in my early days in boston and if his great sweetness and kindness had not instantly won my liking i should still have been glad of the glimpse of the older and statelier boston which my slight acquaintance with george ticknor gave me  the historian of spanish literature the friend and biographer of prescott and a leading figure of the intellectual society of an epoch already closed dwelt in the fine old square brick mansion which yet stands at the corner of park street and beacon though sunk now to a variety of business uses and lamentably changed in aspect the interior was noble and there was an air of scholarly quiet and of lettered elegance in the library where the host received his guests which seemed to pervade the whole house and which made its appeal to the imagination of one of them most potently  it seemed to me that to be master of such circumstance and keeping would be enough of life in a certain way and it all lingers in my memory yet as if it were one with the gentle courtesy which welcomed me  among my fellowguests one night was george s hillard now a faded reputation and even then a life defeated of the high expectation of its youth  i do not know whether his six months in italy still keeps itself in print but it was a book once very well known and he was perhaps the more gracious to me as our host was because of our common italian background  he was of the old silvergray whig society too and i suppose that order of things imparted its tone to what i felt and saw in that place  the civil war had come and gone and that order accepted the result if not with faith then with patience  there were two young english noblemen there that night who had been travelling in the south and whose stories of the wretched conditions they had seen moved our host to some open misgiving  but the englishmen had no question in spite of all they defended the accomplished fact and when i ventured to say that now at least there could be a hope of better things while the old order was only the perpetuation of despair he mildly assented with a gesture of the hand that waived the point and a deeply sighed perhaps perhaps  he was a presence of great dignity which seemed to recall the past with a steadfast allegiance and yet to relax itself towards the present in the wisdom of the accumulated years  his whole life had been passed in devotion to polite literature and in the society of the polite world and he was a type of scholar such as only the circumstances of boston could form  those circumstances could alone form such another type as quincy and i wish i could have felt then as i do now the advantage of meeting them so contemporaneously     vii  the historian of spanish literature was an old man nearer eighty than seventy when i saw him and i recall of him personally his dark tint and the scholarly refinement of his cleanshaven face which seemed to me rather english than american in character  he was quite exterior to the atlantic group of writers and had no interest in me as one of it literary boston of that day was not a solidarity as i soon perceived and i understood that it was only in my quality of stranger that i saw the different phases of it  i should not be just to a vivid phase if i failed to speak of mrs julia ward howe and the impulse of reform which she personified  i did not sympathize with this then so much as i do now but i could appreciate it on the intellectual side  once many years later i heard mrs howe speak in public and it seemed to me that she made one of the best speeches i had ever heard  it gave me for the first time a notion of what women might do in that sort if they entered public life but when we met in those earlier days i was interested in her as perhaps our chief poetess  i believe she did not care much to speak of literature she was alert for other meanings in life and i remember how she once brought to book a youthful matron who had perhaps unduly lamented the hardships of housekeeping with the sharp demand child where is your religion  after the many years of an acquaintance which had not nearly so many meetings as years it was pleasant to find her at the latest as strenuous as ever for the faith of works and as eager to aid stepniak as john brown  in her beautiful old age she survives a certain literary impulse of boston but a still higher impulse of boston she will not survive for that will last while the city endures     viii  the cambridge men were curiously apart from others that formed the great new england group and with whom in my earlier ignorance i had always fancied them mingling  now and then i met doctor holmes at longfellows table but not oftener than now and then and i never saw emerson in cambridge at all except at longfellows funeral  in my first years on the atlantic i sometimes saw him when he would address me some grave rather retrorsive civilities after i had been newly introduced to him as i had always to be on these occasions  i formed the belief that he did not care for me either in my being or doing and i am far from blaming him for that on such points there might easily be two opinions and i was myself often of the mind i imagined in him  if emerson forgot me it was perhaps because i was not of those qualities of things which even then it was said he could remember so much better than things themselves  in his later years i sometimes saw him in the boston streets with his beautiful face dreamily set as he moved like one to whose vision                heaven opens inward chasms yawn                vast images in glimmering dawn                half shown are broken and withdrawn  it is known how before the end the eclipse became total and from moment to moment the record inscribed upon his mind was erased  some years before he died i sat between him and mrs rose terry cooke at an atlantic breakfast where it was part of my editorial function to preside  when he was not asking me who she was i could hear him asking her who i was  his great soul worked so independently of memory as we conceive it and so powerfully and essentially that one could not help wondering if after all our personal continuity our identity hereafter was necessarily trammeled up with our enduring knowledge of what happens here  his remembrance absolutely ceased with an event and yet his character his personality his identity fully persisted  i do not know whether the things that we printed for emerson after his memory began to fail so utterly were the work of earlier years or not but i know that they were of his best  there were certain poems which could not have been more electly more exquisitely his or fashioned with a keener and juster selfcriticism  his vision transcended his time so far that some who have tired themselves out in trying to catch up with him have now begun to say that he was no seer at all but i doubt if these form the last court of appeal in his case  in manner he was very gentle like all those great new england men but he was cold like many of them to the newcomer or to the oldcomer who came newly  as i have elsewhere recorded i once heard him speak critically of hawthorne and once he expressed his surprise at the late flowering brilliancy of holmess gift in the autocrat papers after all his friends supposed it had borne its best fruit  but i recall no mention of longfellow or lowell or whittier from him  at a dinner where the talk glanced upon walt whitman he turned to me as perhaps representing the interest posterity might take in the matter and referred to whitmans public use of his privately written praise as something altogether unexpected  he did not disown it or withdraw it but seemed to feel not indignantly that there had been an abuse of it     ix  the first time i saw whittier was in fieldss room at the publishing office where i had come upon some editorial errand to my chief  he introduced me to the poet a tall spare figure in black of quaker cut with a keen cleanshaven face black hair and vivid black eyes  it was just after his poem snow bound had made its great success in the modest fashion of those days and had sold not two hundred thousand but twenty thousand and i tried to make him my compliment  i contrived to say that i could not tell him how much i liked it and he received the inadequate expression of my feeling with doubtless as much effusion as he would have met something more explicit and abundant  if he had judged fit to take my contract off my hands in any way i think he would have been less able to do so than any of his new england contemporaries in him as i have suggested the quaker calm was bound by the frosty puritanic air and he was doubly cold to the touch of the stranger though he would thaw out to old friends and sparkle in laugh and joke i myself never got so far with him as to experience this geniality though afterwards we became such friends as an old man and a young man could be who rarely met our better acquaintance began with some talk at a second meeting about bayard taylors story of kennett which had then lately appeared and which he praised for its fidelity to quaker character in its less amiable aspects  no doubt i had made much of my own quaker descent which i felt was one of the few things i had to be proud of and he therefore spoke the more frankly of those traits of brutality into which the primitive sincerity of the sect sometimes degenerated  he thought the habit of plainspeaking had to be jealously guarded to keep it from becoming rudespeaking and he matched with stories of his own some things i had heard my father tell of friends in the backwoods who were foes to good manners  whittier was one of the most generous of men towards the work of others especially the work of a new man and if i did anything that he liked i could count upon him for cordial recognition  in the quiet of his country home at danvers he apparently read all the magazines and kept himself fully abreast of the literary movement but i doubt if he so fully appreciated the importance of the social movement  like some others of the great antislavery men he seemed to imagine that mankind had won itself a clear field by destroying chattel slavery and he had no sympathy with those who think that the man who may any moment be out of work is industrially a slave  this is not strange so few men last over from one reform to another that the wonder is that any should not that one should not  whittier was prophet for one great need of the divine to man and he spoke his message with a fervor that at times was like the trembling of a flame or the quivering of midsummer sunshine it was hard to associate with the man as one saw him still shy stiff the passion of his verse  this imbued not only his antislavery utterances but equally his ballads of the old witch and quaker persecution and flashed a far light into the dimness where his interrogations of mystery pierced  whatever doubt there can be of the fate of other new england poets in the great and final account it seems to me that certain of these pieces make his place secure  there is great inequality in his work and i felt this so strongly that when i came to have full charge of the magazine i ventured once to distinguish  he sent me a poem and i had the temerity to return it and beg him for something else  he magnanimously refrained from all show of offence and after a while when he had printed the poem elsewhere he gave me another  by this time i perceived that i had been wrong not as to the poem returned but as to my function regarding him and such as he  i had made my reflections and never again did i venture to pass upon what contributors of his quality sent me  i took it and printed it and praised the gods and even now i think that with such men it was not my duty to play the censor in the periodical which they had made what it was  they had set it in authority over american literature and it was not for me to put myself in authority over them  their fame was in their own keeping and it was not my part to guard it against them  after that experience i not only practised an eager acquiescence in their wish to reach the public through the atlantic but i used all the delicacy i was master of in bowing the way to them  sometimes my utmost did not avail or more strictly speaking it did not avail in one instance with emerson  he had given me upon much entreaty a poem which was one of his greatest and best but the proofreader found a nominative at odds with its verb  we had some trouble in reconciling them and some other delays and meanwhile doctor holmes offered me a poem for the same number  i now doubted whether i should get emersons poem back in time for it but unluckily the proof did come back in time and then i had to choose between my poets or acquaint them with the state of the case and let them choose what i should do  i really felt that doctor holmes had the right to precedence since emerson had withheld his proof so long that i could not count upon it but i wrote to emerson and asked as nearly as i can remember whether he would consent to let me put his poem over to the next number or would prefer to have it appear in the same number with doctor holmess the subjects were cognate and i had my misgivings  he wrote me back to return the proofs and break up the forms  i could not go to this iconoclastic extreme with the electrotypes of the magazine but i could return the proofs  i did so feeling that i had done my possible and silently grieving that there could be such ire in heavenly minds     x  emerson as i say i had once met in cambridge but whittier never and i have a feeling that poet as cambridge felt him to be she had her reservations concerning him  i cannot put these into words which would not oversay them but they were akin to those she might have refined upon in regard to mrs stowe  neither of these great writers would have appeared to cambridge of the last literary quality their fame was with a world too vast to be the test that her own                 one entire and perfect crysolite  would have formed  whittier in fact had not arrived at the clear splendor of his later work without some earlier turbidity he was still from time to time capable of a false rhyme like morn and dawn  as for the author of uncle toms cabin her syntax was such a snare to her that it sometimes needed the combined skill of all the proofreaders and the assistant editor to extricate her  of course nothing was ever written into her work but in changes of diction in correction of solecisms in transposition of phrases the text was largely rewritten on the margin of her proofs  the soul of her art was present but the form was so often absent that when it was clothed on anew it would have been hard to say whose cut the garment was of in many places  in fact the proofreading of the atlantic monthly was something almost fearfully scrupulous and perfect  the proofs were first read by the under proofreader in the printingoffice then the head reader passed them to me perfectly clean as to typography with his own abundant and most intelligent comments on the literature and then i read them making what changes i chose and verifying every quotation every date every geographical and biographical name every foreign word to the last accent every technical and scientific term  where it was possible or at all desirable the proof was next submitted to the author  when it came back to me i revised it accepting or rejecting the authors judgment according as he was entitled by his ability and knowledge or not to have them  the proof now went to the printers for correction they sent it again to the head reader who carefully revised it and returned it again to me  i read it a second time and it was again corrected  after this it was revised in the office and sent to the stereotyper from whom it came to the head reader for a last revision in the plates  it would not do to say how many of the first american writers owed their correctness in print to the zeal of our proofreading but i may say that there were very few who did not owe something  the wisest and ablest were the most patient and grateful like mrs stowe under correction it was only the beginners and the more ignorant who were angry and almost always the proofreading editor had his way on disputed points i look back now with respectful amazement at my proficiency in detecting the errors of the great as well as the little  i was able to discover mistakes even in the classical quotations of the deeply lettered sumner and i remember in the earliest years of my service on the atlantic waiting in this statesmans study amidst the prints and engravings that attested his personal resemblance to edmund burke with his proofs in my hand and my heart in my mouth to submit my doubts of his latinity  i forget how he received them but he was not a very gracious person  mrs stowe was a gracious person and carried into age the inalienable charm of a woman who must have been very charming earlier  i met her only at the fieldses in boston where one night i witnessed a controversy between her and doctor holmes concerning homoeopathy and allopathy which lasted well through dinner  after this lapse of time i cannot tell how the affair ended but i feel sure of the liking with which mrs stowe inspired me  there was something very simple very motherly in her and something divinely sincere  she was quite the person to take au grand serieux the monstrous imaginations of lady byrons jealousy and to feel it on her conscience to make public report of them when she conceived that the time had come to do so  in francis parkman i knew much later than in some others a differentiation of the new england type which was not less characteristic  he like so many other boston men of letters was of patrician family and of those easy fortunes which clio prefers her sons to be of but he paid for these advantages by the suffering in which he wrought at what is i suppose our greatest history  he wrought at it piecemeal and sometimes only by moments when the terrible head aches which tormented him and the disorder of the heart which threatened his life allowed him a brief respite for the task which was dear to him he must have been more than a quarter of a century in completing it and in this time as he once told me it had given him a daylaborers wages but of course money was the least return he wished from it  i read the regularly successive volumes of the jesuits in north america the old regime in canada the wolfe and montcalm and the others that went to make up the whole history with a sufficiently noisy enthusiasm and our acquaintance began by his expressing his gratification with the praises of them that i had put in print  we entered into relations as contributor and editor and i know that he was pleased with my eagerness to get as many detachable chapters from the book in hand as he could give me for the magazine but he was of too fine a politeness to make this the occasion of his first coming to see me  he had walked out to cambridge where i then lived in pursuance of a regimen which i believe finally built up his health that it was unsparing i can testify from my own share in one of his constitutionals in boston many years later  his experience in laying the groundwork for his history and his researches in making it thorough were such as to have liberated him to the knowledge of other manners and ideals but he remained strictly a bostonian and as immutably of the boston social and literary faith as any i knew in that capital of accomplished facts  he had lived like an indian among the wild western tribes he consorted with the canadian archaeologists in their mousings among the colonial archives of their fallen state every year he went to quebec or paris to study the history of new france in the original documents european society was open to him everywhere but he had those limitations which i nearly always found in the boston men i remember his talking to me of the rise of silas lapham in a somewhat troubled and uncertain strain and interpreting his rise as the achievement of social recognition without much or at all liking it or me for it  i did not think it my part to point out that i had supposed the rise to be a moral one and later i fell under his condemnation for certain high crimes and misdemeanors i had been guilty of against a wellknown ideal in fiction  these in fact constituted lesemajesty of romanticism which seemed to be disproportionately dear to a man who was in his own way trying to tell the truth of human nature as i was in mine  his displeasures passed however and my last meeting with our greatest historian as i think him was of unalloyed friendliness  he came to me during my final year in boston for nothing apparently but to tell me of his liking for a book of mine describing boylife in southern ohio a halfcentury ago  he wished to talk about many points of this which he found the same as his own boylife in the neighborhood of boston and we could agree that the life of the anglo saxon boy was pretty much the same everywhere  he had helped himself into my apartment with a crutch but i do not remember how he had fallen lame  it was the end of his long walks i believe and not long afterwards i had the grief to read of his death  i noticed that perhaps through his enforced quiet he had put on weight his fine face was full whereas when i first knew him he was almost delicately thin of figure and feature  he was always of a distinguished presence and his face had a great distinction  it had not the appealing charm i found in the face of james parton another historian i knew earlier in my boston days  i cannot say how much his books once so worthily popular are now known but i have an abiding sense of their excellence  i have not read the life of voltaire which was the last but all the rest from the first i have read and if there are better american biographies than those of franklin or of jefferson i could not say where to find them the greeley and the burr were younger books and so was the jackson and they were not nearly so good but to all the author had imparted the valuable humanity in which he abounded  he was never of the fine world of literature the world that sniffs and sneers and abashes the simplerhearted reader but he was a true artist and english born as he was he divined american character as few americans have done  he was a man of eminent courage and in the days when to be an agnostic was to be almost an outcast he had the heart to say of the mysteries that he did not know  he outlived the condemnation that this brought and i think that no man ever came near him without in some measure loving him  to me he was of a most winning personality which his strong gentle face expressed and a cast in the eye which he could not bring to bear directly upon his visavis endeared  i never met him without wishing more of his company for he seldom failed to say something to whatever was most humane and most modern in me  our last meeting was at newburyport whither he had long before removed from new york and where in the serene atmosphere of the ancient puritan town he found leisure and inspiration for his work he was not then engaged upon any considerable task and he had aged and broken somewhat  but the old geniality the old warmth glowed in him and made a summer amidst the storm of snow that blinded the wintry air without  a new light had then lately come into my life by which i saw all things that did not somehow tell for human brotherhood dwarfish and ugly and he listened as i imagined to what i had to say with the tolerant sympathy of a man who has been a long time thinking those things and views with a certain amusement the zeal of the fresh discoverer  there was yet another historian in boston whose acquaintance i made later than either parkmans or partons and whose very recent death leaves me with the grief of a friend  no ones indeed could meet john codman ropes without wishing to be his friend or without finding a friend in him  he had his likes and his dislikes but he could have had no enmities except for evil and meanness  i never knew a man of higher soul of sweeter nature and his whole life was a monument of character it cannot wound him now to speak of the cruel deformity which came upon him in his boyhood and haunted all his after days with suffering  his gentle face showed the pain which is always the part of the hunchback but nothing else in him confessed a sense of his affliction and the resolute activity of his mind denied it in every way  he was as is well known a very able lawyer in full practice while he was making his studies of military history and winning recognition for almost unique insight and thoroughness in that direction though i believe that when he came to embody the results in those extraordinary volumes recording the battles of our civil war he retired from the law in some measure  he knew these battles more accurately than the generals who fought them and he was of a like proficiency in the european wars from the time of napoleon down to our own time  i have heard a story which i cannot vouch for that when foreknowledge of his affliction at the outbreak of our civil war forbade him to be a soldier he became a student of soldiership and wreaked in that sort the passion of his most gallant spirit  but whether this was true or not it is certain that he pursued the study with a devotion which never blinded him to the atrocity of war some wars he could excuse and even justify but for any war that seemed wanton or aggressive he had only abhorrence  the last summer of a score that i had known him we sat on the veranda of his cottage at york harbor and looked out over the moonlit sea and he talked of the high and true things with the inextinguishable zest for the inquiry which i always found in him though he was then feeling the approaches of the malady which was so soon to end all groping in these shadows for him  he must have faced the fact with the same courage and the same trust with which he faced all facts  from the first i found him a deeply religious man not only in the ecclesiastical sense but in the more mystical meanings of the word and he kept his faith as he kept his youth to the last  every one who knew him knows how young he was in heart and how he liked to have those that were young in years about him he wished to have his house in boston as well as his cottage at york full of young men and young girls whose joy of life he made his own and whose society he preferred to his contemporaries  one could not blame him for that or for seeking the sun wherever he

end of this project gutenberg etext of literary boston by william dean howells       literary friends and acquaintancesoliver wendell holmes  by william dean howells    oliver wendell holmes   elsewhere we literary folk are apt to be such a common lot with tendencies here and there to be a shabby lot we arrive from all sorts of unexpected holes and corners of the earth remote obscure and at the best we do so often come up out of the ground but at boston we were of ascertained and noted origin and good part of us dropped from the skies instead of holding horses before the doors of theatres or capping verses at the ploughtail or tramping over europe with nothing but a flute in the pocket or walking up to the metropolis with no luggage but the ms of a tragedy or sleeping in doorways or under the arches of bridges or serving as apothecaries prenticeswe were good society from the beginning  i think this was none the worse for us and it was vastly the better for good society  literature in boston indeed was so respectable and often of so high a lineage that to be a poet was not only to be good society but almost to be good family  if one names over the men who gave boston her supremacy in literature during that unitarian harvesttime of the old puritanic seedtime which was her augustan age one names the people who were and who had been socially first in the city ever since the selfexile of the tories at the time of the revolution  to say prescott motley parkman lowell norton higginson dana emerson channing was to say patrician in the truest and often the best sense if not the largest  boston was small but these were of her first citizens and their primacy in its way was of the same quality as that say of the chief families of venice  but these names can never have the effect for the stranger that they had for one to the manner born  i say had for i doubt whether in boston they still mean all that they once meant and that their equivalents meant in science in law in politics  the most famous if not the greatest of all the literary men of boston i have not mentioned with them for longfellow was not of the place though by his sympathies and relations he became of it and i have not mentioned oliver wendell holmes because i think his name would come first into the readers thought with the suggestion of social quality in the humanities  holmes was of the brahminical caste which his humorous recognition invited from its subjectivity in the new england consciousness into the light where all could know it and own it and like longfellow he was allied to the patriciate of boston by the most intimate ties of life for a long time for the whole first period of his work he stood for that alone its tastes its prejudices its foibles even and when he came to stand in his second period for vastly for infinitely more and to make friends with the whole race as few men have ever done it was always i think with a secret shiver of doubt a backward look of longing and an eye askance  he was himself perfectly aware of this at times and would mark his several misgivings with a humorous sense of the situation  he was essentially too kind to be of a narrow world too human to be finally of less than humanity too gentle to be of the finest gentility  but such limitations as he had were in the direction i have hinted or perhaps more than hinted and i am by no means ready to make a mock of them as it would be so easy to do for some reasons that he has himself suggested  to value aright the affection which the old bostonian had for boston one must conceive of something like the patriotism of men in the times when a mans city was a mans country something athenian something florentine  the war that nationalized us liberated this love to the whole country but its first tenderness remained still for boston and i suppose a bostonian still thinks of himself first as a bostonian and then as an american in a way that no newyorker could deal with himself  the rich historical background dignifies and ennobles the intense public spirit of the place and gives it a kind of personality     ii  in literature doctor holmes survived all the bostonians who had given the city her primacy in letters but when i first knew him there was no apparent ground for questioning it  i do not mean now the time when i visited new england but when i came to live near boston and to begin the many happy years which i spent in her fine intellectual air i found time to run in upon him while i was there arranging to take my place on the atlantic monthly and i remember that in this brief moment with him he brought me to book about some vaunting paragraph in the nation claiming the literary primacy for new york  he asked me if i knew who wrote it and i was obliged to own that i had written it myself when with the kindness he always showed me he protested against my position  to tell the truth i do not think now i had any very good reasons for it and i certainly could urge none that would stand against his  i could only fall back upon the saving clause that this primacy was claimed mainly if not wholly for new york in the future  he was willing to leave me the connotations of prophecy but i think he did even this out of politeness rather than conviction and i believe he had always a sensitiveness where boston was concerned which could not seem ungenerous to any generous mind  whatever lingering doubt of me he may have had with reference to boston seemed to satisfy itself when several years afterwards he happened to speak of a certain character in an early novel of mine who was not quite the kind of bostonian one could wish to be the thing came up in talk with another person who had referred to my bostonian and the doctor had apparently made his acquaintance in the book and not liked him  i understood of course he said that he was a bostonian not the bostonian and i could truthfully answer that this was by all means my own understanding too  his fondness for his city which no one could appreciate better than myself i hope often found expression in a burlesque excess in his writings and in his talk perhaps oftener still  hard upon my return from venice i had a halfhour with him in his old study on charles street where he still lived in 1865 and while i was there a young man came in for the doctors help as a physician though he looked so very well and was so lively and cheerful that i have since had my doubts whether he had not made a pretext for a glimpse of him as the autocrat the doctor took him upon his word however and said he had been so long out of practice that he could not do anything for him but he gave him the address of another physician somewhere near washington street and if you dont know where washington street is he said with a gay burst at a certain vagueness which had come into the young mans face you dont know anything  we had been talking of venice and what life was like there and he made me tell him in some detail  he was especially interested in what i had to say of the minute subdivision and distribution of the necessaries the small coins and the small values adapted to their purchase the intensely retail character in fact of household provisioning and i could see how he pleased himself in formulating the theory that the higher a civilization the finer the apportionment of the demands and supplies  the ideal he said was a civilization in which you could buy two cents worth of beef and a divergence from this standard was towards barbarism  the secret of the man who is universally interesting is that he is universally interested and this was above all the secret of the charm that doctor holmes had for every one  no doubt he knew it for what that most alert intelligence did not know of itself was scarcely worth knowing  this knowledge was one of his chief pleasures i fancy he rejoiced in the consciousness which is one of the highest attributes of the highly organized man and he did not care for the consequences in your mind if you were so stupid as not to take him aright  i remember the delight henry james the father of the novelist had in reporting to me the frankness of the doctor when he had said to him holmes you are intellectually the most alive man i ever knew  i am i am said the doctor  from the crown of my head to the sole of my foot im alive im alive  any one who ever saw him will imagine the vivid relish he had in recognizing the fact  he could not be with you a moment without shedding upon you the light of his flashing wit his radiant humor and he shone equally upon the rich and poor in mind  his gaiety of heart could not withhold itself from any chance of response but he did wish always to be fully understood and to be liked by those he liked  he gave his liking cautiously though for the affluence of his sympathies left him without the reserves of colder natures and he had to make up for these with careful circumspection  he wished to know the character of the person who made overtures to his acquaintance for he was aware that his friendship lay close to it he wanted to be sure that he was a nice person and though i think he preferred social quality in his fellowman he did not refuse himself to those who had merely a sweet and wholesome humanity  he did not like anything that tasted or smelt of bohemianism in the personnel of literature but he did not mind the scent of the newploughed earth or even of the barnyard  i recall his telling me once that after two younger brothersinletters had called upon him in the odor of an habitual beeriness and smokiness he opened the window and the very last time i saw him he remembered at eightyfive the offence he had found on his first visit to new york when a metropolitan poet had asked him to lunch in a basement restaurant     iii  he seemed not to mind however climbing to the little apartment we had in boston when we came there in 1866 and he made this call upon us in due form bringing mrs holmes with him as if to accent the recognition socially  we were then incredibly young much younger than i find people ever are nowadays and in the consciousness of our youth we felt to the last exquisite value of the fact what it was to have the autocrat come to see us and i believe he was not displeased to perceive this he liked to know that you felt his quality in every way  that first winter however i did not see him often and in the spring we went to live in cambridge and thereafter i met him chiefly at longfellows or when i came in to dine at the fieldses in boston  it was at certain meetings of the dante club when longfellow read aloud his translation for criticism and there was supper later that one saw the doctor and his voice was heard at the supper rather than at the criticism for he was no italianate  he always seemed to like a certain turn of the talk toward the mystical but with space for the feet on a firm ground of fact this side of the shadows when it came to going over among them and laying hold of them with the band of faith as if they were substance he was not of the excursion  it is well known how fervent i cannot say devout a spiritualist longfellows brotherinlaw appleton was and when he was at the table too it took all the poets delicate skill to keep him and the autocrat from involving themselves in a cataclysmal controversy upon the matter of manifestations  with doctor holmes the inquiry was inquiry to the last i believe and the burden of proof was left to the ghosts and their friends  his attitude was strictly scientific he denied nothing but he expected the supernatural to be at least as convincing as the natural  there was a time in his history when the popular ignorance classed him with those who were once rudely called infidels but the world has since gone so fast and so far that the mind he was of concerning religious belief would now be thought religious by a good half of the religious world  it is true that he had and always kept a grudge against the ancestral calvinism which afflicted his youth and he was through all rises and lapses of opinion essentially unitarian but of the honest belief of any one i am sure he never felt or spoke otherwise than most tolerantly most tenderly  as often as he spoke of religion and his talk tended to it very often i never heard an irreligious word from him far less a scoff or sneer at religion and i am certain that this was not merely because he would have thought it bad taste though undoubtedly he would have thought it bad taste i think it annoyed it hurt him to be counted among the iconoclasts and he would have been profoundly grieved if he could have known how widely this false notion of him once prevailed  it can do no harm at this late day to impart from the secrets of the publishing house the fact that a supposed infidelity in the tone of his story the guardian angel cost the atlantic monthly many subscribers  now the tone of that story would not be thought even mildly agnostic i fancy and long before his death the author had outlived the error concerning him  it was not the best of his stories by any means and it would not be too harsh to say that it was the poorest  his novels all belonged to an order of romance which was as distinctly his own as the form of dramatized essay which he invented in the autocrat  if he did not think poorly of them he certainly did not think too proudly and i heard him quote with relish the phrase of a lady who had spoken of them to him as his medicated novels  that indeed was perhaps what they were a faint faint odor of the pharmacopoeia clung to their pages their magic was scientific  he knew this better than any one else of course and if any one had said it in his turn he would hardly have minded it  but what he did mind was the persistent misinterpretation of his intention in certain quarters where he thought he had the right to respectful criticism in stead of the succession of sneers that greeted the successive numbers of his story and it was no secret that he felt the persecution keenly  perhaps he thought that he had already reached that time in his literary life when he was a fact rather than a question and when reasons and not feelings must have to do with his acceptance or rejection  but he had to live many years yet before he reached this state  when he did reach it happily a good while before his death i do not believe any man ever enjoyed the like condition more he loved to feel himself out of the fight with much work before him still but with nothing that could provoke illwill in his activities  he loved at all times to take himself objectively if i may so express my sense of a mental attitude that misled many  as i have said before he was universally interested and he studied the universe from himself  i do not know how one is to study it otherwise the impersonal has really no existence but with all his subtlety and depth he was of a make so simple of a spirit so naive that he could not practise the feints some use to conceal that interest in self which after all every one knows is only concealed  he frankly and joyously made himself the startingpoint in all his inquest of the hearts and minds of other men but so far from singling himself out in this and standing apart in it there never was any one who was more eagerly and gladly your fellowbeing in the things of the soul     iv  in the things of the world he had fences and looked at some people through palings and even over the broken bottles on the tops of walls and i think he was the loser by this as well as they  but then i think all fences are bad and that god has made enough differences between men we need not trouble ourselves to multiply them  even behind his fences however holmes had a heart kind for the outsiders and i do not believe any one came into personal relations with him who did not experience this kindness  in that long and delightful talk i had with him on my return from venice i can praise the talk because it was mainly his we spoke of the status of domestics in the old world and how fraternal the relation of high and low was in italy while in england between master and man it seemed without acknowledgment of their common humanity yes he said i always felt as if english servants expected to be trampled on but i cant do that  if they want to be trampled on they must get some one else  he thought that our american way was infinitely better and i believe that in spite of the fences there was always an instinctive impulse with him to get upon common ground with his fellow man  i used to notice in the neighborhood cabman who served our block on beacon street a sort of affectionate reverence for the autocrat which could have come from nothing but the kindly terms between them if you went to him when he was engaged to doctor holmes he told you so with a sort of implication in his manner that the thought of anything else for the time was profanation  the good fellow who took him his drives about the beverly and manchester shores seemed to be quite in the joke of the doctors humor and within the bounds of his personal modesty and his functional dignity permitted himself a smile at the doctors sallies when you stood talking with him or listening to him at the carriage side  the civic and social circumstance that a man values himself on is commonly no part of his value and certainly no part of his greatness rather it is the very thing that limits him and i think that doctor holmes appeared in the full measure of his generous personality to those who did not and could not appreciate his circumstance and not to those who formed it and who from lifelong association were so dear and comfortable to him  those who best knew how great a man he was were those who came from far to pay him their duty or to thank him for some help they had got from his books or to ask his counsel or seek his sympathy  with all such he was most winningly tender most intelligently patient  i suppose no great author was ever more visited by letter and in person than he or kept a faithfuler conscience for his guests  with those who appeared to him in the flesh he used a miraculous tact and i fancy in his treatment of all the physician native in him bore a characteristic part  no one seemed to be denied access to him but it was after a moment of preparation that one was admitted and any one who was at all sensitive must have felt from the first moment in his presence that there could be no trespassing in point of time  if now and then some insensitive began to trespass there was a slidingscale of dismissal that never failed of its work and that really saved the author from the effect of intrusion  he was not bored because he would not be  i transfer at random the impressions of many years to my page and i shall not try to observe a chronological order in these memories  vivid among them is that of a visit which i paid him with osgood the publisher then newly the owner of the atlantic monthly when i had newly become the sole editor  we wished to signalize our accession to the control of the magazine by a stroke that should tell most in the public eye and we thought of asking doctor holmes to do something again in the manner of the autocrat and the professor at the breakfast table  some letters had passed between him and the management concerning our wish and then osgood thought that it would be right and fit for us to go to him in person  he proposed the visit and doctor holmes received us with a mind in which he had evidently formulated all his thoughts upon the matter his main question was whether at his age of sixty years a man was justified in seeking to recall a public of the past or to create a new public in the present  he seemed to have looked the ground over not only with a personal interest in the question but with a keen scientific zest for it as something which it was delightful to consider in its generic relations and i fancy that the pleasure of this inquiry more than consoled him for such pangs of misgiving as he must have had in the personal question  as commonly happens in the solution of such problems it was not solved he was very willing to take our minds upon it and to incur the risk if we thought it well and were willing to share it  we came away rejoicing and the new series began with the new year following  it was by no means the popular success that we had hoped not because the author had not a thousand new things to say or failed to say them with the gust and freshness of his immortal youth but because it was not well to disturb a form associated in the public mind with an achievement which had become classic  it is of the autocrat of the breakfast table that people think when they think of the peculiar species of dramatic essay which the author invented and they think also of the professor at the breakfast table because he followed so soon but the poet at the breakfast table came so long after that his advent alienated rather than conciliated liking  very likely if the poet had come first he would have had no second place in the affections of his readers for his talk was full of delightful matter and at least one of the poems which graced each instalment was one of the finest and greatest that doctor holmes ever wrote  i mean homesick in heaven which seems to me not only what i have said but one of the most important the most profoundly pathetic in the language  indeed i do not know any other that in the same direction goes so far with suggestion so penetrating the other poems were mainly of a cast which did not win the metaphysics in them were too much for the human interest and again there rose a foolish clamor of the creeds against him on account of them  the great talent the beautiful and graceful fancy the eager imagination of the autocrat could not avail in this third attempt and i suppose the poet at the breakfast table must be confessed as near a failure as doctor holmes could come  it certainly was so in the magazine which the brilliant success of the first had availed to establish in the high place the periodical must always hold in the history of american literature lowell was never tired of saying when he recurred to the first days of his editorship that the magazine could never have gone at all without the autocrat papers  he was proud of having insisted upon holmess doing something for the new venture and he was fond of recalling the authors misgivings concerning his contributions which later repeated themselves with too much reason though not with the reason that was in his own mind     v  he lived twentyfive years after that selfquestion at sixty and after eighty he continued to prove that threescore was not the limit of a mans intellectual activity or literary charm  during all that time the work he did in mere quantity was the work that a man in the prime of life might well have been vain of doing and it was of a quality not less surprising  if i asked him with any sort of fair notice i could rely upon him always for something for the january number and throughout the year i could count upon him for those occasional pieces in which he so easily excelled all former writers of occasional verse and which he liked to keep from the newspapers for the magazine  he had a pride in his promptness with copy and you could always trust his promise  the printers toe never galled the authors kibe in his case he wished to have an early proof which he corrected fastidiously but not overmuch and he did not keep it long  he had really done all his work in the manuscript which came printperfect and beautifully clear from his pen in that flowing graceful hand which to the last kept a suggestion of the pleasure he must have had in it  like all wise contributors he was not only patient but very glad of all the queries and challenges that proof reader and editor could accumulate on the margin of his proofs and when they were both altogether wrong he was still grateful  in one of his poems there was some latinquarter french which our collective purism questioned and i remember how tender of us he was in maintaining that in his parisian time at least some ladies beyond the seine said eh ben instead of eh bien  he knew that we must be always on the lookout for such little matters and he would not wound our ignorance i do not think any one enjoyed praise more than he  of course he would not provoke it but if it came of itself he would not deny himself the pleasure as long as a relish of it remained  he used humorously to recognize his delight in it and to say of the lecture audiences which in earlier times hesitated applause why dont they give me three times three  i can stand it  he himself gave in the generous fulness he desired  he did not praise foolishly or dishonestly though he would spare an open dislike but when a thing pleased him he knew how to say so cordially and skilfully so that it might help as well as delight i suppose no great author has tried more sincerely and faithfully to befriend the beginner than he and from time to time he would commend something to me that he thought worth looking at but never insistently in certain cases where he had simply to ease a burden from his own to the editorial shoulders he would ask that the aspirant might be delicately treated  there might be personal reasons for this but usually his kindness of heart moved him  his tastes had their geographical limit but his sympathies were boundless and the hopeless creature for whom he interceded was oftener remote from boston and new england than otherwise  it seems to me that he had a nature singularly affectionate and that it was this which was at fault if he gave somewhat too much of himself to the celebration of the class of 29 and all the multitude of boston occasions large and little embalmed in the clear amber of his verse somewhat to the disadvantage of the amber  if he were asked he could not deny the many friendships and fellowships which united in the asking the immediate reclame from these things was sweet to him but he loved to comply as much as he loved to be praised  in the pleasure he got he could feel himself a prophet in his own country but the country which owned him prophet began perhaps to feel rather too much as if it owned him and did not prize his vaticinations at all their worth  some polite bostonians knew him chiefly on this side and judged him to their own detriment from it     vi  after we went to live in cambridge my life and the delight in it were so wholly there that in ten years i had hardly been in as many boston houses  as i have said i met doctor holmes at the fieldses and at longfellows when he came out to a dante supper which was not often and somewhat later at the saturday club dinners  one parlous time at the publishers i have already recalled when mrs harriet beecher stowe and the autocrat clashed upon homeopathy and it required all the tact of the host to lure them away from the dangerous theme  as it was a battle waged in the courteous forms of fontenoy went on pretty well through the dinner and it was only over the coffee that a truce was called  i need not say which was heterodox or that each had a deep and strenuous conscience in the matter  i have always felt it a proof of his extreme leniency to me unworthy that the doctor was able to tolerate my own defection from the elder faith in medicine and i could not feel his kindness less caressing because i knew it a concession to an infirmity he said something like after all a good physician was the great matter and i eagerly turned his clemency to praise of our family doctor  he was very constant at the saturday club as long as his strength permitted and few of its members missed fewer of its meetings he continued to sit at its table until the ghosts of hawthorne of agassiz of emerson of longfellow of lowell out of others less famous bore him company there among the younger men in the flesh it must have been very melancholy but nothing could deeply cloud his most cheerful spirit  his strenuous interest in life kept him alive to all the things of it after so many of his friends were dead  the questions which he was wont to deal with so fondly so wisely the great problems of the soul were all the more vital perhaps because the personal concern in them was increased by the translation to some other being of the men who had so often tried with him to fathom them here the last time i was at that table he sat alone there among those great memories but he was as gay as ever i saw him his wit sparkled his humor gleamed the poetic touch was deft and firm as of old the serious curiosity the instant sympathy remained  to the witness he was pathetic but to himself he could only have been interesting as the figure of a man surviving in an alien but not unfriendly present the past which held so vast a part of all that had constituted him  if he had thought of himself in this way it would have been without one emotion of selfpity such as more maudlin souls indulge but with a love of knowledge and wisdom as keenly alert as in his prime  for three privileged years i lived all but nextdoor neighbor of doctor holmes in that part of beacon street whither he removed after he left his old home in charles street and during these years i saw him rather often  we were both on the water side which means so much more than the words say and our library windows commanded the same general view of the charles rippling out into the cambridge marshes and the sunsets and curving eastward under long bridge through shipping that increased onward to the sea  he said that you could count fourteen towns and villages in the compass of that view with the three conspicuous monuments accenting the different attractions of it the tower of memorial hall at harvard the obelisk on bunker hill and in the centre of the picture that bulk of tufts college which he said he expected to greet his eyes the first thing when he opened them in the other world but the prospect though generally the same had certain precious differences for each of us which i have no doubt he valued himself as much upon as i did  i have a notion that he fancied these were to be enjoyed best in his library through two oval panes let into the bay there apart from the windows for he was apt to make you come and look out of them if you got to talking of the view before you left  in this pleasant study he lived among the books which seemed to multiply from case to case and shelf to shelf and climb from floor to ceiling  everything was in exquisite order and the desk where he wrote was as scrupulously neat as if the sloven disarray of most authors desks were impossible to him he had a number of ingenious little contrivances for helping his work which he liked to show you for a time a revolving bookcase at the corner of his desk seemed to be his pet and after that came his fountainpen which he used with due observance of its fountain principle though he was tolerant of me when i said i always dipped mine in the inkstand it was a merit in his eyes to use a fountain pen in anywise  after you had gone over these objects with him and perhaps taken a peep at something he was examining through his microscope he sat down at one corner of his hearth and invited you to an easy chair at the other  his talk was always considerate of your wish to be heard but the person who wished to talk when he could listen to doctor holmes was his own victim and always the loser  if you were well advised you kept yourself to the question and response which manifested your interest in what he was saying and let him talk on with his sweet smile and that husky laugh he broke softly into at times  perhaps he was not very well when you came in upon him then he would name his trouble with a scientific zest and accuracy and pass quickly to other matters  as i have noted he was interested in himself only on the universal side and he liked to find his peculiarity in you better than to keep it his own he suffered a visible disappointment if he could not make you think or say you were so and so too  the querulous note was not in his most cheerful register he would not dwell upon a specialized grief though sometimes i have known him touch very lightly and currently upon a slight annoyance or disrelish for this or that  as he grew older he must have had of course an old mans disposition to speak of his infirmities but it was fine to see him catch himself up in this when he became conscious of it and stop short with an abrupt turn to something else  with a real interest which he gave humorous excess he would celebrate some little ingenious thing that had fallen in his way and i have heard him expatiate with childlike delight upon the merits of a new razor he had got a sort of mower which he could sweep recklessly over cheek and chin without the least danger of cutting himself  the last time i saw him he asked me if he had ever shown me that miraculous razor and i doubt if he quite liked my saying i had seen one of the same kind  it seemed to me that he enjoyed sitting at his chimneycorner rather as the type of a person having a good time than as such a person he would rather be up and about something taking down a book making a note going again to his little windows and asking you if you had seen the crows yet that sometimes alighted on the shoals left bare by the ebbtide behind the house  the reader will recall his lovely poem my aviary which deals with the winged life of that pleasant prospect  i shared with him in the flock of wildducks which used to come into our neighbor waters in spring when the ice broke up and stayed as long as the smallest space of brine remained unfrozen in the fall  he was graciously willing i should share in them and in the cloud of gulls which drifted about in the currents of the sea and sky there almost the whole year round  i did not pretend an original right to them coming so late as i did to the place and i think my deference pleased him     vii  as i have said he liked his fences or at least liked you to respect them or to be sensible of them  as often as i went to see him i was made to wait in the little receptionroom below and never shown at once to his study  my name would be carried up and i would hear him verifying my presence from the maid through the opened door then there came a cheery cry of wellcome is that you  come up come up and i found him sometimes halfway down the stairs to meet me  he would make an excuse for having kept me below a moment and say something about the rule he had to observe in all cases as if he would not have me feel his fence a personal thing  i was aware how thoroughly his gentle spirit pervaded the whole house the irish maid who opened the door had the effect of being a neighbor too and of being in the joke of the little formality she apologized in her turn for the receptionroom there was certainly nothing trampled upon in her manner but affection and reverence for him whose gate she guarded with something like the sentiment she would have cherished for a dignitary of the church but nicely differenced and adjusted to the autocrats peculiar merits  the last time i was in that place a visitant who had lately knocked at my own door was about to enter  i met the master of the house on the landing of the stairs outside his study and he led me in for the few moments we could spend together  he spoke of the shadow so near and said he supposed there could be no hope but he did not refuse the cheer i offered him from my ignorance against his knowledge and at something that was thought or said he smiled with even a breath of laughter so potent is the wont of a lifetime though his eyes were full of tears and his voice broke with his words  those who have sorrowed deepest will understand this best  it was during the few years of our beacon street neighborhood that he spent those hundred days abroad in his last visit to england and france he was full of their delight when he came back and my propinquity gave me the advantage of hearing him speak of them at first hand  he whimsically pleased himself most with his derbyday experiences and enjoyed contrasting the crowd and occasion with that of forty or fifty years earlier when he had seen some famous race of the derby won nothing else in england seemed to have moved him so much though all that royalties dignities and celebrities could well do for him had been done  of certain things that happened to him characteristic of the english and interesting to him in their relation to himself through his character of universally interested man he spoke freely but he has said what he chose to the public about them and i have no right to say more the thing that most vexed him during his sojourn apparently was to have been described in one of the london papers as quite deaf and i could truly say to him that i had never imagined him at all deaf or heard him accused of it before  oh yes he said i am a little hard of hearing on one side  but it isnt deafness  he had indeed few or none of the infirmities of age that make themselves painfully or inconveniently evident  he carried his slight figure erect and until his latest years his step was quick and sure once he spoke of the lessened height of old people apropos of something that was said and they will shrink you know he added as if he were not at all concerned in the fact himself  if you met him in the street you encountered a spare carefully dressed old gentleman with a clean shaven face and a friendly smile qualified by the involuntary frown of his thick senile brows well coated lustrously shod well gloved in a silk hat latterly wound with a mourningweed  sometimes he did not know you when he knew you quite well and at such times i think it was kind to spare his years the fatigue of recalling your identity at any rate i am glad of the times when i did so  in society he had the same vagueness the same dimness but after the moment he needed to make sure of you he was as vivid as ever in his life  he made me think of a bed of embers on which the ashes have thinly gathered and which when these are breathed away sparkles and tinkles keenly up with all the freshness of a newly kindled fire  he did not mind talking about his age and i fancied rather enjoyed doing so  its approaches interested him if he was going he liked to know just how and when he was going  once he spoke of his lasting strength in terms of imaginative humor he was still so intensely interested in nature the universe that it seemed to him he was not like an old man so much as a lusty infant which struggles against having the breast snatched from it  he laughed at the notion of this with that impersonal relish which seemed to me singularly characteristic of the selfconsciousness so marked in him  i never heard one lugubrious word from him in regard to his years  he liked your sympathy on all grounds where he could have it selfrespectfully but he was a most manly spirit and he would not have had it even as a type of the universal decay possibly he would have been interested to have you share in that analysis of himself which he was always making if such a thing could have been  he had not much patience with the unmanly craving for sympathy in others and chiefly in our literary craft which is somewhat ignobly given to it though he was patient after all  he used to say and i believe he has said it in printholmes said it in print many times in his three novels and scattered through the breakfast table series  dwthat unless a man could show a good reason for writing verse it was rather against him and a proof of weakness  i suppose this severe conclusion was something he had reached after dealing with innumerable small poets who sought the light in him with verses that no editor would admit to print  yet of morbidness he was often very tender he knew it to be disease something that must be scientifically rather than ethically treated  he was in the same degree kind to any sensitiveness for he was himself as sensitive as he was manly and he was most delicately sensitive to any rightful social claim upon him  i was once at a dinner with him where he was in some sort my host in a company of people whom he had not seen me with before and he made a point of acquainting me with each of them  it did not matter that i knew most of them already the proof of his thoughtfulness was precious and i was sorry when i had to disappoint it by confessing a previous knowledge     viii  i had three memorable meetings with him not very long before he died one a year before and the other two within a few months of the end  the first of these was at luncheon in the summerhouse of a friend whose hospitality made it summer the year round and we all went out to meet him when he drove up in his open carriage with the little sunshade in his hand which he took with him for protection against the heat and also a little i think for the whim of it  he sat a moment after he arrived as if to orient himself in respect to each of us  beside the gifted hostess there was the most charming of all the american essayists and the autocrat seemed at once to find himself singularly at home with the people who greeted him  there was no interval needed for fanning away the ashes he tinkled up before he entered the house and at the table he was as vivid and scintillant as i ever saw him if indeed i ever saw him as much so  the talk began at once and we had made him believe that there was nothing egotistic in his taking the word or turning it in illustration from himself upon universal matters  i spoke among other things of some humble ruins on the road to gloucester which gave the wayside a very aged look the tumbled foundationstones of poor bits of houses and ah he said the cellar and the well  he added to the company generally do you know what i think are the two lines of mine that go as deep as any others in a certain direction and he began to repeat stragglingly certain verses from one of his earlier poems until he came to the closing couplet  but i will give them in full because in going to look them up i have found them so lovely and because i can hear his voice again in every fondly accented syllable           who sees unmoved a ruin at his feet           the lowliest home where human hearts have beat           its hearthstone shaded with the bistre stain           a centurys showery torrents wash in vain           its starving orchard where the thistle blows           and mossy trunks still mark the broken rows           its chimneyloving poplar oftenest seen           next an old roof or where a roof has been           its knotgrass plantainall the social weeds           mans mute companions following where he leads           its dwarfed pale flowers that show their straggling heads           sown by the wind from grasschoked gardenbeds           its woodbine creeping where it used to climb           its roses breathing of the olden time           all the poor shows the curious idler sees           as lifes thin shadows waste by slow degrees           till naught remains the saddening tale to tell           save homes last wrecksthe cellar and the well  the poets chanting voice rose with a triumphant swell in the climax and there he said isnt it so  the cellar and the wellthey cant be thrown down or burnt up they are the human monuments that last longest and defy decay  he rejoiced openly in the sympathy that recognized with him the divination of a most pathetic most signal fact and he repeated the last couplet again at our entreaty glad to be entreated for it i do not know whether all will agree with him concerning the relative importance of the lines but i think all must feel the exquisite beauty of the picture to which they give the final touch  he said a thousand witty and brilliant things that day but his pleasure in this gave me the most pleasure and i recall the passage distinctly out of the dimness that covers the rest  he chose to figure us younger men in touching upon the literary circumstance of the past and present as representative of modern feeling and thinking and himself as no longer contemporary  we knew he did this to be contradicted and we protested affectionately fervently with all our hearts and minds and indeed there were none of his generation who had lived more widely into ours  he was not a prophet like emerson nor ever a voice crying in the wilderness like whittier or lowell  his note was heard rather amid the sweet security of streets but it was always for a finer and gentler civility  he imagined no new rule of life and no philosophy or theory of life will be known by his name  he was not constructive he was essentially observant and in this he showed the scientific nature he made his reader known to himself first in the little and then in the larger things  from first to last he was a censor but a most winning and delightful censor who could make us feel that our faults were other peoples and who was not wont            to bait his homilies with his brother worms  at one period he sat in the seat of the scorner as far as reform was concerned or perhaps reformers who are so often tedious and ridiculous but he seemed to get a new heart with the new mind which came to him when he began to write the autocrat papers and the light mocker of former days became the serious and compassionate thinker to whom most truly nothing that was human was alien  his readers trusted and loved him few men have ever written so intimately with so much dignity and perhaps none has so endeared himself by saying just the thing for his reader that his reader could not say for himself  he sought the universal through himself in others and he found to his delight and theirs that the most universal thing was often if not always the most personal thing  in my later meetings with him i was struck more and more by his gentleness  i believe that men are apt to grow gentler as they grow older unless they are of the curmudgeon type which rusts and crusts with age but with doctor holmes the gentleness was peculiarly marked he seemed to shrink from all things that could provoke controversy or even difference he waived what might be a matter of dispute and rather sought the things that he could agree with you upon  in the last talk i had with him he appeared to have no grudge left except for the puritanic orthodoxy in which he had been bred as a child  this he was not able to forgive though its tradition was interwoven with what was tenderest and dearest in his recollections of childhood  we spoke of puritanism and i said i sometimes wondered what could be the mind of a man towards life who had not been reared in its awful shadow say an english churchman or a continental catholic and he said he could not imagine and that he did not believe such a man could at all enter into our feelings puritanism he seemed to think made an essential and ineradicable difference  i do not believe he had any of that false sentiment which attributes virtue of character to severity of creed while it owns the creed to be wrong  he differed from longfellow in often speaking of his contemporaries  he spoke of them frankly but with an appreciative rather than a censorious criticism  of longfellow himself he said that day when i told him i had been writing about him and he seemed to me a man without error that he could think of but one error in him and that was an error of taste of almost merely literary taste  it was at an earlier time that he talked of lowell after his death and told me that lowell once in the fever of his antislavery apostolate had written him urging him strongly as a matter of duty to come out for the cause he had himself so much at heart  afterwards lowell wrote again owning himself wrong in his appeal which he had come to recognize as invasive  he was ten years younger than i said the doctor  i found him that day i speak of in his house at beverly farms where he had a pleasant study in a corner by the porch and he met me with all the cheeriness of old  but he confessed that he had been greatly broken up by the labor of preparing something that might be read at some commemorative meeting and had suffered from finding first that he could not write something specially for it  even the copying and adapting an old poem had overtaxed him and in this he showed the failing powers of age  but otherwise he was still young intellectually that is there was no failure of interest in intellectual things especially literary things  some new book lay on the table at his elbow and he asked me if i had seen it and made some joke about his having had the good luck to read it and have it lying by him a few days before when the author called  i do not know whether he schooled himself against an old mans tendency to revert to the past or not but i know that he seldom did so that morning however he made several excursions into it and told me that his youthful satire of the spectre pig had been provoked by a poem of the elder danas where a phantom horse had been seriously employed with an effect of anticlimax which he had found irresistible  another foray was to recall the oppression and depression of his early religious associations and to speak with moving tenderness of his father whose hard doctrine as a minister was without effect upon his own kindly nature  in a letter written to me a few weeks after this time upon an occasion when he divined that some word from him would be more than commonly dear he recurred to the feeling he then expressed fiftysix years agomore than half a centuryi lost my own father his age being seventythree years  as i have reached that period of life passed it and now left it far behind my recollections seem to brighten and bring back my boyhood and early manhood in a clearer and fairer light than it came to me in my middle decades  i have often wished of late years that i could tell him how i cherished his memory perhaps i may have the happiness of saying all i long to tell him on the other side of that thin partition which i love to think is all that divides us  men are never long together without speaking of women and i said how inevitably mens lives ended where they began in the keeping of women and their strength failed at last and surrendered itself to their care i had not finished before i was made to feel that i was poaching and yes said the owner of the preserve i have spoken of that and he went on to tell me just where  he was not going to have me suppose i had invented those notions and i could not do less than own that i must have found them in his book and forgotten it  he spoke of his pleasant summer life in the air at once soft and fresh of that lovely coast and of his drives up and down the country roads sometimes this lady and sometimes that came for him and one or two habitually but he always had his own carriage ordered if they failed that he might not fail of his drive in any fair weather  his cottage was not immediately on the sea but in full sight of it and there was a sense of the sea about it as there is in all that incomparable region and i do not think he could have been at home anywhere beyond the reach of its salt breath  i was anxious not to outstay his strength and i kept my eye on the clock in frequent glances  i saw that he followed me in one of these and i said that i knew what his hours were and i was watching so that i might go away in time and then he sweetly protested  did i like that chair i was sitting in  it was a gift to him and he said who gave it with a pleasure in the fact that was very charming as if he liked the association of the thing with his friend  he was disposed to excuse the formal look of his bookcases which were filled with sets and presented some phalanxes of fiction in rather severe array  when i rose to go he was concerned about my being able to find my way readily to the station and he told me how to go and what turns to take as if he liked realizing the way to himself  i believe he did not walk much of late years and i fancy he found much the same pleasure in letting his imagination make this excursion to the station with me that he would have found in actually going  i saw him once more but only once when a day or two later he drove up by our hotel in magnolia toward the cottage where his secretary was lodging  he saw us from his carriage and called us gayly to him to make us rejoice with him at having finally got that commemorative poem off his mind  he made a jest of the trouble it had cost him even some sleeplessness and said he felt now like a convalescent  he was all brightness and friendliness and eagerness to make us feel his mood through what was common to us all and i am glad that this last impression of him is so one with the first i ever had and with that which every reader receives from his work  that is bright and friendly and eager too for it is throughout the very expression of himself  i think it is a pity if an author disappoints even the unreasonable expectation of the reader whom his art has invited to love him but i do not believe that doctor holmes could inflict this disappointment  certainly he could disappoint no reasonable expectation no intelligent expectation  what he wrote that he was and every one felt this who met him  he has therefore not died as some men die the remote impersonal sort but he is yet thrillingly alive in every page of his books  the quantity of his literature is not great but the quality is very surprising and surprising first of all as equality  from the beginning to the end he wrote one man of course in his successive consciousnesses  perhaps every one does this but his work gives the impression of an uncommon continuity in spite of its being the effect of a later and an earlier impulse so very marked as to have made the later an astonishing revelation to those who thought they knew him     ix  it is not for me in such a paper as this to attempt any judgment of his work  i have loved it as i loved him with a sense of its limitations which is by no means a censure of its excellences  he was not a man who cared to transcend he liked bounds he liked horizons the constancy of shores  if he put to sea he kept in sight of land like the ancient navigators  he did not discover new continents and i will own that i for my part should not have liked to sail with columbus  i think one can safely affirm that as great and as useful men stayed behind and found an america of the mind without stirring from their thresholds     etext editors bookmarks  appeal which he had come to recognize

the mystical work gives the impression of an uncommon continuity     end of this project gutenberg etext of oliver wendell holmes by william dean howells       literary friends and acquaintancesthe white mr longfellow  by william dean howells   the white mr longfellow   we had expected to stay in boston only until we could find a house in old cambridge  this was not so simple a matter as it might seem for the ancient town had not yet quickened its scholarly pace to the modern step indeed in the spring of 1866 the impulse of expansion was not yet visibly felt anywhere the enormous material growth that followed the civil war had not yet begun  in cambridge the houses to be let were few and such as there were fell either below our pride or rose above our purse  i wish i might tell how at last we bought a house we had no money but we were rich in friends who are still alive to shrink from the story of their constant faith in a financial future which we sometimes doubted and who backed their credulity with their credit it is sufficient for the present record which professes to be strictly literary to notify the fact that on the first day of may 1866 we went out to cambridge and began to live in a house which we owned in fee if not in deed and which was none the less valuable for being covered with mortgages  physically it was a carpenters box of a sort which is readily imagined by the angloamerican genius for ugliness but which it is not so easy to impart a just conception of  a trim hedge of arbor vita tried to hide it from the world in front and a tall board fence behind the little lot was well planted perhaps too well planted with pears grapes and currants and there was a small open space which i lost no time in digging up for a kitchengarden  on one side of us were the open fields on the other a brief line of neighborhouses across the street before us was a grove of stately oaks which i never could persuade aldrich had painted leaves on them in the fall  we were really in a poor suburb of a suburb but such is the fascination of ownership even the ownership of a fully mortgaged property that we calculated the latitude and longitude of the whole earth from the spot we called ours in our walks about cambridge we saw other places where we might have been willing to live only we said they were too far off we even prized the architecture of our little box though we had but so lately lived in a gothic palace on the grand canal in venice and were not uncritical of beauty in the possessions of others  positive beauty we could not have honestly said we thought our cottage had as a whole though we might have held out for something of the kind in the brackets of turned wood under its eaves  but we were richly content with it and with life in cambridge as it began to open itself to us we were infinitely more than content  this life so refined so intelligent so gracefully simple i do not suppose has anywhere else had its parallel     i  it was the moment before the old american customs had been changed by european influences among people of easier circumstances and in cambridge society kept what was best of its village traditions and chose to keep them in the full knowledge of different things  nearly every one had been abroad and nearly every one had acquired the taste for olives without losing a relish for native sauces through the intellectual life there was an entire democracy and i do not believe that since the capitalistic era began there was ever a community in which money counted for less  there was little show of what money could buy i remember but one private carriage naturally a publishers and there was not one livery except a livery in the larger sense kept by the stableman pike who made us pay now a quarter and now a half dollar for a seat in his carriages according as he lost or gathered courage for the charge  we thought him extortionate and we mostly walked through snow and mud of amazing depth and thickness  the reader will imagine how acceptable this circumstance was to a young literary man beginning life with a fully mortgaged house and a salary of untried elasticity  if there were distinctions made in cambridge they were not against literature and we found ourselves in the midst of a charming society indifferent apparently to all questions but those of the higher education which comes so largely by nature  that is to say in the cambridge of that day and i dare say of this a mind cultivated in some sort was essential and after that came civil manners and the willingness and ability to be agreeable and interesting but the question of riches or poverty did not enter  even the question of family which is of so great concern in new england was in abeyance  perhaps it was taken for granted that every one in old cambridge society must be of good family or he could not be there perhaps his mere residence tacitly ennobled him certainly his acceptance was an informal patent of gentility  to my mind the structure of society was almost ideal and until we have a perfectly socialized condition of things i do not believe we shall ever have a more perfect society  the instincts which governed it were not such as can arise from the sordid competition of interests they flowed from a devotion to letters and from a selfsacrifice in material things which i can give no better notion of than by saying that the outlay of the richest college magnate seemed to be graduated to the income of the poorest  in those days the men whose names have given splendor to cambridge were still living there  i shall forget some of them in the alphabetical enumeration of louis agassiz francis j child richard henry dana jun john fiske dr asa gray the family of the jameses father and sons lowell longfellow charles eliot norton dr john g palfrey james pierce dr peabody professor parsons professor sophocles  the variety of talents and of achievements was indeed so great that mr bret harte when fresh from his pacific slope justly said after listening to a partial rehearsal of them why you couldnt fire a revolver from your front porch anywhere without bringing down a twovolumer  everybody had written a book or an article or a poem or was in the process or expectation of doing it and doubtless those whose names escape me will have greater difficulty in eluding fame  these kindly these gifted folk each came to see us and to make us at home among them and my home is still among them on this side and on that side of the line between the living and the dead which invisibly passes through all the streets of the cities of men     ii  we had the whole summer for the exploration of cambridge before society returned from the mountains and the seashore and it was not till october that i saw longfellow  i heard again as i heard when i first came to boston that he was at nahant and though nahant was no longer so far away now as it was then i did not think of seeking him out even when we went for a day to explore that coast during the summer  it seems strange that i cannot recall just when and where i saw him but early after his return to cambridge i had a message from him asking me to come to a meeting of the dante club at craigie house  longfellow was that winter 18667 revising his translation of the paradiso and the dante club was the circle of italianate friends and scholars whom he invited to follow him and criticise his work from the original while he read his version aloud  those who were most constantly present were lowell and professor norton but from time to time others came in and we seldom sat down at the nineoclock supper that followed the reading of the canto in less number than ten or twelve  the criticism especially from the accomplished danteists i have named was frank and frequent  i believe they neither of them quite agreed with longfellow as to the form of version he had chosen but waiving that the question was how perfectly he had done his work upon the given lines i myself with whatever right great or little i may have to an opinion believe thoroughly in longfellows plan  when i read his version my sense aches for the rhyme which he rejected but my admiration for his fidelity to dante otherwise is immeasurable  i remember with equal admiration the subtle and sympathetic scholarship of his critics who scrutinized every shade of meaning in a word or phrase that gave them pause and did not let it pass till all the reasons and facts had been considered  sometimes and even often longfellow yielded to their censure but for the most part when he was of another mind he held to his mind and the passage had to go as he said  i make a little haste to say that in all the meetings of the club during a whole winter of wednesday evenings i myself though i faithfully followed in an italian dante with the rest ventured upon one suggestion only  this was kindly even seriously considered by the poet and gently rejected  he could not do anything otherwise than gently and i was not suffered to feel that i had done a presumptuous thing  i can see him now as he looked up from the proofsheets on the round table before him and over at me growing consciously smaller and smaller like something through a reversed operaglass  he had a shaded droplight in front of him and in its glow his beautiful and benignly noble head had a dignity peculiar to him  all the portraits of longfellow are likenesses more or less bad and good for there was something as simple in the physiognomy as in the nature of the man  his head after he allowed his beard to grow and wore his hair long in the manner of elderly men was leonine but mildly leonine as the old painters conceived the lion of st mark  once sophocles the ex monk of mount athos so long a greek professor at harvard came in for supper after the reading was over and he was leonine too but of a fierceness that contrasted finely with longfellows mildness  i remember the poets asking him something about the punishment of impaling in turkey and his answering with an ironical gleam of his fiery eyes unhappily it is obsolete  i dare say he was not so leonine either as he looked  when longfellow read verse it was with a hollow with a mellow resonant murmur like the note of some deepthroated horn  his voice was very lulling in quality and at the dante club it used to have early effect with an old scholar who sat in a cavernous armchair at the corner of the fire and who drowsed audibly in the soft tone and the gentle heat  the poet had a fat terrier who wished always to be present at the meetings of the club and he commonly fell asleep at the same moment with that dear old scholar so that when they began to make themselves heard in concert one could not tell which it was that most took our thoughts from the text of the paradiso  when the duet opened longfellow would look up with an arch recognition of the fact and then go gravely on to the end of the canto  at the close he would speak to his friend and lead him out to supper as if he had not seen or heard anything amiss     iii  in that elect company i was silent partly because i was conscious of my youthful inadequacy and partly because i preferred to listen  but longfellow always behaved as if i were saying a succession of edifying and delightful things and from time to time he addressed himself to me so that i should not feel left out  he did not talk much himself and i recall nothing that he said  but he always spoke both wisely and simply without the least touch of pose and with no intention of effect but with something that i must call quality for want of a better word so that at a table where holmes sparkled and lowell glowed and agassiz beamed he cast the light of a gentle gaiety which seemed to dim all these vivider luminaries  while he spoke you did not miss fieldss story or tom appletons wit or even the gracious amity of mr norton with his unequalled intuitions  the supper was very plain a cold turkey which the host carved or a haunch of venison or some braces of grouse or a platter of quails with a deep bowl of salad and the sympathetic companionship of those elect vintages which longfellow loved and which he chose with the inspiration of affection  we usually began with oysters and when some one who was expected did not come promptly longfellow invited us to raid his plate as a just punishment of his delay  one evening lowell remarked with the cayenne poised above his bluepoints its astonishing how fond these fellows are of pepper  the old friend of the cavernous armchair was perhaps not wide enough awake to repress an ah of deep interest in this fact of natural history and lowell was provoked to go on  yes ive dropped a red pepper pod into a barrel of them before now and then taken them out in a solid mass clinging to it like a swarm of bees to their queen  is it possible cried the old friend and then longfellow intervened to save him from worse and turned the talk  i reproach myself that i made no record of the talk for i find that only a few fragments of it have caught in my memory and that the sieve which should have kept the gold has let it wash away with the gravel i remember once doctor holmess talking of the physician as the true seer whose awful gift it was to behold with the fatal second sight of science the shroud gathering to the throat of many a doomed man apparently in perfect health and happy in the promise of unnumbered days  the thought may have been suggested by some of the toys of superstition which intellectual people like to play with  i never could be quite sure at first that longfellows brotherinlaw appleton was seriously a spiritualist even when he disputed the most strenuously with the unbelieving autocrat  but he really was in earnest about it though he relished a joke at the expense of his doctrine like some clerics when they are in the safe company of other clerics  he told me once of having recounted to agassiz the facts of a very remarkable seance where the souls of the departed outdid themselves in the athletics and acrobatics they seem so fond of over there throwing large stones across the room moving pianos and lifting dinnertables and setting them atwirl under the chandelier  and now he demanded what do you say to that  well mr appleton agassiz answered to appletons infinite delight i say that it did not happen  one night they began to speak at the dante supper of the unhappy man whose crime is a red stain in the cambridge annals and one and another recalled their impressions of professor webster  it was possibly with a retroactive sense that they had all felt something uncanny in him but apropos of the deep saladbowl in the centre of the table longfellow remembered a supper webster was at where he lighted some chemical in such a dish and held his head over it with a handkerchief noosed about his throat and lifted above it with one hand while his face in the pale light took on the livid ghastliness of that of a man hanged by the neck  another night the talk wandered to the visit which an english author now with god paid america at the height of a popularity long since toppled to the ground with many another  he was in very good humor with our whole continent and at longfellows table he found the champagne even surprisingly fine  but he said to his host who now told the story it cawnt be genuine you know  many years afterwards this author revisited our shores and i dined with him at longfellows where he was anxious to constitute himself a guest during his sojourn in our neighborhood  longfellow was equally anxious that he should not do so and he took a harmless pleasure in out manoeuvring him  he seized a chance to speak with me alone and plotted to deliver him over to me without apparent unkindness when the latest horsecar should be going in to boston and begged me to walk him to harvard square and put him aboard  put him aboard and dont leave him till the car starts and then watch that he doesnt get off  these instructions he accompanied with a lifting of the eyebrows and a pursing of the mouth in an anxiety not altogether burlesque  he knew himself the prey of any one who chose to batten on him and his hospitality was subject to frightful abuse  perhaps mr norton has somewhere told how when he asked if a certain person who had been outstaying his time was not a dreadful bore longfellow answered with angelic patience yes but then you know i have been bored so often  there was one fatal englishman whom i shared with him during the great part of a season a poor soul not without gifts but always ready for more especially if they took the form of meat and drink  he had brought letters from one of the best english men alive who withdrew them too late to save his american friends from the sad consequences of welcoming him  so he established himself impregnably in a boston club and came out every day to dine with longfellow in cambridge beginning with his return from nahant in october and continuing far into december  that was the year of the great horsedistemper when the plague disabled the transportation in boston and cut off all intercourse between the suburb and the city on the street railways  i did think longfellow pathetically lamented that when the horsecars stopped running i should have a little respite from l but he walks out  in the midst of his own suffering he was willing to advise with me concerning some poems l had offered to the atlantic monthly and after we had desperately read them together he said with inspiration i think these things are more adapted to music than the magazine and this seemed so good a notion that when l came to know their fate from me i answered confidently i think they are rather more adapted to music he calmly asked why and as this was an exigency which longfellow had not forecast for me i was caught in it without hope of escape  i really do not know what i said but i know that i did not take the poems such was my literary conscience in those days i am afraid i should be weaker now     iv  the suppers of the dante club were a relaxation from the severity of their toils on criticism and i will not pretend that their tabletalk was of that seriousness which duller wits might have given themselves up to  the passing stranger especially if a light or jovial person was always welcome and i never knew of the enforcement of the rule i heard of that if you came in without question on the club nights you were a guest but if you rang or knocked you could not get in  any sort of diversion was hailed and once appleton proposed that longfellow should show us his winecellar  he took up the candle burning on the table for the cigars and led the way into the basement of the beautiful old colonial mansion doubly memorable as washingtons headquarters while he was in cambridge and as the home of longfellow for so many years  the taper cast just the right gleams on the darkness bringing into relief the massive piers of brick and the solid walls of stone which gave the cellar the effect of a casemate in some fortress and leaving the corners and distances to a romantic gloom  this basement was a work of the days when men built more heavily if not more substantially than now but i forget if i ever knew what date the wine cellar was of  it was well stored with precious vintages aptly cobwebbed and dusty but i could not find that it had any more charm than the shelves of a library it is the inside of bottles and of books that makes its appeal  the whole place witnessed a bygone state and luxury which otherwise lingered in a dim legend or two  longfellow once spoke of certain old loveletters which dropped down on the basement stairs from some place overhead and there was the fable or the fact of a subterranean passage under the street from craigie house to the old batchelder house which i relate to these letters with no authority i can allege  but in craigie house dwelt the proud fair lady who was buried in the cambridge churchyard with a slave at her head and a slave at her feet                 dust is in her beautiful eyes  and whether it was they that smiled or wept in their time over those loveletters i will leave the reader to say  the fortunes of her tory family fell with those of their party and the last vassal ended his days a prisoner from his creditors in his own house with a weekly enlargement on sundays when the law could not reach him  it is known how the place took longfellows fancy when he first came to be professor in harvard and how he was a lodger of the last mistress craigie there long before he became its owner  the house is square with longfellows study where he read and wrote on the right of the door and a statelier library behind it on the left is the drawingroom with the diningroom in its rear from its square hall climbs a beautiful stairway with twisted banisters and a tall clock in their angle  the study where the dante club met and where i mostly saw longfellow was a plain pleasant room with broad panelling in white painted pine in the centre before the fireplace stood his round table laden with books papers and proofs in the farthest corner by the window was a high desk which he sometimes stood at to write  in this room washington held his councils and transacted his business with all comers in the chamber overhead he slept  i do not think longfellow associated the place much with him and i never heard him speak of washington in relation to it except once when he told me with peculiar relish what he called the true version of a pious story concerning the aidedecamp who blundered in upon him while he knelt in prayer  the father of his country rose and rebuked the young man severely and then resumed his devotions  he rebuked him said longfellow lifting his brows and making rings round the pupils of his eyes by throwing his scabbard at his head  all the front windows of craigie house look out over the open fields across the charles which is now the longfellow memorial garden  the poet used to be amused with the popular superstition that he was holding this vacant ground with a view to a rise in the price of lots while all he wanted was to keep a feature of his beloved landscape unchanged lofty elms drooped at the corners of the house on the lawn billowed clumps of the lilac which formed a thick hedge along the fence  there was a terrace part way down this lawn and when a whitepainted balustrade was set some fifteen years ago upon its brink it seemed always to have been there  long verandas stretched on either side of the mansion and behind was an oldfashioned garden with beds primly edged with box after a design of the poets own  longfellow had a ghost story of this quaint plaisance which he used to tell with an artful reserve of the catastrophe  he was coming home one winter night and as he crossed the garden he was startled by a white figure swaying before him  but he knew that the only way was to advance upon it  he pushed boldly forward and was suddenly caught under the throatby the clothesline with a long nightgown on it  perhaps it was at the end of a long night of the dante club that i heard him tell this story  the evenings were sometimes mornings before the reluctant breakup came but they were never half long enough for me i have given no idea of the high reasoning of vital things which i must often have heard at that table and that i have forgotten it is no proof that i did not hear it  the memory will not be ruled as to what it shall bind and what it shall loose and i should entreat mine in vain for record of those meetings other than what i have given  perhaps it would be well in the interest of some popular conceptions of what the social intercourse of great wits must be for me to invent some ennobling and elevating passages of conversation at longfellows perhaps i ought to do it for the sake of my own repute as a serious and adequate witness  but i am rather helpless in the matter i must set down what i remember and surely if i can remember no phrase from holmes that a reader could live or die by it is something to recall how when a certain potent cheese was passing he leaned over to gaze at it and asked does it kick does it kick  no strain of high poetic thinking remains to me from lowell but he made me laugh unforgettably with his passive adventure one night going home late when a man suddenly leaped from the top of a high fence upon the sidewalk at his feet and after giving him the worst fright of his life disappeared peaceably into the darkness  to be sure there was one most memorable supper when he read the bigelow paper he had finished that day and enriched the meaning of his verse with the beauty of his voice  there lingers yet in my sense his very tone in giving the last line of the passage lamenting the waste of the heroic lives which in those dark hours of johnsons time seemed to have been            butchered to make a blind mans holiday  the hush that followed upon his ceasing was of that finest quality which spoken praise always lacks and i suppose that i could not give a just notion of these dante club evenings without imparting the effect of such silences  this i could not hopefully undertake to do but i am tempted to some effort of the kind by my remembrance of longfellows old friend george washington greene who often came up from his home in rhode island to be at those sessions and who was a most interesting and amiable fact of those delicate silences  a full half of his earlier life had been passed in italy where he and longfellow met and loved each other in their youth with an affection which the poet was constant to in his age after many vicissitudes with the beautiful fidelity of his nature  greene was like an old italian housepriest in manner gentle suave very suave smooth as creamy curds cultivated in the elegancies of literary taste and with a certain meek abeyance  i think i never heard him speak in all those evenings except when longfellow addressed him though he must have had the dante scholarship for an occasional criticism  it was at more recent dinners where i met him with the longfellow family alone that he broke now and then into a quotation from some of the modern italian poets he knew by heart preferably giusti and syllabled their verse with an exquisite roman accent and a bewitching florentine rhythm  now and then at these times he brought out a faded italian anecdote faintly smelling of civet and threadbare in its ancient texture  he liked to speak of goldoni and of nota of niccolini and manzoni of monti and leopardi and if you came to america of the revolution and his grandfather the quaker general nathaniel greene whose life he wrote and i read in three volumes  he worshipped longfellow and their friendship continued while they lived but towards the last of his visits at craigie house it had a pathos for the witness which i should grieve to wrong  greene was then a quivering paralytic and he clung tremulously to longfellows arm in going out to dinner where even the modern italian poets were silent upon his lips  when we rose from table longfellow lifted him out of his chair and took him upon his arm again for their return to the study  he was of lighter metal than most other members of the dante club and he was not of their immediate intimacy living away from cambridge as he did and i shared his silence in their presence with full sympathy i was by far the youngest of their number and i cannot yet quite make out why i was of it at all  but at every moment i was as sensible of my good fortune as of my ill desert  they were the men whom of all men living i most honored and it seemed to be impossible that i at my age should be so perfectly fulfilling the dream of my life in their company often the nights were very cold and as i returned home from craigie house to the carpenters box on sacramento street a mile or two away i was as if soulborne through the air by my pride and joy while the frozen blocks of snow clinked and tinkled before my feet stumbling along the middle of the road  i still think that was the richest moment of my life and i look back at it as the moment in a life not unblessed by chance which i would most like to live over againif i must live any the next winter the sessions of the dante club were transferred to the house of mr norton who was then completing his version of the vita nuova  this has always seemed to me a work of not less graceful art than longfellows translation of the commedia  in fact it joins the effect of a sympathy almost mounting to divination with a patient scholarship and a delicate skill unknown to me elsewhere in such work i do not know whether mr norton has satisfied himself better in his prose version of the commedia than in this of the vita nuova but i do not believe he could have satisfied dante better unless he had rhymed his sonnets and canzonets  i am sure he might have done this if he had chosen  he has always pretended that it was impossible but miracles are never impossible in the right hands     v  after three or four years we sold the carpenters box on sacramento street and removed to a larger house near harvard square and in the immediate neighborhood of longfellow  he gave me an easement across that old garden behind his house through an opening in the high board fence which enclosed it and i saw him oftener than ever though the meetings of the dante club had come to an end  at the last of them lowell had asked him with fond regret in his jest longfellow why dont you do that indian poem in forty thousand verses  the demand but feebly expressed the reluctance in us all though i suspect the indian poem existed only by the challengers invention  before i leave my faint and unworthy record of these great times i am tempted to mention an incident poignant with tragical associations  the first night after christmas the holly and the pine wreathed about the chandelier above the suppertable took fire from the gas just as we came out from the reading and longfellow ran forward and caught the burning garlands down and bore them out  no one could speak for thinking what he must be thinking of when the ineffable calamity of his home befell it  curtis once told me that a little while before mrs longfellows death he was driving by craigie house with holmes who said be trembled to look at it for those who lived there had their happiness so perfect that no change of all the changes which must come to them could fail to be for the worse i did not know longfellow before that fatal time and i shall not say that his presence bore record of it except in my fancy  he may always have had that look of one who had experienced the utmost harm that fate can do and henceforth could possess himself of what was left of life in peace  he could never have been a man of the flowing ease that makes all comers at home some people complained of a certain gene in him and he had a reserve with strangers which never quite lost itself in the abandon of friendship as lowells did  he was the most perfectly modest man i ever saw ever imagined but he had a gentle dignity which i do not believe any one the coarsest the obtusest could trespass upon  in the years when i began to know him his long hair and the beautiful beard which mixed with it were of one irongray which i saw blanch to a perfect silver while that pearly tone of his complexion which appleton so admired lost itself in the wanness of age and pain  when he walked he had a kind of spring in his gait as if now and again a buoyant thought lifted him from the ground  it was fine to meet him coming down a cambridge street you felt that the encounter made you a part of literary history and set you apart with him for the moment from the poor and mean  when he appeared in harvard square he beatified if not beautified the ugliest and vulgarest looking spot on the planet outside of new york  you could meet him sometimes at the market if you were of the same provisionman as he and longfellow remained as constant to his tradespeople as to any other friends  he rather liked to bring his proofs back to the printers himself and we often found ourselves together at the university press where the atlantic monthly used to be printed  but outside of his own house longfellow seemed to want a fit atmosphere and i love best to think of him in his study where he wrought at his lovely art with a serenity expressed in his smooth regular and scrupulously perfect handwriting  it was quite vertical and rounded with a slope neither to the right nor left and at the time i knew him first he was fond of using a soft pencil on printing paper though commonly he wrote with a quill  each letter was distinct in shape and between the verses was always the exact space of half an inch i have a good many of his poems written in this fashion but whether they were the first drafts or not i cannot say very likely not  towards the last he no longer sent his poems to the magazines in his own hand but they were always signed in autograph  i once asked him if he were not a great deal interrupted and he said with a faint sigh not more than was good for him he fancied if it were not for the interruptions he might overwork  he was not a friend to stated exercise i believe nor fond of walking as lowell was he had not indeed the childish associations of the younger poet with the cambridge neighborhoods and i never saw him walking for pleasure except on the east veranda of his house though i was told he loved walking in his youth  in this and in some other things longfellow was more european than american more latin than saxon  he once said quaintly that one got a great deal of exercise in putting on and off ones overcoat and overshoes  i suppose no one who asked decently at his door was denied access to him and there must have been times when he was overrun with volunteer visitors but i never heard him complain of them  he was very charitable in the immediate sort which christ seems to have meant but he had his preferences humorously owned among beggars  he liked the german beggars least and the italian beggars most as having most savairfaire in fact we all loved the italians in cambridge  he was pleased with the accounts i could give him of the love and honor i had known for him in italy and one day there came a letter from an italian admirer addressed to mr greatest poet longfellow which he said was the very most amusing superscription he had ever seen  it is known that the king of italy offered longfellow the cross of san lazzaro which is the italian literary decoration  it came through the good offices of my old acquaintance professor messadaglia then a deputy in the italian parliament whom for some reason i cannot remember i had put in correspondence with longfellow  the honor was wholly unexpected and it brought longfellow a distress which was chiefly for the gentleman who had procured him the impossible distinction  he showed me the pretty collar and cross not i think without a natural pleasure in it  no man was ever less a bigot in things civil or religious than he but he said firmly of course as a republican and a protestant i cant accept a decoration from a catholic prince  his decision was from his conscience and i think that all americans who think duly about it will approve his decision     vi  such honors as he could fitly permit himself he did not refuse and i recall what zest he had in his election to the arcadian academy which had made him a shepherd of its roman fold with the title as he said of olimipico something  but i fancy his sweetest pleasure in his vast renown came from his popular recognition everywhere  few were the lands few the languages he was unknown to he showed me a version of the psalm of life in chinese  apparently even the poor lost autographseeker was not denied by his universal kindness i know that he kept a store of autographs ready written on small squares of paper for all who applied by letter or in person he said it was no trouble but perhaps he was to be excused for refusing the request of a lady for fifty autographs which she wished to offer as a novel attraction to her guests at a lunch party  foreigners of all kinds thronged upon him at their pleasure apparently and with perfect impunity  sometimes he got a little fun very very kindly out of their excuses and reasons and the englishman who came to see him because there were no ruins to visit in america was no fable as i can testify from the poet himself  but he had no prejudice against englishmen and even at a certain time when the coarsehanded british criticism began to blame his delicate art for the universal acceptance of his verse and to try to sneer him into the rank of inferior poets he was without rancor for the clumsy misliking that he felt  he could not understand rudeness he was too finely framed for that he could know it only as swedenborgs most celestial angels perceived evil as something distressful angular  the illwill that seemed nearly always to go with adverse criticism made him distrust criticism and the discomfort which mistaken or blundering praise gives probably made him shy of all criticism  he said that in his early life as an author he used to seek out and save all the notices of his poems but in his latter days he read only those that happened to fall in his way these he cut out and amused his leisure by putting together in scrapbooks  he was reluctant to make any criticism of other poets i do not remember ever to have heard him make one and his writings show no trace of the literary dislikes or contempts which we so often mistake in ourselves for righteous judgments no doubt he had his resentments but he hushed them in his heart which he did not suffer them to embitter  while poe was writing of longfellow and other plagiarists longfellow was helping to keep poe alive by the loans which always made themselves gifts in poes case  he very very rarely spoke of himself at all and almost never of the grievances which he did not fail to share with all who live  he was patient as i said of all things and gentle beyond all mere gentlemanliness  but it would have been a great mistake to mistake his mildness for softness  it was most manly and firm and of course it was braced with the new england conscience he was born to  if he did not find it well to assert himself he was prompt in behalf of his friends and one of tho fine things told of him was his resenting some censures of sumner at a dinner in boston during the old proslavery times he said to the gentlemen present that sumner was his friend and he must leave their company if they continued to assail him  but he spoke almost as rarely of his friends as of himself  he liked the large impersonal topics which could be dealt with on their human side and involved characters rather than individuals  this was rather strange in cambridge where we were apt to take our instances from the environment  it was not the only thing he was strange in there he was not to that manner born he lacked the final intimacies which can come only of birth and lifelong association and which make the men of the boston breed seem exclusive when they least feel so he was longfellow to the friends who were james and charles and wendell to one another  he and hawthorne were classmates at college but i never heard him mention hawthorne i never heard him mention whittier or emerson  i think his reticence about his contemporaries was largely due to his reluctance from criticism he was the finest artist of them all and if he praised he must have praised with the reservations of an honest man  of younger writers he was willing enough to speak  no new contributor made his mark in the magazine unnoted by him and sometimes i showed him verse in manuscript which gave me peculiar pleasure  i remember his liking for the first piece that mr maurice thompson sent me and how he tasted the fresh flavor of it and inhaled its wild new fragrance  he admired the skill of some of the young storytellers he praised the subtlety of one in working out an intricate character and said modestly that he could never have done that sort of thing himself  it was entirely safe to invite his judgment when in doubt for he never suffered it to become aggressive or used it to urge upon me the manuscripts that must often have been urged upon him  longfellow had a house at nahant where he went every summer for more than a quarter of a century  he found the slight transition change enough from cambridge and liked it perhaps because it did not take him beyond the range of the friends and strangers whose company he liked  agassiz was there and appleton sumner came to sojourn with him and the tourists of all nations found him there in half an hour after they reached boston  his cottage was very plain and simple but was rich in the sight of the illimitable sea and it had a luxury of rocks at the foot of its garden draped with seaweed and washed with the indefatigable tides  as he grew older and feebler he ceased to go to nahant he remained the whole year round at cambridge he professed to like the summer which he said warmed him through there better than the cold spectacle of summer which had no such effect at nahant  the hospitality which was constant at either house was not merely of the worldly sort  longfellow loved good cheer he tasted history and poetry in a precious wine and he liked people who were acquainted with manners and men and brought the air of capitals with them  but often the man who dined with longfellow was the man who needed a dinner and from what i have seen of the sweet courtesy that governed at that board i am sure that such a man could never have felt himself the least honored guest the poets heart was open to all the homelessness of the world and i remember how once when we sat at his table and i spoke of his poem of the challenge then a new poem and said how i had been touched by the fancy of                the povertystricken millions                who challenge our wine and bread                and impeach us all as traitors                both the living and the dead  his voice sank in grave humility as he answered yes i often think of those things  he had thought of them in the days of the slave when he had taken his place with the friends of the hopeless and hapless and as long as he lived he continued of the party which had freed the slave he did not often speak of politics but when the movement of some of the best republicans away from their party began he said that he could not see the wisdom of their course  but this was said without censure or criticism of them and so far as i know he never permitted himself anything like denunciation of those who in any wise differed from him on a matter of yet deeper interest i do not feel authorized to speak for him but i think that as he grew older his hold upon anything like a creed weakened though he remained of the unitarian philosophy concerning christ  he did not latterly go to church i believe but then very few of his circle were churchgoers  once he said something very vague and uncertain concerning the doctrine of another life when i affirmed my hope of it to the effect that he wished he could be sure with the sigh that so often clothed the expression of a misgiving with him     vii  when my acquaintance with longfellow began he had written the things that made his fame and that it will probably rest upon evangeline hiawatha and the courtship of miles standish were by that time old stories  but during the eighteen years that i knew him he produced the best of his minor poems the greatest of his sonnets the sweetest of his lyrics  his art ripened to the last it grew richer and finer and it never knew decay  he rarely read anything of his own aloud but in three or four cases he read to me poems he had just finished as if to give himself the pleasure of hearing them with the sympathetic sense of another  the hexameter piece elizabeth in the third part of tales of a wayside inn was one of these and he liked my liking its rhythmical form which i believed one of the measures best adapted to the english speech and which he had used himself with so much pleasure and success  about this time he was greatly interested in the slight experiments i was beginning to make in dramatic form and he said that if he were himself a young man he should write altogether for the stage he thought the drama had a greater future with us  he was pleased when a popular singer wished to produce his masque of pandora with music and he was patient when it failed of the effect hoped for it as an opera  when the late lawrence barrett in the enthusiasm which was one of the fine traits of his generous character had taken my play of a counterfeit presentment and came to the boston museum with it longfellow could not apparently have been more zealous for its popular acceptance if it had been his own work  he invited himself to one of the rehearsals with me and he sat with me on the stage through the four acts with a fortitude which i still wonder at and with the keenest zest for all the details of the performance  no finer testimony to the love and honor which all kinds of people had for him could have been given than that shown by the actors and employees of the theatre high and low  they thronged the scenery those who were not upon the stage and at the edge of every wing were faces peering round at the poet who sat unconscious of their adoration intent upon the play  he was intercepted at every step in going out and made to put his name to the photographs of himself which his worshippers produced from their persons  he came to the first night of the piece and when it seemed to be finding favor with the public he leaned forward out of his line to nod and smile at the author when they had the author up it was the sweetest flattery of the applause which abused his fondness that longfellow clapped first and loudest  where once he had given his kindness he could not again withhold it and he was anxious no fact should be interpreted as withdrawal  when the emperor dom pedro of brazil who was so great a lover of longfellow came to boston he asked himself out to dine with the poet who had expected to offer him some such hospitality  soon after longfellow met me and as if eager to forestall a possible feeling in me said i wanted to ask you to dinner with the emperor but he not only sent word he was coming he named his fellowguests  i answered that though i should probably never come so near dining with an emperor again i prized his wish to ask me much more than the chance i had missed and with this my great and good friend seemed a little consoled  i believe that i do not speak too confidently of our relation  he was truly the friend of all men but i had certainly the advantage of my propinquity we were near neighbors as the pleonasm has it both when i lived on berkeley street and after i had built my own house on concord avenue and i suppose he found my youthful informality convenient  he always asked me to dinner when his old friend greene came to visit him and then we had an italian time together with more or less repetition in our talk of what we had said before of italian poetry and italian character one day there came a note from him saying in effect salvini is coming out to dine with me tomorrow night and i want you to come too  there will be no one else but greene and myself and we will have an italian dinner  unhappily i had accepted a dinner in boston for that night and this invitation put me in great misery  i must keep my engagement but how could i bear to miss meeting salvini at longfellows table on terms like these  we consulted at home together and questioned whether i might not rush into boston seek out my host there possess him of the facts and frankly throw myself on his mercy  then a sudden thought struck us go to longfellow and submit the case to him  i went and he entered with delicate sympathy into the affair  but he decided that taking the large view of it i must keep my engagement lest i should run even a remote risk of wounding my friends susceptibilities  i obeyed and i had a very good time but i still feel that i missed the best time of my life and that i ought to be rewarded for my sacrifice somewhere  longfellow so rarely spoke of himself in any way that one heard from him few of those experiences of the distinguished man in contact with the undistinguished which he must have had so abundantly  but he told while it was fresh in his mind an incident that happened to him one day in boston at a tobacconists where a certain brand of cigars was recommended to him as the kind longfellow smoked  ah then i must have some of them and i will ask you to send me a box said longfellow and he wrote down his name and address  the cigardealer read it with the smile of a worsted champion and said well i guess you had me that time  at a funeral a mourner wished to open conversation and by way of suggesting a theme of common interest began youve buried i believe  sometimes people were shown by the poet through craigie house who had no knowledge of it except that it had been washingtons headquarters  of course longfellow was known by sight to every one in cambridge  he was daily in the streets while his health endured and as he kept no carriage he was often to be met in the horsecars which were such common ground in cambridge that they were often like small invited parties of friends when they left harvard square so that you expected the gentlemen to jump up and ask the ladies whether they would have chicken salad  in civic and political matters he mingled so far as to vote regularly and he voted with his party trusting it for a general regard to the public welfare  i fancy he was somewhat shy of his fellowmen as the scholar seems always to be from the sequestered habit of his life but i think longfellow was incapable of marking any difference between himself and them  i never heard from him anything that was de haut en bas when he spoke of people and in cambridge where there was a good deal of contempt for the less lettered and we liked to smile though we did not like to sneer and to analyze if we did not censure longfellow and longfellows house were free of all that  whatever his feeling may have been towards other sorts and conditions of men his effect was of an entire democracy  he was always the most unassuming person in any company and at some large public dinners where i saw him i found him patient of the greater attention that more public men paid themselves and one another  he was not a speaker and i never saw him on his feet at dinner except once when he read a poem for whittier who was absent he disliked afterdinner speaking and made conditions for his own exemption from it     viii  once your friend longfellow was always your friend he would not think evil of you and if he knew evil of you he would be the last of all that knew it to judge you for it  this may have been from the impersonal habit of his mind but i believe it was also the effect of principle for he would do what he could to arrest the delivery of judgment from others and would soften the sentences passed in his presence  naturally this brought him under some condemnation with those of a severer cast and i have heard him criticised for his benevolence towards all and his constancy to some who were not quite so true to themselves perhaps but this leniency of longfellows was what constituted him great as well as good for it is not our wisdom that censures others  as for his goodness i never saw a fault in him  i do not mean to say that he had no faults or that there were no better men but only to give the witness of my knowledge concerning him  i claim in no wise to have been his intimate such a thing was not possible in my case for quite apparent reasons and i doubt if longfellow was capable of intimacy in the sense we mostly attach to the word  something more of egotism than i ever found in him must go to the making of any intimacy which did not come from the tenderest affections of his heart  but as a man shows himself to those often with him and in his noted relations with other men he showed himself without blame  all men that i have known besides have had some foible it often endeared them the more or some meanness or pettiness or bitterness but longfellow had none nor the suggestion of any  no breath of evil ever touched his name he went in and out among his fellowmen without the reproach that follows wrong the worst thing i ever heard said of him was that he had gene and this was said by one of those difficult cambridge men who would have found gene in a celestial angel  something that bjornstjerne bjornson wrote to me when he was leaving america after a winter in cambridge comes nearer suggesting longfellow than all my talk  the norsemen in the days of their stormy and reluctant conversion used always to speak of christ as the white christ and bjornson said in his letter give my love to the white mr longfellow  a good many years before longfellows death he began to be sleepless and he suffered greatly  he said to me once that he felt as if he were going about with his heart in a kind of mist  the whole night through he would not be aware of having slept  but he would add with his heavenly patience i always get a good deal of rest from lying down so long  i cannot say whether these conditions persisted or how much his insomnia had to do with his breaking health three or four years before the end came we left cambridge for a house farther in the country and i saw him less frequently than before  he did not allow our meetings to cease he asked me to dinner from time to time as if to keep them up but it could not be with the old frequency  once he made a point of coming to see us in our cottage on the hill west of cambridge but it was with an effort not visible in the days when he could end one of his brief walks at our house on concord avenue he never came but he left our house more luminous for his having been there  once he came to supper there to meet garfield an old family friend of mine in ohio and though he was suffering from a heavy cold he would not scant us in his stay  i had some very bad sherry which he drank with the serenity of a martyr and i shudder to this day to think what his kindness must have cost him  he told his story of the clothesline ghost and garfield matched it with the story of an umbrella ghost who sheltered a friend of his through a midnight storm but was not cheerful company to his beneficiary who passed his hand through him at one point in the effort to take his arm  after the end of four years i came to cambridge to be treated for a long sickness which had nearly been my last and when i could get about i returned the visit longfellow had not failed to pay me  but i did not find him and i never saw him again in life  i went into boston to finish the winter of 18812 and from time to time i heard that the poet was failing in health  as soon as i felt able to bear the horsecar journey i went out to cambridge to see him  i had knocked once at his door the friendly door that had so often opened to his welcome and stood with the knocker in my hand when the door was suddenly set ajar and a maid showed her face wet with tears  how is mr longfellow i palpitated and with a burst of grief she answered oh the poor gentleman has just departed  i turned away as if from a helpless intrusion at a deathbed  at the services held in the house before the obsequies at the cemetery i saw the poet for the last time where                 dead he lay among his books  in the library behind his study  death seldom fails to bring serenity to all and i will not pretend that there was a peculiar peacefulness in longfellows noble mask as i saw it then  it was calm and benign as it had been in life he could not have worn a gentler aspect in going out of the world than he had always worn in it he had not to wait for death to dignify it with the peace of god  all who were left of his old cambridge were present and among those who had come farther was emerson he went up to the bier and with his arms crossed on his breast and his elbows held in either hand stood with his head pathetically fallen forward looking down at the dead face  those who knew how his memory was a mere blank with faint gleams of recognition capriciously coming and going in it must have felt that he was struggling to remember who it was lay there before him and for me the electly simple words confessing his failure will always be pathetic with his remembered aspect the gentleman we have just been burying he said to the friend who had come with him was a sweet and beautiful soul but i forget his name  i had the privilege and honor of looking over the unprinted poems longfellow left behind him and of helping to decide which of them should be published  there were not many of them and some of these few were quite fragmentary  i gave my voice for the publication of all that had any sort of completeness for in every one there was a touch of his exquisite art the grace of his most lovely spirit  we have so far had two men only who felt the claim of their gift to the very best that the most patient skill could give its utterance one was hawthorne and the other was longfellow  i shall not undertake to say which was the greater artist of these two but i am sure that every one who has studied it must feel with me that the art of longfellow held out to the end with no touch of decay in it and that it equalled the art of any other poet of his time  it knew when to give itself and more and more it knew when to withhold itself  what longfellows place in literature will be i shall not offer to say that is times affair not mine but i am sure that with tennyson and browning he fully shared in the expression of an age which more completely than any former age got itself said by its poets     etext editors bookmarks  angloamerican genius for ugliness backed their credulity with their credit candle burning on the table for the

seems always to be     end of this project gutenberg etext of the white mr longfellow by william dean howells       literary friends and acquaintancesstudies of lowell  by william dean howells   studies of lowell  i have already spoken of my earliest meetings with lowell at cambridge when i came to new england on a literary pilgrimage from the west in 1860  i saw him more and more after i went to live in cambridge in 1866 and i now wish to record what i knew of him during the years that passed between this date and that of his death  if the portrait i shall try to paint does not seem a faithful likeness to others who knew him i shall only claim that so he looked to me at this moment and at that  if i do not keep myself quite out of the picture what painter ever did     i  it was in the summer of 1865 that i came home from my consular post at venice and two weeks after i landed in boston i went out to see lowell at elmwood and give him an inkstand that i had brought him from italy the bronze lobster whose back opened and disclosed an inkpot and a sand box was quite ugly but i thought it beautiful then and if lowell thought otherwise he never did anything to let me know it  he put the thing in the middle of his writingtable he nearly always wrote on a pasteboard pad resting upon his knees and there it remained as long as i knew the placea matter of twentyfive years but in all that time i suppose the inkpot continued as dry as the sandbox  my visit was in the heat of august which is as fervid in cambridge as it can well be anywhere and i still have a sense of his study windows lifted to the summer night and the crickets and grasshoppers crying in at them from the lawns and the gardens outside  other people went away from cambridge in the summer to the sea and to the mountains but lowell always stayed at elmwood in an impassioned love for his home and for his town  i must have found him there in the afternoon and he must have made me sup with him dinner was at two oclock and then go with him for a long night of talk in his study  he liked to have some one help him idle the time away and keep him as long as possible from his work and no doubt i was impersonally serving his turn in this way aside from any pleasure he might have had in my company as some one he had always been kind to and as a fresh arrival from the italy dear to us both  he lighted his pipe and from the depths of his easychair invited my shy youth to all the ease it was capable of in his presence  it was not much i loved him and he gave me reason to think that he was fond of me but in lowell i was always conscious of an older and closer and stricter civilization than my own an unbroken tradition a more authoritative status  his democracy was more of the head and mine more of the heart and his denied the equality which mine affirmed  but his nature was so noble and his reason so tolerant that whenever in our long acquaintance i found it well to come to open rebellion as i more than once did he admitted my right of insurrection and never resented the outbreak i disliked to differ with him and perhaps he subtly felt this so much that he would not dislike me for doing it  he even suffered being taxed with inconsistency and where he saw that he had not been quite just he would take punishment for his error with a contrition that was sometimes humorous and always touching  just then it was the dark hour before the dawn with italy and he was interested but not much encouraged by what i could tell him of the feeling in venice against the austrians  he seemed to reserve a like scepticism concerning the fine things i was hoping for the italians in literature and he confessed an interest in the facts treated which in the retrospect i am aware was more tolerant than participant of my enthusiasm  that was always lowells attitude towards the opinions of people he liked when he could not go their lengths with them and nothing was more characteristic of his affectionate nature and his just intelligence  he was a man of the most strenuous convictions but he loved many sorts of people whose convictions he disagreed with and he suffered even prejudices counter to his own if they were not ignoble in the whimsicalities of others he delighted as much as in his own     ii  our associations with italy held over until the next day when after breakfast he went with me towards boston as far as the village for so he liked to speak of cambridge in the custom of his younger days when wide tracts of meadow separated harvard square from his lifelong home at elmwood  we stood on the platform of the horsecar together and when i objected to his paying my fare in the american fashion he allowed that the italian usage of each paying for himself was the politer way he would not commit himself about my returning to venice for i had not given up my place yet and was away on leave but he intimated his distrust of the flattering conditions of life abroad  he said it was charming to be treated da signore but he seemed to doubt whether it was well and in this as in all other things he showed his final fealty to the american ideal  it was that serious and great moment after the successful close of the civil war when the republican consciousness was more robust in us than ever before or since but i cannot recall any reference to the historical interest of the time in lowells talk  it had been all about literature and about travel and now with the suggestion of the word village it began to be a little about his youth  i have said before how reluctant he was to let his youth go from him and perhaps the touch with my juniority had made him realize how near he was to fifty and set him thinking of the past which had sorrows in it to age him beyond his years he would never speak of these though he often spoke of the past  he told once of having been on a brief journey when he was six years old with his father and of driving up to the gate of elmwood in the evening and his father saying ah this is a pleasant place  i wonder who lives herewhat little boy  at another time he pointed out a certain window in his study and said he could see himself standing by it when he could only get his chin on the windowsill  his memories of the house and of everything belonging to it were very tender but he could laugh over an escapade of his youth when he helped his fellowstudents pull down his fathers fences in the pure zeal of goodcomradeship     iii  my fortunes took me to new york and i spent most of the winter of 18656 writing in the office of the nation  i contributed several sketches of italian travel to that paper and one of these brought me a precious letter from lowell  he praised my sketch which he said he had read without the least notion who had written it and he wanted me to feel the full value of such an impersonal pleasure in it  at the same time he did not fail to tell me that he disliked some pseudocynical verses of mine which he had read in another place and i believe it was then that he bade me sweat the heine out of me as men sweat the mercury out of their bones  when i was asked to be assistant editor of the atlantic monthly and came on to boston to talk the matter over with the publishers i went out to cambridge and consulted lowell  he strongly urged me to take the position i thought myself hopefully placed in new york on the nation and at the same time he seemed to have it on his heart to say that he had recommended some one else for it never he owned having thought of me  he was most cordial but after i came to live in cambridge where the magazine was printed and i could more conveniently look over the proofs he did not call on me for more than a month and seemed quite to have forgotten me  we met one night at mr nortons for one of the dante readings and he took no special notice of me till i happened to say something that offered him a chance to give me a little humorous snub  i was speaking of a paper in the magazine on the claudian emissary and i demanded no doubt a little too airily something like who in the world ever heard of the claudian emissary  you are in cambridge mr howells lowell answered and laughed at my confusion having put me down he seemed to soften towards me and at parting he said with a light of halfmocking tenderness in his beautiful eyes goodnight fellowtownsman  i hardly knew we were fellowtownsmen i returned  he liked that apparently and said he had been meaning to call upon me and that he was coming very soon  he was as good as his word and after that hardly a week of any kind of weather passed but he mounted the steps to the door of the ugly little house in which i lived two miles away from him and asked me to walk these walks continued i suppose until lowell went abroad for a winter in the early seventies  they took us all over cambridge which he knew and loved every inch of and led us afield through the straggling unhandsome outskirts bedrabbled with squalid irish neighborhoods and fraying off into marshes and salt meadows  he liked to indulge an excess of admiration for the local landscape and though i never heard him profess a preference for the charles river flats to the finest alpine scenery i could well believe he would do so under provocation of a fit listeners surprise  he had always so much of the boy in him that he liked to tease the overserious or oversincere  he liked to tease and he liked to mock especially his juniors if any touch of affectation or any little exuberance of manner gave him the chance when he once came to fetch me and the young mistress of the house entered with a certain excessive elasticity he sprang from his seat and minced towards her with a burlesque of her buoyant carriage which made her laugh  when he had given us his heart in trust of ours he used us like a younger brother and sister or like his own children  he included our children in his affection and he enjoyed our fondness for them as if it were something that had come back to him from his own youth  i think he had also a sort of artistic a sort of ethical pleasure in it as being of the good tradition of the old honest simple material from which pleasing effects in literature and civilization were wrought  he liked giving the children books and writing tricksy fancies in these where he masked as a fairy prince and as long as he lived he remembered his early kindness for them     iv  in those walks of ours i believe he did most of the talking and from his talk then and at other times there remains to me an impression of his growing conservatism  i had in fact come into his life when it had spent its impulse towards positive reform and i was to be witness of its increasing tendency towards the negative sort  he was quite past the storm and stress of his antislavery age with the close of the war which had broken for him all his ideals of inviolable peace he had reached the age of misgiving  i do not mean that i ever heard him express doubt of what he had helped to do or regret for what he had done but i know that he viewed with critical anxiety what other men were doing with the accomplished facts  his anxiety gave a cast of what one may call reluctance from the political situation and turned him back towards those civic and social defences which he had once seemed willing to abandon  i do not mean that he lost faith in democracy this faith he constantly then and signally afterwards affirmed but he certainly had no longer any faith in insubordination as a means of grace  he preached a quite socratic reverence for law as law and i remember that once when i had got back from canada in the usual disgust for the american custom house and spoke lightly of smuggling as not an evil in itself and perhaps even a right under our vexatious tariff he would not have it but held that the illegality of the act made it a moral of fence  this was not the logic that would have justified the attitude of the anti slavery men towards the fugitive slave act but it was in accord with lowells feeling about john brown whom he honored while always condemning his violation of law and it was in the line of all his later thinking  in this he wished you to agree with him or at least he wished to make you but he did not wish you to be more of his mind than he was himself  in one of those squalid irish neighborhoods i confessed a grudge a mean and cruel grudge i now think it for the increasing presence of that race among us but this did not please him and i am sure that whatever misgiving he had as to the future of america he would not have had it less than it had been the refuge and opportunity of the poor of any race or color  yet he would not have had it this alone there was a line in his poem on agassiz which he left out of the printed version at the fervent entreaty of his friends as saying too bitterly his disappointment with his country  writing at the distance of europe and with america in the perspective which the alien environment clouded he spoke of her as the land of broken promise  it was a splendid reproach but perhaps too dramatic to bear the full test of analysis and yet it had the truth in it and might i think have usefully stood to the end of making people think  undoubtedly it expressed his sense of the case and in the same measure it would now express that of many who love their country most among us  it is well to hold ones country to her promises and if there are any who think she is forgetting them it is their duty to say so even to the point of bitter accusation  i do not suppose it was the common man of lincolns dream that lowell thought america was unfaithful to though as i have suggested he could be tender of the common mans hopes in her but he was impeaching in that blotted line her sincerity with the uncommon man the man who had expected of her a constancy to the ideals of her youth end to the high martyrmoods of the war which had given an unguarded and bewildering freedom to a race of slaves  he was thinking of the shame of our municipal corruptions the debased quality of our national statesmanship the decadence of our whole civic tone rather than of the increasing disabilities of the hard working poor though his heart when he thought of them was with them too as it was in the time when the slave would not let him sleep  he spoke very rarely of those times perhaps because their political and social associations were so knit up with the saddest and tenderest personal memories which it was still anguish to touch  not only was he                                     not of the race                that hawk their sorrows in the market place  but so far as my witness went he shrank from mention of them  i do not remember hearing him speak of the young wife who influenced him so potently at the most vital moment and turned him from his whole scholarly and aristocratic tradition to an impassioned championship of the oppressed and he never spoke of the children he had lost  i recall but one allusion to the days when he was fighting the antislavery battle along the whole line and this was with a humorous relish of his irish servants disgust in having to wait upon a negro whom he had asked to his table  he was rather severe in his notions of the subordination his domestics owed him  they were to do as they were bid and yet he had a tenderness for such as had been any time with him which was wounded when once a hired man long in his employ greedily overreached him in a certain transaction  he complained of that with a simple grief for the mans indelicacy after so many favors from him rather than with any resentment  his hauteur towards his dependents was theoretic his actual behavior was of the gentle consideration common among americans of good breeding and that recreant hired man had no doubt never been suffered to exceed him in shows of mutual politeness  often when the maid was about weightier matters he came and opened his door to me himself welcoming me with the smile that was like no other  sometimes he said siete il benvenuto or used some other italian phrase which put me at ease with him in the region where we were most at home together  looking back i must confess that i do not see what it was he found to make him wish for my company which he presently insisted upon having once a week at dinner  after the meal we turned into his study where we sat before a wood fire in winter and he smoked and talked  he smoked a pipe which was always needing tobacco or going out so that i have the figure of him before my eyes constantly getting out of his deep chair to rekindle it from the fire with a paper lighter  he was often out of his chair to get a book from the shelves that lined the walls either for a passage which he wished to read or for some disputed point which he wished to settle  if i had caused the dispute he enjoyed putting me in the wrong if he could not he sometimes whimsically persisted in his error in defiance of all authority but mostly he had such reverence for the truth that he would not question it even in jest  if i dropped in upon him in the afternoon i was apt to find him reading the old french poets or the plays of calderon or the divina commedia which he magnanimously supposed me much better acquainted with than i was because i knew some passages of it by heart  one day i came in quoting                 io son cantava io son dolce sirena                che i marinai in mezzo al mar dismago  he stared at me in a rapture with the matchless music and then uttered all his adoration and despair in one word  damn he said and no more i believe he instantly proposed a walk that day as if his study walls with all their vistas into the great literatures cramped his soul liberated to a sense of ineffable beauty of the verse of the somma poeta  but commonly be preferred to have me sit down with him there among the mute witnesses of the larger part of his life  as i have suggested in my own case it did not matter much whether you brought anything to the feast or not  if he liked you he liked being with you not for what he got but for what he gave  he was fond of one man whom i recall as the most silent man i ever met  i never heard him say anything not even a dull thing but lowell delighted in him and would have you believe that he was full of quaint humor     v  while lowell lived there was a superstition which has perhaps survived him that he was an indolent man wasting himself in barren studies and minor efforts instead of devoting his great powers to some monumental work worthy of them  if the robust body of literature both poetry and prose which lives after him does not yet correct this vain delusion the time will come when it must and in the meantime the delusion cannot vex him now  i think it did vex him then and that he even shared it and tried at times to meet such shadowy claim as it had  one of the things that people urged upon him was to write some sort of story and it is known how he attempted this in verse  it is less known that he attempted it in prose and that he went so far as to write the first chapter of a novel  he read this to me and though i praised it then i have a feeling now that if he had finished the novel it would have been a failure  but i shall never finish it he sighed as if he felt irremediable defects in it and laid the manuscript away to turn and light his pipe  it was a rather oldfashioned study of a whimsical character and it did not arrive anywhere so far as it went but i believe that it might have been different with a yankee story in verse such as we have fragmentarily in the nooning and fitzadams story still his gift was essentially lyrical and meditative with the universal new england tendency to allegory  he was wholly undramatic in the actuation of the characters which he imagined so dramatically  he liked to deal with his subject at first hand to indulge through himself all the whim and fancy which the more dramatic talent indulges through its personages  he enjoyed writing such a poem as the cathedral which is not of his best but which is more immediately himself in all his moods than some better poems  he read it to me soon after it was written and in the long walk which we went hard upon the reading our way led us through the port far towards east cambridge where he wished to show me a tupelotree of his acquaintance because i said i had never seen one his talk was still of the poem which he was greatly in conceit of  later his satisfaction with it received a check from the reserves of other friends concerning some whimsical lines which seemed to them too great a drop from the higher moods of the piece  their reluctance nettled him perhaps he agreed with them but he would not change the lines and they stand as he first wrote them  in fact most of his lines stand as he first wrote them he would often change them in revision and then in a second revision go back to the first version  he was very sensitive to criticism especially from those he valued through his head or heart  he would try to hide his hurt and he would not let you speak of it as though your sympathy unmanned him but you could see that he suffered  this notably happened in my remembrance from a review in a journal which he greatly esteemed and once when in a notice of my own i had put one little thorny point among the flowers he confessed a puncture from it  he praised the criticism hardily but i knew that he winced under my recognition of the didactic quality which he had not quite guarded himself against in the poetry otherwise praised he liked your liking and he openly rejoiced in it and i suppose he made himself believe that in trying his verse with his friends he was testing it but i do not believe that he was and i do not think he ever corrected his judgment by theirs however he suffered from it  in any matter that concerned literary morals he was more than eager to profit by another eye  one summer he sent me for the magazine a poem which when i read it i trembled to find in motive almost exactly like one we had lately printed by another contributor  there was nothing for it but to call his attention to the resemblance and i went over to elmwood with the two poems  he was not at home and i was obliged to leave the poems i suppose with some sort of note for the next mornings post brought me a delicious letter from him all one cry of confession the most complete the most ample  he did not trouble himself to say that his poem was an unconscious reproduction of the other that was for every reason unnecessary but he had at once rewritten it upon wholly different lines and i do not think any reader was reminded of mrs akerss among the laurels by lowells footpath  he was not only much more sensitive of others rights than his own but in spite of a certain severity in him he was most tenderly regardful of their sensibilities when he had imagined them he did not always imagine them     vi  at this period between the years 1866 and 1874 when he unwillingly went abroad for a twelvemonth lowell was seen in very few cambridge houses and in still fewer boston houses  he was not an unsocial man but he was most distinctly not a society man  he loved chiefly the companionship of books and of men who loved books but of women generally he had an amusing diffidence he revered them and honored them but he would rather not have had them about  this is oversaying it of course but the truth is in what i say there was never a more devoted husband and he was content to let his devotion to the sex end with that  he especially could not abide difference of opinion in women he valued their taste their wit their humor but he would have none of their reason  i was by one day when he was arguing a point with one of his nieces and after it had gone on for some time and the impartial witness must have owned that she was getting the better of him he closed the controversy by giving her a great kiss with the words you are a very good girl my dear and practically putting her out of the room  as to women of the flirtatious type he did not dislike them no man perhaps does but he feared them and he said that with them there was but one way and that was to run  i have a notion that at this period lowell was more freely and fully himself than at any other  the passions and impulses of his younger manhood had mellowed the sorrows of that time had softened he could blamelessly live to himself in his affections and his sobered ideals his was always a duteous life but he had pretty well given up making man over in his own image as we all wish some time to do and then no longer wish it  he fulfilled his obligations to his fellowmen as these sought him out but he had ceased to seek them  he loved his friends and their love but he had apparently no desire to enlarge their circle  it was that hour of civic suspense in which public men seemed still actuated by unselfish aims and one not essentially a politician might contentedly wait to see what would come of their doing their best  at any rate without occasionally withholding open criticism or acclaim lowell waited among his books for the wounds of the war to heal themselves and the nation to begin her healthfuller and nobler life  with slavery gone what might not one expect of american democracy  his life at elmwood was of an entire simplicity  in the old colonial mansion in which he was born he dwelt in the embowering leafage amid the quiet of lawns and gardenplots broken by few noises ruder than those from the elms and the syringas where            the oriole clattered and the catbird sang  from the tracks on brattle street came the drowsy tinkle of horsecar bells and sometimes a funeral trailed its black length past the corner of his grounds and lost itself from sight under the shadows of the willows that hid mount auburn from his study windows  in the winter the deep new england snows kept their purity in the stretch of meadow behind the house which a double row of pines guarded in a domestic privacy all was of a modest dignity within and without the house which lowell loved but did not imagine of a manorial presence and he could not conceal his annoyance with an overenthusiastic account of his home in which the simple chiselling of some panels was vaunted as rich wood carving  there was a graceful staircase and a good wide hall from which the diningroom and drawingroom opened by opposite doors behind the last in the southwest corner of the house was his study  there literally he lived during the six or seven years in which i knew him after my coming to cambridge  summer and winter he sat there among his books seldom stirring abroad by day except for a walk and by night yet more rarely  he went to the monthly midday dinner of the saturday club in boston he was very constant at the fortnightly meetings of his whistclub because he loved the old friends who formed it he came always to the dante suppers at longfellows and he was familiarly in and out at mr nortons of course  but otherwise he kept to his study except for some rare and almost unwilling absences upon university lecturing at johns hopkins or at cornell  for four years i did not take any summer outing from cambridge myself and my associations with elmwood and with lowell are more of summer than of winter weather meetings  but often we went our walks through the snows trudging along between the horsecar tracks which enclosed the only wellbrokenout paths in that simple old cambridge  i date one memorable expression of his from such a walk when as we were passing longfellows house in midstreet he came as near the declaration of his religious faith as he ever did in my presence  he was speaking of the new testament and he said the truth was in it but they had covered it up with their hagiology  though he had been bred a unitarian and had more and more liberated himself from all creeds he humorously affected an abiding belief in hell and similarly contended for the eternal punishment of the wicked  he was of a religious nature and he was very reverent of other peoples religious feelings  he expressed a special tolerance for my own inherited faith no doubt because mrs lowell was also a swedenborgian but i do not think he was interested in it and i suspect that all religious formulations bored him  in his earlier poems are many intimations and affirmations of belief in an overruling providence and especially in the god who declares vengeance his and will repay men for their evil deeds and will right the weak against the strong  i think he never quite lost this though when in the last years of his life i asked him if he believed there was a moral government of the universe he answered gravely and with a sort of pain the scale was so vast and we saw such a little part of it  as to tine notion of a life after death i never had any direct or indirect expression from him but i incline to the opinion that his hold upon this weakened with his years as it is sadly apt to do with men who have read much and thought much they have apparently exhausted their potentialities of psychological life  mystical lowell was as every poet must be but i do not think he liked mystery  one morning he told me that when he came home the night before he had seen the doppelganger of one of his household though as he joked he was not in a state to see double  he then said he used often to see peoples doppelganger at another time as to ghosts he said he was like coleridge he had seen too many of em  lest any weaker brethren should be caused to offend by the restricted oath which i have reported him using in a moment of transport it may be best to note here that i never heard him use any other imprecation and this one seldom  any grossness of speech was inconceivable of him now and then but only very rarely the human nature of some story unmeet for ladies was too much for his sense of humor and overcame him with amusement which he was willing to impart and did impart but so that mainly the human nature of it reached you  in this he was like the other great cambridge men though he was opener than the others to contact with the commoner life he keenly delighted in every native and novel turn of phrase and he would not undervalue a vital word or a notion picked up out of the road even if it had some dirt sticking to it  he kept as close to the common life as a man of his patrician instincts and cloistered habits could  i could go to him with any new find about it and be sure of delighting him after i began making my involuntary and all but unconscious studies of yankee character especially in the country he was always glad to talk them over with me  still when i had discovered a new accent or turn of speech in the fields he had cultivated i was aware of a subtle grudge mingling with his pleasure but this was after all less envy than a fine regret  at the time i speak of there was certainly nothing in lowells dress or bearing that would have kept the common life aloof from him if that life were not always too proud to make advances to any one  in this retrospect i see him in the sack coat and rough suit which he wore upon all outdoor occasions with heavy shoes and a round hat  i never saw him with a high hat on till he came home after his diplomatic stay in london then he had become rather rigorously correct in his costume and as conventional as he had formerly been indifferent  in both epochs he was apt to be gloved and the strong broad hands which left the sensation of their vigor for some time after they had clasped yours were notably white  at the earlier period he still wore his auburn hair somewhat long it was darker than his beard which was branching and full and more strawcolored than auburn as were his thick eyebrows neither hair nor beard was then touched with gray as i now remember when he uncovered his straight wide white forehead showed itself one of the most beautiful that could be his eyes were gay with humor and alert with all intelligence  he had an enchanting smile a laugh that was full of friendly joyousness and a voice that was exquisite music everything about him expressed his strenuous physical condition he would not wear an overcoat in the coldest cambridge weather at all times he moved vigorously and walked with a quick step lifting his feet well from the ground     vii  it gives me a pleasure which i am afraid i cannot impart to linger in this effort to materialize his presence from the fading memories of the past  i am afraid i can as little impart a due sense of what he spiritually was to my knowledge  it avails nothing for me to say that i think no man of my years and desert had ever so true and constant a friend  he was both younger and older than i by insomuch as he was a poet through and through and had been out of college before i was born but he had already come to the age of selfdistrust when a man likes to take counsel with his juniors as with his elders and fancies he can correct his perspective by the test of their fresher vision  besides lowell was most simply and pathetically reluctant to part with youth and was willing to cling to it wherever he found it  he could not in any wise bear to be leftout  when mr bret harte came to cambridge and the talk was all of the brilliant characterpoems with which he had then first dazzled the world lowell casually said with a most touching however ungrounded sense of obsolescence he could remember when the biglow papers were all the talk  i need not declare that there was nothing ungenerous in that  he was only too ready to hand down his laurels to a younger man but he wished to do it himself  through the modesty that is always a quality of such a nature he was magnanimously sensitive to the appearance of fading interest he could not take it otherwise than as a proof of his fading power  i had a curious hint of this when one year in making up the prospectus of the magazine for the next i omitted his name because i had nothing special to promise from him and because i was half ashamed to be always flourishing it in the eyes of the public  i see that you have dropped me this year he wrote and i could see that it had hurt and i knew that he was glad to believe the truth when i told him  he did not care so much for popularity as for the praise of his friends if he liked you he wished you not only to like what he wrote but to say so  he was himself most cordial in his recognition of the things that pleased him  what happened to me from him happened to others and i am only describing his common habit when i say that nothing i did to his liking failed to bring me a spoken or oftener a written acknowledgment this continued to the latest years of his life when the effort even to give such pleasure must have cost him a physical pang  he was of a very catholic taste and he was apt to be carried away by a little touch of life or humor and to overvalue the piece in which he found it but mainly his judgments of letters and men were just one of the dangers of scholarship was a peculiar danger in the cambridge keeping but lowell was almost as averse as longfellow from contempt he could snub and pitilessly where he thought there was presumption and apparently sometimes merely because he was in the mood but i cannot remember ever to have heard him sneer  he was often wonderfully patient of tiresome people and sometimes celestially insensible to vulgarity in spite of his reserve he really wished people to like him he was keenly alive to neighborly goodwill or illwill and when there was a question of widening elmwood avenue by taking part of his grounds he was keenly hurt by hearing that some one who lived near him had said he hoped the city would cut down lowells elms his english elms which his father had planted and with which he was himself almost one blood     viii  in the period of which i am speaking lowell was constantly writing and pretty constantly printing though still the superstition held that he was an idle man  to this time belongs the publication of some of his finest poems if not their inception there were cases in which their inception dated far back even to ten or twenty years  he wrote his poems at a heat and the manuscript which came to me for the magazine was usually the first draft very little corrected  but if the cold fit took him quickly it might hold him so fast that he would leave the poem in abeyance till he could slowly live back to a liking for it  the most of his best prose belongs to the time between 1866 and 1874 and to this time we owe the several volumes of essays and criticisms called among my books and my study windows  he wished to name these more soberly but at the urgence of his publishers he gave them titles which they thought would be attractive to the public though he felt that they took from the dignity of his work  he was not a good business man in a literary way he submitted to others judgment in all such matters i doubt if he ever put a price upon anything he sold and i dare say he was usually surprised at the largeness of the price paid him but sometimes if his need was for a larger sum he thought it too little without reference to former payments  this happened with a long poem in the atlantic which i had urged the countingroom authorities to deal handsomely with him for  i did not know how many hundred they gave him and when i met him i ventured to express the hope that the publishers had done their part  he held up four fingers quattro he said in italian and then added with a disappointment which he tried to smile away i thought they might have made it cinque  between me and me i thought quattro very well but probably lowell had in mind some end which cinque would have fitted better  it was pretty sure to be an unselfish end a pleasure to some one dear to him a gift that he had wished to make  long afterwards when i had been the means of getting him cinque for a poem onetenth the length he spoke of the payment to me  it came very handily i had been wanting to give a watch  i do not believe at any time lowell was able to deal with money            like wealthy men not knowing what they give  more probably he felt a sacredness in the money got by literature which the literary man never quite rids him self of even when he is not a poet and which made him wish to dedicate it to something finer than the every day uses  he lived very quietly but he had by no means more than he needed to live upon and at that time he had pecuniary losses  he was writing hard and was doing full work in his harvard professorship and he was so far dependent upon his salary that he felt its absence for the year he went abroad  i do not know quite how to express my sense of something unworldly of something almost womanlike in his relation to money  he was not only generous of money but he was generous of himself when he thought he could be of use or merely of encouragement  he came all the way into boston to hear certain lectures of mine on the italian poets which he could not have found either edifying or amusing that he might testify his interest in me and show other people that they were worth coming to  he would go carefully over a poem with me word by word and criticise every turn of phrase and after all be magnanimously tolerant of my sticking to phrasings that he disliked  in a certain line            the silvern chords of the piano trembled  he objected to silvern  why not silver  i alleged leathern golden and like adjectives in defence of my word but still he found an affectation in it and suffered it to stand with extreme reluctance  another line of another piece            and what she would would rather that she would not  he would by no means suffer  he said that the stress falling on the last word made it publicschool english and he mocked it with the answer a maid had lately given him when he asked if the master of the house was at home  she said no sir he is not when she ought to have said no sir he isnt  he was appeased when i came back the next day with the stanza amended so that the verse could read            and what she would would rather she would not so  but i fancy he never quite forgave my word silvern  yet he professed not to have prejudices in such matters but to use any word that would serve his turn without wincing and he certainly did use and defend words as undisprivacied and disnatured that made others wince  he was otherwise such a stickler for the best diction that he would not have had me use slovenly vernacular even in the dialogue in my stories my characters must not say they wanted to do so and so but wished and the like  in a copy of one of my books which i found him reading i saw he had corrected my erring western woulds and shoulds as he grew old he was less and less able to restrain himself from setting people right to their faces  once in the vast area of my ignorance he specified my small acquaintance with a certain period of english poetry saying youre rather shady there old fellow  but he would not have had me too learned holding that he had himself been hurt for literature by his scholarship  his patience in analyzing my work with me might have been the easy effort of his habit of teaching and his willingness to give himself and his own was no doubt more signally attested in his asking a brother man of letters who wished to work up a subject in the college library to stay a fortnight in his house and to share his study his beloved study with him  this must truly have cost him dear as any author of fixed habits will understand  happily the man of letters was a good fellow and knew how to prize the favordone him but if he had been otherwise it would have been the same to lowell  he not only endured but did many things for the weaker brethren which were amusing enough to one in the secret of his inward revolt  yet in these things he was considerate also of the editor whom he might have made the sharer of his selfsacrifice and he seldom offered me manuscripts for others  the only real burden of the kind that he put upon me was the diary of a virginian who had travelled in new england during the early thirties and had set down his impressions of men and manners there  it began charmingly and went on very well under lowells discreet pruning but after a while he seemed to fall in love with the character of the diarist so much that he could not bear to cut anything    ix  he had a great tenderness for the broken and ruined south whose sins he felt that he had had his share in visiting upon her and he was willing to do what he could to ease her sorrows in the case of any particular southerner  he could not help looking askance upon the dramatic shows of retribution which some of the northern politicians were working but with all his misgivings he continued to act with the republican party until after the election of hayes he was away from the country during the garfield campaign  he was in fact one of the massachusetts electors chosen by the republican majority in 1816 and in that most painful hour when there was question of the policy and justice of counting hayes in for the presidency it was suggested by some of lowells friends that he should use the original right of the electors under the constitution and vote for tilden whom one vote would have chosen president over hayes  after he had cast his vote for hayes he quietly referred to the matter one day in the moment of lighting his pipe with perhaps the faintest trace of indignation in his tone  he said that whatever the first intent of the constitution was usage had made the presidential electors strictly the instruments of the party which chose them and that for him to have voted for tilden when he had been chosen to vote for hayes would havebeen an act of bad faith  he would have resumed for me all the old kindness of our relations before the recent year of his absence but this had inevitably worked a little estrangement  he had at least lost the habit of me and that says much in such matters  he was not so perfectly at rest in the cambridge environment in certain indefinable ways it did not so entirely suffice him though he would have been then and always the last to allow this i imagine his friends realized more than he that certain delicate but vital filaments of attachment had frayed and parted in alien air and left him heartloose as he had not been before  i do not know whether it crossed his mind after the election of hayes that he might be offered some place abroad but it certainly crossed the minds of some of his friends and i could not feel that i was acting for myself alone when i used a family connection with the president very early in his term to let him know that i believed lowell would accept a diplomatic mission  i could assure him that i was writing wholly without lowells privity or authority and i got back such a letter as i could wish in its delicate sense of the situation  the president said that he had already thought of offering lowell something and he gave me the pleasure a pleasure beyond any other i could imagine of asking lowell whether he would accept the mission to austria  i lost no time carrying his letter to elmwood where i found lowell over his coffee at dinner he saw me at the threshold and called to me through the open door to come in and i handed him the letter and sat down at table while he ran it through  when he had read it he gave a quick ah and threw it over the length of the table to mrs lowell  she read it in a smiling and loyal reticence as if she would not say one word of all she might wish to say in urging his acceptance though i could see that she was intensely eager for it  the whole situation was of a perfect new england character in its tacit significance after lowell had taken his coffee we turned into his study without further allusion to the matter  a day or two later he came to my house to say that he could not accept the austrian mission and to ask me to tell the president so for him and make his acknowledgments which he would also write himself  he remained talking a little while of other things and when he rose to go he said with a sigh of vague reluctance i should like to see a play of calderon as if it had nothing to do with any wish of his that could still be fulfilled  upon this hint i acted and in due time it was found in washington that the gentleman who had been offered the spanish mission would as lief go to austria and lowell was sent to madrid     x  when we met in london some years later he came almost every afternoon to my lodging and the story of our oldtime cambridge walks began again in london phrases  there were not the vacant lots and outlying fields of his native place but we made shift with the vast simple parks and we walked on the grass as we could not have done in an american park and were glad to feel the earth under our feet  i said how much it was like those earlier tramps and that pleased him for he wished whenever a thing delighted him to find a cambridge quality in it  but he was in love with everything english and was determined i should be so too beginning with the english weather which in summer cannot be overpraised  he carried of course an umbrella but he would not put it up in the light showers that caught us at times saying that the english rain never wetted you  the thick short turf delighted him he would scarcely allow that the trees were the worse for foliage blighted by a vile easterly storm in the spring of that year  the tender air the delicate veils that the moisture in it cast about all objects at the least remove the soft colors of the flowers the dull blue of the low sky showing through the rifts of the dirty white clouds the hovering pall of london smoke were all dear to him and he was anxious that i should not lose anything of their charm  he was anxious that i should not miss the value of anything in england and while he volunteered that the aristocracy had the corruptions of aristocracies everywhere he insisted upon my respectful interest in it because it was so historical  perhaps there was a touch of irony in this demand but it is certain that he was very happy in england  he had come of the age when a man likes smooth warm keeping in which he need make no struggle for his comfort disciplined and obsequious service society perfectly ascertained within the larger society which we call civilization and in an alien environment for which he was in no wise responsible he could have these without a pang of the selfreproach which at home makes a man unhappy amidst his luxuries when he considers their cost to others  he had a position which forbade thought of unfairness in the conditions he must not wake because of the slave it was his duty to sleep  besides at that time lowell needed all the rest he could get for he had lately passed through trials such as break the strength of men and how them with premature age  he was living alone in his little house in lowndes square and mrs lowell was in the country slowly recovering from the effects of the terrible typhus which she had barely survived in madrid  he was yet so near the anguish of that experience that he told me he had still in his nerves the expectation of a certain agonized cry from her which used to rend them  but he said he had adjusted himself to this and he went on to speak with a patience which was more affecting in him than in men of more phlegmatic temperament of how we were able to adjust ourselves to all our trials and to the constant presence of pain  he said he was never free of a certain distress which was often a sharp pang in one of his shoulders but his physique had established such relations with it that though he was never unconscious of it he was able to endure it without a recognition of it as suffering  he seemed to me however very well and at his age of sixtythree i could not see that he was less alert and vigorous than he was when i first knew him in cambridge  he had the same brisk light step and though his beard was well whitened and his auburn hair had grown ashen through the red his face had the freshness and his eyes the clearness of a young mans  i suppose the novelty of his life kept him from thinking about his years or perhaps in contact with those great insenescent englishmen he could not feel himself old  at any rate he did not once speak of age as he used to do ten years earlier and i then half through my forties was still you young dog to him  it was a bright and cheerful renewal of the early kindliness between us on which indeed there had never been a shadow except such as distance throws  he wished apparently to do everything he could to assure us of his personal interest and we were amused to find him nervously apprehensive of any purpose such as was far from us to profit by him officially  he betrayed a distinct relief when he found we were not going to come upon him even for admissions to the houses of parliament which we were to see by means of an english acquaintance  he had not perhaps found some other fellowcitizens so considerate he dreaded the halfduties of his place like presentations to the queen and complained of the cheap ambitions he had to gratify in that way  he was so eager to have me like england in every way and seemed so fond of the english that i thought it best to ask him whether he minded my quoting in a paper about lexington which i was just then going to print in a london magazine some humorous lines of his expressing the mounting satisfaction of an imaginary yankee storyteller who has the old fight terminate in lord percys coming            to hammer stone for life in concord jail  it had occurred to me that it might possibly embarrass him to have this patriotic picture presented to a public which could not take our fourth of july pleasure in it and i offered to suppress it as i did afterwards quite for literary reasons  he said no let it stand and let them make the worst of it and i fancy that much of his success with a people who are not gingerly with other peoples sensibilities came from the frankness with which he trampled on their prejudice when he chose he said he always told them when there was question of such things that the best society he had ever known was in cambridge massachusetts he contended that the best english was spoken there and so it was when he spoke it  we were in london out of the season and he was sorry that he could not have me meet some titles who he declared had found pleasure in my books when we returned from italy in the following june he was prompt to do me this honor  i dare say he wished me to feel it to its last implication and i did my best but there was nothing in the evening i enjoyed so much as his coming up to mrs lowell at the close when there was only a title or two left and saying to her as he would have said to her at elmwood where she would have personally planned it fanny that was a fine dinner you gave us  of course this was in a tender burlesque but it remains the supreme impression of what seemed to me a cloudlessly happy period for lowell  his wife was quite recovered of her long suffering and was again at the head of his house sharing in his pleasures and enjoying his successes for his sake successes so great that people spoke of him seriously as an addition to society in london where one man more or less seemed like a drop in the sea she was a woman perfectly of the new england type and tradition almost repellantly shy at first and almost glacially cold with new acquaintance but afterwards very sweet and cordial  she was of a dark beauty with a regular face of the spanish outline lowell was of an ideal manner towards her and of an admiration which delicately travestied itself and which she knew how to receive with smiling irony  after her death which occurred while he was still in england he never spoke of her to me though before that he used to be always bringing her name in with a young loverlike fondness     xi  in the hurry of the london season i did not see so much of lowell on our second sojourn as on our first but once when we were alone in his study there was a return to the terms of the old meetings in cambridge  he smoked his pipe and sat by his fire and philosophized and but for the great london sea swirling outside and bursting through our shelter and dashing him with notes that must be instantly answered it was a very fair image of the past  he wanted to tell me about his coachman whom he had got at on his human side with great liking and amusement and there was a patient gentleness in his manner with the footman who had to keep coming in upon him with those notes which was like the echo of his young faith in the equality of men  but he always distinguished between the simple unconscious equality of the ordinary american and its assumption by a foreigner  he said he did not mind such an americans coming into his house with his hat on but if a german or englishman did it he wanted to knock it off  he was apt to be rather punctilious in his shows of deference towards others and at one time he practised removing his own hat when he went into shops in cambridge  it must have mystified the cambridge salesmen and i doubt if he kept it up  with reference to the doctrine of his young poetry the fierce and the tender humanity of his storm and stress period i fancy a kind of baffle in lowell which i should not perhaps find it easy to prove  i never knew him by word or hint to renounce this doctrine but he could not come to seventy years without having seen many high hopes fade and known many inspired prophecies fail  when we have done our best to make the world over we are apt to be dismayed by finding it in much the old shape as he said of the moral government of the universe the scale is so vast and a little difference a little change for the better is scarcely perceptible to the eager consciousness of the wholesale reformer but with whatever sense of disappointment of doubt as to his own deeds for truer freedom and for better conditions i believe his sympathy was still with those who had some heart for hoping and striving  i am sure that though he did not agree with me in some of my own later notions for the redemption of the race he did not like me the less but rather the more because to my own great surprise i confess i had now and then the courage of my convictions both literary and social  he was probably most at odds with me in regard to my theories of fiction though he persisted in declaring his pleasure in my own fiction  he was in fact by nature and tradition thoroughly romantic and he could not or would not suffer realism in any but a friend  he steadfastly refused even to read the russian masters to his immense loss as i tried to persuade him and even among the modern spaniards for whom he might have had a sort of personal kindness from his love of cervantes he chose one for his praise the least worthy of it and bore me down with his heavier metal in argument when i opposed to alarcons factitiousness the delightful genuineness of valdes  ibsen with all the norwegians he put far from him he would no more know them than the russians the french naturalists he abhorred  i thought him all wrong but you do not try improving your elders when they have come to three score and ten years and i would rather have had his affection unbroken by our difference of opinion than a perfect agreement  where he even imagined that this difference could work me harm he was anxious to have me know that he meant me none and he was at the trouble to write me a letter when a boston paper had perverted its report of what he said in a public lecture to my disadvantage and to assure me that he had not me in mind  when once he had given his liking he could not bear that any shadow of change should seem to have come upon him  he had a most beautiful and endearing ideal of friendship he desired to affirm it and to reaffirm it as often as occasion offered and if occasion did not offer he made occasion it did not matter what you said or did that contraried him if he thought he had essentially divined you you were still the same and on his part he was by no means exacting of equal demonstration but seemed not even to wish it     xii  after he was replaced at london by a minister more immediately representative of the democratic administration he came home  he made a brave show of not caring to have remained away but in truth he had become very fond of england where he had made so many friends and where the distinction he had in that comfortably padded environment was so agreeable to him  it would have been like him to have secretly hoped that the new president might keep him in london but he never betrayed any ignoble disappointment and he would not join in any blame of him  at our first meeting after he came home he spoke of the movement which had made mr cleveland president and said he supposed that if he had been here he should have been in it  all his friends were he added a little helplessly but he seemed not to dislike my saying i knew one of his friends who was not in fact as i have told he never disliked a plump differenceunless he disliked the differer  for several years he went back to england every summer and it was not until he took up his abode at elmwood again that he spent a whole year at home  one winter he passed at his sisters home in boston but mostly he lived with his daughter at southborough  i have heard a story of his going to elmwood soon after his return in 1885 and sitting down in his old study where he declared with tears that the place was full of ghosts  but four or five years later it was well for family reasons that he should live there and about the same time it happened that i had taken a house for the summer in his neighborhood  he came to see me and to assure me in all tacit forms of his sympathy in a sorrow for which there could be no help but it was not possible that the old intimate relations should be resumed  the affection was there as much on his side as on mine i believe but he was now an old man and i was an elderly man and we could not without insincerity approach each other in the things that had drawn us together in earlier and happier years his course was run my own in which he had taken such a generous pleasure could scarcely move his jaded interest  his life so far as it remained to him had renewed itself in other air the later friendships beyond seas sufficed him and were without the pang without the effort that must attend the knitting up of frayed ties here  he could never have been anything but american if he had tried and he certainly never tried but he certainly did not return to the outward simplicities of his life as i first knew it  there was no more round hatandsackcoat business for him he wore a frock and a high hat and whatever else was rather like london than cambridge i do not know but drab gaiters sometimes added to the effect of a gentleman of the old school which he now produced upon the witness  some fastidiousnesses showed themselves in him which were not so surprising  he complained of the american lower class manner the conductor and cabman would be kind to you but they would not be respectful and he could not see the fun of this in the old way  early in our acquaintance he rather stupified me by saying i like you because you dont put your hands on me and i heard of his consenting to some sort of reception in those last years yes if they wont shake hands  ever since his visit to rome in 1875 he had let his heavy mustache grow long till it dropped below the corners of his beard which was now almost white his face had lost the ruddy hue so characteristic of him  i fancy he was then ailing with premonitions of the disorder which a few years later proved mortal but he still bore himself with sufficient vigor and he walked the distance between his house and mine though once when i missed his visit the family reported that after he came in he sat a long time with scarcely a word as if too weary to talk  that winter i went into boston to live and i saw him only at infrequent intervals when i could go out to elmwood  at such times i found him sitting in the room which was formerly the drawingroom but which had been joined with his study by taking away the partitions beside the heavy mass of the old colonial chimney  he told me that when he was a newborn babe the nurse had carried him round this chimney for luck and now in front of the same hearth the white old man stretched himself in an easychair with his writingpad on his knees and his books on the table at his elbow and was willing to be entreated not to rise  i remember the sun used to come in at the eastern windows full pour and bathe the air in its warmth  he always hailed me gayly and if i found him with letters newly come from england as i sometimes did he glowed and sparkled with fresh life he wanted to read passages from those letters he wanted to talk about their writers and to make me feel their worth and charm as he did he still dreamed of going back to england the next summer but that was not to be  one day he received me not less gayly than usual but with a certain excitement and began to tell me about an odd experience he had had not at all painful but which had very much mystified him  he had since seen the doctor and the doctor had assured him that there was nothing alarming in what had happened and in recalling this assurance he began to look at the humorous aspects of the case and to make some jokes about it  he wished to talk of it as men do of their maladies and very fully and i gave him such proof of my interest as even inviting him to talk of it would convey  in spite of the doctors assurance and his joyful acceptance of it i doubt if at the bottom of his heart there was not the stir of an uneasy misgiving but he had not for a long time shown himself so cheerful  it was the beginning of the end  he recovered and relapsed and recovered again but never for long  late in the spring i came out and he had me stay to dinner which was somehow as it used to be at two oclock and after dinner we went out on his lawn  he got a longhandled spud and tried to grub up some dandelions which he found in his turf but after a moment or two he threw it down and put his hand upon his back with a groan  i did not see him again till i came out to take leave of him before going away for the summer and then i found him sitting on the little porch in a western corner of his house with a volume of scott closed upon his finger  there were some other people and our meeting was with the constraint of their presence  it was natural in nothing so much as his saying very significantly to me as if he knew of my heresies concerning scott and would have me know he did not approve of them that there was nothing he now found so much pleasure in as scotts novels another friend equally heretical was by but neither of us attempted to gainsay him  lowell talked very little but he told of having been a walk to beaver brook and of having wished to jump from one stone to another in the stream and of having had to give it up  he said without completing the sentence if it had come to that with him  then he fell silent again and with some vain talk of seeing him when i came back in the fall i went away sick at heart  i was not to see him again and i shall not look upon his like  i am aware that i have here shown him from this point and from that in a series of sketches which perhaps collectively impart but do not assemble his personality in one impression  he did not indeed make one impression upon me but a thousand impressions which i should seek in vain to embody in a single presentment  what i have cloudily before me is the vision of a very lofty and simple soul perplexed and as it were surprised and even dismayed at the complexity of the effects from motives so single in it but escaping always to a clear expression of what was noblest and loveliest in itself at the supreme moments in the divine exigencies  i believe neither in heroes nor in saints but i believe in great and good men for i have known them and among such men lowell was of the richest nature i have known  his nature was not always serene or pellucid it was sometimes roiled by the currents that counter and cross in all of us but it was without the least alloy of insincerity and it was never darkened by the shadow of a selfish fear  his genius was an instrument that responded in affluent harmony to the power that made him a humorist and that made him a poet and appointed him rarely to be quite either alone     etext editors bookmarks  i believe neither in heroes nor in saints it is well to hold ones country to her promises liked being with you not for what he got but for what he gave    end of this project gutenberg etext of studies of lowell by william dean howells       literary friends and acquaintancescambridge neighbors  by william dean howells   cambridge neighbors  being the wholly literary spirit i was when i went to make my home in cambridge i do not see how i could well have been more content if i had found myself in the elysian fields with an agreeable eternity before me at twentynine indeed one is practically immortal and at that age time had for me the effect of an eternity in which i had nothing to do but to read books and dream of writing them in the overflow of endless hours from my work with the manuscripts critical notices and proofs of the atlantic monthly  as for the social environment i should have been puzzled if given my choice among the elect of all the ages to find poets and scholars more to my mind than those still in the flesh at cambridge in the early afternoon of the nineteenth century  they are now nearly all dead and i can speak of them in the freedom which is deaths doubtful favor to the survivor but if they were still alive i could say little to their offence unless their modesty was hurt with my praise     i  one of the first and truest of our cambridge friends was that exquisite intelligence who in a world where so many people are grotesquely miscalled was most fitly named for no man ever kept here more perfectly and purely the heart of such as the kingdom of heaven is of than francis j child  he was then in his prime and i like to recall the outward image which expressed the inner man as happily as his name  he was of low stature and of an inclination which never became stoutness but what you most saw when you saw him was his face of consummate refinement very regular with eyes always glassed by goldrimmed spectacles a straight short most sensitive nose and a beautiful mouth with the sweetest smile mouth ever wore and that was as wise and shrewd as it was sweet  in a time when every other man was more or less bearded he was clean shaven and of a delightful freshness of coloring which his thick sunny hair clustering upon his head in close rings admirably set off  i believe he never became gray and the last time i saw him though he was broken then with years and pain his face had still the brightness of his inextinguishable youth  it is well known how great was professor childs scholarship in the branches of his harvard work and how especially how uniquely effective it was in the study of english and scottish balladry to which he gave so many years of his life  he was a poet in his nature and he wrought with passion as well as knowledge in the achievement of as monumental a task as any american has performed  but he might have been indefinitely less than he was in any intellectual wise and yet been precious to those who knew him for the gentleness and the goodness which in him were protected from misconception by a final dignity as delicate and as inviolable as that of longfellow himself  we were still much less than a year from our life in venice when he came to see us in cambridge and in the italian interest which then commended us to so many fine spirits among our neighbors we found ourselves at the beginning of a lifelong friendship with him  i was known to him only by my letters from venice which afterwards became venetian life and by a bit of devotional verse which he had asked to include in a collection he was making but he immediately gave us the freedom of his heart which after wards was never withdrawn  in due time he imagined a homeschool to which our little one was asked and she had her first lessons with his own daughter under his roof  these things drew us closer together and he was willing to be still nearer to me in any time of trouble  at one such time when the shadow which must some time darken every door hovered at ours he had the strength to make me face it and try to realize while it was still there that it was not cruel and not evil  it passed for that time but the sense of his help remained and in my own case i can testify of the potent tenderness which all who knew him must have known in him  but in bearing my witness i feel accused almost as if he were present by his fastidious reluctance from any recognition of his helpfulness when this came in the form of gratitude taking credit to itself in a pose which reflected honor upon him as the architect of greatness he was delightfully impatient of it and he was most amusingly dramatic in reproducing the consciousness of certain ineffectual alumni who used to overwhelm him at commencement solemnities with some such pompous acknowledgment as professor child all that i have become sir i owe to your influence in my college career  he did with delicious mockery the oldfashioned intellectual poseurs among the students who used to walk the groves of harvard with bent head and the left arm crossing the back while the other lodged its hand in the breast of the high buttoned frockcoat and i could fancy that his classes in college did not form the sunniest exposure for young  folly and vanity  i know that he was intolerant of any manner of insincerity and no flattery could take him off his guard  i have seen him meet this with a cutting phrase of rejection and no man was more apt at snubbing the patronage that offers itself at times to all men  but mostly he wished to do people pleasure and he seemed always to be studying how to do it as for need i am sure that worthy and unworthy want had alike the way to his heart  children were always his friends and they repaid with adoration the affection which he divided with them and with his flowers  i recall him in no moments so characteristic as those he spent in making the little ones laugh out of their hearts at his drolling some festive evening in his house and those he gave to sharing with you his joy in his gardening  this i believe began with violets and it went on to roses which he grew in a splendor and profusion impossible to any but a true lover with a genuine gift for them  like lowell he spent his summers in cambridge and in the afternoon you could find him digging or pruning among his roses with an ardor which few caprices of the weather could interrupt  he would lift himself from their ranks which he scarcely overtopped as you came up the footway to his door and peer purblindly across at you  if he knew you at once he traversed the nodding and swaying bushes to give you the hand free of the trowel or knife or if you got indoors unseen by him he would come in holding towards you some exquisite blossom that weighed down the tip of its long stem with a succession of hospitable obeisances  he graced with unaffected poetry a life of as hard study of as hard work and as varied achievement as any i have known or read of and he played with gifts and acquirements such as in no great measure have made reputations  he had a rare and lovely humor which could amuse itself both in english and italian with such an airy burletta as il pesceballo he wrote it in metastasian italian and lowell put it in libretto english he had a critical sense as sound as it was subtle in all literature and whatever he wrote he imbued with the charm of a style finely personal to himself  his learning in the line of his harvard teaching included an early english scholarship unrivalled in his time and his researches in ballad literature left no corner of it untouched i fancy this part of his study was peculiarly pleasant to him for he loved simple and natural things and the beauty which he found nearest life  at least he scorned the pedantic affectations of literary superiority and he used to quote with joyous laughter the swelling exclamation of an italian critic who proposed to leave the summits of polite learning for a moment with the cry scendiamo fra il popolo let us go down among the people     ii  of course it was only so hard worked a man who could take thought and trouble for another  he once took thought for me at a time when it was very important to me and when he took the trouble to secure for me an engagement to deliver that course of lowell lectures in boston which i have said lowell had the courage to go in town to hear  i do not remember whether professor child was equal to so much but he would have been if it were necessary and i rather rejoice now in the belief that he did not seek quite that martyrdom  he had done more than enough for me but he had done only what he was always willing to do for others  in the form of a favor to himself he brought into my fife the great happiness of intimately knowing hjalmar hjorth boyesen whom he had found one summer day among the shelves in the harvard library and found to be a poet and an intending novelist  i do not remember now just how this fact imparted itself to the professor but literature is of easily cultivated confidence in youth and possibly the revelation was spontaneous  at any rate as a susceptible young editor i was asked to meet my potential contributor at the professors two oclock dinner and when we came to coffee in the study boyesen took from the pocket nearest his heart a chapter of gunnar and read it to us  perhaps the good professor who brought us together had plotted to have both novel and novelist make their impression at once upon the youthful subeditor but at any rate they did not fail of an effect  i believe it was that chapter where gunnar and ragnhild dance and sing a stev together for i associate with that far happy time the rich mellow tones of the poets voice in the poets verse  these were most characteristic of him and it is as if i might put my ear against the ethereal wall beyond which he is rapt and hear them yet  our meeting was on a lovely afternoon of summer and the odor of the professors roses stole in at the open windows and became part of the gentle event  boyesen walked home with me and for a fortnight after i think we parted only to dream of the literature which we poured out upon each other in every waking moment  i had just learned to know bjornsons stories and boyesen told me of his poetry and of his drama which in even measure embodied the great norse literary movement and filled me with the wonder and delight of that noble revolt against convention that brave return to nature and the springs of poetry in the heart and the speech of the common people  literature was boyesens religion more than the swedenborgian philosophy in which we had both been spiritually nurtured and at every step of our mounting friendship we found ourselves on common ground in our worship of it  i was a decade his senior but at thirtyfive i was not yet so stricken in years as not to be able fully to rejoice in the ardor which fused his whole being in an incandescent poetic mass  i have known no man who loved poetry more generously and passionately and i think he was above all things a poet  his work took the shape of scholarship fiction criticism but poetry gave it all a touch of grace and beauty  some years after this first meeting of ours i remember a pathetic moment with him when i asked him why he had not written any verse of late and he answered as if still in sad astonishment at the fact that he had found life was not all poetry  in those earlier days i believe he really thought it was  perhaps it really is and certainly in the course of a life that stretched almost to half a century boyesen learned more and more to see the poetry of the everyday world at least as the material of art  he did battle valiantly for that belief in many polemics which i suppose gave people a sufficiently false notion of him and he showed his faith by works in fiction which better illustrated his motive  gunnar stands at the beginning of these works and at the farthest remove from it in matter and method stands the mammon of unrighteousness  the lovely idyl won him fame and friendship and the great novel added neither to him though he had put the experience and the observation of his ripened life into it  whether it is too late or too early for it to win the place in literature which it merits i do not know but it always seemed to me the very spite of fate that it should have failed of popular effect  yet i must own that it has so failed and i own this without bitterness towards gunnar which embalmed the spirit of his youth as the mammon of unrighteousness embodied the thought of his manhood     iii  it was my pleasure my privilege to bring gunnar before the public as editor of the atlantic monthly and to second the author in many a struggle with the strange idiom he had cast the story in  the proofs went back and forth between us till the author had profited by every hint and suggestion of the editor  he was quick to profit by any hint and he never made the same mistake twice  he lived his english as fast as he learned it the right word became part of him and he put away the wrong word with instant and final rejection  he had not learned american english without learning newspaper english but if one touched a phrase of it in his work he felt in his nerves which are the ultimate arbiters in such matters its difference from true american and true english it was wonderful how apt and how elect his diction was in those days it seemed as if his thought clothed itself in the fittest phrase without his choosing  in his poetry he had extraordinary good fortune from the first  his mind had an apparent affinity with what was most native most racy in our speech and i have just been looking over gunnar and marvelling anew at the felicity and the beauty of his phrasing  i do not know whether those who read his books stop much to consider how rare his achievement was in the mere means of expression  our speech is rather more hospitable than most and yet i can remember but five other writers born to different languages who have handled english with anything like his mastery  two italians ruffini the novelist and gallenga the journalist two germans carl schurz and carl hillebrand and the dutch novelist maarten maartens have some of them equalled but none of them surpassed him  yet he was a man grown when he began to speak and to write english though i believe he studied it somewhat in norway before he came to america  what english he knew he learned the use of here and in the measure of its idiomatic vigor we may be proud of it as americans  he had least of his native grace i think in his criticism and yet as a critic he had qualities of rare temperance acuteness and knowledge he had very decided convictions in literary art one kind of thing he believed was good and all other kinds less good down to what was bad but he was not a bigot and he made allowances for artinerror  his hand fell heavy only upon those heretics who not merely denied the faith but pretended that artifice was better than nature that decoration was more than structure that makebelieve was something you could live by as you live by truth  he was not strongest however in damnatory criticism his spirit was too large too generous to dwell in that and it rose rather to its full height in his appreciations of the great authors whom he loved and whom he commented from the plenitude of his scholarship as well as from his delighted sense of their grandeur  here he was almost as fine as in his poetry and only less fine than in his more fortunate essays in fiction  after gunnar he was a long while in striking another note so true  he did not strike it again till he wrote the mammon of unrighteousness and after that he was sometimes of a wandering and uncertain touch there are certain stories of his which i cannot read without a painful sense of their inequality not only to his talent but to his knowledge of human nature and of american character  he understood our character quite as well as he understood our language but at times he seemed not to do so  i think these were the times when he was overworked and ought to have been resting instead of writing  in such fatigue one loses command of alien words alien situations and in estimating boyesens achievements we must never forget that he was born strange to our language and to our life  in gunnar he handled the one with grace and charm in his great novel he handled both with masterly strength  i call the mammon of unrighteousness a great novel and i am quite willing to say that i know few novels by born americans that surpass it in dealing with american types and conditions  it has the vast horizon of the masterpieces of fictions its meanings are not for its characters alone but for every reader of it when you close the book the story is not at an end  i have a pang in praising it for i remember that my praise cannot please him any more  but it was a book worthy the powers which could have given us yet greater things if they had not been spent on lesser things boyesen could toil terribly but for his fame he did not always toil wisely though he gave himself as utterly in his unwise work as in his best it was always the best he could do  several years after our first meeting in cambridge he went to live in new york a city where money counts for more and goes for less than in any other city of the world and he could not resist the temptation to write more and more when he should have written less and less  he never wrote anything that was not worth reading but he wrote too much for one who was giving himself with all his conscience to his academic work in the university honored by his gifts and his attainments and was lecturing far and near in the vacations which should have been days and weeks and months of leisure the wonder is that even such a stock of health as his could stand the strain so long but he had no vices and his only excesses were in the direction of the work which he loved so well  when a man adds to his achievements every year we are apt to forget the things he has already done and i think it well to remind the reader that boyesen who died at fortyeight had written besides articles reviews and lectures unnumbered four volumes of scholarly criticism on german and scandinavian literature a volume of literary and social essays a popular history of norway a volume of poems twelve volumes of fiction and four books for boys  boyesens energies were inexhaustible  he was not content to be merely a scholar merely an author he wished to be an active citizen to take his part in honest politics and to live for his day in things that most men of letters shun  his experience in them helped him to know american life better and to appreciate it more justly both in its good and its evil and as a matter of fact he knew us very well  his acquaintance with us had been wide and varied beyond that of most of our literary men and touched many aspects of our civilization which remain unknown to most americans  when be died he had been a journalist in chicago and a teacher in ohio he had been a professor in cornell university and a literary free lance in new york and everywhere his eyes and ears had kept themselves open  as a teacher he learned to know the more fortunate or the more ambitious of our youth and as a lecturer his knowledge was continually extending itself among all ages and classes of americans  he was through and through a norseman but he was none the less a very american  between norsk and yankee there is an affinity of spirit more intimate than the ties of race  both have the commonsense view of life both are unsentimental  when boyesen told me that among the norwegians men never kissed each other as the germans and the frenchmen and the italians do i perceived that we stood upon common ground  when he explained the democratic character of society in norway i could well understand how he should find us a little behind his own countrymen in the practice if not the theory of equality though they lived under a king and we under a president  but he was proud of his american citizenship he knew all that it meant at its best for humanity  he divined that the true expression of america was not civic not social but domestic almost and that the people in the simplest homes or those who remained in the tradition of a simple home life were the true americans as yet whatever the future americans might be  when i first knew him he was chafing with the impatience of youth and ambition at what he thought his exile in the west  there was to be sure a difference between urbana ohio and cambridge massachusetts and he realized the difference in the extreme and perhaps beyond it i tried to make him believe that if a man had one or two friends anywhere who loved letters and sympathized with him in his literary attempts it was incentive enough but of course he wished to be in the centres of literature as we all do and he never was content until he had set his face and his foot eastward  it was a great step for him from the swedenborgian school at urbana to the young university at ithaca and i remember his exultation in making it  but he could not rest there and in a few years he resigned his professorship and came to new york where he entered highheartedly upon the struggle with fortune which ended in his appointment in columbia  new york is a mart and not a capital in literature as well as in other things and doubtless he increasingly felt this  i know that there came a time when he no longer thought the west must be exile for a literary man and his latest visits to its summer schools as a lecturer impressed him with the genuineness of the interest felt there in culture of all kinds  he spoke of this with a due sense of what was pathetic as well as what was grotesque in some of its manifestations and i think that in reconciling himself to our popular crudeness for the sake of our popular earnestness he completed his naturalization in the only sense in which our citizenship is worth having  i do not wish to imply that he forgot his native land or ceased to love it proudly and tenderly  he kept for norway the fondness which the man sitting at his own hearth feels for the home of his boyhood  he was of good family his people were people of substance and condition and he could have had an easier life there than here  he could have won even wider fame and doubtless if he had remained in norway he would have been one of that group of great norwegians who have given their little land renown surpassed by that of no other in the modern republic of letters  the name of boyesen would have been set with the names of bjornson of ibsen of kielland and of lie  but when once he had seen america at the wish of his father who had visited the united states before him he thought only of becoming an american  when i first knew him he was full of the poetry of his motherland his talk was of fjords and glaciers of firs and birches of hulders and nixies of housemen and gaardsmen but he was glad to be here and i think he never regretted that he had cast his lot with us  always of course he had the deepest interest in his country and countrymen  he stood the friend of every norwegian who came to him in want or trouble and they came to him freely and frequently  he sympathized strongly with norway in her quarrel with sweden and her wish for equality as well as autonomy and though he did not go all lengths with the national party he was decided in his feeling that sweden was unjust to her sister kingdom and strenuous for the principles of the norwegian leaders  but as i have said poetry was what his ardent spirit mainly meditated in that hour when i first knew him in cambridge before we had either of us grown old and sad if not wise  he overflowed with it and he talked as little as he dreamed of anything else in the vast halfsummer we spent together  he was constantly at my house where in an absence of my family i was living bachelor and where we sat indoors and talked or sauntered outdoors and talked with our heads in a cloud of fancies not unmixed with the mosquitoes of cambridge if i could have back the fancies i would be willing to have the mosquitoes with them  he looked the poetry he lived his eyes were the blue of sunlit fjords his brown silken hair was thick on the crown which it later abandoned to a scholarly baldness his soft red lips half hid a boyish pout in the youthful beard and mustache  he was short of stature but of a stalwart breadth of frame and his voice was of a peculiar and endearing quality indescribably mellow and tender when he read his verse  i have hardly the right to dwell so long upon him here for he was only a sojourner in cambridge but the memory of that early intimacy is too much for my sense of proportion  as i have hinted our intimacy was renewed afterwards when i too came to live in new york where as long as he was in this dolce lome he hardly let a week go by without passing a long evening with me  our talk was still of literature and life but more of life than of literature and we seldom spoke of those old times  i still found him true to the ideals which had clarified themselves to both of us as the duty of unswerving fealty to the real thing in whatever we did this we felt as we had felt it long before to be the sole source of beauty and of art and we warmed ourselves at each others hearts in our devotion to it amidst a misunderstanding environment which we did not characterize by so mild an epithet  boyesen indeed outrealisted me in the polemics of our aesthetics and sometimes when an unbeliever was by i willingly left to my friend the affirmation of our faith not without some quaking at his unsparing strenuousness in disciplining the heretic  but now that ardent and active soul is elsewhere and i have ceased even to expect the ring which making itself heard at the late hour of his coming i knew always to be his and not anothers  that mechanical expectation of those who will come no more is something terrible but when even that ceases we know the irreparability of our loss and begin to realize how much of ourselves they have taken with them     iv  it was some years before the boyesen summer which was the fourth or fifth of our life in cambridge that i made the acquaintance of a man very much my senior who remains one of the vividest personalities in my recollection  i speak of him in this order perhaps because of an obscure association with boyesen through their religious faith which was also mine  but henry james was incommensurably more swedenborgian than either of us he lived and thought and felt swedenborg with an entirety and intensity far beyond the mere assent of other men  he did not do this in any stupidly exclusive way but in the most luminously inclusive way with a constant reference of these vain mundane shadows to the spiritual realities from which they project  his piety which sometimes expressed itself in terms of alarming originality and freedom was too large for any ecclesiastical limits and one may learn from the books which record it how absolutely individual his interpretations of swedenborg were clarifications they cannot be called and in that other world whose substantial verity was the inspiration of his life here the two sages may by this time have met and agreed to differ as to some points in the doctrine of the seer  in such a case i cannot imagine the apostle giving way and i do not say he would be wrong to insist but i think he might now be willing to allow that the exegetic pages which sentence by sentence were so brilliantly suggestive had sometimes a collective opacity which the most resolute vision could not penetrate  he put into this dark wisdom the most brilliant intelligence ever brought to the service of his mystical faith he lighted it up with flashes of the keenest wit and bathed it in the glow of a lambent humor so that it is truly wonderful to me how it should remain so unintelligible  but i have only tried to read certain of his books and perhaps if i had persisted in the effort i might have found them all as clear at last as the one which seems to me the clearest and is certainly most encouragingly suggestive i mean the one called society the redeemed form of man  he had his whole being in his belief it had not only liberated him from the bonds of the calvinistic theology in which his youth was trammelled but it had secured him against the conscious ethicism of the prevailing unitarian doctrine which supremely worshipped conduct and it had colored his vocabulary to such strange effects that he spoke of moral men with abhorrence as more hopelessly lost than sinners  any one whose sphere tempted him to recognition of the foibles of others he called the devil but in spite of his perception of such diabolism he was rather fond of yielding to it for he had a most trenchant tongue  i myself once fell under his condemnation as the devil by having too plainly shared his joy in his characterization of certain fellowmen perhaps a group of bostonians from whom he had just parted and whose reciprocal pleasure of themselves he presented in the image of simmering in their own fat and putting a nice brown on each other  swedenborg himself he did not spare as a man  he thought that very likely his life had those lapses in it which some of his followers deny and he regarded him on the aesthetical side as essentially commonplace and as probably chosen for his prophetic function just because of his imaginative nullity his tremendous revelations could be the more distinctly and unmistakably inscribed upon an intelligence of that sort which alone could render again a strictly literal report of them  as to some other sorts of believers who thought they had a special apprehension of the truth he had no mercy upon them if they betrayed however innocently any selfcomplacency in their possession  i went one evening to call upon him with a dear old shaker elder who had the misfortune to say that his people believed themselves to be living the angelic life  james fastened upon him with the suggestion that according to swedenborg the most celestial angels were unconscious of their own perfection and that if the shakers felt they were of angelic condition they were probably the sport of the hells  i was very glad to get my poor old friend off alive and to find that he was not even aware of being cut asunder i did not invite him to shake himself  with spiritualists james had little or no sympathy he was not so impatient of them as the swedenborgians commonly are and he probably acknowledged a measure of verity in the spiritistic phenomena but he seemed rather incurious concerning them and he must have regarded them as superfluities of naughtiness mostly as emanations from the hells his powerful and penetrating intellect interested itself with all social and civil facts through his religion  he was essentially religious but he was very consciously a citizen with most decided opinions upon political questions  my own darkness as to anything like social reform was then so dense that i cannot now be clear as to his feeling in such matters but i have the impression that it was far more radical than i could understand  he was of a very merciful mind regarding things often held in pitiless condemnation but of charity as it is commonly understood he had misgivings  he would never have turned away from him that asketh but he spoke with regret of some of his benefactions in the past large gifts of money to individuals which he now thought had done more harm than good  i never knew him to judge men by the society scale  he was most human in his relations with others and was in correspondence with all sorts of people seeking light and help he answered their letters and tried to instruct them and no one was so low or weak but he or she could reach him on his or her own level though he had his humorous perception of their foibles and disabilities and he had that keen sense of the grotesque which often goes with the kindliest nature  he told of his dining early in life next a fellowman from cape cod at the astor house where such a man could seldom have found himself  when they were served with meat this neighbor asked if he would mind his putting his fat on jamess plate he disliked fat  james said that he considered the request and seeing no good reason against it consented  he could be cruel with his tongue when he fancied insincerity or pretence and then cruelly sorry for the hurt he gave  he was indeed tremulously sensitive not only for himself but for others and would offer atonement far beyond the measure of the offence he supposed himself to have given  at all times he thought originally in words of delightful originality which painted a fact with the greatest vividness  of a person who had a nervous twitching of the face and who wished to call up a friend to them he said he spasmed to the fellow across the room and introduced him  his written style had traits of the same bold adventurousness but it was his speech which was most captivating  as i write of him i see him before me his white bearded face with a kindly intensity which at first glance seemed fierce the mouth humorously shaping the mustache the eyes vague behind the glasses his sensitive hand gripping the stick on which he rested his weight to ease it from the artificial limb he wore     v  the goethean face and figure of louis agassiz were in those days to be seen in the shady walks of cambridge to which for me they lent a weimarish quality in the degree that in weimar itself a few years ago i felt a quality of cambridge  agassiz of course was swiss and latin and not teutonic but he was of the continental european civilization and was widely different from the other cambridge men in everything but love of the place  he is always an europaen said lowell one day in distinguishing concerning him and for any one who had tasted the flavor of the life beyond the ocean and the channel this had its charm  yet he was extremely fond of his adoptive compatriots and no alien born had a truer or tenderer sense of new england character  i have an idea that no one else of his day could have got so much money for science out of the general court of massachusetts and i have heard him speak with the wisest and warmest appreciation of the hard material from which he was able to extract this treasure  the legislators who voted appropriations for his museum and his other scientific objects were not usually lawyers or professional men with the perspectives of a liberal education but were hardfisted farmers who had a grip of the states money as if it were their own and yet gave it with intelligent munificence they understood that he did not want it for himself and had no interested aim in getting it they knew that as he once said he had no time to make money and wished to use it solely for the advancement of learning and with this understanding they were ready to help him generously he compared their liberality with that of kings and princes when these patronized science with a recognition of the superior plebeian generosity  it was on the veranda of his summer house at nahant while he lay in the hammock talking of this that i heard him refer also to the offer which napoleon iii had made him inviting him upon certain splendid conditions to come to paris after he had established himself in cambridge  he said that he had not come to america without going over every such possibility in his own mind and deciding beforehand against it  he was a republican by nationality and by preference and was entirely satisfied with his position and environment in new england  outside of his scientific circle in cambridge he was more friends with longfellow than with any one else i believe and longfellow told me how after the doctors had condemned agassiz to inaction on account of his failing health he had broken down in his friends study and wept like an europaer and lamented i shall never finish my work  some papers which he had begun to write for the magazine in contravention of the darwinian theory or part of it which it is known agassiz did not accept remained part of the work which he never finished  after his death i wished professor jeffries wyman to write of him in the atlantic but he excused himself on account of his many labors and then he voluntarily spoke of agassizs methods which he agreed with rather than his theories being himself thoroughly darwinian  i think he said agassiz was the first to imagine establishing a fact not from a single example but from examples indefinitely repeated  if it was a question of something about robins for instance he would have a hundred robins examined before he would receive an appearance as a fact  of course no preconception or prepossession of his own was suffered to bar his way to the final truth he was seeking and he joyously renounced even a conclusion if he found it mistaken  i do not know whether mrs agassiz has put into her interesting life of him a delightful story which she told me about him  he came to her beaming one day and demanded you know i have always held such and such an opinion about a certain group of fossil fishes  yes yes  well i have just been reading s new book and he has shown me that there isnt the least truth in my theory and he burst into a laugh of unalloyed pleasure in relinquishing his error  i could touch science at cambridge only on its literary and social side of course and my meetings with agassiz were not many  i recall a dinner at his house to mr bret harte when the poet came on from california and agassiz approached him over the coffee through their mutual scientific interest in the last meeting of the geological society upon the stanislow  he quoted to the author some passages from the poem recording the final proceedings of this body which had particularly pleased him and i think mr harte was as much amused at finding himself thus in touch with the savant as agassiz could ever have been with that delicious poem  agassiz lived at one end of quincy street and james almost at the other end with an interval between them which but poorly typified their difference of temperament  the one was all philosophical and the other all scientific and yet towards the close of his life agassiz may be said to have led that movement towards the new position of science in matters of mystery which is now characteristic of it  he was ancestrally of the swiss brahminical caste as so many of his friends in cambridge were of the brahminical caste of new england and perhaps it was the line of ancestral pasteurs which at last drew him back or on to the affirmation of an unformulated faith of his own  at any rate before most other savants would say that they had souls of their own he became by opening a summer school of science with prayer nearly as consolatory to the unscientific who wished to believe they had souls as mr john fiske himself though mr fiske as the archapostle of darwinism had arrived at nearly the same point by such a very different road  mr fiske had been our neighbor in our first cambridge home and when we went to live in berkeley street he followed with his family and placed himself across the way in a house which i already knew as the home of richard henry dana the author of two years before the mast  like nearly all the other cambridge men of my acquaintance dana was very much my senior and like the rest he welcomed my literary promise as cordially as if it were performance with no suggestion of the condescension which was said to be his attitude towards many of his fellowmen  i never saw anything of this in fact and i suppose he may have been a blend of those patrician qualities and democratic principles which made lowell anomalous even to himself  he is part of the antislavery history of his time and he gave to the oppressed his strenuous help both as a man and a politician his gifts and learning in the law were freely at their service  he never lost his interest in those white slaves whose brutal bondage he remembered as bound with them in his two years before the mast and any luckless seaman with a case or cause might count upon his friendship as surely as the black slaves of the south  he was able to temper his indignation for their oppression with a humorous perception of what was droll in its agents and circumstances and i wish i could recall all that he said once about seaetiquette on merchant vessels where the chief mate might no more speak to the captain at table without being addressed by him than a subject might put a question to his sovereign he was amusing in his stories of the pacific trade in which he said it was very noble to deal in furs from the northwest and very ignoble to deal in hides along the mexican and south american coasts  every ships master wished naturally to be in the furcarrying trade and in one of danas instances two vessels encounter in midocean and exchange the usual parley as to their respective ports of departure and destination the final demand comes through the trumpet what cargo and the captain so challenged yields to temptation and roars back furs  a moment of hesitation elapses and then the questioner pursues here and there a horn  there were other distinctions of which seafaring men of other days were keenly sensible and dana dramatized the meeting of a great swelling east indiaman with a little atlantic trader which has hailed her  she shouts back through her captains trumpet that she is from calcutta and laden with silks spices and other orient treasures and in her turn she requires like answer from the sail which has presumed to enter into parley with her  what cargo the trader confesses to a mixed cargo for boston and to the final question her master replies in meek apology only from liverpool sir and scuttles down the horizon as swiftly as possible  dana was not of the cambridge men whose calling was in cambridge  he was a lawyer in active practice and he went every day to boston  one was apt to meet him in those horsecars which formerly tinkled back and forth between the two cities and which were often so full of ones acquaintance that they had all the social elements of an afternoon tea they were abusively overcrowded at times of course and one might easily see a prime literary celebrity swaying from a strap or hanging uneasily by the handrail to the lower steps of the back platform  i do not mean that i ever happened to see the author of two years before the mast in either fact but in his celebrity he had every qualification for the illustration of my point  his book probably carried the american name farther and wider than any american books except those of irving and cooper at a day when our writers were very little known and our literature was the only infant industry not fostered against foreign ravage but expressly left to harden and strengthen itself as it best might in a heartless neglect even at home  the book was delightful and i remember it from a reading of thirty years ago as of the stuff that classics are made of  i venture no conjecture as to its present popularity but of all books relating to the sea i think it is the best the author when i knew him was still richard henry dana jr his father the aged poet who first established the name in the public recognition being alive though past literary activity  it was distinctively a literary race and in the actual generation it has given proofs of its continued literary vitality in the romance of espiritu santo by the youngest daughter of the dana i knew     vii  there could be no stronger contrast to him in origin education and character than a man who lived at the same time in cambridge and who produced a book which in its final fidelity to life is not unworthy to be named with two years before the mast  ralph keeler wrote the vagabond adventures which he had lived  i have it on my heart to name him in the presence of our great literary men not only because i had an affection for him tenderer than i then knew but because i believe his book is worthier of more remembrance than it seems to enjoy  i was reading it only the other day and i found it delightful and much better than i imagined when i accepted for the atlantic the several papers which it is made up of  i am not sure but it belongs to the great literature in that fidelity to life which i have spoken of and which the author brought himself to practise with such difficulty and under so much stress from his editor  he really wanted to fake it at times but he was docile at last and did it so honestly that it tells the history of his strange career in much better terms than it can be given again  he had been as he claimed a cruel uncles ward in his early orphanhood and while yet almost a child he had run away from home to fulfil his hearts desire of becoming a clogdancer in a troupe of negro minstrels  but it was first his fate to be cabinboy and bootblack on a lake steamboat and meet with many squalid adventures scarcely to be matched outside of a spanish picaresque novel  when he did become a dancer and even a danseuse of the sort he aspired to be the fruition of his hopes was so little what he imagined that he was very willing to leave the floating palace on the mississippi in which his troupe voyaged and exhibited and enter the college of the jesuit fathers at cape girardeau in missouri they were very good to him and in their charge he picked up a good deal more latin if not less greek than another strolling player who also took to literature  from college keeler went to europe and then to california whence he wrote me that he was coming on to boston with the manuscript of a novel which he wished me to read for the magazine  i reported against it to my chief but nothing could shake keelers faith in it until he had printed it at his own cost and known it fail instantly and decisively  he had come to cambridge to see it through the press and he remained there four or five years with certain brief absences  then during the cuban insurrection of the early seventies he accepted the invitation of a new york paper to go to cuba as its correspondent  dont go keeler i entreated him when he came to tell me of his intention  theyll garrote you down there  well he said with the air of being pleasantly interested by the coincidence as he stood on my study hearth with his feet wide apart in a fashion he had and gayly flirted his hand in the air thats what aldrich says and hes agreed to write my biography on condition that i make a last dying speech when they bring me out on the plaza to do it if i had taken the advice of my friend t b aldrich author of marjorie daw and other people i should not now be in this place  he went and he did not come back  he was not indeed garroted as his friends had promised but he was probably assassinated on the steamer by which he sailed from santiago for he never arrived in havana and was never heard of again  i now realize that i loved him though i did as little to show it as men commonly do  if i am to meet somewhere else the friends who are no longer here i should like to meet ralph keeler and i would take some chances of meeting in a happy place a soul which had by no means kept itself unspotted but which in all its consciousness of error cheerfully trusted that the almighty was not going to scoop any of us  the faith worded so grotesquely could not have been more simply or humbly affirmed and no man i think could have been more helplessly sincere  he had nothing of that false selfrespect which forbids a man to own himself wrong promptly and utterly when need is and in fact he owned to some things in his checkered past which would hardly allow him any sort of selfrespect  he had always an essential gaiety not to be damped by any discipline and a docility which expressed itself in cheerful compliance why do you use bias for opinion i demanded in going over a proof with him  oh because im such an asssuch a biass  he had a philosophy which he liked to impress with a vivid touch on his listeners shoulder put your finger on the present moment and enjoy it its the only one youve got or ever will have  this light and joyous creature could not but be a pariah among our brahmins and i need not say that i never met him in any of the great cambridge houses  i am not sure that he was a persona grata to every one in my own for keeler was framed rather for mens liking and mr aldrich and i had our subtleties as to whether his mind about women was not so chinese as somewhat to infect his manner  keeler was too really modest to be of any rebellious mind towards the society which ignored him and of too sweet a cheerfulness to be greatly vexed by it  he lived on in the house of a suave old actor who oddly made his home in cambridge and he continued of a harmless bohemianism in his daily walk which included lunches at boston restaurants as often as he could get you to let him give them you if you were of his acquaintance  on a sunday he would appear coming out of the postoffice usually at the hour when all cultivated cambridge was coming for its letters and wave a glad hand in air and shout a blithe salutation to the friend he had marked for his companion in a morning stroll  the stroll was commonly over the flats towards brighton i do not know why except perhaps that it was out of the beat of the better element and the talk was mainly of literature in which he was doing less than he meant to do and which he seemed never able quite to feel was not a branch of the show business and might not be legitimately worked by like advertising though he truly loved and honored it  i suppose it was not altogether a happy life and keeler had his moments of amusing depression which showed their shadows in his smiling face he was of a slight figure and low stature with hands and feet of almost womanish littleness  he was very blonde and his restless eyes were blue he wore his yellow beard in whiskers only which he pulled nervously but perhaps did not get to droop so much as he wished     viii  keeler was a native of ohio and there lived at cambridge when i first came there an indianian more accepted by literary society who was of real quality as a poet  forceythe willson whose poem of the old sergeant doctor holmes used to read publicly in the closing year of the civil war was of a western altitude of figure and of an extraordinary beauty of face in an oriental sort  he had large dark eyes with clouded whites his full silken beard was of a flashing persian blackness he was excessively nervous to such an extreme that when i first met him at longfellows he could not hold himself still in his chair  i think this was an effect of shyness in him as well as physical for afterwards when i went to find him in his own house he was much more at ease  he preferred to receive me in the dim large hall after opening his door to me himself and we sat down there and talked i remember of supernatural things  he was much interested in spiritualism and he had several stories to tell of his own experience in such matters  but none was so good as one which i had at second hand from lowell who thought it almost the best ghost story he had ever heard  the spirit of willsons father appeared to him and stood before him  willson was accustomed to apparitions and so he said simply wont you sit down father  the phantom put out his hand to lay hold of a chairback as some people do in taking a seat and his shadowy arm passed through the framework ah he said i forgot that i was not substance  i do not know whether the old sergeant is ever read now it has probably passed with other great memories of the great war and i am afraid none of willsons other verse is remembered  but he was then a distinct literary figure and not to be left out of the count of our poets  i did not see him again  shortly afterwards i heard that he had left cambridge with signs of consumption which must have run a rapid course for a very little later came the news of his death     ix  the most devoted cantabrigian after lowell whom i knew would perhaps have contended that if he had stayed with us willson might have lived for john holmes affirmed a faith in the virtues of the place which ascribed almost an aseptic character to its air and when he once listened to my own complaints of an obstinate cold he cheered himself if not me with the declaration well one thing mr howells cambridge never let a man keep a cold yet  if he had said it was better to live in cambridge with a cold than elsewhere without one i should have believed him as it was cambridge bore him out in his assertion though she took her own time to do it  lowell had talked to me of him before i met him celebrating his peculiar humor with that affection which was not always so discriminating and holmes was one of the first cambridge men i knew  i knew him first in the charming old colonial house in which his famous brother and he were born  it was demolished long before i left cambridge but in memory it still stands on the ground since occupied by the hemenway gymnasium and shows for me through that bulk a phantom frame of continental buff in the shadow of elms that are shadows themselves  the genius loci was limping about the pleasant mansion with the rheumatism which then expressed itself to his friends in a resolute smile but which now insists upon being an essential trait of the fulllength presence to my mind a short stout figure helped out with a cane and a grizzled head with features formed to win the heart rather than the eye of the beholder  in one of his own eyes there was a cast of such winning humor and geniality that it took the liking more than any beauty could have done and the sweetest shy laugh in the world went with this cast  i long wished to get him to write something for the magazine and at last i prevailed with him to review a history of cambridge which had come out  he did it charmingly of course for he loved more to speak of cambridge than anything else  he held his native town in an idolatry which was not blind but which was none the less devoted because he was aware of her droll points and her weak points  he always celebrated these as so many virtues and i think it was my own passion for her that first commended me to him  i was not her son but he felt that this was my misfortune more than my fault and he seemed more and more to forgive it  after we had got upon the terms of editor and contributor we met oftener than before though i do not now remember that i ever persuaded him to write again for me  once he gave me something and then took it back with a selfdistrust of it which i could not overcome  when the holmes house was taken down he went to live with an old domestic in a small house on the street amusingly called appian way  he had certain rooms of her and his own table but he would not allow that he was ever anything but a lodger in the place where he continued till he died  in the process of time he came so far to trust his experience of me that he formed the habit of giving me an annual supper  some days before this event he would appear in my study and with divers delicate and tentative approaches nearly always of the same tenor he would say that he should like to ask my family to an oyster supper with him  but you know he would explain i havent a house of my own to ask you to and i should like to give you the supper here  when i had agreed to this suggestion with due gravity he would inquire our engagements and then say as if a great load were off his mind well then i will send up a few oysters tomorrow or whatever day we had fixed on and after a little more talk to take the strangeness out of the affair would go his way  on the day appointed the fishman would come with several gallons of oysters which he reported mr holmes had asked him to bring and in the evening the giver of the feast would reappear with a lank oilcloth bag sagged by some bottles of wine  there was always a bottle of red wine and sometimes a bottle of champagne and he had taken the precaution to send some crackers beforehand so that the supper should be as entirely of his own giving as possible  he was forced to let us do the cooking and to supply the coldslaw and perhaps he indemnified himself for putting us to these charges and for the use of our linen and silver by the vast superfluity of his oysters with which we remained inundated for days  he did not care to eat many himself but seemed content to fancy doing us a pleasure and i have known few greater ones in life than in the hospitality that so oddly played the host to us at our own table  it must have seemed incomprehensible to such a cantabrigian that we should ever have been willing to leave cambridge and in fact i do not well understand it myself  but if he resented it he never showed his resentment  as often as i happened to meet him after our defection he used me with unabated kindness and sparkled into some gaiety too ethereal for remembrance  the last time i met him was at lowells funeral when i drove home with him and curtis and child and in the revulsion from the stress of that saddest event had our laugh as people do in the presence of death at something droll we remembered of the friend we mourned  my nearest literary neighbor when we lived in sacramento street was the rev dr john g palfrey the historian of new england whose chimney tops amid the pinetops i could see from my study window when the leaves were off the little grove of oaks between us  he was one of the first of my acquaintances not suffering the great disparity of our ages to count against me but tactfully and sweetly adjusting himself to my youth in the friendly intercourse which he invited  he was a most gentle and kindly old man with still an interest in liberal things which lasted till the infirmities of age secluded him from the world and all its interests  as is known he had been in his prime one of the foremost of the new england antislavery men and he had fought the good fight with a heavy heart for a brother long settled in louisiana who sided with the south and who after the civil war found himself disfranchised  in this temporary disability he came north to visit doctor palfrey upon the doctors insistence though at first he would have nothing to do with him and refused even to answer his letters  of course the doctor said i was not going to stand that from my mothers son and i simply kept on writing  so he prevailed but the fiery old gentleman from louisiana was reconciled to nothing in the north but his brother and when he came to return my visit he quickly touched upon his cause of quarrel with us  i cant vote he declared but my coachman can and i dont know how im to get the suffrage unless my physician paints me all over with the iodine hes using for my rheumatic side  doctor palfrey was most distinctly of the brahminical caste and was long an eminent unitarian minister but at the time i began to know him he had long quitted the pulpit  he was so far of civic or public character as to be postmaster at boston when we were first neighbors but this officiality was probably so little in keeping with his nature that it was like a return to his truer self when he ceased to hold the place and gave his time altogether to his history  it is a work which will hardly be superseded in the interest of those who value thorough research and temperate expression  it is very just and without endeavor for picture or drama it is to me very attractive  much that has to be recorded of new england lacks charm but he gave form and dignity and presence to the memories of the past and the finer moments of that great story he gave with the simplicity that was their best setting  it seems to me such an apology in the old sense as new england might have written for herself and in fact doctor palfrey was a personification of new england in one of the best and truest kinds  he was refined in the essential gentleness of his heart without being refined away he kept the faith of her puritan tradition though he no longer kept the puritan faith and his defence of the puritan severity with the witches and quakers was as impartial as it was efficient in positing the puritans as of their time and rather better and not worse than other people of the same time  he was himself a most tolerant man and his tolerance was never weak or fond it stopped well short of condoning error which he condemned when he preferred to leave it to its own punishment  personally he was without any flavor of harshness his mind was as gentle as his manner which was one of the gentlest i have ever known  of as gentle make but of more pensive temper with unexpected bursts of lyrical gaiety was christopher pearse cranch the poet whom i had known in new york long before he came to live in cambridge  he could not only play and sing most amusing songs but he wrote very good poems and painted pictures perhaps not so good  i always liked his venetian pictures for their poetic unsentimentalized veracity and i printed as well as liked many of his poems  during the time that i knew him more than his due share of troubles and sorrows accumulated themselves on his fine head which the years had whitened and gave a droop to the beautiful whitebearded face  but he had the artist soul and the poet heart and no doubt he could take refuge in these from the cares that shadowed his visage  my acquaintance with him in cambridge renewed itself upon the very terms of its beginning in new york  we met at longfellows table where he lifted up his voice in the yankee folksong on springfield mountain there did dwell which he gave with a perfectly killing mockgravity     xi  at cambridge the best society was better it seems to me than even that of the neighboring capital  it would be rather hard to prove this and i must ask the reader to take my word for it if he wishes to believe it the great interests in that pleasant world which i think does not present itself to my memory in a false iridiscence were the intellectual interests and all other interests were lost in these to such as did not seek them too insistently  people held themselves high they held themselves personally aloof from people not duly assayed their civilization was still puritan though their belief had long ceased to be so  they had weights and measure stamped in an earlier time a time surer of itself than ours by which they rated the merit of all comers and rejected such as did not bear the test  these standards were their own and they were satisfied with them most americans have no standards of their own but these are not satisfied even with other peoples and so our society is in a state of tolerant and tremulous misgiving  family counted in cambridge without doubt as it counts in new england everywhere but family alone did not mean position and the want of family did not mean the want of it  money still less than family commanded one could be openly poor in cambridge without open shame or shame at all for no one was very rich there and no one was proud of his riches  i do not wonder that turguenieff thought the conditions ideal as boyesen portrayed them to him and i look back at my own life there with wonder at my good fortune  i was sensible and i still am sensible this had its alloys  i was young and unknown and was making my way and i had to suffer some of the penalties of these disadvantages but i do not believe that anywhere else in this illcontrived economy where it is vainly imagined that the material struggle forms a high incentive and inspiration would my penalties have been so light  on the other hand the good that was done me i could never repay if i lived all over again for others the life that i have so long lived for myself  at times when i had experienced from those elect spirits with whom i was associated some act of friendship as signal as it was delicate i used to ask myself how i could ever do anything unhandsome or ungenerous towards any one again and i had a bad conscience the next time i did it  the air of the cambridge that i knew was sufficiently cool to be bracing but what was of good import in me flourished in it  the life of the place had its lateral limitations sometimes its lights failed to detect excellent things that lay beyond it but upward it opened illimitably i speak of it frankly because that life as i witnessed it is now almost wholly of the past  cambridge is still the home of much that is good and fine in our literature one realizes this if one names colonel thomas wentworth higginson mr john fiske mr william james mr horace e scudder not to name any others but the first had not yet come back to live in his birthplace at the time i have been writing of and the rest had not yet their actual prominence  one in deed among so many absent is still present there whom from time to time i have hitherto named without offering him the recognition which i should have known an infringement of his preferences  but the literary cambridge of thirty years ago could not be clearly imagined or justly estimated without taking into account the creative sympathy of a man whose contributions to our literature only partially represent what he has constantly done for the humanities  i am sure that after the easy heroes of the day are long forgot and the noisy fames of the strenuous life shall dwindle to their essential insignificance before those of the gentle life we shall all see in charles eliot norton the eminent scholar who left the quiet of his books to become our chief citizen at the moment when he warned his countrymen of the ignominy and disaster of doing wrong     etext editors bookmarks  coldslaw collective opacity expectation of those who will come no more felt that this was my misfortune more than my fault found life was not all poetry he had no time to make money intellectual poseurs no time to make money nyc a city where money counts for more and goes for less one could be openly poor in cambridge without open shame put your finger on the present moment and enjoy it standards were their own and they were satisfied with them wonderful to me how it should remain so unintelligible     end of this project gutenberg etext of cambridge neighbors by william dean howells       literary friends and acquaintancesa belated guest  by william dean howells    a belated guest  it is doubtful whether the survivor of any order of things finds compensation in the privilege however undisputed by his contemporaries of recording his memories of it  this is in the first two or three instances a pleasure  it is sweet to sit down in the shade or by the fire and recall names looks and tones from the past and if the absences thus entreated to become presences are those of famous people they lend to the fond historian a little of their lustre in which he basks for the time with an agreeable sense of celebrity  but another time comes and comes very soon when the pensive pleasure changes to the pain of duty and the precious privilege converts itself into a grievous obligation  you are unable to choose your company among those immortal shades if one why not another where all seem to have a right to such gleams of this dolce lome as your reminiscences can shed upon them then they gather so rapidly as the years pass in these pale realms that one if one continues to survive is in danger of wearing out such welcome great or small as met ones recollections in the first two or three instances if one does ones duty by each  people begin to say and not without reason in a world so hurried and wearied as this ah here he is again with his recollections  well but if the recollections by some magical goodfortune chance to concern such a contemporary of his as say bret harte shall not he be partially justified or at least excused     i  my recollections of bret harte begin with the arrest on the atlantic shore of that progress of his from the pacific slope which in the simple days of 1871 was like the progress of a prince in the universal attention and interest which met and followed it  he was indeed a prince a fairy prince in whom every lover of his novel and enchanting art felt a patriotic property for his promise and performance in those earliest tales of the luck of roaring camp and tennessees partner and maggles and the outcasts of poker flat were the earnests of an american literature to come  if it is still to come in great measure that is not hartes fault for he kept on writing those stories in one form or another as long as he lived  he wrote them first and last in the spirit of dickens which no man of his time could quite help doing but he wrote them from the life of bret harte on the soil and in the air of the newest kind of new world and their freshness took the soul of his fellowcountrymen not only with joy but with pride such as the europeans who adored him much longer could never know in him  when the adventurous young editor who had proposed being his host for cambridge and the boston neighborhood while harte was still in san francisco and had not yet begun his princely progress eastward read of the honors that attended his coming from point to point his courage fell as if he had perhaps committed himself in too great an enterprise who was he indeed that he should think of making this                 dear son of memory great heir of fame  his guest especially when he heard that in chicago harte failed of attending a banquet of honor because the givers of it had not sent a carriage to fetch him to it as the alleged use was in san francisco whether true or not and it was probably not true in just that form it must have been this rumor which determined his host to drive into boston for him with the handsomest hack which the livery of cambridge afforded and not trust to the horsecar and the local expressman to get him and his baggage out as he would have done with a less portentous guest  however it was he instantly lost all fear when they met at the station and harte pressed forward with his cordial handclasp as if he were not even a fairy prince and with that voice and laugh which were surely the most winning in the world  he was then as always a child of extreme fashion as to his clothes and the cut of his beard which he wore in a mustache and the drooping sidewhiskers of the day and his jovial physiognomy was as winning as his voice with its straight nose and fascinating thrust of the under lip its fine eyes and good forehead then thickly crowned with the black hair which grew early white while his mustache remained dark the most enviable and consoling effect possible in the universal mortal necessity of either aging or dying he was as one could not help seeing thickly pitted but after the first glance one forgot this so that a lady who met him for the first time could say to him mr harte arent you afraid to go about in the cars so recklessly when there is this scare about smallpox  no madam he could answer in that rich note of his with an irony touched by pseudo pathos i bear a charmed life  the drive out from boston was not too long for getting on terms of personal friendship with the family which just filled the hack the two boys intensely interested in the novelties of a new england city and suburb and the father and mother continually exchanging admiration of such aspects of nature as presented themselves in the leafless sidewalk trees and patches of park and lawn  they found everything so fine so refined after the gigantic coarseness of california where the natural forms were so vast that one could not get on companionable terms with them  their host heard them without misgiving for the world of romance which harte had built up among those huge forms and with a subtle perception that this was no excursion of theirs to the east but a lifelong exodus from the exile which he presently understood they must always have felt california to be  it is different now when people are every day being born in california and must begin to feel it home from the first breath but it is notable that none of the californians of that great early day have gone back to live amid the scenes which inspired and prospered them  before they came in sight of the editors humble roof he had mocked himself to his guest for his trepidations and harte with burlesque magnanimity had consented to be for that occasion only something less formidable than he had loomed afar  he accepted with joy the theory of passing a week in the home of virtuous poverty and the week began as delightfully as it went on  from first to last cambridge amused him as much as it charmed him by that air of academic distinction which was stranger to him even than the refined trees and grass  it has already been told how after a list of the local celebrities had been recited to him he said why you couldnt stand on your front porch and fire off your revolver without bringing down a two volumer and no doubt the pleasure he had in it was the effect of its contrast with the wild california he had known and perhaps when he had not altogether known it had invented     ii  cambridge began very promptly to show him those hospitalities which he could value and continued the fable of his fairy princeliness in the curiosity of those humbler admirers who could not hope to be his hosts or his fellowguests at dinner or luncheon  pretty presences in the tie backs of the period were seen to flit before the home of virtuous poverty hungering for any chance sight of him which his outgoings or incomings might give  the chances were better with the outgoings than with the incomings for these were apt to be so hurried in the final result of his constitutional delays as to have the rapidity of the homing pigeons flight and to afford hardly a glimpse to the quickest eye  it cannot harm him or any one now to own that harte was nearly always late for those luncheons and dinners which he was always going out to and it needed the anxieties and energies of both families to get him into his clothes and then into the carriage where a good deal of final buttoning must have been done in order that he might not arrive so very late  he was the only one concerned who was quite unconcerned his patience with his delays was inexhaustible he arrived at the expected houses smiling serenely jovial radiating a bland gaiety from his whole person and ready to ignore any discomfort he might have occasioned  of course people were glad to have him on his own terms and it may be truly said that it was worth while to have him on any terms  there never was a more charming companion an easier or more delightful guest  it was not from what he said for he was not much of a talker and almost nothing of a storyteller but he could now and then drop the fittest word and with a glance or smile of friendly intelligence express the appreciation of anothers fit word which goes far to establish for a man the character of boon humorist  it must be said of him that if he took the honors easily that were paid him he took them modestly and never by word or look invited them or implied that he expected them  it was fine to see him humorously accepting the humorous attribution of scientific sympathies from agassiz in compliment of his famous epic describing the incidents that broke up the society upon the stanislow  it was a little fearsome to hear him frankly owning to lowell his dislike for something overliterary in the phrasing of certain verses of the cathedral  but lowell could stand that sort of thing from a man who could say the sort of things that harte said to him of that delicious line picturing the bobolink as he            runs down a brook of laughter in the air  this harte told him was the line he liked best of all his lines and lowell smoked well content with the praise  yet they were not men to get on easily together lowell having limitations in directions where harte had none  afterward in london they did not meet often or willingly lowell owned the brilliancy and uncommonness of hartes gift while he sumptuously surfeited his passion of finding everybody more or less a jew by finding that harte was at least half a jew on his fathers side he had long contended for the hebraicism of his name  with all his appreciation of the literary eminences whom fields used to class together as the old saints harte had a spice of irreverence that enabled him to take them more ironically than they might have liked and to see the fun of a minor literary mans relation to them  emersons smoking amused him as a jovian selfindulgence divinely out of character with so supreme a god and he shamelessly burlesqued it telling how emerson at concord had proposed having a wet night with him over a glass of sherry and had urged the scant wine upon his young friend with a hospitable gesture of his cigar  but this was long after the cambridge episode in which longfellow alone escaped the corrosive touch of his subtle irreverence or more strictly speaking had only the effect of his reverence  that gentle and exquisitely modest dignity of longfellows he honored with as much veneration as it was in him to bestow and he had that sense of longfellows beautiful and perfected art which is almost a test of a critics own fineness     iii  as for hartes talk it was mostly ironical not to the extreme of satire but tempered to an agreeable coolness even for the things he admired  he did not apparently care to hear himself praised but he could very accurately and perfectly mark his discernment of excellence in others  he was at times a keen observer of nature and again not apparently  something was said before him and lowell of the beauty of his description of a rabbit startled with fear among the ferns and lifting its head with the pulsation of its frightened heart visibly shaking it then the talk turned on the graphic homeliness of dantes noticing how the dogs skin moves upon it and harte spoke of the exquisite shudder with which a horse tries to rid itself of a fly  but once again when an azalea was shown to him as the sort of bush that sandy drunkenly slept under in the idyl of iced gulch he asked why is that an azalea  to be sure this might have been less from his ignorance or indifference concerning the quality of the bush he had sent sandy to sleep under than from his willingness to make a mock of an azalea in a very small pot so disproportionate to uses which an azalea of californian size could easily lend itself to  you never could be sure of harte he could only by chance be caught in earnest about anything or anybody  except for those slight recognitions of literary traits in his talk with lowell nothing remained from his conversation but the general criticism he passed upon his brilliant fellowhebrew heine as rather scorbutic  he preferred to talk about the little matters of common incident and experience  he amused himself with such things as the mystification of the postman of whom he asked his way to phillips avenue where he adventurously supposed his host to be living  why the postman said there is no phillips avenue in cambridge  theres phillips place  well harte assented phillips place will do but there is a phillips avenue  he entered eagerly into the canvass of the distinctions and celebrities asked to meet him at the reception made for him but he had even a greater pleasure in compassionating his host for the vast disparity between the caterers china and plated ware and the simplicities and humilities of the home of virtuous poverty and he spluttered with delight at the sight of the lofty epergnes set up and down the suppertable when he was brought in to note the preparations made in his honor  those monumental structures were an inexhaustible joy to him he walked round and round the room and viewed them in different perspectives so as to get the full effect of the towering forms that dwarfed it so  he was a tease as many a sweet and fine wit is apt to be but his teasing was of the quality of a caress so much kindness went with it he lamented as an irreparable loss his having missed seeing that night an absentminded brother in literature who came in rubber shoes and forgetfully wore them throughout the evening  that hospitable soul of ralph keeler who had known him in california but had trembled for their acquaintance when he read of all the honors that might well have spoiled harte for the friends of his simpler days rejoiced in the unchanged cordiality of his nature when they met and presently gave him one of those restaurant lunches in boston which he was always sumptuously providing out of his destitution  harte was the life of a time which was perhaps less a feast of reason than a flow of soul  the truth is there was nothing but careless stories carelessly told and jokes and laughing and a great deal of mere laughing without the jokes the whole as unlike the ideal of a literary symposium as well might be but there was present one who met with that pleasant boston company for the first time and to whom harte attributed a superstition of boston seriousness not realized then and there  look at him he said from time to time  this is the dream of his life and then shouted and choked with fun at the difference between the occasion and the expectation he would have imagined in his commensals mind  at a dinner long after in london where several of the commensals of that time met again with other literary friends of a like age and stature harte laid his arms well along their shoulders as they formed in a halfcircle before him and screamed out in mocking mirth at the bulbous favor to which the slim shapes of the earlier date had come  the sight was not less a rapture to him that he was himself the prey of the same practical joke from the passing years  the hair which the years had wholly swept from some of those thoughtful brows or left spindling autumnal spears or few or none to shake against the cold had whitened to a wintry snow on his while his mustache had kept its youthful black  he looks one of his friends said to another as they walked home together like a french marquis of the ancien regime  yes the other assented thoughtfully or like an american actor made up for the part  the saying closely fitted the outward fact but was of a subtle injustice in its implication of anything histrionic in hartes nature  never was any man less a poseur he made simply and helplessly known what he was at any and every moment and he would join the witness very cheerfully in enjoying whatever was amusing in the disadvantage to himself  in the course of events which were in his case so very human it came about on a subsequent visit of his to boston that an impatient creditor decided to right himself out of the proceeds of the lecture which was to be given and had the law corporeally present at the house of the friend where harte dined and in the anteroom at the lecturehall and on the platform where the lecture was delivered with beautiful aplomb and untroubled charm  he was indeed the only one privy to the laws presence who was not the least affected by it so that when his host of an earlier time ventured to suggest well harte this is the old literary tradition this is the fleet business over again he joyously smote his thigh and crowed out yes the fleet  no doubt he tasted all the delicate humor of the situation and his pleasure in it was quite unaffected  if his temperament was not adapted to the harsh conditions of the elder american world it might very well be that his temperament was not altogether in the wrong  if it disabled him for certain experiences of life it was the source of what was most delightful in his personality and perhaps most beautiful in his talent  it enabled him to do such things as he did without being at all anguished for the things he did not do and indeed could not  his talent was not a facile gift he owned that he often went day after day to his desk and sat down before that yellow postoffice paper on which he liked to write his literature in that exquisitely refined script of his without being able to inscribe a line  it may be owned for him that though he came to the east at thirty four which ought to have been the very prime of his powers he seemed to have arrived after the age of observation was past for him  he saw nothing aright either in newport where he went to live or in new york where he sojourned or on those lecturing tours which took him about the whole country or if he saw it aright he could not report it aright or would not  after repeated and almost invariable failures to deal with the novel characters and circumstances which he encountered he left off trying and frankly went back to the semimythical california he had half discovered half created and wrote bret harte over and over as long as he lived  this whether he did it from instinct or from reason was the best thing he could do and it went as nearly as might be to satisfy the insatiable english fancy for the wild america no longer to be found on our map  it is imaginable of harte that this temperament defended him from any bitterness in the disappointment he may have shared with that simple american public which in the early eighteenseventies expected any and everything of him in fiction and drama  the long breath was not his he could not write a novel though he produced the like of one or two and his plays were too bad for the stage or else too good for it  at any rate they could not keep it even when they got it and they denoted the fatigue or the indifference of their author in being dramatizations of his longer or shorter fictions and not originally dramatic efforts the direction in which his originality lasted longest and most strikingly affirmed his power was in the direction of his verse  whatever minds there may be about hartes fiction finally there can hardly be more than one mind about his poetry  he was indeed a poet whether he wrote what drolly called itself dialect or wrote language he was a poet of a fine and fresh touch  it must be allowed him that in prose as well he had the inventive gift but he had it in verse far more importantly  there are lines phrases turns in his poems characterizations and pictures which will remain as enduringly as anything american if that is not saying altogether too little for them in poetry he rose to all the occasions he made for himself though he could not rise to the occasions made for him and so far failed in the demands he acceded to for a phi beta kappa poem as to come to that august harvard occasion with a jingle so trivial so out of keeping so inadequate that his enemies if he ever truly had any must have suffered from it almost as much as his friends  he himself did not suffer from his failure from having read before the most elect assembly of the country a poem which would hardly have served the careless needs of an informal dinner after the speaking had begun he took the whole disastrous business lightly gayly leniently kindly as that golden temperament of his enabled him to take all the good or bad of life  the first year of his eastern sojourn was salaried in a sum which took the souls of all his young contemporaries with wonder if no baser passion in the days when dollars were of so much farther flight than now but its net result in a literary return to his publishers was one story and two or three poems  they had not profited much by his book which it will doubtless amaze a time of fifty thousand editions selling before their publication to learn had sold only thirtyfive hundred in the sixth month of its career as harte himself            with sick and scornful looks averse  confided to his cambridge host after his first interview with the boston countingroom  it was the volume which contained the luck of roaring camp and the other early tales which made him a continental and then an all but a worldwide fame  stories that had been talked over and laughed over and cried over all up and down the land that had been received with acclaim by criticism almost as boisterous as their popularity and recognized as the promise of greater things than any done before in their kind came to no more than this pitiful figure over the booksellers counters  it argued much for the publishers that in spite of this stupefying result they were willing they were eager to pay him ten thousand dollars for whatever however much or little he chose to write in a year their offer was made in boston after some offers mortifyingly mean and others insultingly vague had been made in new york  it was not his fault that their venture proved of such slight return in literary material  harte was in the midst of new and alien conditions see a corollary in m froude who visited the us for a few months and then published a comprehensive analysis of the nation and its people twains rebuttal mr froudes progress would have been a propos for harte in cambridge  dwand he had always his temperament against him as well as the reluctant if not the niggard nature of his muse  he would no doubt have been only too glad to do more than he did for the money but actually if not literally he could not do more  when it came to literature all the gay improvidence of life forsook him and be became a stern rigorous exacting selfmaster who spared himself nothing to achieve the perfection at which he aimed  he was of the order of literary men like goldsmith and de quincey and sterne and steele in his relations with the outer world but in his relations with the inner world he was one of the most duteous and exemplary citizens  there was nothing of his easygoing hilarity in that world there he was of a puritanic severity and of a conscience that forgave him no pang  other california writers have testified to the fidelity with which he did his work as editor  he made himself not merely the arbiter but the inspiration of his contributors and in a region where literature had hardly yet replaced the wild sagebrush of frontier journalism he made the sandlots of san francisco to blossom as the rose and created a literary periodical of the first class on the borders of civilization  it is useless to wonder now what would have been his future if the publisher of the overland monthly had been of imagination or capital enough to meet the demand which harte dimly intimated to his cambridge host as the condition of his remaining in california  publishers men with sufficient capital are of a greatly varying gift in the regions of prophecy and he of the overland monthly was not to be blamed if he could not foresee his account in paying harte ten thousand a year to continue editing the magazine  he did according to his lights and harte came to the east and then went to england where his last twentyfive years were passed in cultivating the wild plant of his pacific slope discovery  it was always the same plant leaf and flower and fruit but it perennially pleased the constant english world and thence the european world though it presently failed of much delighting these fastidious states  probably he would have done something else if he could he did not keep on doing the wild miningcamp thing because it was the easiest but because it was for him the only possible thing  very likely he might have preferred not doing anything     iv  the joyous visit of a week which has been here so poorly recovered from the past came to an end and the host went with his guest to the station in as much vehicular magnificence as had marked his going to meet him there  harte was no longer the alarming portent of the earlier time but an experience of unalloyed delight  you must love a person whose worst troublegiving was made somehow a favor by his own unconsciousness of the trouble and it was a most flattering triumph to have got him in time or only a little late to so many luncheons and dinners  if only now he could be got to the train in time the victory would be complete the happiness of the visit without a flaw  success seemed to crown the fondest hope in this respect  the train had not yet left the station there stood the parlorcar which harte had seats in and he was followed aboard for those last words in which people try to linger out pleasures they have known together  in this case the sweetest of the pleasures had been sitting up late after those dinners and talking them over and then degenerating from that talk into the mere giggle and making giggle which charles lamb found the best thing in life  it had come to this as the host and guest sat together for those parting moments when harte suddenly started up in the discovery of having forgotten to get some cigars  they rushed out of the train together and after a wild descent upon the cigarcounter of the restaurant harte rushed back to his car but by this time the train was already moving with that deceitful slowness of the departing train and harte had to clamber up the steps of the rearmost platform  his host clambered after to make sure that he was aboard which done he dropped to the ground while harte drew out of the station blandly smiling and waving his hand with a cigar in it in picturesque farewell from the platform  then his host realized that he had dropped to the ground barely in time to escape being crushed against the side of the archway that sharply descended beside the steps of the train and he went and sat down in that handsomest hack and was for a moment deathly sick at the danger that had not realized itself to him in season  to be sure he was able long after to adapt the incident to the exigencies of fiction and to have a character not otherwise to be conveniently disposed of actually crushed to death between a moving train and such an archway  besides he had then and always afterward the immense supercompensation of the memories of that visit from one of the most charming personalities in the world            in lifes morning march when his bosom was young  and when infinitely less would have sated him  now death has come to join its vague conjectures to the broken expectations of life and that blithe spirit is elsewhere  but nothing can take from him who remains the witchery of that most winning presence  still it looks smiling from the platform of the car and casts a farewell of mock heartbreak from it still a gay laugh comes across the abysm of the years that are now numbered and out of somewhere the hearers sense is rapt with the mellow cordial of a voice that was like no other  this last paragraph reminds one again that as with holmes a great poet writes the best prose  dw     etext editors bookmarks  always sumptuously providing out of his destitution could only by chance be caught in earnest about anything couldnt fire your revolver without bringing down a two volumer deaths vague conjectures to the broken expectations of life dollars were of so much farther flight than now enjoying whatever was amusing in the disadvantage to himself express the appreciation of anothers fit word gay laugh comes across the abysm of the years giggle which charles lamb found the best thing in life his enemies suffered from it almost as much as his friends his plays were too bad for the stage or else too good for it insatiable english fancy for the wild america no longer there long breath was not his he could not write a novel mellow cordial of a voice that was like no other not much of a talker and almost nothing of a storyteller now death has come to join its vague conjectures offers mortifyingly mean and others insultingly vague only one concerned who was quite unconcerned so refined after the gigantic coarseness of california wrote them first and last in the spirit of dickens     end of this project gutenberg etext of a belated guest by william dean howells       literary friends and acquaintancesmy mark twain  by william dean howells   my mark twain     i  it was in the little office of james t fields over the bookstore of ticknor  fields at 124 tremont street boston that i first met my friend of now fortyfour years samuel l clemens  mr fields was then the editor of the atlantic monthly and i was his proud and glad assistant with a pretty free hand as to manuscripts and an unmanacled command of the booknotices at the end of the magazine  i wrote nearly all of them myself and in 1869 i had written rather a long notice of a book just winning its way to universal favor  in this review i had intimated my reservations concerning the innocents abroad but i had the luck if not the sense to recognize that it was such fun as we had not had before  i forget just what i said in praise of it and it does not matter it is enough that i praised it enough to satisfy the author he now signified as much and he stamped his gratitude into my memory with a story wonderfully allegorizing the situation which the mock modesty of print forbids my repeating here  throughout my long acquaintance with him his graphic touch was always allowing itself a freedom which i cannot bring my fainter pencil to illustrate  he had the southwestern the lincolnian the elizabethan breadth of parlance which i suppose one ought not to call coarse without calling ones self prudish and i was often hiding away in discreet holes and corners the letters in which he had loosed his bold fancy to stoop on rank suggestion i could not bear to burn them and i could not after the first reading quite bear to look at them  i shall best give my feeling on this point by saying that in it he was shakespearian or if his ghost will not suffer me the word then he was baconian  at the time of our first meeting which must have been well toward the winter clemens as i must call him instead of mark twain which seemed always somehow to mask him from my personal sense was wearing a sealskin coat with the fur out in the satisfaction of a caprice or the love of strong effect which he was apt to indulge through life  i do not know what droll comment was in fieldss mind with respect to this garment but probably he felt that here was an original who was not to be brought to any bostonian book in the judgment of his vivid qualities  with his crest of dense red hair and the wide sweep of his flaming mustache clemens was not discordantly clothed in that sealskin coat which afterward in spite of his own warmth in it sent the cold chills through me when i once accompanied it down broadway and shared the immense publicity it won him  he had always a relish for personal effect which expressed itself in the white suit of complete serge which he wore in his last years and in the oxford gown which he put on for every possible occasion and said he would like to wear all the time  that was not vanity in him but a keen feeling for costume which the severity of our modern tailoring forbids men though it flatters women to every excess in it yet he also enjoyed the shock the offence the pang which it gave the sensibilities of others  then there were times he played these pranks for pure fun and for the pleasure of the witness  once i remember seeing him come into his drawingroom at hartford in a pair of white cowskin slippers with the hair out and do a crippled colored uncle to the joy of all beholders  or i must not say all for i remember also the dismay of mrs clemens and her low despairing cry of oh youth  that was her name for him among their friends and it fitted him as no other would though i fancied with her it was a shrinking from his baptismal samuel or the vernacular sam of his earlier companionships  he was a youth to the end of his days the heart of a boy with the head of a sage the heart of a good boy or a bad boy but always a wilful boy and wilfulest to show himself out at every time for just the boy he was     ii  there is a gap in my recollections of clemens which i think is of a year or two for the next thing i remember of him is meeting him at a lunch in boston given us by that genius of hospitality the tragically destined ralph keeler author of one of the most unjustly forgotten books vagabond adventures a true bit of picaresque autobiography  keeler never had any money to the general knowledge and he never borrowed and he could not have had credit at the restaurant where he invited us to feast at his expense  there was t b aldrich there was j t fields much the oldest of our company who had just freed himself from the trammels of the publishing business and was feeling his freedom in every word there was bret harte who had lately come east in his princely progress from california and there was clemens  nothing remains to me of the happy time but a sense of idle and aimless and joyful talkplay beginning and ending nowhere of eager laughter of countless good stories from fields of a heatlightning shimmer of wit from aldrich of an occasional concentration of our joint mockeries upon our host who took it gladly and amid the discourse so little improving but so full of good fellowship bret hartes fleeting dramatization of clemenss mental attitude toward a symposium of boston illuminates  why fellows he spluttered this is the dream of marks life and i remember the glance from under clemenss feathery eyebrows which betrayed his enjoyment of the fun  we had beefsteak with mushrooms which in recognition of their shape aldrich hailed as shoepegs and to crown the feast we had an omelette souse which the waiter brought in as flat as a pancake amid our shouts of congratulations to poor keeler who took them with appreciative submission  it was in every way what a boston literary lunch ought not to have been in the popular ideal which harte attributed to clemens  our next meeting was at hartford or rather at springfield where clemens greeted us on the way to hartford  aldrich was going on to be his guest and i was going to be charles dudley warners but clemens had come part way to welcome us both  in the good fellowship of that cordial neighborhood we had two such days as the aging sun no longer shines on in his round  there was constant running in and out of friendly houses where the lively hosts and guests called one another by their christian names or nicknames and no such vain ceremony as knocking or ringing at doors  clemens was then building the stately mansion in which he satisfied his love of magnificence as if it had been another sealskin coat and he was at the crest of the prosperity which enabled him to humor every whim or extravagance  the house was the design of that most original artist edward potter who once when hard pressed by incompetent curiosity for the name of his style in a certain church proposed that it should be called the english violet order of architecture and this house was so absolutely suited to the owners humor that i suppose there never was another house like it but its character must be for recognition farther along in these reminiscences the vividest impression which clemens gave us two ravenous young boston authors was of the satisfying the surfeiting nature of subscription publication  an army of agents was overrunning the country with the prospectuses of his books and delivering them by the scores of thousands in completed sale  of the innocents abroad he said it sells right along just like the bible and roughing it was swiftly following without perhaps ever quite overtaking it in popularity  but he lectured aldrich and me on the folly of that mode of publication in the trade which we had thought it the highest success to achieve a chance in anything but subscription publication is printing for private circulation he maintained and he so won upon our greed and hope that on the way back to boston we planned the joint authorship of a volume adapted to subscription publication  we got a very good name for it as we believed in memorable murders and we never got farther with it but by the time we reached boston we were rolling in wealth so deep that we could hardly walk home in the frugal fashion by which we still thought it best to spare car fare carriage fare we did not dream of even in that opulence     iii  the visits to hartford which had begun with this affluence continued without actual increase of riches for me but now i went alone and in warners european and egyptian absences i formed the habit of going to clemens  by this time he was in his new house where he used to give me a royal chamber on the ground floor and come in at night after i had gone to bed to take off the burglar alarm so that the family should not be roused if anybody tried to get in at my window  this would be after we had sat up late he smoking the last of his innumerable cigars and soothing his tense nerves with a mild hot scotch while we both talked and talked and talked of everything in the heavens and on the earth and the waters under the earth  after two days of this talk i would come away hollow realizing myself best in the image of one of those locust shells which you find sticking to the bark of trees at the end of summer once after some such bout of brains we went down to new york together and sat facing each other in the pullman smoker without passing a syllable till we had occasion to say well were there  then with our installation in a now vanished hotel the old brunswick to be specific the talk began again with the inspiration of the novel environment and went on and on  we wished to be asleep but we could not stop and he lounged through the rooms in the long nightgown which he always wore in preference to the pajamas which he despised and told the story of his life the inexhaustible the fairy the arabian nights story which i could never tire of even when it began to be told over again  or at times he would reason high                of providence foreknowledge will and fate                fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute  walking up and down and halting now and then with a fine toss and slant of his shaggy head as some bold thought or splendid joke struck him  he was in those days a constant attendant at the church of his great friend the rev joseph h twichell and at least tacitly far from the entire negation he came to at last  i should say he had hardly yet examined the grounds of his passive acceptance of his wifes belief for it was hers and not his and he held it unscanned in the beautiful and tender loyalty to her which was the most moving quality of his most faithful soul  i make bold to speak of the love between them because without it i could not make him known to others as he was known to me it was a greater part of him than the love of most men for their wives and she merited all the worship he could give her all the devotion all the implicit obedience by her surpassing force and beauty of character she was in a way the loveliest person i have ever seen the gentlest the kindest without a touch of weakness she united wonderful tact with wonderful truth and clemens not only accepted her rule implicitly but he rejoiced he gloried in it  i am not sure that he noticed all her goodness in the actions that made it a heavenly vision to others he so had the habit of her goodness but if there was any forlorn and helpless creature in the room mrs clemens was somehow promptly at his side or hers she was always seeking occasion of kindness to those in her household or out of it she loved to let her heart go beyond the reach of her hand and imagined the whole hard and suffering world with compassion for its structural as well as incidental wrongs  i suppose she had her ladyhood limitations her female fears of etiquette and convention but she did not let them hamper the wild and splendid generosity with which clemens rebelled against the social stupidities and cruelties  she had been a lifelong invalid when he met her and he liked to tell the beautiful story of their courtship to each new friend whom he found capable of feeling its beauty or worthy of hearing it  naturally her father had hesitated to give her into the keeping of the young strange westerner who had risen up out of the unknown with his giant reputation of burlesque humorist and demanded guaranties demanded proofs  he asked me clemens would say if i couldnt give him the names of people who knew me in california and when it was time to hear from them i heard from him  well mr clemens he said nobody seems to have a very good word for you  i hadnt referred him to people that i thought were going to whitewash me  i thought it was all up with me but i was disappointed  so i guess i shall have to back you myself  whether this made him faithfuler to the trust put in him i cannot say but probably not it was always in him to be faithful to any trust and in proportion as a trust of his own was betrayed he was ruthlessly and implacably resentful  but i wish now to speak of the happiness of that household in hartford which responded so perfectly to the ideals of the mother when the three daughters so lovely and so gifted were yet little children  there had been a boy and yes i killed him clemens once said with the unsparing selfblame in which he would wreak an unavailing regret  he meant that he had taken the child out imprudently and the child had taken the cold which he died of but it was by no means certain this was through its fathers imprudence  i never heard him speak of his son except that once but no doubt in his deep heart his loss was irreparably present  he was a very tender father and delighted in the minds of his children but he was wise enough to leave their training altogether to the wisdom of their mother  he left them to that in everything keeping for himself the pleasure of teaching them little scenes of drama learning languages with them and leading them in singing  they came to the table with their parents and could have set him an example in behavior when in moments of intense excitement he used to leave his place and walk up and down the room flying his napkin and talking and talking  it was after his first english sojourn that i used to visit him and he was then full of praise of everything english the english personal independence and public spirit and hospitality and truth  he liked to tell stories in proof of their virtues but he was not blind to the defects of their virtues their submissive acceptance of caste their callousness with strangers their bluntness with one another  mrs clemens had been in a way to suffer socially more than he and she praised the english less  she had sat after dinner with ladies who snubbed and ignored one another and left her to find her own amusement in the absence of the attention with which americans perhaps cloy their guests but which she could not help preferring  in their successive sojourns among them i believe he came to like the english less and she more the fine delight of his first acceptance among them did not renew itself till his oxford degree was given him then it made his cup run over and he was glad the whole world should see it  his wife would not chill the ardor of his early anglomania and in this as in everything she wished to humor him to the utmost  no one could have realized more than she his essential fineness his innate nobleness marriages are what the parties to them alone really know them to be but from the outside i should say that this marriage was one of the most perfect  it lasted in his absolute devotion to the day of her death that delayed long in cruel suffering and that left one side of him in lasting night  from florence there came to me heartbreaking letters from him about the torture she was undergoing and at last a letter saying she was dead with the simplehearted cry i wish i was with livy  i do not know why i have left saying till now that she was a very beautiful woman classically regular in features with black hair smooth over her forehead and with tenderly peering myopia eyes always behind glasses and a smile of angelic kindness  but this kindness went with a sense of humor which qualified her to appreciate the selflawed genius of a man who will be remembered with the great humorists of all time with cervantes with swift or with any others worthy his company none of them was his equal in humanity     iv  clemens had appointed himself with the architects connivance a luxurious study over the library in his new house but as his children grew older this study with its carved and cushioned armchairs was given over to them for a schoolroom and he took the room above his stable which had been intended for his coachman  there we used to talk together when we were not walking and talking together until he discovered that he could make a more commodious use of the billiardroom at the top of his house for the purposes of literature and friendship it was pretty cold up there in the early spring and late fall weather with which i chiefly associate the place but by lighting up all the gas burners and kindling a reluctant fire on the hearth we could keep it well above freezing  clemens could also push the balls about and without rivalry from me who could no more play billiards than smoke could win endless games of pool while he carried points of argument against imaginable differers in opinion  here he wrote many of his tales and sketches and for anything i know some of his books  i particularly remember his reading me here his first rough sketch of captain stormfields visit to heaven with the real name of the captain whom i knew already from his many stories about him  we had a peculiar pleasure in looking off from the high windows on the pretty hartford landscape and down from them into the tops of the trees clothing the hillside by which his house stood  we agreed that there was a novel charm in trees seen from such a vantage far surpassing that of the farther scenery  he had not been a country boy for nothing rather he had been a country boy or still better a village boy for everything that nature can offer the young of our species and no aspect of her was lost on him  we were natives of the same vast mississippi valley and missouri was not so far from ohio but that we were akin in our first knowledges of woods and fields as we were in our early parlance  i had outgrown the use of mine through my greater bookishness but i gladly recognized the phrases which he employed for their lasting juiciness and the longremembered savor they had on his mental palate  i have elsewhere sufficiently spoken of his unsophisticated use of words of the diction which forms the backbone of his manly style  if i mention my own greater bookishness by which i mean his less quantitative reading it is to give myself better occasion to note that he was always reading some vital book  it might be some outoftheway book but it had the root of the human matter in it a volume of great trials one of the supreme autobiographies a signal passage of history a narrative of travel a story of captivity which gave him life at firsthand  as i remember he did not care much for fiction and in that sort he had certain distinct loathings there were certain authors whose names he seemed not so much to pronounce as to spew out of his mouth  goldsmith was one of these but his prime abhorrence was my dear and honored prime favorite jane austen  he once said to me i suppose after he had been reading some of my unsparing praises of heri am always praising her you seem to think that woman could write and he forbore withering me with his scorn apparently because we had been friends so long and he more pitied than hated me for my bad taste  he seemed not to have any preferences among novelists or at least i never heard him express any he used to read the modern novels i praised in or out of print but i do not think he much liked reading fiction  as for plays he detested the theatre and said he would as lief do a sum as follow a plot on the stage  he could not or did not give any reasons for his literary abhorrences and perhaps he really had none  but he could have said very distinctly if he had needed why he liked the books he did  i was away at the time of his great browning passion and i know of it chiefly from hearsay but at the time tolstoy was doing what could be done to make me over clemens wrote that man seems to have been to you what browning was to me  i do not know that he had other favorites among the poets but he had favorite poems which he liked to read to you and he read of course splendidly  i have forgotten what piece of john hays it was that he liked so much but i remembered how he fiercely revelled in the vengefulness of william morriss sir guy of the dolorous blast and how he especially exalted in the lines which tell of the supposed speakers joy in slaying the murderer of his brother                i am threescore years and ten                and my hair is nigh turned gray                but i am glad to think of the moment when                i took his life away  generally i fancy his pleasure in poetry was not great and i do not believe he cared much for the conventionally accepted masterpieces of literature  he liked to find out good things and great things for himself sometimes he would discover these in a masterpiece new to him alone and then if you brought his ignorance home to him he enjoyed it and enjoyed it the more the more you rubbed it in  of all the literary men i have known he was the most unliterary in his make and manner  i do not know whether he had any acquaintance with latin but i believe not the least german he knew pretty well and italian enough late in life to have fun with it but he used english in all its alien derivations as if it were native to his own air as if it had come up out of american out of missourian ground  his style was what we know for good and for bad but his manner if i may difference the two was as entirely his own as if no one had ever written before i have noted before this how he was not enslaved to the consecutiveness in writing which the rest of us try to keep chained to  that is he wrote as he thought and as all men think without sequence without an eye to what went before or should come after  if something beyond or beside what he was saying occurred to him he invited it into his page and made it as much at home there as the nature of it would suffer him then when he was through with the welcoming of this casual and unexpected guest he would go back to the company he was entertaining and keep on with what he had been talking about  he observed this manner in the construction of his sentences and the arrangement of his chapters and the ordering or disordering of his compilationsnowhere is this characteristic better found than in twains autobiography it was not a style it was unselfconscious thought  dwi helped him with a library of humor which he once edited and when i had done my work according to tradition with authors times and topics carefully studied in due sequence he tore it all apart and chucked the pieces in wherever the fancy for them took him at the moment  he was right we were not making a textbook but a book for the pleasure rather than the instruction of the reader and he did not see why the principle on which he built his travels and reminiscences and tales and novels should not apply to it and i do not now see either though at the time it confounded me  on minor points he was beyond any author i have known without favorite phrases or pet words  he utterly despised the avoidance of repetitions out of fear of tautology  if a word served his turn better than a substitute he would use it as many times in a page as he chose     v  at that time i had become editor of the atlantic monthly and i had allegiances belonging to the conduct of what was and still remains the most scrupulously cultivated of our periodicals  when clemens began to write for it he came willingly under its rules for with all his wilfulness there never was a more biddable man in things you could show him a reason for  he never made the least of that trouble which so abounds for the hapless editor from narrowerminded contributors  if you wanted a thing changed very good he changed it if you suggested that a word or a sentence or a paragraph had better be struck out very good he struck it out  his proofsheets came back each a veritable mush of concession as emerson says  now and then he would try a little stronger language than the atlantic had stomach for and once when i sent him a proof i made him observe that i had left out the profanity he wrote back mrs clemens opened that proof and lit into the room with danger in her eye  what profanity  you see when i read the manuscript to her i skipped that  it was part of his joke to pretend a violence in that gentlest creature which the more amusingly realized the situation to their friends  i was always very glad of him and proud of him as a contributor but i must not claim the whole merit or the first merit of having him write for us  it was the publisher the late h o houghton who felt the incongruity of his absence from the leading periodical of the country and was always urging me to get him to write  i will take the credit of being eager for him but it is to the publishers credit that he tried so far as the modest traditions of the atlantic would permit to meet the expectations in pay which the colossal profits of clemenss books might naturally have bred in him  whether he was really able to do this he never knew from clemens himself but probably twenty dollars a page did not surfeit the author of books that sold right along just like the bible  we had several short contributions from clemens first all of capital quality and then we had the series of papers which went mainly to the making of his great book life on the mississippi  upon the whole i have the notion that clemens thought this his greatest book and he was supported in his opinion by that of the portier in his hotel at vienna and that of the german emperor who as he told me with equal respect for the preference of each united in thinking it his best with such far sundered social poles approaching in its favor he apparently found himself without standing for opposition  at any rate the papers won instant appreciation from his editor and publisher and from the readers of their periodical which they expected to prosper beyond precedent in its circulation  but those were days of simpler acceptance of the popular rights of newspapers than these are when magazines strictly guard their vested interests against them  the new york times and the st louis democrat profited by the advance copies of the magazine sent them to reprint the papers month by month  together they covered nearly the whole reading territory of the union and the terms of their daily publication enabled them to anticipate the magazine in its own restricted field  its subscription list was not enlarged in the slightest measure and the atlantic monthly languished on the newsstands as undesired as ever     vi  it was among my later visits to hartford that we began to talk up the notion of collaborating a play but we did not arrive at any clear intention and it was a telegram out of the clear sky that one day summoned me from boston to help with a continuation of colonel sellers i had been a witness of the high joy of clemens in the prodigious triumph of the first colonel sellers which had been dramatized from the novel of the gilded age  this was the joint work of clemens and charles dudley warner and the story had been put upon the stage by some one in utah whom clemens first brought to book in the courts for violation of his copyright and then indemnified for such rights as his adaptation of the book had given him  the structure of the play as john t raymond gave it was substantially the work of this unknown dramatist  clemens never pretended to me at any rate that he had the least hand in it he frankly owned that he was incapable of dramatization yet the vital part was his for the characters in the play were his as the book embodied them and the success which it won with the public was justly his this he shared equally with the actor following the company with an agent who counted out the authors share of the gate money and sent him a note of the amount every day by postal card  the postals used to come about dinnertime and clemens would read them aloud to us in wild triumph  one hundred and fifty dollarstwo hundred dollarsthree hundred dollars were the gay figures which they bore and which he flaunted in the air before he sat down at table or rose from it to brandish and then flinging his napkin into his chair walked up and down to exult in  byandby the popularity of the play waned and the time came when he sickened of the whole affair and withdrew his agent and took whatever gain from it the actor apportioned him  he was apt to have these sudden surceases following upon the intensities of his earlier interest though he seemed always to have the notion of making something more of colonel sellers  but when i arrived in hartford in answer to his summons i found him with no definite idea of what he wanted to do with him i represented that we must have some sort of plan and he agreed that we should both jot down a scenario overnight and compare our respective schemes the next morning  as the author of a large number of little plays which have been privately presented throughout the united states and in parts of the united kingdom without ever getting upon the public stage except for the noble ends of charity and then promptly getting off it i felt authorized to make him observe that his scheme was as nearly nothing as chaos could be  he agreed hilariously with me and was willing to let it stand in proof of his entire dramatic inability at the same time he liked my plot very much which ultimated sellers according to clemenss intention as a man crazed by his own inventions and by his superstition that he was the rightful heir to an english earldom  the exuberant nature of sellers and the vast range of his imagination served our purpose in other ways  clemens made him a spiritualist whose specialty in the occult was materialization he became on impulse an ardent temperance reformer and he headed a procession of temperance ladies after disinterestedly testing the deleterious effects of liquor upon himself until he could not walk straight always he wore a marvellous fireextinguisher strapped on his back to give proof in any emergency of the effectiveness of his invention in that way  we had a jubilant fortnight in working the particulars of these things out  it was not possible for clemens to write like anybody else but i could very easily write like clemens and we took the play scene and scene about quite secure of coming out in temperamental agreement the characters remained for the most part his and i varied them only to make them more like his than if possible he could  several years after when i looked over a copy of the play i could not always tell my work from his i only knew that i had done certain scenes  we would work all day long at our several tasks and then at night before dinner read them over to each other  no dramatists ever got greater joy out of their creations and when i reflect that the public never had the chance of sharing our joy i pity the public from a full heart  i still believe that the play was immensely funny i still believe that if it could once have got behind the footlights it would have continued to pack the house before them for an indefinite succession of nights  but this may be my fondness  at any rate it was not to be  raymond had identified himself with sellers in the playgoing imagination and whether consciously or unconsciously we constantly worked with raymond in our minds  but before this time bitter displeasures had risen between clemens and raymond and clemens was determined that raymond should never have the play  he first offered it to several other actors who eagerly caught it only to give it back with the despairing renunciation that is a raymond play  we tried managers with it but their only question was whether they could get raymond to do it  in the mean time raymond had provided himself with a play for the wintera very good play by demarest lloyd and he was in no hurry for ours  perhaps he did not really care for it perhaps he knew when he heard of it that it must come to him in the end  in the end it did from my hand for clemens would not meet him  i found him in a mood of sweet reasonableness perhaps the more softened by one of those lunches which our publisher the hospitable james r osgood was always bringing people together over in boston  he said that he could not do the play that winter but he was sure that he should like it and he had no doubt he would do it the next winter  so i gave him the manuscript in spite of clemenss charges for his suspicions and rancors were such that he would not have had me leave it for a moment in the actors hands but it seemed a conclusion that involved success and fortune for us in due time but i do not remember how long after raymond declared himself delighted with the piece he entered into a satisfactory agreement for it and at the beginning of the next season he started with it to buffalo where he was to give a first production  at rochester he paused long enough to return it with the explanation that a friend had noted to him the fact that colonel sellers in the play was a lunatic and insanity was so serious a thing that it could not be represented on the stage without outraging the sensibilities of the audience or words to that effect  we were too far off to allege hamlet to the contrary or king lear or to instance the delight which generations of readers throughout the world had taken in the mad freaks of don quixote whatever were the real reasons of raymond for rejecting the play we had to be content with those he gave and to set about getting it into other hands  in this effort we failed even more signally than before if that were possible  at last a clever and charming elocutionist who had long wished to get himself on the stage heard of it and asked to see it we would have shown it to any one by this time and we very willingly showed it to him  he came to hartford and did some scenes from it for us  i must say he did them very well quite as well as raymond could have done them in whose manner he did them  but now late toward spring the question was where he could get an engagement with the play and we ended by hiring a theatre in new york for a week of trial performances  clemens came on with me to boston where we were going to make some changes in the piece and where we made them to our satisfaction but not to the effect of that high rapture which we had in the first draft he went back to hartford and then the cold fit came upon me and in visions of the night in slumberings upon the bed ghastly forms of failure appalled me and when i rose in the morning i wrote him here is a play which every manager has put outofdoors and which every actor known to us has refused and now we go and give it to an elocutioner we are fools  whether clemens agreed with me or not in my conclusion he agreed with me in my premises and we promptly bought our play off the stage at a cost of seven hundred dollars which we shared between us but clemens was never a man to give up  i relinquished gratis all right and title i had in the play and he paid its entire expenses for a week of onenight stands in the country  it never came to new york and yet i think now that if it had come it would have succeeded  so hard does the faith of the unsuccessful dramatist in his work die     vii  there is an incident of this time so characteristic of both men that i will yield to the temptation of giving it here  after i had gone to hartford in response to clemenss telegram matthew arnold arrived in boston and one of my family called on his to explain why i was not at home to receive his introduction i had gone to see mark twain  oh but he doesnt like that sort of thing does he  he likes mr clemens very much my representative answered and he thinks him one of the greatest men he ever knew  i was still clemenss guest at hartford when arnold came there to lecture and one night we went to meet him at a reception while his hand laxly held mine in greeting i saw his eyes fixed intensely on the other side of the room  whowho in the world is that i looked and said oh that is mark twain  i do not remember just how their instant encounter was contrived by arnolds wish but i have the impression that they were not parted for long during the evening and the next night arnold as if still under the glamour of that potent presence was at clemenss house  i cannot say how they got on or what they made of each other if clemens ever spoke of arnold i do not recall what he said but arnold had shown a sense of him from which the incredulous sniff of the polite world now so universally exploded had already perished  it might well have done so with his first dramatic vision of that prodigious head  clemens was then hard upon fifty and he had kept as he did to the end the slender figure of his youth but the ashes of the burntout years were beginning to gray the fires of that splendid shock of red hair which he held to the height of a stature apparently greater than it was and tilted from side to side in his undulating walk he glimmered at you from the narrow slits of fine bluegreenish eyes under branching brows which with age grew more and more like a sort of plumage and he was apt to smile into your face with a subtle but amiable perception and yet with a sort of remote absence you were all there for him but he was not all there for you     viii  i shall not try to give chronological order to my recollections of him but since i am just now with him in hartford i will speak of him in association with the place  once when i came on from cambridge he followed me to my room to see that the water was not frozen in my bath or something of the kind for it was very cold weather and then hospitably lingered  not to lose time in banalities i began at once from the thread of thought in my mind  i wonder why we hate the past so and he responded from the depths of his own consciousness its so damned humiliating which is what any man would say of his past if he were honest but honest men are few when it comes to themselves  clemens was one of the few and the first of them among all the people i have known  i have known i suppose men as truthful but not so promptly so absolutely so positively so almost aggressively truthful  he could lie of course and did to save others from grief or harm he was not stupidly truthful but his first impulse was to say out the thing and everything that was in him  to those who can understand it will not be contradictory of his sense of humiliation from the past that he was not ashamed for anything he ever did to the point of wishing to hide it  he could be and he was bitterly sorry for his errors which he had enough of in his life but he was not ashamed in that mean way  what he had done he owned to good bad or indifferent and if it was bad he was rather amused than troubled as to the effect in your mind  he would not obtrude the fact upon you but if it were in the way of personal history he would not dream of withholding it far less of hiding it  he was the readiest of men to allow an error if he were found in it  in one of our walks about hartford when he was in the first fine flush of his agnosticism be declared that christianity had done nothing to improve morals and conditions and that the world under the highest pagan civilization was as well off as it was under the highest christian influences  i happened to be fresh from the reading of charles loring braces gesta christi or history of humane progress and i could offer him abundant proofs that he was wrong  he did not like that evidently but he instantly gave way saying be had not known those things  later be was more tolerant in his denials of christianity but just then he was feeling his freedom from it and rejoicing in having broken what he felt to have been the shackles of belief worn so long he greatly admired robert ingersoll whom he called an angelic orator and regarded as an evangel of a new gospelthe gospel of free thought he took the warmest interest in the newspaper controversy raging at the time as to the existence of a hell when the noes carried the day i suppose that no enemy of perdition was more pleased  he still loved his old friend and pastor mr twichell but he no longer went to hear him preach his sage and beautiful sermons and was i think thereby the greater loser  long before that i had asked him if he went regularly to church and he groaned out oh yes i go  it most kills me but i go and i did not need his telling me to understand that he went because his wife wished it  he did tell me after they both ceased to go that it had finally come to her saying well if you are to be lost i want to be lost with you  he could accept that willingness for supreme sacrifice and exult in it because of the supreme truth as he saw it after they had both ceased to be formal christians she was still grieved by his denial of immortality so grieved that he resolved upon one of those heroic lies which for loves sake he held above even the truth and he went to her saying that he had been thinking the whole matter over and now he was convinced that the soul did live after death  it was too late  her keen vision pierced through his ruse as it did when he brought the doctor who had diagnosticated her case as organic disease of the heart and after making him go over the facts of it again with her made him declare it merely functional  to make an end of these records as to clemenss beliefs so far as i knew them i should say that he never went back to anything like faith in the christian theology or in the notion of life after death or in a conscious divinity  it is best to be honest in this matter he would have hated anything else and i do not believe that the truth in it can hurt any one  at one period he argued that there must have been a cause a conscious source of things that the universe could not have come by chance  i have heard also that in his last hours or moments he said or his dearest ones hoped he had said something about meeting again  but the expression of which they could not be certain was of the vaguest and it was perhaps addressed to their tenderness out of his tenderness all his expressions to me were of a courageous renunciation of any hope of living again or elsewhere seeing those he had lost  he suffered terribly in their loss and he was not fool enough to try ignoring his grief  he knew that for this there were but two medicines that it would wear itself out with the years and that meanwhile there was nothing for it but those respites in which the mourner forgets himself in slumber i remember that in a black hour of my own when i was called down to see him as he thought from sleep he said with an infinite an exquisite compassion oh did i wake you did i wake you  nothing more but the look the voice were everything and while i live they cannot pass from my sense     ix  he was the most caressing of men in his pity but he had the fine instinct which would have pleased lowell of never putting his hands on youfine delicate hands with taper fingers and pink nails like a girls and sensitively quivering in moments of emotion he did not paw you with them to show his affection as so many of us americans are apt to do  among the halfdozen or halfhundred personalities that each of us becomes i should say that clemenss central and final personality was something exquisite  his casual acquaintance might know him perhaps from his fierce intensity his wild pleasure in shocking people with his ribaldries and profanities or from the mere need of loosing his rebellious spirit in that way as anything but exquisite and yet that was what in the last analysis he was  they might come away loathing or hating him but one could not know him well without realizing him the most serious the most humane the most conscientious of men  he was southwestern and born amid the oppression of a race that had no rights as against ours but i never saw a man more regardful of negroes  he had a yellow butler when i first began to know him because he said he could not bear to order a white man about but the terms of his ordering george were those of the softest entreaty which command ever wore  he loved to rely upon george who was such a broken reed in some things though so stanch in others and the fervent republican in politics that clemens then liked him to be  he could interpret clemenss meaning to the public without conveying his mood and could render his roughest answer smooth to the person denied his presence  his general instructions were that this presence was to be denied all but personal friends but the soft heart of george was sometimes touched by importunity and once he came up into the billiardroom saying that mr smith wished to see clemens  upon inquiry mr smith developed no ties of friendship and clemens said you go and tell mr smith that i wouldnt come down to see the twelve apostles  george turned from the threshold where he had kept himself and framed a paraphrase of this message which apparently sent mr smith away content with himself and all the rest of the world  the part of him that was western in his southwestern origin clemens kept to the end but he was the most desouthernized southerner i ever knew no man more perfectly sensed and more entirely abhorred slavery and no one has ever poured such scorn upon the secondhand walterscotticized pseudochivalry of the southern ideal  he held himself responsible for the wrong which the white race had done the black race in slavery and he explained in paying the way of a negro student through yale that he was doing it as his part of the reparation due from every white to every black man  he said he had never seen this student nor ever wished to see him or know his name it was quite enough that he was a negro  about that time a colored cadet was expelled from west point for some point of conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman and there was the usual shabby philosophy in a portion of the press to the effect that a negro could never feel the claim of honor  the man was fifteen parts white but oh yes clemens said with bitter irony it was that one part black that undid him  it made him a nigger and incapable of being a gentleman  it was to blame for the whole thing  the fifteen parts white were guiltless  clemens was entirely satisfied with the result of the civil war and he was eager to have its facts and meanings brought out at once in history he ridiculed the notion held by many that it was not yet time to philosophize the events of the great struggle that we must wait till its passions had cooled and the clouds of strife had cleared away he maintained that the time would never come when we should see its motives and men and deeds more clearly and that now now was the hour to ascertain them in lasting verity  picturesquely and dramatically he portrayed the imbecility of deferring the inquiry at any point to the distance of future years when inevitably the facts would begin to put on fable  he had powers of sarcasm and a relentless rancor in his contempt which those who knew him best appreciated most  the late noah brooks who had been in california at the beginning of clemenss career and had witnessed the effect of his ridicule before he had learned to temper it once said to me that he would rather have any one else in the world down on him than mark twain  but as clemens grew older he grew more merciful not to the wrong but to the men who were in it  the wrong was often the source of his wildest drolling  he considered it in such hopelessness of ever doing it justice that his despair broke in laughter     x  i go back to that house in hartford where i was so often a happy guest with tenderness for each of its endearing aspects  over the chimney in the library which had been cured of smoking by so much art and science clemens had written in perennial brass the words of emerson the ornament of a house is the friends who frequent it and he gave his guests a welcome of the simplest and sweetest cordiality but i must not go aside to them from my recollections of him which will be of sufficient garrulity if i give them as fully as i wish  the windows of the library looked northward from the hillside above which the house stood and over the little valley with the stream in it and they showed the leaves of the trees that almost brushed them as in a claude lorraine glass  to the eastward the diningroom opened amply and to the south there was a wide hall where the voices of friends made themselves heard as they entered without ceremony and answered his joyous hail  at the west was a little semicircular conservatory of a pattern invented by mrs harriet beecher stowe and adopted in most of the houses of her kindly neighborhood  the plants were set in the ground and the flowering vines climbed up the sides and overhung the roof above the silent spray of a fountain companied by callas and other waterloving lilies  there while we breakfasted patrick came in from the barn and sprinkled the pretty bower which poured out its responsive perfume in the delicate accents of its varied blossoms  breakfast was clemenss best meal and he sat longer at his steak and coffee than at the courses of his dinner luncheon was nothing to him unless as might happen he made it his dinner and reserved the later repast as the occasion of walking up and down the room and discoursing at large on anything that came into his head  like most good talkers he liked other people to have their say he did not talk them down he stopped instantly at anothers remark and gladly or politely heard him through he even made believe to find suggestion or inspiration in what was said  his children came to the table as i have told and after dinner he was apt to join his fine tenor to their trebles in singing  fully half our meetings were at my house in cambridge where he made himself as much at home as in hartford  he would come ostensibly to stay at the parker house in boston and take a room where he would light the gas and leave it burning after dressing while he drove out to cambridge and stayed two or three days with us  once i suppose it was after a lecture he came in evening dress and passed twentyfour hours with us in that guise wearing an overcoat to hide it when we went for a walk sometimes he wore the slippers which he preferred to shoes at home and if it was muddy as it was wont to be in cambridge he would put a pair of rubbers over them for our rambles  he liked the lawlessness and our delight in allowing it and he rejoiced in the confession of his hostess after we had once almost worn ourselves out in our pleasure with the intense talk with the stories and the laughing that his coming almost killed her but it was worth it  in those days he was troubled with sleeplessness or rather with reluctant sleepiness and he had various specifics for promoting it at first it had been champagne just before going to bed and we provided that but later he appeared from boston with four bottles of lagerbeer under his arms lagerbeer he said now was the only thing to make you go to sleep and we provided that  still later on a visit i paid him at hartford i learned that hot scotch was the only soporific worth considering and scotchwhiskey duly found its place on our sideboard one day very long afterward i asked him if he were still taking hot scotch to make him sleep  he said he was not taking anything  for a while he had found going to bed on the bathroom floor a soporific then one night he went to rest in his own bed at ten oclock and had gone promptly to sleep without anything  he had done the like with the like effect ever since  of course it amused him there were few experiences of life grave or gay which did not amuse him even when they wronged him  he came on to cambridge in april 1875 to go with me to the centennial ceremonies at concord in celebration of the battle of the minute men with the british troops a hundred years before  we both had special invitations including passage from boston but i said why bother to go into boston when we could just as well take the train for concord at the cambridge station  he equally decided that it would be absurd so we breakfasted deliberately and then walked to the station reasoning of many things as usual  when the train stopped we found it packed inside and out  people stood dense on the platforms of the cars to our startled eyes they seemed to project from the windows and unless memory betrays me they lay strewn upon the roofs like brakemen slain at the post of duty  whether this was really so or not it is certain that the train presented an impenetrable front even to our imagination and we left it to go its way without the slightest effort to board  we remounted the fameworn steps of porters station and began exploring north cambridge for some means of transportation overland to concord for we were that far on the road by which the british went and came on the day of the battle  the liverymen whom we appealed to received us some with compassion some with derision but in either mood convinced us that we could not have hired a cat to attempt our conveyance much less a horse or vehicle of any description  it was a raw windy day very unlike the exceptionally hot april day when the routed redcoats pursued by the colonials fled panting back to boston with their tongues hanging out like dogs but we could not take due comfort in the vision of their discomfiture we could almost envy them for they had at least got to concord  a swift procession of coaches carriages and buggies all going to concord passed us inert and helpless on the sidewalk in the peculiarly cold mud of north cambridge  we began to wonder if we might not stop one of them and bribe it to take us but we had not the courage to try and clemens seized the opportunity to begin suffering with an acute indigestion which gave his humor a very dismal cast  i felt keenly the shame of defeat and the guilt of responsibility for our failure and when a gay party of students came toward us on the top of a tally ho luxuriously empty inside we felt that our chance had come and our last chance he said that if i would stop them and tell them who i was they would gladly perhaps proudly give us passage i contended that if with his far vaster renown he would approach them our success would be assured while we stood lost in this contest of civilities the coach passed us with gay notes blown from the horns of the students and then clemens started in pursuit encouraged with shouts from the merry party who could not imagine who was trying to run them down to a rivalry in speed  the unequal match could end only in one way and i am glad i cannot recall what he said when he came back to me  since then i have often wondered at the grief which would have wrung those blithe young hearts if they could have known that they might have had the company of mark twain to concord that day and did not  we hung about unavailingly in the bitter wind a while longer and then slowly very slowly made our way home  we wished to pass as much time as possible in order to give probability to the deceit we intended to practise for we could not bear to own ourselves baffled in our boasted wisdom of taking the train at porters station and had agreed to say that we had been to concord and got back  even after coming home to my house we felt that our statement would be wanting in verisimilitude without further delay and we crept quietly into my library and made up a roaring fire on the hearth and thawed ourselves out in the heat of it before we regained our courage for the undertaking  with all these precautions we failed for when our statement was imparted to the proposed victim she instantly pronounced it unreliable and we were left with it on our hands intact  i think the humor of this situation was finally a greater pleasure to clemens than an actual visit to concord would have been only a few weeks before his death he laughed our defeat over with one of my family in bermuda and exulted in our prompt detection     xi  from our joint experience in failing i argue that clemenss affection for me must have been great to enable him to condone in me the final defection which was apt to be the end of our enterprises  i have fancied that i presented to him a surface of such entire trustworthiness that he could not imagine the depths of unreliability beneath it and that never realizing it he always broke through with fresh surprise but unimpaired faith  he liked beyond all things to push an affair to the bitter end and the end was never too bitter unless it brought grief or harm to another  once in a telegraph office at a railway station he was treated with such insolent neglect by the young lady in charge who was preoccupied in a flirtation with a gentleman friend that emulous of the public spirit which he admired in the english he told her he should report her to her superiors and probably to her astonishment he did so  he went back to hartford and in due time the poor girl came to me in terror and in tears for i had abetted clemens in his action and had joined my name to his in his appeal to the authorities  she was threatened with dismissal unless she made full apology to him and brought back assurance of its acceptance  i felt able to give this and of course he eagerly approved i think he telegraphed his approval another time some years afterward we sat down together in places near the end of a car and a brakeman came in looking for his official note book  clemens found that he had sat down upon it and handed it to him the man scolded him very abusively and came back again and again still scolding him for having no more sense than to sit down on a notebook the patience of clemens in bearing it was so angelic that i saw fit to comment i suppose you will report this fellow  yes he answered slowly and sadly  thats what i should have done once  but now i remember that he gets twenty dollars a month  nothing could have been wiser nothing tenderer and his humanity was not for humanity alone  he abhorred the dull and savage joy of the sportsman in a lucky shot an unerring aim and once when i met him in the country he had just been sickened by the success of a gunner in bringing down a blackbird and he described the poor stricken glossy thing how it lay throbbing its life out on the grass with such pity as he might have given a wounded child  i find this a fit place to say that his mind and soul were with those who do the hard work of the world in fear of those who give them a chance for their livelihoods and underpay them all they can  he never went so far in socialism as i have gone if he went that way at all but he was fascinated with looking backward and had bellamy to visit him and from the first he had a luminous vision of organized labor as the only present help for workingmen  he would show that side with such clearness and such force that you could not say anything in hopeful contradiction he saw with that relentless insight of his that with unions was the workingmans only present hope of standing up like a man against money and the power of it  there was a time when i was afraid that his eves were a little holden from the truth but in the very last talk i heard from him i found that i was wrong and that this great humorist was as great a humanist as ever  i wish that all the workfolk could know this and could know him their friend in life as he was in literature as he was in such a glorious gospel of equality as the connecticut yankee in king arthurs court     xii  whether i will or no i must let things come into my story thoughtwise as he would have let them for i cannot remember them in their order  one night while we were giving a party he suddenly stormed in with a friend of his and mine mr twichell and immediately began to eat and drink of our supper for they had come straight to our house from walking to boston or so great a part of the way as to be ahungered and athirst i can see him now as he stood up in the midst of our friends with his head thrown back and in his hand a dish of those escalloped oysters without which no party in cambridge was really a party exulting in the tale of his adventure which had abounded in the most original characters and amusing incidents at every mile of their progress  they had broken their journey with a nights rest and they had helped themselves lavishly out by rail in the last half but still it had been a mighty walk to do in two days  clemens was a great walker in those years and was always telling of his tramps with mr twichell to talcotts tower ten miles out of hartford  as he walked of course he talked and of course he smoked  whenever he had been a few days with us the whole house had to be aired for he smoked all over it from breakfast to bedtime  he always went to bed with a cigar in his mouth and sometimes mindful of my fire insurance i went up and took it away still burning after he had fallen asleep  i do not know how much a man may smoke and live but apparently he smoked as much as a man could for he smoked incessantly  he did not care much to meet people as i fancied and we were greedy of him for ourselves he was precious to us and i would not have exposed him to the critical edge of that cambridge acquaintance which might not have appreciated him at say his transatlantic value  in america his popularity was as instant as it was vast  but it must be acknowledged that for a much longer time here than in england polite learning hesitated his praise  in england rank fashion and culture rejoiced in him  lord mayors lord chief justices and magnates of many kinds were his hosts he was desired in country houses and his bold genius captivated the favor of periodicals which spurned the rest of our nation but in his own country it was different  in proportion as people thought themselves refined they questioned that quality which all recognize in him now but which was then the inspired knowledge of the simplehearted multitude  i went with him to see longfellow but i do not think longfellow made much of him and lowell made less  he stopped as if with the long semitic curve of clemenss nose which in the indulgence of his passion for finding every one more or less a jew he pronounced unmistakably racial  it was two of my most fastidious cambridge friends who accepted him with the english the european entiretynamely charles eliot norton and professor francis j child  norton was then newly back from a long sojourn abroad and his judgments were delocalized  he met clemens as if they had both been in england and rejoiced in his bold freedom from environment and in the rich variety and boundless reach of his talk  child was of a personal liberty as great in its fastidious way as that of clemens himself and though he knew him only at second hand he exulted in the most audacious instance of his grotesquery as i shall have to tell byandby almost solely  i cannot say just why clemens seemed not to hit the favor of our community of scribes and scholars as bret harte had done when he came on from california and swept them before him disrupting their dinners and delaying their lunches with impunity but it is certain he did not and i had better say so  i am surprised to find from the bibliographical authorities that it was so late as 1875 when he came with the manuscript of tom sawyer and asked me to read it as a friend and critic and not as an editor  i have an impression that this was at mrs clemenss instance in his own uncertainty about printing it  she trusted me i can say with a satisfaction few things now give me to be her husbands true and cordial adviser and i was so  i believe i never failed him in this part though in so many of our enterprises and projects i was false as water through my temperamental love of backing out of any undertaking  i believe this never ceased to astonish him and it has always astonished me it appears to me quite out of character though it is certain that an undertaking when i have entered upon it holds me rather than i it  but however this immaterial matter may be i am glad to remember that i thoroughly liked tom sawyer and said so with every possible amplification  very likely i also made my suggestions for its improvement i could not have been a real critic without that and i have no doubt they were gratefully accepted and i hope never acted upon  i went with him to the horsecar station in harvard square as my frequent wont was and put him aboard a car with his ms in his hand stayed and reassured so far as i counted concerning it  i do not know what his misgivings were perhaps they were his wifes misgivings for she wished him to be known not only for the wild and boundless humor that was in him but for the beauty and tenderness and natural piety and she would not have had him judged by a too close fidelity to the rude conditions of tom sawyers life  this is the meaning that i read into the fact of his coming to me with those doubts     xiii  clemens had then and for many years the habit of writing to me about what he was doing and still more of what he was experiencing  nothing struck his imagination in or out of the daily routine but he wished to write me of it and he wrote with the greatest fulness and a lavish dramatization sometimes to the length of twenty or forty pages so that i have now perhaps fifteen hundred pages of his letters  they will no doubt some day be published but i am not even referring to them in these records which i think had best come to the reader with an old mans falterings and uncertainties  with his frequent absences and my own abroad and the intrusion of calamitous cares the rich tide of his letters was more and more interrupted  at times it almost ceased and then it would come again a torrent  in the very last weeks of his life he burst forth and though too weak himself to write he dictated his rage with me for recommending to him a certain author whose truthfulness he could not deny but whom he hated for his truthfulness to sordid and ugly conditions  at heart clemens was romantic and he would have had the world of fiction stately and handsome and whatever the real world was not but he was not romanticistic and he was too helplessly an artist not to wish his own work to show life as he had seen it  i was preparing to rap him back for these letters when i read that he had got home to die he would have liked the rapping back  he liked coming to boston especially for those luncheons and dinners in which the fertile hospitality of our publisher osgood abounded  he dwelt equidistant from boston and new york and he had special friends in new york but he said he much preferred coming to boston of late years he never went there and he had lost the habit of it long before he came home from europe to live in new york  at these feasts which were often of afterdinnerspeaking measure he could always be trusted for something of amazing delightfulness  once when osgood could think of no other occasion for a dinner he gave himself a birthday dinner and asked his friends and authors  the beautiful and splendid trooperlike blaring was there and i recall how in the long rambling speech in which clemens went round the table hitting every head at it and especially visiting osgood with thanks for his ingenious pretext for our entertainment he congratulated blaring upon his engineering genius and his hypnotic control of municipal governments  he said that if there was a plan for draining a city at a cost of a million by seeking the level of the water in the downhill course of the sewers blaring would come with a plan to drain that town uphill at twice the cost and carry it through the common council without opposition  it is hard to say whether the time was gladder at these dinners or at the small lunches at which osgood and aldrich and i foregathered with him and talked the afternoon away till well toward the winter twilight  he was a great figure and the principal figure at one of the first of the now wornout authors readings which was held in the boston museum to aid a longfellow memorial  it was the late george parsons lathrop everybody seems to be late in these sad days who imagined the reading but when it came to a price for seats i can always claim the glory of fixing it at five dollars  the price if not the occasion proved irresistible and the museum was packed from the floor to the topmost gallery  norton presided and when it came clemenss turn to read he introduced him with such exquisite praises as he best knew how to give but before he closed he fell a prey to one of those lapses of tact which are the peculiar peril of people of the greatest tact  he was reminded of darwins delight in mark twain and how when he came from his long days exhausting study and sank into bed at midnight he took up a volume of mark twain whose books he always kept on a table beside him and whatever had been his tormenting problem or excess of toil he felt secure of a good nights rest from it  a sort of blank ensued which clemens filled in the only possible way  he said he should always be glad that he had contributed to the repose of that great man whom science owed so much and then without waiting for the joy in every breast to burst forth he began to read  it was curious to watch his triumph with the house  his carefully studied effects would reach the first rows in the orchestra first and ripple in laughter back to the standees against the wall and then with a fine resurgence come again to the rear orchestra seats and so rise from gallery to gallery till it fell back a cataract of applause from the topmost rows of seats  he was such a practised speaker that he knew all the stops of that simple instrument man and there is no doubt that these results were accurately intended from his unerring knowledge  he was the most consummate public performer i ever saw and it was an incomparable pleasure to hear him lecture on the platform he was the great and finished actor which he probably would not have been on the stage  he was fond of private theatricals and liked to play in them with his children and their friends in dramatizations of such stories of his as the prince and the pauper but i never saw him in any of these scenes  when he read his manuscript to you it was with a thorough however involuntary recognition of its dramatic qualities he held that an actor added fully half to the character the author created  with my own hurried and half hearted reading of passages which i wished to try on him from unprinted chapters say out of the undiscovered country or a modern instance he said frankly that my reading could spoil anything  he was realistic but he was essentially histrionic and he was rightly so  what we have strongly conceived we ought to make others strongly imagine and we ought to use every genuine art to that end     xiv  there came a time when the lecturing which had been the joy of his prime became his loathing loathing unutterable and when he renounced it with indescribable violence  yet he was always hankering for those fleshpots whose savor lingered on his palate and filled his nostrils after his withdrawal from the platform  the authors readings when they had won their brief popularity abounded in suggestion for him  reading from ones book was not so bad as giving a lecture written for a lectures purpose and he was willing at last to compromise  he had a magnificent scheme for touring the country with aldrich and mr g w cable and myself in a private car with a cook of our own and every facility for living on the fat of the land  we should read only four times a week in an entertainment that should not last more than an hour and a half  he would be the impresario and would guarantee us others at least seventy five dollars a day and pay every expense of the enterprise which he provisionally called the circus himself  but aldrich and i were now no longer in those earlier thirties when we so cheerfully imagined memorable murders for subscription publication we both abhorred public appearances and at any rate i was going to europe for a year  so the plan fell through except as regarded mr cable who in his way was as fine a performer as clemens and could both read and sing the matter of his books  on a far less stupendous scale they two made the rounds of the great lecturing circuit together  but i believe a famous lecture manager had charge of them and travelled with them  he was a most sanguine man a most amiable person and such a believer in fortune that clemens used to say of him as he said of one of his early publishers that you could rely upon fifty per cent of everything he promised  i myself many years later became a follower of this hopeful prophet and i can testify that in my case at least he was able to keep ninetynine and even a hundred per cent of his word  it was i who was much nearer failing of mine for i promptly began to lose sleep from the nervous stress of my lecturing and from the gratifying but killing receptions afterward and i was truly in that state from insomnia which clemens recognized in the brief letter i got from him in the western city after half a dozen wakeful nights  he sardonically congratulated me on having gone into the lecture field and then he said i know where you are now  you are in hell  it was this perdition which he reentered when he undertook that round theworld lecturing tour for the payment of the debts left to him by the bankruptcy of his firm in the publishing business  it was not purely perdition for him or rather it was perdition for only onehalf of him the authorhalf for the actorhalf it was paradise  the author who takes up lecturing without the ability to give histrionic support to the literary reputation which he brings to the crude test of his readers eyes and ears invokes a peril and a misery unknown to the lecturer who has made his first public from the platform  clemens was victorious on the platform from the beginning and it would be folly to pretend that he did not exult in his triumphs there  but i suppose with the wearing nerves of middle life he hated more and more the personal swarming of interest upon him and all the inevitable clatter of the thing  yet he faced it and he labored round our tiresome globe that he might pay the uttermost farthing of debts which he had not knowingly contracted the debts of his partners who had meant well and done ill not because they were evil but because they were unwise and as unfit for their work as he was  pay what thou owest  that is right even when thou owest it by the error of others and even when thou owest it to a bank which had not lent it from love of thee but in the hard line of business and thy need  clemenss behavior in this matter redounded to his glory among the nations of the whole earth and especially in this nation so wrapped in commerce and so little used to honor among its many thieves  he had behaved like walter scott as millions rejoiced to know who had not known how walter scott had behaved till they knew it was like clemens no doubt it will be put to his credit in the books of the recording angel but what the judge of all the earth will say of it at the last day there is no telling  i should not be surprised if he accounted it of less merit than some other things that clemens did and was less than his abhorrence of the spanish war and the destruction of the southafrican republics and our deceit of the filipinos and his hate of slavery and his payment of his portion of our races debt to the race of the colored student whom he saw through college and his support of a poor artist for three years in paris and his loan of opportunity to the youth who became the most brilliant of our actordramatists and his eager pardon of the thoughtless girl who was near paying the penalty of her impertinence with the loss of her place and his remembering that the insolent brakeman got so few dollars a month and his sympathy for workingmen standing up to money in their unions and even his pity for the wounded bird throbbing out its little life on the grass for the pleasure of the cruel fool who shot it  these and the thousand other charities and beneficences in which he abounded openly or secretly may avail him more than the discharge of his firms liabilities with the judge of all the earth who surely will do right but whose measures and criterions no man knows and i least of all men  he made no great show of sympathy with people in their anxieties but it never failed and at a time when i lay sick for many weeks his letters were of comfort to those who feared i might not rise again  his hand was out in help for those who needed help and in kindness for those who needed kindness  there remains in my mind the dreary sense of a long long drive to the uttermost bounds of the south end at boston where he went to call upon some obscure person whose claim stretched in a lengthening chain from his early days in missouria most inadequate person in whose vacuity the gloom of the dull day deepened till it was almost too deep for tears  he bore the ordeal with grim heroism and silently smoked away the sense of it as we drove back to cambridge in his slippered feet sombrely musing sombrely swearing  but he knew he had done the right the kind thing and he was content  he came the whole way from hartford to go with me to a friendless play of mine which alessandro salvini was giving in a series of matinees to houses never enlarging themselves beyond the count of the brave two hundred who sat it through and he stayed my fainting spirit with a cheer beyond flagons joining me in my joke at the misery of it and carrying the fun farther  before that he had come to witness the aesthetic suicide of anna dickinson who had been a flaming light of the political platform in the war days and had been left by them consuming in a hapless ambition for the theatre  the poor girl had had a play written especially for her and as anne boleyn she ranted and exhorted through the five acts drawing ever nearer the utter defeat of the anticlimax  we could hardly look at each other for pity clemens sitting there in the box he had taken with his shaggy head out over the corner and his slippered feet curled under him he either went to a place in his slippers or he carried them with him and put them on as soon as he could put off his boots  when it was so that we could not longer follow her failure and live he began to talk of the absolute close of her career which the thing was and how probably she had no conception that it was the end  he philosophized the mercifulness of the fact and of the ignorance of most of us when mortally sick or fatally wounded  we think it is not the end because we have never ended before and we do not see how we can end  some can push by the awful hour and live again but for anna dickinson there could be and was no such palingenesis  of course we got that solemn joy out of reading her fate aright which is the compensation of the wise spectator in witnessing the inexorable doom of others     xv  when messrs houghton  mifflin became owners of the atlantic monthly mr houghton fancied having some breakfasts and dinners which should bring the publisher and the editor face to face with the contributors who were bidden from far and near  of course the subtle fiend of advertising who has now grown so unblushing bold lurked under the covers at these banquets and the junior partner and the young editor had their joint and separate fine anguishes of misgiving as to the taste and the principle of them but they were really very simplehearted and honestly meant hospitalities and they prospered as they ought and gave great pleasure and no pain  i forget some of the emergent occasions but i am sure of a birthday dinner most unexpectedly accepted by whittier and a birthday luncheon to mrs stowe and i think a birthday dinner to longfellow but the passing years have left me in the dark as to the pretext of that supper at which clemens made his awful speech and came so near being the death of us all  at the breakfasts and luncheons we had the pleasure of our lady contributors company but that night there were only men and because of our great strength we survived  i suppose the year was about 1879 but here the almanac is unimportant and i can only say that it was after clemens had become a very valued contributor of the magazine where he found himself to his own great explicit satisfaction  he had jubilantly accepted our invitation and had promised a speech which it appeared afterward he had prepared with unusual care and confidence  it was his custom always to think out his speeches mentally wording them and then memorizing them by a peculiar system of mnemonics which he had invented  on the dinnertable a certain succession of knife spoon saltcellar and butterplate symbolized a train of ideas and on the billiardtable a ball a cue and a piece of chalk served the same purpose  with a diagram of these printed on the brain he had full command of the phrases which his excogitation had attached to them and which embodied the ideas in perfect form  he believed he had been particularly fortunate in his notion for the speech of that evening and he had worked it out in joyous selfreliance it was the notion of three tramps three deadbeats visiting a california miningcamp and imposing themselves upon the innocent miners as respectively ralph waldo emerson henry wadsworth longfellow and oliver wendell holmes  the humor of the conception must prosper or must fail according to the mood of the hearer but clemens felt sure of compelling this to sympathy and he looked forward to an unparalleled triumph  but there were two things that he had not taken into account  one was the species of religious veneration in which these men were held by those nearest them a thing that i should not be able to realize to people remote from them in time and place  they were men of extraordinary dignity of the thing called presence for want of some clearer word so that no one could well approach them in a personally light or trifling spirit  i do not suppose that anybody more truly valued them or more piously loved them than clemens himself but the intoxication of his fancy carried him beyond the bounds of that regard and emboldened him to the other thing which he had not taken into accountnamely the immense hazard of working his fancy out before their faces and expecting them to enter into the delight of it  if neither emerson nor longfellow nor holmes had been there the scheme might possibly have carried but even this is doubtful for those who so devoutly honored them would have overcome their horror with difficulty and perhaps would not have overcome it at all  the publisher with a modesty very ungrateful to me had abdicated his office of host and i was the hapless president fulfilling the abhorred function of calling people to their feet and making them speak  when i came to clemens i introduced him with the cordial admiring i had for him as one of my greatest contributors and dearest friends  here i said in sum was a humorist who never left you hanging your head for having enjoyed his joke and then the amazing mistake the bewildering blunder the cruel catastrophe was upon us  i believe that after the scope of the burlesque made itself clear there was no one there including the burlesquer himself who was not smitten with a desolating dismay  there fell a silence weighing many tons to the square inch which deepened from moment to moment and was broken only by the hysterical and blood curdling laughter of a single guest whose name shall not be handed down to infamy  nobody knew whether to look at the speaker or down at his plate  i chose my plate as the least affliction and so i do not know how clemens looked except when i stole a glance at him and saw him standing solitary amid his appalled and appalling listeners with his joke dead on his hands  from a first glance at the great three whom his jest had made its theme i was aware of longfellow sitting upright and regarding the humorist with an air of pensive puzzle of holmes busily writing on his menu with a wellfeigned effect of preoccupation and of emerson holding his elbows and listening with a sort of jovian oblivion of this nether world in that lapse of memory which saved him in those later years from so much bother  clemens must have dragged his joke to the climax and left it there but i cannot say this from any sense of the fact  of what happened afterward at the table where the immense the wholly innocent the truly unimagined affront was offered i have no longer the least remembrance  i next remember being in a room of the hotel where clemens was not to sleep but to toss in despair and charles dudley warners saying in the gloom well mark youre a funny fellow  it was as well as anything else he could have said but clemens seemed unable to accept the tribute  i stayed the night with him and the next morning after a haggard breakfast we drove about and he made some purchases of bricabrac for his house in hartford with a soul as far away from bricabrac as ever the soul of man was  he went home by an early train and he lost no time in writing back to the three divine personalities which he had so involuntarily seemed to flout  they all wrote back to him making it as light for him as they could  i have heard that emerson was a good deal mystified and in his sublime forgetfulness asked who was this gentleman who appeared to think he had offered him some sort of annoyance  but i am not sure that this is accurate  what i am sure of is that longfellow a few days after in my study stopped before a photograph of clemens and said ah he is a wag and nothing more  holmes told me with deep emotion such as a brother humorist might well feel that he had not lost an instant in replying to clemenss letter and assuring him that there had not been the least offence and entreating him never to think of the matter again  he said that he was a fool but he was gods fool holmes quoted from the letter with a true sense of the pathos and the humor of the selfabasement  to me clemens wrote a week later it doesnt get any better it burns like fire  but now i understand that it was not shame that burnt but rage for a blunder which he had so incredibly committed  that to have conceived of those men the most dignified in our literature our civilization as impersonable by three hoboes and then to have imagined that he could ask them personally to enjoy the monstrous travesty was a break he saw too late for which there was no repair  yet the time came and not so very long afterward when some mention was made of the incident as a mistake and he said with all his fierceness but i dont admit that it was a mistake and it was not so in the minds of all witnesses at second hand  the morning after the dreadful dinner there came a glowing note from professor child who had read the newspaper report of it praising clemenss burlesque as the richest piece of humor in the world and betraying no sense of incongruity in its perpetration in the presence of its victims  i think it must always have ground in clemenss soul that he was the prey of circumstances and that if he had some more favoring occasion he could retrieve his loss in it by giving the thing the right setting  not more than two or three years ago he came to try me as to trying it again at a meeting of newspaper men in washington  i had to own my fears while i alleged childs note on the other hand but in the end he did not try it with the newspaper men  i do not know whether he has ever printed it or not but since the thing happened i have often wondered how much offence there really was in it i am not sure but the horror of the spectators read more indignation into the subjects of the hapless drolling than they felt  but it must have been difficult for them to bear it with equanimity  to be sure they were not themselves mocked the joke was of course beside them nevertheless their personality was trifled with and i could only end by reflecting that if i had been in their place i should not have liked it myself  clemens would have liked it himself for he had the heart for that sort of wild play and he so loved a joke that even if it took the form of a liberty and was yet a good joke he would have loved it  but perhaps this burlesque was not a good joke     xvi  clemens was oftenest at my house in cambridge but he was also sometimes at my house in belmont when after a year in europe we went to live in boston he was more rarely with us  we could never be long together without something out of the common happening and one day something far out of the common happened which fortunately refused the nature of absolute tragedy while remaining rather the saddest sort of comedy  we were looking out of my library window on that view of the charles which i was so proud of sharing with my allbutnextdoor neighbor doctor holmes when another friend who was with us called out with curiously impersonal interest oh see that woman getting into the water  this would have excited curiosity and alarmed anxiety far less lively than ours and clemens and i rushed downstairs and out through my basement and back gate  at the same time a coachman came out of a stable next door and grappled by the shoulders a woman who was somewhat deliberately getting down the steps to the water over the face of the embankment before we could reach them he had pulled her up to the driveway and stood holding her there while she crazily grieved at her rescue  as soon as he saw us he went back into his stable and left us with the poor wild creature on our hands  she was not very young and not very pretty and we could not have flattered ourselves with the notion of anything romantic in her suicidal mania but we could take her on the broad human level and on this we proposed to escort her up beacon street till we could give her into the keeping of one of those kindly policemen whom our neighborhood knew  naturally there was no policeman known to us or unknown the whole way to the public garden  we had to circumvent our charge in her present design of drowning herself and walk her past the streets crossing beacon to the river  at these points it needed considerable reasoning to overcome her wish and some active manoeuvring in both of us to enforce our arguments  nobody else appeared to be interested and though we did not court publicity in the performance of the duty so strangely laid upon us still it was rather disappointing to be so entirely ignored  there are some four or five crossings to the river between 302 beacon street and the public garden and the suggestions at our command were pretty well exhausted by the time we reached it  still the expected policeman was nowhere in sight but a brilliant thought occurred to clemens  he asked me where the nearest police station was and when i told him he started off at his highest speed leaving me in sole charge of our hapless ward  all my powers of suasion were now taxed to the utmost and i began attracting attention as a short stout gentleman in early middle life endeavoring to distrain a respectable female of her personal liberty when his accomplice had abandoned him to his wicked design  after a much longer time than i thought i should have taken to get a policeman from the station clemens reappeared in easy conversation with an officer who had probably realized that he was in the company of mark twain and was in no hurry to end the interview  he took possession of our captive and we saw her no more  i now wonder that with our joint instinct for failure we ever got rid of her but i am sure we did and few things in life have given me greater relief  when we got back to my house we found the friend we had left there quite unruffled and not much concerned to know the facts of our adventure  my impression is that he had been taking a nap on my lounge be appeared refreshed and even gay but if i am inexact in these details he is alive to refute me     xvii  a little after this clemens went abroad with his family and lived several years in germany  his letters still came but at longer intervals and the thread of our intimate relations was inevitably broken  he would write me when something i had written pleased him or when something signal occurred to him or some political or social outrage stirred him to wrath and he wished to free his mind in pious profanity  during this sojourn he came near dying of pneumonia in berlin and he had slight relapses from it after coming home  in berlin also he had the honor of dining with the german emperor at the table of a cousin married to a high officer of the court  clemens was a man to enjoy such a distinction he knew how to take it as a delegated recognition from the german people but as coming from a rather cockahoop sovereign who had as yet only his sovereignty to value himself upon he was not very proud of it  he expressed a quiet disdain of the event as between the imperiality and himself on whom it was supposed to confer such glory crowning his life with the topmost leaf of laurel  he was in the same mood in his account of an english dinner many years before where there was a little scotch lord present to whom the english tacitly referred clemenss talk and laughed when the lord laughed and were grave when he failed to smile  of all the men i have known he was the farthest from a snob though he valued recognition and liked the flattery of the fashionable fair when it came in his way  he would not go out of his way for it but like most able and brilliant men he loved the minds of women their wit their agile cleverness their sensitive perception their humorous appreciation the saucy things they would say and their pretty temerarious defiances  he had of course the keenest sense of what was truly dignified and truly undignified in people but he was not really interested in what we call society affairs they scarcely existed for him though his books witness how he abhorred the dreadful fools who through some chance of birth or wealth hold themselves different from other men  commonly he did not keep things to himself especially dislikes and condemnations  upon most current events he had strong opinions and he uttered them strongly  after a while he was silent in them but if you tried him you found him in them still  he was tremendously worked up by a certain famous trial as most of us were who lived in the time of it he believed the accused guilty but when we met some months after it was over and i tempted him to speak his mind upon it he would only say the man had suffered enough as if the man had expiated his wrong and he was not going to do anything to renew his penalty  i found that very curious very delicate  his continued blame could not come to the sufferers knowledge but he felt it his duty to forbear it  he was apt to wear himself out in the vehemence of his resentments or he had so spent himself in uttering them that he had literally nothing more to say  you could offer clemens offences that would anger other men and he did not mind he would account for them from human nature but if he thought you had in any way played him false you were anathema and maranatha forever  yet not forever perhaps for by andby after years he would be silent  there were two men half a generation apart in their succession whom he thought equally atrocious in their treason to him and of whom he used to talk terrifyingly even after they were out of the world  he went farther than heine who said that he forgave his enemies but not till they were dead  clemens did not forgive his dead enemies their death seemed to deepen their crimes like a base evasion or a cowardly attempt to escape he pursued them to the grave he would like to dig them up and take vengeance upon their clay  so he said but no doubt he would not have hurt them if he had had them living before him he was generous without stint he trusted without measure but where his generosity was abused or his trust betrayed he was a fire of vengeance a consuming flame of suspicion that no sprinkling of cool patience from others could quench it had to burn itself out  he was eagerly and lavishly hospitable but if a man seemed willing to batten on him or in any way to lie down upon him clemens despised him unutterably  in his frenzies of resentment or suspicion he would not and doubtless could not listen to reason  but if between the paroxysms he were confronted with the facts he would own them no matter how much they told against him  at one period he fancied that a certain newspaper was hounding him with biting censure and poisonous paragraphs and he was filling himself up with wrath to be duly discharged on the editors head  later he wrote me with a humorous joy in his mistake that warner had advised him to have the paper watched for these injuries  he had done so and how many mentions of him did i reckon he had found in three months  just two and they were rather indifferent than unfriendly  so the paper was acquitted and the editors life was spared  the wretch never knew how near he was to losing it with incredible preliminaries of obloquy and a subsequent devotion to lasting infamy  his memory for favors was as good as for injuries and he liked to return your friendliness with as loud a band of music as could be bought or bribed for the occasion  all that you had to do was to signify that you wanted his help  when my father was consul at toronto during arthurs administration he fancied that his place was in danger and he appealed to me  in turn i appealed to clemens bethinking myself of his friendship with grant and grants friendship with arthur  i asked him to write to grant in my fathers behalf but no he answered me i must come to hartford and we would go on to new york together and see grant personally  this was before and long before clemens became grants publisher and splendid benefactor but the men liked each other as such men could not help doing  clemens made the appointment and we went to find grant in his business office that place where his business innocence was afterward so betrayed  he was very simple and very cordial and i was instantly the more at home with him because his voice was the soft rounded ohio river accent to which my years were earliest used from my steamboating uncles my earliest heroes  when i stated my business he merely said oh no that must not be he would write to mr arthur and he did so that day and my father lived to lay down his office when he tired of it with no urgence from above  it is not irrelevant to clemens to say that grant seemed to like finding himself in company with two literary men one of whom at least he could make sure of and unlike that silent man he was reputed he talked constantly and so far as he might he talked literature  at least he talked of john phoenix that delightfulest of the early pacific slope humorists whom he had known under his real name of george h derby when they were fellowcadets at west point  it was mighty pretty as pepys would say to see the delicate deference clemens paid our plain hero and the manly respect with which he listened  while grant talked his luncheon was brought in from some unassuming restaurant near by and he asked us to join him in the baked beans and coffee which were served us in a little room out of the office with about the same circumstance as at a railroad refreshmentcounter  the baked beans and coffee were of about the railroadrefreshment quality but eating them with grant was like sitting down to baked beans and coffee with julius caesar or alexander or some other great plutarchan captain  one of the highest satisfactions of clemenss often supremely satisfactory life was his relation to grant it was his proud joy to tell how he found grant about to sign a contract for his book on certainly very good terms and said to him that he would himself publish the book and give him a percentage three times as large he said grant seemed to doubt whether he could honorably withdraw from the negotiation at that point but clemens overbore his scruples and it was his unparalleled privilege his princely pleasure to pay the author a far larger check for his work than had ever been paid to an author before  he valued even more than this splendid opportunity the sacred moments in which their business brought him into the presence of the slowly dying heroically living man whom he was so befriending and he told me in words which surely lost none of their simple pathos through his report how grant described his suffering  the prosperity of this venture was the beginning of clemenss adversity for it led to excesses of enterprise which were forms of dissipation the young sculptor who had come back to him from paris modelled a small bust of grant which clemens multiplied in great numbers to his great loss and the success of grants book tempted him to launch on publishing seas where his bark presently foundered  the first and greatest of his disasters was the life of pope leo xiii which he came to tell me of when he had imagined it in a sort of delirious exultation  he had no words in which to paint the magnificence of the project or to forecast its colossal success  it would have a currency bounded only by the number of catholics in christendom  it would be translated into every language which was anywhere written or printed it would be circulated literally in every country of the globe and clemenss book agents would carry the prospectuses and then the bound copies of the work to the ends of the whole earth  not only would every catholic buy it but every catholic must as he was a good catholic as he hoped to be saved  it was a magnificent scheme and it captivated me as it had captivated clemens it dazzled us both and neither of us saw the fatal defect in it  we did not consider how often catholics could not read how often when they could they might not wish to read  the event proved that whether they could read or not the immeasurable majority did not wish to read the life of the pope though it was written by a dignitary of the church and issued to the world with every sanction from the vatican the failure was incredible to clemens his sanguine soul was utterly confounded and soon a silence fell upon it where it had been so exuberantly jubilant     xix  the occasions which brought us to new york together were not nearly so frequent as those which united us in boston but there was a dinner given him by a friend which remains memorable from the fatuity of two men present so different in everything but their fatuity  one was the sweet old comedian billy florence who was urging the unsuccessful dramatist across the table to write him a play about oliver cromwell and giving the reasons why he thought himself peculiarly fitted to portray the character of cromwell  the other was a modestly millioned rich man who was then only beginning to amass the moneys afterward heaped so high and was still in the condition to be flattered by the condescension of a yet greater millionaire  his contribution to our gaiety was the verbatim report of a call he had made upon william h vanderbilt whom he had found just about starting out of town with his trunks actually in the front hall but who had stayed to receive the narrator  he had in fact sat down on one of the trunks and talked with the easiest friendliness and quite we were given to infer like an ordinary human being  clemens often kept on with some thread of the talk when we came away from a dinner but now he was silent as if high sorrowful and cloyed and it was not till well afterward that i found he had noted the facts from the bitterness with which he mocked the rich man and the pity he expressed for the actor  he had begun before that to amass those evidences against mankind which eventuated with him in his theory of what he called the damned human race  this was not an expression of piety but of the kind contempt to which he was driven by our follies and iniquities as he had observed them in himself as well as in others  it was as mild a misanthropy probably as ever caressed the objects of its malediction  but i believe it was about the year 1900 that his sense of our perdition became insupportable and broke out in a mixed abhorrence and amusement which spared no occasion so that i could quite understand why mrs clemens should have found some compensation when kept to her room by sickness in the reflection that now she should not hear so much about the damned human race  he told of that with the same wild joy that he told of overhearing her repetition of one of his most inclusive profanities and her explanation that she meant him to hear it so that he might know how it sounded  the contrast of the lurid blasphemy with her heavenly whiteness should have been enough to cure any one less grounded than he in what must be owned was as fixed a habit as smoking with him  when i first knew him he rarely vented his fury in that sort and i fancy he was under a promise to her which he kept sacred till the wear and tear of his nerves with advancing years disabled him  then it would be like him to struggle with himself till he could struggle no longer and to ask his promise back and it would be like her to give it back  his profanity was the heritage of his boyhood and young manhood in social conditions and under the duress of exigencies in which everybody swore about as impersonally as he smoked  it is best to recognize the fact of it and i do so the more readily because i cannot suppose the recording angel really minded it much more than that guardian  angel of his  it probably grieved them about equally but they could equally forgive it nothing came of his pose regarding the damned human race except his invention of the human race luncheon club  this was confined to four persons who were never all got together and it soon perished of their indifference  in the earlier days that i have more specially in mind one of the questions that we used to debate a good deal was whether every human motive was not selfish  we inquired as to every impulse the noblest the holiest in effect and he found them in the last analysis of selfish origin  pretty nearly the whole time of a certain railroad run from new york to hartford was taken up with the scrutiny of the selfsacrifice of a mother for her child of the abandon of the lover who dies in saving his mistress from fire or flood of the heros courage in the field and the martyrs at the stake  each he found springing from the unconscious love of self and the dread of the greater pain which the selfsacrificer would suffer inforbearing the sacrifice  if we had any time left from this inquiry that day he must have devoted it to a high regret that napoleon did not carry out his purpose of invading england for then he would have destroyed the feudal aristocracy or reformed the lords as it might be called now  he thought that would have been an incalculable blessing to the english people and the world  clemens was always beautifully and unfalteringly a republican  none of his occasional misgivings for america implicated a return to monarchy  yet he felt passionately the splendor of the english monarchy and there was a time when he gloried in that figurative poetry by which the king was phrased as the majesty of england  he rolled the words deepthroatedly out and exulted in their beauty as if it were beyond any other glory of the world  he read or read at english history a great deal and one of the byproducts of his restless invention was a game of english kings like the game of authors for children  i do not know whether he ever perfected this but i am quite sure it was not put upon the market  very likely he brought it to a practicable stage and then tired of it as he was apt to do in the ultimation of his vehement undertakings     xx  he satisfied the impassioned demand of his nature for incessant activities of every kind by taking a personal as well as a pecuniary interest in the inventions of others  at one moment the damned human race was almost to be redeemed by a process of founding brass without air bubbles in it if this could once be accomplished as i understood or misunderstood brass could be used in artprinting to a degree hitherto impossible  i dare say i have got it wrong but i am not mistaken as to clemenss enthusiasm for the process and his heavy losses in paying its way to ultimate failure  he was simultaneously absorbed in the perfection of a typesetting machine which he was paying the inventor a salary to bring to a perfection so expensive that it was practically impracticable  we were both printers by trade and i could take the same interest in this wonderful piece of mechanism that he could and it was so truly wonderful that it did everything but walk and talk  its ingenious creator was so bent upon realizing the highest ideal in it that he produced a machine of quite unimpeachable efficiency  but it was so costly when finished that it could not be made for less than twenty thousand dollars if the parts were made by hand  this sum was prohibitive of its introduction unless the requisite capital could be found for making the parts by machinery and clemens spent many months in vainly trying to get this money together  in the mean time simpler machines had been invented and the market filled and his investment of three hundred thousand dollars in the beautiful miracle remained permanent but not profitable  i once went with him to witness its performance and it did seem to me the last word in its way but it had been spoken too exquisitely too fastidiously  i never heard him devote the inventor to the infernal gods as he was apt to do with the geniuses he lost money by and so i think he did not regard him as a traitor  in these things and in his other schemes for the subiti guadagni of the speculator and the sudden making of splendid names for the benefactors of our species clemens satisfied the colonel sellers nature in himself from which he drew the picture of that wild and lovable figure and perhaps made as good use of his money as he could  he did not care much for money in itself but he luxuriated in the lavish use of it and he was as generous with it as ever a man was he liked giving it but he commonly wearied of giving it himself and wherever he lived he established an almoner whom he fully trusted to keep his left hand ignorant of what his right hand was doing  i believe he felt no finality in charity but did it because in its provisional way it was the only thing a man could do i never heard him go really into any sociological inquiry and i have a feeling that that sort of thing baffled and dispirited him  no one can read the connecticut yankee and not be aware of the length and breadth of his sympathies with poverty but apparently he had not thought out any scheme for righting the economic wrongs we abound in  i cannot remember our ever getting quite down to a discussion of the matter we came very near it once in the day of the vast wave of emotion sent over the world by looking backward and again when we were all so troubled by the great coal strike in pennsylvania in considering that he seemed to be for the time doubtful of the justice of the workingmans cause  at all other times he seemed to know that whatever wrongs the workingman committed work was always in the right  when clemens returned to america with his family after lecturing round the world i again saw him in new york where i so often saw him while he was shaping himself for that heroic enterprise  he would come to me and talk sorrowfully over his financial ruin and picture it to himself as the stuff of some unhappy dream which after long prosperity had culminated the wrong way  it was very melancholy very touching but the sorrow to which he had come home from his long journey had not that forlorn bewilderment in it  he was looking wonderfully well and when i wanted the name of his elixir he said it was plasmon  he was apt for a man who had put faith so decidedly away from him to take it back and pin it to some superstition usually of a hygienic sort  once when he was well on in years he came to new york without glasses and announced that he and all his family so astigmatic and myopic and oldsighted had so to speak burned their spectacles behind them upon the instruction of some sage who had found out that they were a delusion  the next time he came he wore spectacles freely almost ostentatiously and i heard from others that the whole clemens family had been near losing their eyesight by the miracle worked in their behalf  now i was not surprised to learn that the damned human race was to be saved by plasmon if anything and that my first duty was to visit the plasmon agency with him and procure enough plasmon to secure my family against the ills it was heir to for evermore  i did not immediately understand that plasmon was one of the investments which he had made from the substance of things hoped for and in the destiny of a disastrous disappointment  but after paying off the creditors of his late publishing firm he had to do something with his money and it was not his fault if he did not make a fortune out of plasmon     xxi  for a time it was a question whether he should not go back with his family to their old home in hartford  perhaps the fathers and mothers hearts drew them there all the more strongly because of the grief written ineffaceably over it but for the younger ones it was no longer the measure of the world  it was easier for all to stay on indefinitely in new york which is a sojourn without circumstance and equally the home of exile and of indecision  the clemenses took a pleasant spacious house at riverdale on the hudson and there i began to see them again on something like the sweet old terms  they lived far more unpretentiously than they used and i think with a notion of economy which they had never very successfully practised  i recall that at the end of a certain year in hartford when they had been saving and paying cash for everything clemens wrote reminding me of their avowed experiment and asking me to guess how many bills they had at new years he hastened to say that a horsecar would not have held them  at riverdale they kept no carriage and there was a snowy night when i drove up to their handsome old mansion in the station carryall which was crusted with mud as from the going down of the deluge after transporting noah and his family from the ark to whatever point they decided to settle at provisionally  but the good talk the rich talk the talk that could never suffer poverty of mind or soul was there and we jubilantly found ourselves again in our middle youth  it was the mighty moment when clemens was building his engines of war for the destruction of christian science which superstition nobody and he least of all expected to destroy  it would not be easy to say whether in his talk of it his disgust for the illiterate twaddle of mrs eddys book or his admiration of her genius for organization was the greater  he believed that as a religious machine the christian science church was as perfect as the roman church and destined to be more formidable in its control of the minds of men he looked for its spread over the whole of christendom and throughout the winter he spent at riverdale he was ready to meet all listeners more than halfway with his convictions of its powerful grasp of the average human desire to get something for nothing  the vacuous vulgarity of its texts was a perpetual joy to him while he bowed with serious respect to the sagacity which built so securely upon the everlasting rock of human credulity and folly  an interesting phase of his psychology in this business was not only his admiration for the masterly policy of the christian science hierarchy but his willingness to allow the miracles of its healers to be tried on his friends and family if they wished it  he had a tender heart for the whole generation of empirics as well as the newer sorts of scientitians but he seemed to base his faith in them largely upon the failure of the regulars rather than upon their own successes which also he believed in he was recurrently but not insistently desirous that you should try their strange magics when you were going to try the familiar medicines     xxii  the order of my acquaintance or call it intimacy with clemens was this our first meeting in boston my visits to him in hartford his visits to me in cambridge in belmont and in boston our briefer and less frequent meetings in paris and new york all with repeated interruptions through my absences in europe and his sojourns in london berlin vienna and florence and his flights to the many ends and odds and ends of the earth  i will not try to follow the events if they were not rather the subjective experiences of those different periods and points of time which i must not fail to make include his summer at york harbor and his divers residences in new york on tenth street and on fifth avenue at riverdale and at stormfield which his daughter has told me he loved best of all his houses and hoped to make his home for long years  not much remains to me of the week or so that we had together in paris early in the summer of 1904  the first thing i got at my bankers was a cable message announcing that my father was stricken with paralysis but urging my stay for further intelligence and i went about till the final summons came with my head in a mist of care and dread  clemens was very kind and brotherly through it all  he was living greatly to his mind in one of those arcaded little hotels in the rue de rivoli and he was free from all household duties to range with me  we drove together to make calls of digestion at many houses where he had got indigestion through his reluctance from their hospitality for he hated dining out  but as he explained his wife wanted him to make these visits and he did it as he did everything she wanted  at one place some suburban villa he could get no answer to his ring and he hove his cards over the gate just as it opened and he had the shame of explaining in his unexplanatory french to the man picking them up  he was excruciatingly helpless with his cabmen but by very cordially smiling and casting himself on the drivers mercy he always managed to get where he wanted the family was on the verge of their many moves and he was doing some small errands he said that the others did the main things and left him to do what the cat might  it was with that return upon the buoyant billow of plasmon renewed in look and limb that clemenss universally pervasive popularity began in his own country  he had hitherto been more intelligently accepted or more largely imagined in europe and i suppose it was my sense of this that inspired the stupidity of my saying to him when we came to consider the state of polite learning among us you mustnt expect people to keep it up here as they do in england  but it appeared that his countrymen were only wanting the chance and they kept it up in honor of him past all precedent  one does not go into a catalogue of dinners receptions meetings speeches and the like when there are more vital things to speak of  he loved these obvious joys and he eagerly strove with the occasions they gave him for the brilliancy which seemed so exhaustless and was so exhausting  his friends saw that he was wearing himself out and it was not because of mrs clemenss health alone that they were glad to have him take refuge at riverdale  the family lived there two happy hopeless years and then it was ordered that they should change for his wifes sake to some less exacting climate  clemens was not eager to go to florence but his imagination was taken as it would have been in the oldyoung days by the notion of packing his furniture into flexible steel cages from his house in hartford and unpacking it from them untouched at his villa in fiesole  he got what pleasure any man could out of that triumph of mind over matter but the shadow was creeping up his life  one sunny afternoon we sat on the grass before the mansion after his wife had begun to get well enough for removal and we looked up toward a balcony where byandby that lovely presence made itself visible as if it had stooped there from a cloud  a hand frailly waved a handkerchief clemens ran over the lawn toward it calling tenderly what  what as if it might be an asking for him instead of the greeting it really was for me  it was the last time i saw her if indeed i can be said to have seen her then and long afterward when i said how beautiful we all thought her how good how wise how wonderfully perfect in every relation of life he cried out in a breaking voice oh why didnt you ever tell her  she thought you didnt like her  what a pang it was then not to have told her but how could we have told her  his unreason endeared him to me more than all his wisdom  to that riverdale sojourn belong my impressions of his most violent anti christian science rages which began with the postponement of his book and softened into acceptance of the delay till he had wellnigh forgotten his wrath when it come out  there was also one of those joint episodes of ours which strangely enough did not eventuate in entire failure as most of our joint episodes did  he wrote furiously to me of a wrong which had been done to one of the most helpless and one of the most helped of our literary brethren asking me to join with him in recovering the money paid over by that brothers publisher to a false friend who had withheld it and would not give any account of it  our hapless brother had appealed to clemens as he had to me with the facts but not asking our help probably because he knew he need not ask and clemens enclosed to me a very takingbythethroat message which he proposed sending to the false friend  for once i had some sense and answered that this would never do for we had really no power in the matter and i contrived a letter to the recreant so softly diplomatic that i shall always think of it with pride when my honesties no longer give me satisfaction saying that this incident had come to our knowledge and suggesting that we felt sure he would not finally wish to withhold the money  nothing more practically than that but that was enough there came promptly back a letter of justification covering a very substantial check which we hilariously forwarded to our beneficiary  but the helpless man who was so used to being helped did not answer with the gladness i at least expected of him  he acknowledged the check as he would any ordinary payment and then he made us observe that there was still a large sum due him out of the moneys withheld  at this point i proposed to clemens that we should let the nonchalant victim collect the remnant himself  clouds of sorrow had gathered about the bowed head of the delinquent since we began on him and my fickle sympathies were turning his way from the victim who was really to blame for leaving his affairs so unguardedly to him in the first place  clemens made some sort of grit assent and we dropped the matter  he was more used to ingratitude from those he helped than i was who found being lain down upon not so amusing as he found my revolt  he reckoned i was right he said and after that i think we never recurred to the incident  it was not ingratitude that he ever minded it was treachery that really maddened him past forgiveness     xxiii  during the summer he spent at york harbor i was only forty minutes away at kittery point and we saw each other often but this was before the last time at riverdale  he had a wide low cottage in a pine grove overlooking york river and we used to sit at a corner of the veranda farthest away from mrs clemenss window where we could read our manuscripts to each other and tell our stories and laugh our hearts out without disturbing her  at first she had been about the house and there was one gentle afternoon when she made tea for us in the parlor but that was the last time i spoke with her  after that it was really a question of how soonest and easiest she could be got back to riverdale but of course there were specious delays in which she seemed no worse and seemed a little better and clemens could work at a novel he had begun he had taken a room in the house of a friend and neighbor a fisherman and boatman there was a table where he could write and a bed where he could lie down and read and there unless my memory has played me one of those constructive tricks that peoples memories indulge in he read me the first chapters of an admirable story  the scene was laid in a missouri town and the characters such as he had known in boyhood but as often as i tried to make him own it he denied having written any such story it is possible that i dreamed it but i hope the ms will yet be found  upon reflection i cannot believe that i dreamed it and i cannot believe that it was an effect of that sort of pseudomnemonics which i have mentioned  the characters in the novel are too clearly outlined in my recollection together with some critical reservations of my own concerning them  not only does he seem to have read me those first chapters but to have talked them over with me and outlined the whole story  i cannot say whether or not he believed that his wife would recover he fought the fear of her death to the end for her life was far more largely his than the lives of most mens wives are theirs  for his own life i believe he would never have much cared if i may trust a saying of one who was so absolutely without pose as he was  he said that he never saw a dead man whom he did not envy for having had it over and being done with it  life had always amused him and in the resurgence of its interests after his sorrow had ebbed away he was again deeply interested in the world and in the human race which though damned abounded in subjects of curious inquiry  when the time came for his wifes removal from york harbor i went with him to boston where he wished to look up the best means of her conveyance to new york  the inquiry absorbed him the sort of invalid car he could get how she could be carried to the village station how the car could be detached from the eastern train at boston and carried round to the southern train on the other side of the city and then how it could be attached to the hudson river train at new york and left at riverdale  there was no particular of the business which he did not scrutinize and master not only with his poignant concern for her welfare but with his strong curiosity as to how these unusual things were done with the usual means  with the inertness that grows upon an aging man he had been used to delegating more and more things but of that thing i perceived that he would not delegate the least detail  he had meant never to go abroad again but when it came time to go he did not look forward to returning he expected to live in florence always after that they were used to the life and they had been happy there some years earlier before he went with his wife for the cure of nauheim  but when he came home again it was for good and all  it was natural that he should wish to live in new york where they had already had a pleasant year in tenth street  i used to see him there in an upper room looking south over a quiet open space of back yards where we fought our battles in behalf of the filipinos and the boers and he carried on his campaign against the missionaries in china  he had not yet formed his habit of lying for whole days in bed and reading and writing there yet he was a good deal in bed from weakness i suppose and for the mere comfort of it  my perspectives are not very clear and in the foreshortening of events which always takes place in our review of the past i may not always time things aright  but i believe it was not until he had taken his house at 21 fifth avenue that he began to talk to me of writing his autobiography he meant that it should be a perfectly veracious record of his life and period for the first time in literature there should be a true history of a man and a true presentation of the men the man had known  as we talked it over the scheme enlarged itself in our riotous fancy  we said it should be not only a book it should be a library not only a library but a literature  it should make good the worlds loss through omars barbarity at alexandria there was no image so grotesque so extravagant that we did not play with it and the work so far as he carried it was really done on a colossal scale  but one day he said that as to veracity it was a failure he had begun to lie and that if no man ever yet told the truth about himself it was because no man ever could  how far he had carried his autobiography i cannot say he dictated the matter several hours each day and the public has already seen long passages from it and can judge probably of the make and matter of the whole from these it is immensely inclusive and it observes no order or sequence  whether now after his death it will be published soon or late i have no means of knowing  once or twice he said in a vague way that it was not to be published for twenty years so that the discomfort of publicity might be minimized for all the survivors  suddenly he told me he was not working at it but i did not understand whether he had finished it or merely dropped it i never asked  we lived in the same city but for old men rather far apart he at tenth street and i at seventieth and with our colds and other disabilities we did not see each other often  he expected me to come to him and i would not without some return of my visits but we never ceased to be friends and good friends so far as i know  i joked him once as to how i was going to come out in his autobiography and he gave me some sort of joking reassurance  there was one incident however that brought us very frequently and actively together  he came one sunday afternoon to have me call with him on maxim gorky who was staying at a hotel a few streets above mine  we were both interested in gorky clemens rather more as a revolutionist and i as a realist though i too wished the russian tsar ill and the novelist well in his mission to the russian sympathizers in this republic  but i had lived through the episode of kossuths visit to us and his vain endeavor to raise funds for the hungarian cause in 1851 when we were a younger and nobler nation than now with hearts if not hands opener to the oppressed of europe the oppressed of america the four or five millions of slaves we did not count  i did not believe that gorky could get the money for the cause of freedom in russia which he had come to get as i told a valued friend of his and mine i did not believe he could get twentyfive hundred dollars and i think now i set the figure too high  i had already refused to sign the sort of general appeal his friends were making to our principles and pockets because i felt it so wholly idle and when the paper was produced in gorkys presence and clemens put his name to it i still refused  the next day gorky was expelled from his hotel with the woman who was not his wife but who i am bound to say did not look as if she were not at least to me who am however not versed in those aspects of human nature  i might have escaped unnoted but clemenss familiar head gave us away to the reporters waiting at the elevators mouth for all who went to see gorky  as it was a hunt of interviewers ensued for us severally and jointly  i could remain aloof in my hotel apartment returning answer to such guardians of the public right to know everything that i had nothing to say of gorkys domestic affairs for the public interest had now strayed far from the revolution and centred entirely upon these  but with clemens it was different he lived in a house with a street door kept by a single butler and he was constantly rung for  i forget how long the siege lasted but long enough for us to have fun with it  that was the moment of the great vesuvian eruption and we figured ourselves in easy reach of a volcano which was every now and then blowing a cone off as the telegraphic phrase was  the roof of the great market in naples had just broken in under its load of ashes and cinders and crashed hundreds of people and we asked each other if we were not sorry we had not been there where the pressure would have been far less terrific than it was with us in fifth avenue  the forbidden butler came up with a message that there were some gentlemen below who wanted to see clemens  how many he demanded  five the butler faltered  reporters  the butler feigned uncertainty  what would you do he asked me  i wouldnt see them i said and then clemens went directly down to them  how or by what means he appeased their voracity i cannot say but i fancy it was by the confession of the exact truth which was harmless enough  they went away joyfully and he came back in radiant satisfaction with having seen them  of course he was right and i wrong and he was right as to the point at issue between gorky and those who had helplessly treated him with such cruel ignominy  in america it is not the convention for men to live openly in hotels with women who are not their wives  gorky had violated this convention and he had to pay the penalty and concerning the destruction of his efficiency as an emissary of the revolution his blunder was worse than a crime     xxiv  to the period of clemenss residence in fifth avenue belongs his efflorescence in white serge  he was always rather aggressively indifferent about dress and at a very early date in our acquaintance aldrich and i attempted his reform by clubbing to buy him a cravat but he would not put away his stiff little black bow and until he imagined the suit of white serge he wore always a suit of black serge truly deplorable in the cut of the sagging frock  after his measure had once been taken he refused to make his clothes the occasion of personal interviews with his tailor he sent the stuff by the kind elderly woman who had been in the service of the family from the earliest days of his marriage and accepted the result without criticism  but the white serge was an inspiration which few men would have had the courage to act upon the first time i saw him wear it was at the authors hearing before the congressional committee on copyright in washington  nothing could have been more dramatic than the gesture with which he flung off his long loose overcoat and stood forth in white from his feet to the crown of his silvery head  it was a magnificent coup and he dearly loved a coup but the magnificent speech which he made tearing to shreds the venerable farrago of nonsense about nonproperty in ideas which had formed the basis of all copyright legislation made you forget even his spectacularity  it is well known how proud he was of his oxford gown not merely because it symbolized the honor in which he was held by the highest literary body in the world but because it was so rich and so beautiful  the red and the lavender of the cloth flattered his eyes as the silken black of the same degree of doctor of letters given him years before at yale could not do  his frank defiant happiness in it mixed with a due sense of burlesque was something that those lacking his poetsoul could never imagine they accounted it vain weak but that would not have mattered to him if he had known it  in his london sojourn he had formed the top hat habit and for a while he lounged splendidly up and down fifth avenue in that society emblem but he seemed to tire of it and to return kindly to the soft hat of his southwestern tradition  he disliked clubs i dont know whether he belonged to any in new york but i never met him in one  as i have told he himself had formed the human race club but as he never could get it together it hardly counted there was to have been a meeting of it the time of my only visit to stormfield in april of last year but of three who were to have come i alone came  we got on very well without the absentees after finding them in the wrong as usual and the visit was like those i used to have with him so many years before in hartford but there was not the old ferment of subjects  many things had been discussed and put away for good but we had our old fondness for nature and for each other who were so differently parts of it  he showed his absolute content with his house and that was the greater pleasure for me because it was my son who designed it  the architect had been so fortunate as to be able to plan it where a natural avenue of savins the closeknit slender cypresslike cedars of new england led away from the rear of the villa to the little level of a pergola meant some day to be wreathed and roofed with vines but in the early spring days all the landscape was in the beautiful nakedness of the northern winter  it opened in the surpassing loveliness of wooded and meadowed uplands under skies that were the first days blue and the last gray over a rainy and then a snowy floor  we walked up and down up and down between the villa terrace and the pergola and talked with the melancholy amusement the sad tolerance of age for the sort of men and things that used to excite us or enrage us now we were far past turbulence or anger  once we took a walk together across the yellow pastures to a chasmal creek on his grounds where the ice still knit the clayey banks together like crystal mosses and the stream far down clashed through and over the stones and the shards of ice  clemens pointed out the scenery he had bought to give himself elbowroom and showed me the lot he was going to have me build on  the next day we came again with the geologist he had asked up to stormfield to analyze its rocks  truly he loved the place though he had been so weary of change and so indifferent to it that he never saw it till he came to live in it he left it all to the architect whom he had known from a child in the intimacy which bound our families together though we bodily lived far enough apart  i loved his little ones and he was sweet to mine and was their delightedin and wonderedat friend  once and once again and yet again and again the black shadow that shall never be lifted where it falls fell in his house and in mine during the forty years and more that we were friends and endeared us the more to each other     xxv  my visit at stormfield came to an end with tender relucting on his part and on mine  every morning before i dressed i heard him sounding my name through the house for the fun of it and i know for the fondness and if i looked out of my door there he was in his long nightgown swaying up and down the corridor and wagging his great white head like a boy that leaves his bed and comes out in the hope of frolic with some one  the last morning a soft sugarsnow had fallen and was falling and i drove through it down to the station in the carriage which had been given him by his wifes father when they were first married and been kept all those intervening years in honorable retirement for this final use  its springs had not grown yielding with time it had rather the stiffness and severity of age but for him it must have swung low like the sweet chariot of the negro spiritual which i heard him sing with such fervor when those wonderful hymns of the slaves began to make their way northward  go down daniel was one in which i can hear his quavering tenor now  he was a lover of the things he liked and full of a passion for them which satisfied itself in reading them matchlessly aloud  no one could read uncle remus like him his voice echoed the voices of the negro nurses who told his childhood the wonderful tales  i remember especially his rapture with mr cables old creole days and the thrilling force with which he gave the forbidding of the lepers brother when the citys survey ran the course of an avenue through the cottage where the leper lived in hiding strit must not pass  out of a nature rich and fertile beyond any i have known the material given him by the mystery that makes a man and then leaves him to make himself over he wrought a character of high nobility upon a foundation of clear and solid truth  at the last day he will not have to confess anything for all his life was the free knowledge of any one who would ask him of it  the searcher of hearts will not bring him to shame at that day for he did not try to hide any of the things for which he was often so bitterly sorry  he knew where the responsibility lay and he took a mans share of it bravely but not the less fearlessly he left the rest of the answer to the god who had imagined men  it is in vain that i try to give a notion of the intensity with which he pierced to the heart of life and the breadth of vision with which he compassed the whole world and tried for the reason of things and then left trying  we had other meetings insignificantly sad and brief but the last time i saw him alive was made memorable to me by the kind clear judicial sense with which he explained and justified the laborunions as the sole present help of the weak against the strong  next i saw him dead lying in his coffin amid those flowers with which we garland our despair in that pitiless hour  after the voice of his old friend twichell had been lifted in the prayer which it wailed through in brokenhearted supplication i looked a moment at the face i knew so well and it was patient with the patience i had so often seen in it something of puzzle a great silent dignity an assent

writer is conscious of and it is in this doubt that the writer wishes to offer a word of explanation  he owns as he must that they have every appearance of a group of desultory sketches and essays without palpable relation to one another or superficial allegiance to any central motive  yet he ventures to hope that the reader who makes his way through them will be aware in the retrospect of something like this relation and this allegiance  for my own part if i am to identify myself with the writer who is here on his defence i have never been able to see much difference between what seemed to me literature and what seemed to me life  if i did not find life in what professed to be literature i disabled its profession and possibly from this habit now inveterate with me i am never quite sure of life unless i find literature in it  unless the thing seen reveals to me an intrinsic poetry and puts on phrases that clothe it pleasingly to the imagination i do not much care for it but if it will do this i do not mind how poor or common or squalid it shows at first glance it challenges my curiosity and keeps my sympathy  instantly i love it and wish to share my pleasure in it with some one else or as many ones else as i can get to look or listen  if the thing is something read rather than seen i am not anxious about the matter if it is like life i know that it is poetry and take it to my heart  there can be no offence in it for which its truth will not make me amends  out of this way of thinking and feeling about these two great things about literature and life there may have arisen a confusion as to which is which  but i do not wish to part them and in their union i have found since i learned my letters a joy in them both which i hope will last till i forget my letters                so was it when my life began                so is it now i am a man                so be it when i shall grow old  it is the rainbow in the sky for me and i have seldom seen a sky without some bit of rainbow in it  sometimes i can make others see it sometimes not but i always like to try and if i fail i harbor no worse thought of them than that they have not had their eyes examined and fitted with glasses which would at least have helped their vision  as to the where and when of the different papers in which i suppose their bibliography properly lies i need not be very exact  the man of letters as a man of business was written in a hotel at lakewood in the may of 1892 or 1893 and pretty promptly printed in scribners magazine confessions of a summer colonist was done at york harbor in the fall of 1898 for the atlantic monthly and was a study of life at that pleasant resort as it was livedin the idyllic times of the earlier settlement long before motors and almost before private carriages american literary centres american literature in exile puritanism in american fiction politics of american authors were with three or four other papers the endeavors of the american correspondent of the london timess literary supplement to enlighten the british understanding as to our ways of thinking and writing eleven years ago and are here left to bear the defects of the qualities of their obsolete actuality in the year 1899  most of the studies and sketches are from an extinct department of life and letters which i invented for harpers weekly and operated for a year or so toward the close of the nineteenth century  notable among these is the last days in a dutch hotel which was written at paris in 1897 it is rather a favorite of mine perhaps because i liked holland so much others which more or less personally recognize effects of sojourn in new york or excursions into new england are from the same department several may be recalled by the longer memoried reader as papers from the editors easy chair in harpers monthly wild flowers of the asphalt is the review of an ever delightful book which i printed in harpers bazar the editors relations with the young contributor was my endeavor in youths companion to shed a kindly light from my experience in both seats upon the toooften and too needlessly embittered souls of literary beginners  so it goes as to the motives and origins of the collection which may persist in disintegrating under the readers eye in spite of my well meant endeavors to establish a solidarity for it  the group at least attests even in this event the wide the wild variety of my literary production in time and space  from the beginning the journalists independence of the scholars solitude and seclusion has remained with me and though i am fond enough of a bookish entourage of the serried volumes of the library shelves and the inviting breadth of the library table i am not disabled by the hard conditions of a bedroom in a summer hotel or the narrow possibilities of a candlestand without a dictionary in the whole house or a book of reference even in the running brooks outside                                              w d howells                                 literature and life    the man of letters as a man of business  i think that every man ought to work for his living without exception and that when he has once avouched his willingness to work society should provide him with work and warrant him a living  i do not think any man ought to live by an art  a mans art should be his privilege when he has proven his fitness to exercise it and has otherwise earned his daily bread and its results should be free to all  there is an instinctive sense of this even in the midst of the grotesque confusion of our economic being people feel that there is something profane something impious in taking money for a picture or a poem or a statue most of all the artist himself feels this  he puts on a bold front with the world to be sure and brazens it out as business but he knows very well that there is something false and vulgar in it and that the work which cannot be truly priced in money cannot be truly paid in money he can of course say that the priest takes money for reading the marriage service for christening the newborn babe and for saying the last office for the dead that the physician sells healing that justice itself is paid for and that he is merely a party to the thing that is and must be  he can say that as the thing is unless he sells his art he cannot live that society will leave him to starve if he does not hit its fancy in a picture or a poem or a statue and all this is bitterly true  he is and he must be only too glad if there is a market for his wares  without a market for his wares he must perish or turn to making something that will sell better than pictures or poems or statues all the same the sin and the shame remain and the averted eye sees them still with its inward vision  many will make believe otherwise but i would rather not make believe otherwise and in trying to write of literature as business i am tempted to begin by saying that business is the opprobrium of literature   i  literature is at once the most intimate and the most articulate of the arts  it cannot impart its effect through the senses or the nerves as the other arts can it is beautiful only through the intelligence it is the mind speaking to the mind until it has been put into absolute terms of an invariable significance it does not exist at all  it cannot awaken this emotion in one and that in another if it fails to express precisely the meaning of the author if it does not say him it says nothing and is nothing  so that when a poet has put his heart much or little into a poem and sold it to a magazine the scandal is greater than when a painter has sold a picture to a patron or a sculptor has modelled a statue to order  these are artists less articulate and less intimate than the poet they are more exterior to their work they are less personally in it they part with less of themselves in the dicker it does not change the nature of the case to say that tennyson and longfellow and emerson sold the poems in which they couched the most mystical messages their genius was charged to bear mankind  they submitted to the conditions which none can escape but that does not justify the conditions which are none the less the conditions of hucksters because they are imposed upon poets  if it will serve to make my meaning a little clearer we will suppose that a poet has been crossed in love or has suffered some real sorrow like the loss of a wife or child  he pours out his broken heart in verse that shall bring tears of sacred sympathy from his readers and an editor pays him a hundred dollars for the right of bringing his verse to their notice  it is perfectly true that the poem was not written for these dollars but it is perfectly true that it was sold for them  the poet must use his emotions to pay his provision bills he has no other means society does not propose to pay his bills for him  yet and at the end of the ends the unsophisticated witness finds the transaction ridiculous finds it repulsive finds it shabby  somehow he knows that if our huckstering civilization did not at every moment violate the eternal fitness of things the poets song would have been given to the world and the poet would have been cared for by the whole human brotherhood as any man should be who does the duty that every man owes it  the instinctive sense of the dishonor which moneypurchase does to art is so strong that sometimes a man of letters who can pay his way otherwise refuses pay for his work as lord byron did for a while from a noble pride and as count tolstoy has tried to do from a noble conscience but byrons publisher profited by a generosity which did not reach his readers and the countess tolstoy collects the copyright which her husband foregoes so that these two eminent instances of protest against business in literature may be said not to have shaken its money basis i know of no others but there may be many that i am culpably ignorant of  still i doubt if there are enough to affect the fact that literature is business as well as art and almost as soon  at present business is the only human solidarity we are all bound together with that chain whatever interests and tastes and principles separate us and i feel quite sure that in writing of the man of letters as a man of business i shall attract far more readers than i should in writing of him as an artist  besides as an artist he has been done a great deal already and a commercial state like ours has really more concern in him as a business man  perhaps it may sometime be different i do not believe it will till the conditions are different and that is a long way off     ii  in the mean time i confidently appeal to the readers imagination with the fact that there are several men of letters among us who are such good men of business that they can command a hundred dollars a thousand words for all they write  it is easy to write a thousand words a day and supposing one of these authors to work steadily it can be seen that his net earnings during the year would come to some such sum as the president of the united states gets for doing far less work of a much more perishable sort  if the man of letters were wholly a business man this is what would happen he would make his forty or fifty thousand dollars a year and be able to consort with bank presidents and railroad officials and rich tradesmen and other flowers of our plutocracy on equal terms  but unfortunately from a business point of view he is also an artist and the very qualities that enable him to delight the public disable him from delighting it uninterruptedly  no rose blooms right along as the english boys at oxford made an american collegian say in a theme which they imagined for him in his national parlance and the man of letters as an artist is apt to have times and seasons when he cannot blossom  very often it shall happen that his mind will lie fallow between novels or stories for weeks and months at a stretch when the suggestions of the friendly editor shall fail to fruit in the essays or articles desired when the muse shall altogether withhold herself or shall respond only in a feeble dribble of verse which he might sell indeed but which it would not be good business for him to put on the market  but supposing him to be a very diligent and continuous worker and so happy as to have fallen on a theme that delights him and bears him along he may please himself so ill with the result of his labors that he can do nothing less in artistic conscience than destroy a days work a weeks work a months work  i know one man of letters who wrote today and tore up tomorrow for nearly a whole summer  but even if part of the mistaken work may be saved because it is good work out of place and not intrinsically bad the task of reconstruction wants almost as much time as the production and then when all seems done comes the anxious and endless process of revision  these drawbacks reduce the earning capacity of what i may call the highcost man of letters in such measure that an author whose name is known everywhere and whose reputation is commensurate with the boundaries of his country if it does not transcend them shall have the income say of a rising young physician known to a few people in a subordinate city  in view of this fact so humiliating to an author in the presence of a nation of business men like ours i do not know that i can establish the man of letters in the popular esteem as very much of a business man after all  he must still have a low rank among practical people and he will be regarded by the great mass of americans as perhaps a little off a little funny a little soft  perhaps not and yet i would rather not have a consensus of public opinion on the question i think i am more comfortable without it   iii  there is this to be said in defence of men of letters on the business side that literature is still an infant industry with us and so far from having been protected by our laws it was exposed for ninety years after the foundation of the republic to the vicious competition of stolen goods  it is true that we now have the international copyright law at last and we can at least begin to forget our shame but literary property has only fortytwo years of life under our unjust statutes and if it is attacked by robbers the law does not seek out the aggressors and punish them as it would seek out and punish the trespassers upon any other kind of property it leaves the aggrieved owner to bring suit against them and recover damages if he can  this may be right enough in itself but i think then that all property should be defended by civil suit and should become public after fortytwo years of private tenure  the constitution guarantees us all equality before the law but the lawmakers seem to have forgotten this in the case of our literary industry  so long as this remains the case we cannot expect the best business talent to go into literature and the man of letters must keep his present low grade among business men  as i have hinted it is but a little while that he has had any standing at all  i may say that it is only since the civil war that literature has become a business with us  before that time we had authors and very good ones it is astonishing how good they were but i do not remember any of them who lived by literature except edgar a poe perhaps and we all know how he lived it was largely upon loans  they were either men of fortune or they were editors or professors with salaries or incomes apart from the small gains of their pens or they were helped out with public offices one need not go over their names or classify them  some of them must have made money by their books but i question whether any one could have lived even very simply upon the money his books brought him  no one could do that now unless he wrote a book that we could not recognize as a work of literature  but many authors live now and live prettily enough by the sale of the serial publication of their writings to the magazines  they do not live so nicely as successful tradespeople of course or as men in the other professions when they begin to make themselves names the high state of brokers bankers railroad operators and the like is in the nature of the case beyond their fondest dreams of pecuniary affluence and social splendor  perhaps they do not want the chief seats in the synagogue it is certain they do not get them  still they do very fairly well as things go and several have incomes that would seem riches to the great mass of worthy americans who work with their hands for a livingwhen they can get the work  their incomes are mainly from serial publication in the different magazines and the prosperity of the magazines has given a whole class existence which as a class was wholly unknown among us before the civil war  it is not only the famous or fully recognized authors who live in this way but the much larger number of clever people who are as yet known chiefly to the editors and who may never make themselves a public but who do well a kind of acceptable work  these are the sort who do not get reprinted from the periodicals but the better recognized authors do get reprinted and then their serial work in its completed form appeals to the readers who say they do not read serials  the multitude of these is not great and if an author rested his hopes upon their favor he would be a much more imbittered man than he now generally is  but he understands perfectly well that his reward is in the serial and not in the book the return from that he may count as so much money found in the roada few hundreds a very few thousands at the most unless he is the author of an historical romance   iv  i doubt indeed whether the earnings of literary men are absolutely as great as they were earlier in the century in any of the englishspeaking countries relatively they are nothing like as great  scott had forty thousand dollars for woodstock which was not a very large novel and was by no means one of his best and forty thousand dollars then had at least the purchasing power of sixty thousand now  moore had three thousand guineas for lalla rookh but what publisher would be rash enough to pay fifteen thousand dollars for the masterpiece of a minor poet now  the book except in very rare instances makes nothing like the return to the author that the magazine makes and there are few leading authors who find their account in that form of publication those who do those who sell the most widely in book form are often not at all desired by editors with difficulty they get a serial accepted by any principal magazine  on the other hand there are authors whose books compared with those of the popular favorites do not sell and yet they are eagerly sought for by editors they are paid the highest prices and nothing that they offer is refused  these are literary artists and it ought to be plain from what i am saying that in belleslettres at least most of the best literature now first sees the light in the magazines and most of the secondbest appears first in book form  the oldfashioned people who flatter themselves upon their distinction in not reading magazine fiction or magazine poetry make a great mistake and simply class themselves with the public whose taste is so crude that they cannot enjoy the best  of course this is true mainly if not merely of belleslettres history science politics metaphysics in spite of the many excellent articles and papers in these sorts upon what used to be called various emergent occasions are still to be found at their best in books  the most monumental example of literature at once light and good which has first reached the public in book form is in the different publications of mark twain but mr clemens has of late turned to the magazines too and now takes their mintmark before he passes into general circulation  all this may change again but at present the magazineswe have no longer any reviews form the most direct approach to that part of our reading public which likes the highest things in literary art  their readers if we may judge from the quality of the literature they get are more refined than the book readers in our community and their taste has no doubt been cultivated by that of the disciplined and experienced editors  so far as i have known these they are men of aesthetic conscience and of generous sympathy  they have their preferences in the different kinds and they have their theory of what kind will be most acceptable to their readers but they exercise their selective function with the wish to give them the best things they can  i do not know one of themand it has been my good fortune to know them nearly allwho would print a wholly inferior thing for the sake of an inferior class of readers though they may sometimes decline a good thing because for one reason or another they believe it would not be liked  still even this does not often happen they would rather chance the good thing they doubted of than underrate their readers judgment  the young author who wins recognition in a firstclass magazine has achieved a double success first with the editor and then with the best reading public  many factitious and fallacious literary reputations have been made through books but very few have been made through the magazines which are not only the best means of living but of outliving with the author they are both bread and fame to him  if i insist a little upon the high office which this modern form of publication fulfils in the literary world it is because i am impatient of the antiquated and ignorant prejudice which classes the magazines as ephemeral  they are ephemeral in form but in substance they are not ephemeral and what is best in them awaits its resurrection in the book which as the first form is so often a lasting death  an interesting proof of the value of the magazine to literature is the fact that a good novel will often have wider acceptance as a book from having been a magazine serial   v  under the regime of the great literary periodicals the prosperity of literary men would be much greater than it actually is if the magazines were altogether literary  but they are not and this is one reason why literature is still the hungriest of the professions  twothirds of the magazines are made up of material which however excellent is without literary quality  very probably this is because even the highest class of readers who are the magazine readers have small love of pure literature which seems to have been growing less and less in all classes  i say seems because there are really no means of ascertaining the fact and it may be that the editors are mistaken in making their periodicals twothirds popular science politics economics and the timely topics which i will call contemporanics  but however that may be their efforts in this direction have narrowed the field of literary industry and darkened the hope of literary prosperity kindled by the unexampled prosperity of their periodicals  they pay very well indeed for literature they pay from five or six dollars a thousand words for the work of the unknown writer to a hundred and fifty dollars a thousand words for that of the most famous or the most popular if there is a difference between fame and popularity but they do not altogether want enough literature to justify the best business talent in devoting itself to belleslettres to fiction or poetry or humorous sketches of travel or light essays business talent can do far better in dry goods groceries drugs stocks real estate railroads and the like  i do not think there is any danger of a ruinous competition from it in the field which though narrow seems so rich to us poor fellows whose business talent is small at the best  the most of the material contributed to the magazines is the subject of agreement between the editor and the author it is either suggested by the author or is the fruit of some suggestion from the editor in any case the price is stipulated beforehand and it is no longer the custom for a wellknown contributor to leave the payment to the justice or the generosity of the publisher that was never a fair thing to either nor ever a wise thing  usually the price is so much a thousand words a truly odious method of computing literary value and one well calculated to make the author feel keenly the hatefulness of selling his art at all it is as if a painter sold his picture at so much a square inch or a sculptor bargained away a group of statuary by the pound  but it is a custom that you cannot always successfully quarrel with and most writers gladly consent to it if only the price a thousand words is large enough the sale to the editor means the sale of the serial rights only but if the publisher of the magazine is also a publisher of books the republication of the material is supposed to be his right unless there is an understanding to the contrary the terms for this are another affair  formerly something more could be got for the author by the simultaneous appearance of his work in an english magazine but now the great american magazines which pay far higher prices than any others in the world have a circulation in england so much exceeding that of any english periodical that the simultaneous publication can no longer be arranged for from this side though i believe it is still done here from the other side   vi  i think this is the case of authorship as it now stands with regard to the magazines  i am not sure that the case is in every way improved for young authors  the magazines all maintain a staff for the careful examination of manuscripts but as most of the material they print has been engaged the number of volunteer contributions that they can use is very small one of the greatest of them i know does not use fifty in the course of a year  the new writer then must be very good to be accepted and when accepted he may wait long before he is printed the pressure is so great in these avenues to the public favor that one two three years are no uncommon periods of delay  if the young writer has not the patience for this or has a soul above cooling his heels in the courts of fame or must do his best to earn something at once the book is his immediate hope  how slight a hope the book is i have tried to hint already but if a book is vulgar enough in sentiment and crude enough in taste and flashy enough in incident or better or worse still if it is a bit hot in the mouth and promises impropriety if not indecency there is a very fair chance of its success i do not mean success with a selfrespecting publisher but with the public which does not personally put its name to it and is not openly smirched by it i will not talk of that kind of book however but of the book which the young author has written out of an unspoiled heart and an untainted mind such as most young men and women write and i will suppose that it has found a publisher  it is human nature as competition has deformed human nature for the publisher to wish the author to take all the risks and he possibly proposes that the author shall publish it at his own expense and let him have a percentage of the retail price for managing it  if not that he proposes that the author shall pay for the stereotype plates and take fifteen per cent of the price of the book or if this will not go if the author cannot rather than will not do it he is commonly only too glad to do any thing he can then the publisher offers him ten per cent of the retail price after the first thousand copies have been sold  but if he fully believes in the book he will give ten per cent from the first copy sold and pay all the costs of publication himself  the book is to be retailed for a dollar and a half and the publisher is not displeased with a new book that sells fifteen hundred copies  whether the author has as much reason to be pleased is a question but if the book does not sell more he has only himself to blame and had better pocket in silence the two hundred and twentyfive dollars he gets for it and bless his publisher and try to find work somewhere at five dollars a week  the publisher has not made any more if quite as much as the author and until a book has sold two thousand copies the division is fair enough  after that the heavier expenses of manufacturing have been defrayed and the book goes on advertising itself there is merely the cost of paper printing binding and marketing to be met and the arrangement becomes fairer and fairer for the publisher the author has no right to complain of this in the case of his first book which he is only too grateful to get accepted at all  if it succeeds he has himself to blame for making the same arrangement for his second or third it is his fault or else it is his necessity which is practically the same thing  it will be business for the publisher to take advantage of his necessity quite the same as if it were his fault but i do not say that he will always do so i believe he will very often not do so  at one time there seemed a probability of the enlargement of the authors gains by subscription publication and one very wellknown american author prospered fabulously in that way  the percentage offered by the subscription houses was only about half as much as that paid by the trade but the sales were so much greater that the author could very well afford to take it  where the bookdealer sold ten the bookagent sold a hundred or at least he did so in the case of mark twains books and we all thought it reasonable he could do so with ours  such of us as made experiment of him however found the facts illogical  no book of literary quality was made to go by subscription except mr clemenss books and i think these went because the subscription public never knew what good literature they were  this sort of readers or buyers were so used to getting something worthless for their money that they would not spend it for artistic fiction or indeed for any fiction at all except mr clemenss which they probably supposed bad  some good books of travel had a measurable success through the bookagents but not at all the success that had been hoped for and i believe now the subscription trade again publishes only compilations or such works as owe more to the skill of the editor than the art of the writer  mr clemens himself no longer offers his books to the public in that way  it is not common i think in this country to publish on the half profits system but it is very common in england where owing probably to the moisture in the air which lends a fairy outline to every prospect it seems to be peculiarly alluring  one of my own early books was published there on these terms which i accepted with the insensate joy of the young author in getting any terms from a publisher  the book sold sold every copy of the small first edition and in due time the publishers statement came  i did not think my half of the profits was very great but it seemed a fair division after every imaginable cost had been charged up against my poor book and that frail venture had been made to pay the expenses of composition corrections paper printing binding advertising and editorial copies  the wonder ought to have been that there was anything at all coming to me but i was young and greedy then and i really thought there ought to have been more  i was disappointed but i made the best of it of course and took the account to the junior partner of the house which employed me and said that i should like to draw on him for the sum due me from the london publishers he said certainly but after a glance at the account he smiled and said he supposed i knew how much the sum was  i answered yes it was eleven pounds nine shillings was not it  but i owned at the same time that i never was good at figures and that i found english money peculiarly baffling  he laughed now and said it was eleven shillings and ninepence  in fact after all those charges for composition corrections paper printing binding advertising and editorial copies there was a most ingenious and wholly surprising charge of ten per cent commission on sales which reduced my half from pounds to shillings and handsomely increased the publishers half in proportion  i do not now dispute the justice of the charge  it was not the fault of the half profits system it was the fault of the glad young author who did not distinctly inform himself of its mysterious nature in agreeing to it and had only to reproach himself if he was finally disappointed  but there is always something disappointing in the accounts of publishers which i fancy is because authors are strangely constituted rather than because publishers are so  i will confess that i have such inordinate expectations of the sale of my books which i hope i think modestly of that the sales reported to me never seem great enough  the copyright due me no matter how handsome it is appears deplorably mean and i feel impoverished for several days after i get it  but then i ought to add that my balance in the bank is always much less than i have supposed it to be and my own checks when they come back to me have the air of having been in a conspiracy to betray me  no we literary men must learn no matter how we boast ourselves in business that the distress we feel from our publishers accounts is simply idiopathic and i for one wish to bear my witness to the constant good faith and uprightness of publishers  it is supposed that because they have the affair altogether in their hands they are apt to take advantage in it but this does not follow and as a matter of fact they have the affair no more in their own hands than any other business man you have an open account with  there is nothing to prevent you from looking at their books except your own innermost belief and fear that their books are correct and that your literature has brought you so little because it has sold so little  the author is not to blame for his superficial delusion to the contrary especially if he has written a book that has set every one talking because it is of a vital interest  it may be of a vital interest without being at all the kind of book people want to buy it may be the kind of book that they are content to know at second hand there are such fatal books but hearing so much and reading so much about it the author cannot help hoping that it has sold much more than the publisher says  the publisher is undoubtedly honest however and the author had better put away the comforting question of his integrity  the english writers seem largely to suspect their publishers but i believe that american authors when not flown with flattering reviews as largely trust theirs  of course there are rogues in every walk of life  i will not say that i ever personally met them in the flowery paths of literature but i have heard of other people meeting them there just as i have heard of people seeing ghosts and i have to believe in both the rogues and the ghosts without the witness of my own senses i suppose upon such grounds mainly that there are wicked publishers but in the case of our books that do not sell i am afraid that it is the graceless and inappreciative public which is far more to blame than the wickedest of the publishers  it is true that publishers will drive a hard bargain when they can or when they must but there is nothing to hinder an author from driving a hard bargain too when he can or when he must and it is to be said of the publisher that he is always more willing to abide by the bargain when it is made than the author is perhaps because he has the best of it  but he has not always the best of it i have known publishers too generous to take advantage of the innocence of authors and i fancy that if publishers had to do with any race less diffident than authors they would have won a repute for unselfishness that they do now now enjoy  it is certain that in the long period when we flew the black flag of piracy there were many among our corsairs on the high seas of literature who paid a fair price for the stranger craft they seized still oftener they removed the cargo and released their capture with several weeks provision and although there was undoubtedly a good deal of actual throatcutting and scuttling still i feel sure that there was less of it than there would have been in any other line of business released to the unrestricted plunder of the neighbor  there was for a long time even a comity among these amiable buccaneers who agreed not to interfere with each other and so were enabled to pay over to their victims some portion of the profit from their stolen goods  of all business men publishers are probably the most faithful and honorable and are only surpassed in virtue when men of letters turn business men   vii  publishers have their little theories their little superstitions and their blind faith in the great god chance which we all worship  these things lead them into temptation and adversity but they seem to do fairly well as business men even in their own behalf  they do not make above the usual ninetyfive per cent of failures and more publishers than authors get rich  some theories or superstitions publishers and authors share together one of these is that it is best to keep your books all in the hands of one publisher if you can because then he can give them more attention and sell more of them  but my own experience is that when my books were in the hands of three publishers they sold quite as well as when one had them and a fellowauthor whom i approached in question of this venerable belief laughed at it  this bold heretic held that it was best to give each new book to a new publisher for then the fresh man put all his energies into pushing it but if you had them all together the publisher rested in a vain security that one book would sell another and that the fresh venture would revive the public interest in the stale ones i never knew this to happen and i must class it with the superstitions of the trade  it may be so in other and more constant countries but in our fickle republic each last book has to fight its own way to public favor much as if it had no sort of literary lineage  of course this is stating it rather largely and the truth will be found inside rather than outside of my statement but there is at least truth enough in it to give the young author pause  while one is preparing to sell his basket of glass he may as well ask himself whether it is better to part with all to one dealer or not and if he kicks it over in spurning the imaginary customer who asks the favor of taking the entire stock that will be his fault and not the fault of the customer  however the most important question of all with the man of letters as a man of business is what kind of book will sell the best of itself because at the end of the ends a book sells itself or does not sell at all kissing after long ages of reasoning and a great deal of culture still goes by favor and though innumerable generations of horses have been led to the water not one horse has yet been made to drink  with the best or the worst will in the world no publisher can force a book into acceptance  advertising will not avail and reviewing is notoriously futile  if the book does not strike the popular fancy or deal with some universal interest which need by no means be a profound or important one the drums and the cymbals shall be beaten in vain  the book may be one of the best and wisest books in the world but if it has not this sort of appeal in it the readers of it and worse yet the purchasers will remain few though fit  the secret of this like most other secrets of a rather ridiculous world is in the awful keeping of fate and we can only hope to surprise it by some lucky chance  to plan a surprise of it to aim a book at the public favor is the most hopeless of all endeavors as it is one of the unworthiest and i can neither as a man of letters nor as a man of business counsel the young author to do it  the best that you can do is to write the book that it gives you the most pleasure to write to put as much heart and soul as you have about you into it and then hope as hard as you can to reach the heart and soul of the great multitude of your fellowmen that and that alone is good business for a man of letters  the man of letters must make up his mind that in the united states the fate of a book is in the hands of the women  it is the women with us who have the most leisure and they read the most books  they are far better educated for the most part than our men and their tastes if not their minds are more cultivated  our men read the newspapers but our women read the books the more refined among them read the magazines  if they do not always know what is good they do know what pleases them and it is useless to quarrel with their decisions for there is no appeal from them  to go from them to the men would be going from a higher to a lower court which would be honestly surprised and bewildered if the thing were possible  as i say the author of light literature and often the author of solid literature must resign himself to obscurity unless the ladies choose to recognize him  yet it would be impossible to forecast their favor for this kind or that  who could prophesy it for another who guess it for himself  we must strive blindly for it and hope somehow that our best will also be our prettiest but we must remember at the same time that it is not the ladies man who is the favorite of the ladies  there are of course a few a very few of our greatest authors who have striven forward to the first place in our valhalla without the help of the largest readingclass among us but i should say that these were chiefly the humorists for whom women are said nowhere to have any warm liking and who have generally with us come up through the newspapers and have never lost the favor of the newspaper readers  they have become literary men as it were without the newspaper readers knowing it but those who have approached literature from another direction have won fame in it chiefly by grace of the women who first read them and then made their husbands and fathers read them  perhaps then and as a matter of business it would be well for a serious author when he finds that he is not pleasing the women and probably never will please them to turn humorous author and aim at the countenance of the men  except as a humorist he certainly never will get it for your american when he is not making money or trying to do it is making a joke or trying to do it   viii  i hope that i have not been hinting that the author who approaches literature through journalism is not as fine and high a literary man as the author who comes directly to it or through some other avenue i have not the least notion of condemning myself by any such judgment  but i think it is pretty certain that fewer and fewer authors are turning from journalism to literature though the entente cordiale between the two professions seems as great as ever  i fancy though i may be as mistaken in this as i am in a good many other things that most journalists would have been literary men if they could at the beginning and that the kindness they almost always show to young authors is an effect of the selfpity they feel for their own thwarted wish to be authors  when an author is once warm in the saddle and is riding his winged horse to glory the case is different they have then often no sentiment about him he is no longer the image of their own young aspiration and they would willingly see pegasus buck under him or have him otherwise brought to grief and shame  they are apt to gird at him for his unhallowed gains and they would be quite right in this if they proposed any way for him to live without them as i have allowed at the outset the gains are unhallowed  apparently it is unseemly for two or three authors to be making half as much by their pens as popular ministers often receive in salary the public is used to the pecuniary prosperity of some of the clergy and at least sees nothing droll in it but the paragrapher can always get a smile out of his readers at the gross disparity between the ten thousand dollars jones gets for his novel and the five pounds milton got for his epic  i have always thought milton was paid too little but i will own that he ought not to have been paid at all if it comes to that  again i say that no man ought to live by any art it is a shame to the art if not to the artist but as yet there is no means of the artists living otherwise and continuing an artist  the literary man has certainly no complaint to make of the newspaper man generally speaking  i have often thought with amazement of the kindness shown by the press to our whole unworthy craft and of the help so lavishly and freely given to rising and even risen authors  to put it coarsely brutally i do not suppose that any other business receives so much gratuitous advertising except the theatre  it is enormous the space given in the newspapers to literary notes literary announcements reviews interviews personal paragraphs biographies and all the rest not to mention the vigorous and incisive attacks made from time to time upon different authors for their opinions of romanticism realism capitalism socialism catholicism and sandemanianism  i have sometimes doubted whether the public cared for so much of it all as the editors gave them but i have always said this under my breath and i have thankfully taken my share of the common bounty  a curious fact however is that this vast newspaper publicity seems to have very little to do with an authors popularity though ever so much with his notoriety some of those strange subterranean fellows who never come to the surface in the newspapers except for a contemptuous paragraph at long intervals outsell the famousest of the celebrities and secretly have their horses and yachts and country seats while immodest merit is left to get about on foot and look up summerboard at the cheaper hotels  that is probably right or it would not happen it seems to be in the general scheme like millionairism and pauperism but it becomes a question then whether the newspapers with all their friendship for literature and their actual generosity to literary men can really help one much to fortune however much they help one to fame  such a question is almost too dreadful and though i have asked it i will not attempt to answer it  i would much rather consider the question whether if the newspapers can make an author they can also unmake him and i feel pretty safe in saying that i do not think they can  the afreet once out of the bottle can never be coaxed back or cudgelled back and the author whom the newspapers have made cannot be unmade by the newspapers  perhaps he could if they would let him alone but the art of letting alone the creature of your favor when he has forfeited your favor is yet in its infancy with the newspapers  they consign him to oblivion with a rumor that fills the land and they keep visiting him there with an uproar which attracts more and more notice to him  an author who has long enjoyed their favor suddenly and rather mysteriously loses it through his opinions on certain matters of literary taste say  for the space of five or six years he is denounced with a unanimity and an incisive vigor that ought to convince him there is something wrong  if he thinks it is his censors he clings to his opinions with an abiding constancy while ridicule obloquy caricature burlesque critical refutation and personal detraction follow unsparingly upon every expression for instance of his belief that romantic fiction is the highest form of fiction and that the base sordid photographic commonplace school of tolstoy tourgunief zola hardy and james is unworthy a moments comparison with the school of rider haggard  all this ought certainly to unmake the author in question but this is not really the effect  slowly but surely the clamor dies away and the author without relinquishing one of his wicked opinions or in any wise showing himself repentant remains apparently whole and he even returns in a measure to the old kindnessnot indeed to the earlier day of perfectly smooth things but certainly to as much of it as he merits  i would not have the young author from this imaginary case believe that it is well either to court or to defy the good opinion of the press  in fact it will not only be better taste but it will be better business for him to keep it altogether out of his mind  there is only one whom he can safely try to please and that is himself  if he does this he will very probably please other people but if he does not please himself he may be sure that he will not please them the book which he has not enjoyed writing no one will enjoy reading  still i would not have him attach too little consequence to the influence of the press  i should say let him take the celebrity it gives him gratefully but not too seriously let him reflect that he is often the necessity rather than the ideal of the paragrapher and that the notoriety the journalists bestow upon him is not the measure of their acquaintance with his work far less his meaning  they are good fellows those hardpushed poor fellows of the press but the very conditions of their censure friendly or unfriendly forbid it thoroughness and it must often have more zeal than knowledge in it   ix  there are some sorts of light literature once greatly in demand but now apparently no longer desired by magazine editors who ought to know what their readers desire  among these is the travel sketch to me a very agreeable kind and really to be regretted in its decline  there are some reasons for its decline besides a change of taste in readers and a possible surfeit  travel itself has become so universal that everybody in a manner has been everywhere and the foreign scene has no longer the charm of strangeness  we do not think the old world either so romantic or so ridiculous as we used and perhaps from an instinctive perception of this altered mood writers no longer appeal to our sentiment or our humor with sketches of outlandish people and places  of course this can hold true only in a general way the thing is still done but not nearly so much done as formerly  when one thinks of the long line of american writers who have greatly pleased in this sort and who even got their first fame in it one must grieve to see it obsolescent  irving curtis bayard taylor herman melville ross browne warner ik marvell longfellow lowell story mr james mr aldrich mr hay mrs hunt mr c w stoddard mark twain and many others whose names will not come to me at the moment have in their several ways richly contributed to our pleasure in it but i cannot now fancy a young author finding favor with an editor in a sketch of travel or a study of foreign manners and customs his work would have to be of the most signal importance and brilliancy to overcome the editors feeling that the thing had been done already and i believe that a publisher if offered a book of such things would look at it askance and plead the wellknown quiet of the trade  still i may be mistaken  i am rather more confident about the decline of another literary species namely the light essay  we have essays enough and to spare of certain soberer and severer sorts such as grapple with problems and deal with conditions but the kind that i mean the slightly humorous gentle refined and humane kind seems no longer to abound as it once did  i do not know whether the editor discourages them knowing his readers frame or whether they do not offer themselves but i seldom find them in the magazines  i certainly do not believe that if any one were now to write essays such as warners backlog studies an editor would refuse them and perhaps nobody really writes them  nobody seems to write the sort that colonel higginson formerly contributed to the periodicals or such as emerson wrote  without a great name behind it i am afraid that a volume of essays would find few buyers even after the essays had made a public in the magazines  there are of course instances to the contrary but they are not so many or so striking as to make me think that the essay could be offered as a good opening for business talent  i suspect that good poetry by wellknown hands was never better paid in the magazines than it is now  i must say too that i think the quality of the minor poetry of our day is better than that of twentyfive or thirty years ago  i could name half a score of young poets whose work from time to time gives me great pleasure by the reality of its feeling and the delicate perfection of its art but i will not name them for fear of passing over half a score of others equally meritorious  we have certainly no reason to be discouraged whatever reason the poets themselves have to be so and i do not think that even in the short story our younger writers are doing better work than they are doing in the slighter forms of verse  yet the notion of inviting business talent into this field would be as preposterous as that of asking it to devote itself to the essay  what book of verse by a recent poet if we except some such peculiarly gifted poet as mr whitcomb riley has paid its expenses not to speak of any profit to the author  of course it would be rather more offensive and ridiculous that it should do so than that any other form of literary art should do so and yet there is no more provision in our economic system for the support of the poet apart from his poems than there is for the support of the novelist apart from his novel  one could not make any more money by writing poetry than by writing history but it is a curious fact that while the historians have usually been rich men and able to afford the luxury of writing history the poets have usually been poor men with no pecuniary justification in their devotion to a calling which is so seldom an election  to be sure it can be said for them that it costs far less to set up poet than to set up historian  there is no outlay for copying documents or visiting libraries or buying books  in fact except as historian the man of letters in whatever walk has not only none of the expenses of other men of business but none of the expenses of other artists  he has no such outlay to make for materials or models or studio rent as the painter or the sculptor has and his income such as it is is immediate if he strikes the fancy of the editor with the first thing he offers as he very well may it is as well with him as with other men after long years of apprenticeship  although he will always be the better for an apprenticeship and the longer apprenticeship the better he may practically need none at all  such are the strange conditions of his acceptance with the public that he may please better without it than with it  an authors first book is too often not only his luckiest but really his best it has a brightness that dies out under the school he puts himself to but a painter or a sculptor is only the gainer by all the school he can give himself   x  in view of this fact it becomes again very hard to establish the authors status in the business world and at moments i have grave question whether he belongs there at all except as a novelist  there is of course no outlay for him in this sort any more than in any other sort of literature but it at least supposes and exacts some measure of preparation  a young writer may produce a brilliant and very perfect romance just as he may produce a brilliant and very perfect poem but in the field of realistic fiction or in what we used to call the novel of manners a writer can only produce an inferior book at the outset  for this work he needs experience and observation not so much of others as of himself for ultimately his characters will all come out of himself and he will need to know motive and character with such thoroughness and accuracy as he can acquire only through his own heart  a man remains in a measure strange to himself as long as he lives and the very sources of novelty in his work will be within himself he can continue to give it freshness in no other way than by knowing himself better and better  but a young writer and an untrained writer has not yet begun to be acquainted even with the lives of other men  the world around him remains a secret as well as the world within him and both unfold themselves simultaneously to that experience of joy and sorrow that can come only with the lapse of time  until he is well on towards forty he will hardly have assimilated the materials of a great novel although he may have amassed them  the novelist then is a man of letters who is like a man of business in the necessity of preparation for his calling though he does not pay storerent and may carry all his affairs under his hat as the phrase is  he alone among men of letters may look forward to that sort of continuous prosperity which follows from capacity and diligence in other vocations for storytelling is now a fairly recognized trade and the storyteller has a moneystanding in the economic world  it is not a very high standing i think and i have expressed the belief that it does not bring him the respect felt for men in other lines of business  still our people cannot deny some consideration to a man who gets a hundred dollars a thousand words or whose book sells five hundred thousand copies or less  that is a fact appreciable to business and the man of letters in the line of fiction may reasonably feel that his place in our civilization though he may owe it to the women who form the great mass of his readers has something of the character of a vested interest in the eyes of men  there is indeed as yet no conspiracy law which will avenge the attempt to injure him in his business  a critic or a dark conjuration of critics may damage him at will and to the extent of their power and he has no recourse but to write better books or worse the law will do nothing for him and a boycott of his books might be preached with immunity by any class of men not liking his opinions on the question of industrial slavery or antipaedobaptism  still the market for his wares is steadier than the market for any other kind of literary wares and the prices are better  the historian who is a kind of inferior realist has something like the same steadiness in the market but the prices he can command are much lower and the two branches of the novelists trade are not to be compared in a business way  as for the essayist the poet the traveller the popular scientist they are nowhere in the competition for the favor of readers  the reviewer indeed has a pretty steady call for his work but i fancy the reviewers who get a hundred dollars a thousand words could all stand upon the point of a needle without crowding one another i should rather like to see them doing it  another gratifying fact of the situation is that the best writers of fiction who are most in demand with the magazines probably get nearly as much money for their work as the inferior novelists who outsell them by tens of thousands and who make their appeal to the innumerable multitude of the less educated and less cultivated buyers of fiction in book form  i think they earn their money but if i did not think all of the higher class of novelists earned so much money as they get i should not be so invidious as to single out for reproach those who did not  the difficulty about payment as i have hinted is that literature has no objective value really but only a subjective value if i may so express it  a poem an essay a novel even a paper on political economy may be worth gold untold to one reader and worth nothing whatever to another it may be precious to one mood of the reader and worthless to another mood of the same reader  how then is it to be priced and how is it to be fairly marketed  all people must be fed and all people must be clothed and all people must be housed and so meat raiment and shelter are things of positive and obvious necessity which may fitly have a market price put upon them  but there is no such positive and obvious necessity i am sorry to say for fiction or not for the higher sort of fiction  the sort of fiction which corresponds in literature to the circus and the variety theatre in the showbusiness seems essential to the spiritual health of the masses but the most cultivated of the classes can get on from time to time without an artistic novel  this is a great pity and i should bevery willing that readers might feel something like the pangs of hunger and cold when deprived of their finer fiction but apparently they never do  their dumb and passive need is apt only to manifest itself negatively or in the form of weariness of this author or that  the publisher of books can ascertain the fact through the declining sales of a writer but the editor of a magazine who is the best customer of the best writers must feel the market with a much more delicate touch  sometimes it may be years before he can satisfy himself that his readers are sick of smith and are pining for jones even then he cannot know how long their mood will last and he is by no means safe in cutting down smiths price and putting up joness with the best will in the world to pay justly he cannot  smith who has been boring his readers to death for a year may write tomorrow a thing that will please them so much that he will at once be a prime favorite again and jones whom they have been asking for may do something so uncharacteristic and alien that it will be a flat failure in the magazine  the only thing that gives either writer positive value is his acceptance with the reader but the acceptance is from month to month wholly uncertain  authors are largely matters of fashion like this style of bonnet or that shape of gown  last spring the dresses were all made with lace berthas and smith was read this year the butterfly capes are worn and jones is the favorite author  who shall forecast the fall and winter modes   xi  in this inquiry it is always the author rather than the publisher always the contributor rather than the editor whom i am concerned for  i study the difficulties of the publisher and editor only because they involve the author and the contributor if they did not i will not say with how hard a heart i should turn from them my only pang now in scrutinizing the business conditions of literature is for the makers of literature not the purveyors of it  after all and in spite of my vaunting title is the man of letters ever am business man  i suppose that strictly speaking he never is except in those rare instances where through need or choice he is the publisher as well as the author of his books  then he puts something on the market and tries to sell it there and is a man of business  but otherwise he is an artist merely and is allied to the great mass of wageworkers who are paid for the labor they have put into the thing done or the thing made who live by doing or making a thing and not by marketing a thing after some other man has done it or made it  the quality of the thing has nothing to do with the economic nature of the case the author is in the last analysis merely a workingman and is under the rule that governs the workingmans life  if he is sick or sad and cannot work if he is lazy or tipsy and will not then he earns nothing  he cannot delegate his business to a clerk or a manager it will not go on while he is sleeping  the wage he can command depends strictly upon his skill and diligence  i myself am neither sorry nor ashamed for this i am glad and proud to be of those who eat their bread in the sweat of their own brows and not the sweat of other mens brows i think my bread is the sweeter for it  in the mean time i have no blame for business men they are no more of the condition of things than we workingmen are they did no more to cause it or create it but i would rather be in my place than in theirs and i wish that i could make all my fellowartists realize that economically they are the same as mechanics farmers daylaborers  it ought to be our glory that we produce something that we bring into the world something that was not choately there before that at least we fashion or shape something anew and we ought to feel the tie that binds us to all the toilers of the shop and field not as a galling chain but as a mystic bond also uniting us to him who works hitherto and evermore i know very well that to the vast multitude of our fellowworkingmen we artists are the shadows of names or not even the shadows  i like to look the facts in the face for though their lineaments are often terrible yet there is light nowhere else and i will not pretend in this light that the masses care any more for us than we care for the masses or so much  nevertheless and most distinctly we are not of the classes  except in our work they have no use for us if now and then they fancy qualifying their material splendor or their spiritual dulness with some artistic presence the attempt is always a failure that bruises and abashes  in so far as the artist is a man of the world he is the less an artist and if he fashions himself upon fashion he deforms his art  we all know that ghastly type it is more absurd even than the figure which is really of the world which was born and bred in it and conceives of nothing outside of it or above it  in the social world as well as in the business world the artist is anomalous in the actual conditions and he is perhaps a little ridiculous  yet he has to be somewhere poor fellow and i think that he will do well to regard himself as in a transition state  he is really of the masses but they do not know it and what is worse they do not know him as yet the common people do not hear him gladly or hear him at all  he is apparently of the classes they know him and they listen to him he often amuses them very much but he is not quite at ease among them whether they know it or not he knows that he is not of their kind perhaps he will never be at home anywhere in the world as long as there are masses whom he ought to consort with and classes whom he cannot consort with  the prospect is not brilliant for any artist now living but perhaps the artist of the future will see in the flesh the accomplishment of that human equality of which the instinct has been divinely planted in the human soul     etext editors bookmarks  artist has seasons as trees  when he cannot blossom book that they are content to know at second hand business to take advantage of his necessity competition has deformed human nature conditions of hucksters imposed upon poets fate of a book is in the hands of the women god of chance leads them into temptation and adversity historian who is a kind of inferior realist i do not think any man ought to live by an art if he has not enjoyed writing no one will enjoy reading impropriety if not indecency promises literary success literature beautiful only through the intelligence literature has no objective value literature is business as well as art man is strange to himself as long as he lives men read the newspapers but our women read the books more zeal than knowledge in it most journalists would have been literary men if they could never quite sure of life unless i find literature

confessions of a summer colonist  by william dean howells    confessions of a summer colonist   the season is ending in the little summer settlement on the down east coast where i have been passing the last three months and with each loath day the sense of its peculiar charm grows more poignant a prescience of the homesickness i shall feel for it when i go already begins to torment me and i find myself wishing to imagine some form of words which shall keep a likeness of it at least through the winter some shadowy semblance which i may turn to hereafter if any chance or change should destroy or transform it or what is more likely if i should never come back to it  perhaps others in the distant future may turn to it for a glimpse of our actual life in one of its most characteristic phases i am sure that in the distant present there are many millions of our own inlanders to whom it would be altogether strange     i  in a certain sort fragile is written all over our colony as far as the visible body of it is concerned it is inexpressibly perishable a fire and a high wind could sweep it all away and one of the most american of all american things is the least fitted among them to survive from the present to the future and impart to it the significance of what may soon be a portion and parcel of our extremely forgetful past  it is also in a supremely transitional moment one might say that last year it was not quite what it is now and next year it may be altogether different  in fact our summer colony is in that happy hour when the rudeness of the first summer conditions has been left far behind and vulgar luxury has not yet cumbrously succeeded to a sort of sylvan distinction  the type of its simple and sufficing hospitalities is the sevenoclock supper  every one in hotel or in cottage dines between one and two and no less scrupulously sups at seven unless it is a few extremists who sup at halfpast seven  at this function which is our chief social event it is de rigueur for the men not to dress and they come in any sort of sack or jacket or cutaway letting the ladies make up the pomps which they forego  from this fact may be inferred the informality of the mens daytime attire and the same note is sounded in the whole range of the cottage life so that once a visitor from the world outside who had been exasperated beyond endurance by the absence of form among us if such an effect could be from a cause so negative burst out with the reproach oh you make a fetish of your informality  fetish is perhaps rather too strong a word but i should not mind saying that informality was the tutelary genius of the place  american men are everywhere impatient of form  it burdens and bothers them and they like to throw it off whenever they can  we may not be so very democratic at heart as we seem but we are impatient of ceremonies that separate us when it is our business or our pleasure to get at one another and it is part of our splendor to ignore the ceremonies as we do the expenses  we have all the decent grades of riches and poverty in our colony but our informality is not more the treasure of the humble than of the great  in the nature of things it cannot last however and the only question is how long it will last  i think myself until some one imagines giving an eightoclock dinner then all the informalities will go and the whole train of evils which such a dinner connotes will rush in     ii  the cottages themselves are of several sorts and some still exist in the earlier stages of mutation from the fishermens and farmers houses which formed their germ  but these are now mostly let as lodgings to bachelors and other single or semidetached folks who go for their meals to the neighboring hotels or boardinghouses  the hotels are each the centre of this sort of centripetal life as well as the homes of their own scores or hundreds of inmates  a single boardinghouse gathers about it half a dozen dependent cottages which it cares for and feeds at its table and even where the cottages have kitchens and all the housekeeping facilities their inmates sometimes prefer to dine at the hotels by far the greater number of cottagers however keep house bringing their service with them from the cities and settling in their summer homes for three or four or five months  the houses conform more or less to one type a picturesque structure of colonial pattern shingled to the ground and stained or left to take a weatherstain of grayish brown with cavernous verandas and dormer windowed roofs covering ten or twelve rooms  within they are if not elaborately finished elaborately fitted up with a constant regard to health in the plumbing and drainage  the water is brought in a system of pipes from a lake five miles away and as it is only for summer use the pipes are not buried from the frost but wander along the surface through the ferns and brambles of the tough little seaside knolls on which the cottages are perched and climb the old tumbling stone walls of the original pastures before diving into the cemented basements  most of the cottages are owned by their occupants and furnished by them the rest not less attractive and hardly less tastefully furnished belong to natives who have caught on to the architectural and domestic preferences of the summer people and have built them to let  the rugosities of the stony pasture land end in a wooded point seaward and curve east and north in a succession of beaches  it is on the point and mainly short of its wooded extremity that the cottages of our settlement are dropped as near the ocean as may be and with as little order as birds nests in the grass among the sweetfern laurel bay wild raspberries and dogroses which it is the ideal to leave as untouched as possible  wheelworn lanes that twist about among the hollows find the cottages from the highway but footpaths approach one cottage from another and people walk rather than drive to each others doors from the deepbosomed wellsheltered little harbor the tides swim inland half a score of winding miles up the channel of a river which without them would be a trickling rivulet  an irregular line of cottages follows the shore a little way and then leaves the river to the schooners and barges which navigate it as far as the oldest pilebuilt wooden bridge in new england and these in their turn abandon it to the fleets of rowboats and canoes in which summer youth of both sexes explore it to its source over depths as clear as glass past wooded headlands and low rushbordered meadows through reaches and openings of pastoral fields and under the shadow of dreaming groves  if there is anything lovelier than the scenery of this gentle river i do not know it and i doubt if the sky is purer and bluer in paradise  this seems to be the consensus tacit or explicit of the youth who visit it and employ the landscape for their picnics and their water parties from the beginning to the end of summer  the river is very much used for sunsets by the cottagers who live on it and who claim a superiority through them to the cottagers on the point an impartial mind obliges me to say that the sunsets are all good in our colony there is no place from which they are bad and yet for a certain tragical sunset where the dying day bleeds slowly into the channel till it is filled from shore to shore with red as far as the eye can reach the river is unmatched  for my own purposes it is not less acceptable however when the fog has come in from the sea like a visible reverie and blurred the whole valley with its whiteness  i find that particularly good to look at from the trolleycar which visits and revisits the river before finally leaving it with a sort of desperation and hiding its passion with a sudden plunge into the woods     iii  the old fishing and seafaring village which has now almost lost the recollection of its first estate in its absorption with the care of the summer colony was sparsely dropped along the highway bordering the harbor and the shores of the river where the piles of the timeworn wharves are still rotting  a few houses of the past remain but the type of the summer cottage has impressed itself upon all the later building and the native is passing architecturally if not personally into abeyance  he takes the situation philosophically and in the season he caters to the summer colony not only as the landlord of the rented cottages and the keeper of the hotels and boardinghouses but as liverystableman grocer butcher marketman apothecary and doctor there is not one foreign accent in any of these callings  if the native is a farmer he devotes himself to vegetables poultry eggs and fruit for the summer folks and brings these supplies to their doors his children appear with flowers and there are many proofs that he has accurately sized the cottagers up in their tastes and fancies as well as their needs  i doubt if we have sized him up so well or if our somewhat conventionalized ideal of him is perfectly representative  he is perhaps more complex than he seems he is certainly much more self sufficing than might have been expected  the summer folks are the material from which his prosperity is wrought but he is not dependent and is very far from submissive  as in all right conditions it is here the employer who asks for work not the employee and the work must be respectfully asked for  there are many fables to this effect as for instance that of the lady who said to a summer visitor critical of the weeks wash she had brought home ill wash you and ill iron you but i wont take none of your jaw  a primitive independence is the keynote of the native character and it suffers no infringement but rather boasts itself  were independent here i tell you said the friendly person who consented to take off the wire door  i was down bangor way doin a piece of work and a fellow come along and says he i want you should hurry up on that job hello says i i guess ill pull out  well we calculate to do our work he added with an accent which sufficiently implied that their consciences needed no bossing in the performance  the native compliance with any summervisiting request is commonly in some such form as well i dont know but what i can or i guess there aint anything to hinder me  this compliance is so rarely if ever carried to the point of domestic service that it may fairly be said that all the domestic service at least of the cottagers is imported the natives will wait at the hotel tables they will come in to accommodate but they will not live out  i was one day witness of the extreme failure of a friend whose city cook had suddenly abandoned him and who applied to a friendly farmers wife in the vain hope that she might help him to some one who would help his family out in their strait why there aint a girl in the hollow that lives out  why if you was sick abed i dont know as i know anybody t you could git to set up with you  the natives will not live out because they cannot keep their self respect in the conditions of domestic service  some people laugh at this selfrespect but most summer folks like it as i own i do  in our partly mythical estimate of the native and his relation to us he is imagined as holding a kind of carnival when we leave him at the end of the season and it is believed that he likes us to go early  we have had his good offices at a fair price all summer but as it draws to a close they are rendered more and more fitfully  from some perhaps flattered reports of the happiness of the natives at the departure of the sojourners i have pictured them dancing a sort of farandole and stretching with linked hands from the farthest summer cottage up the river to the last on the wooded point  it is certain that they get tired and i could not blame them if they were glad to be rid of their guests and to go back to their own social life  this includes church festivals of divers kinds lectures and shows sleighrides theatricals and readingclubs and a plentiful use of books from the excellently chosen free village library  they say frankly that the summer folks have no idea how pleasant it is when they are gone and i am sure that the gayeties to which we leave them must be more tolerable than those which we go back to in the city  it may be however that i am too confident and that their gayeties are only different  i should really like to know just what the entertainments are which are given in a building devoted to them in a country neighborhood three or four miles from the village  it was once a church but is now used solely for social amusements     iv  the amusements of the summer colony i have already hinted at  besides suppers there are also teas of larger scope both afternoon and evening  there are hops every week at the two largest hotels which are practically free to all and the bathingbeach is of course a supreme attraction  the bathhouses which are very clean and well equipped are not very cheap either for the season or for a single bath and there is a pretty pavilion at the edge of the sands  this is always full of gossiping spectators of the hardy adventurers who brave tides too remote from the gulf stream to be ever much warmer than sixty or sixtyfive degrees  the bathers are mostly young people who have the courage of their pretty bathingcostumes or the inextinguishable ardor of their years  if it is not rather serious business with them all still i admire the fortitude with which some of them remain in fifteen minutes beyond our colony which calls itself the port there is a far more populous wateringplace east of the point known as the beach which is the resort of people several grades of gentility lower than ours so many in fact that we never can speak of the beach without averting our faces or at the best with a tolerant smile  it is really a succession of beaches all much longer and i am bound to say more beautiful than ours lined with rows of the humbler sort of summer cottages known as shells and with many hotels of corresponding degree  the cottages may be hired by the week or month at about two dollars a day and they are supposed to be taken by inland people of little social importance  very likely this is true but they seemed to be very nice quiet people and i commonly saw the ladies reading on their verandas books and magazines while the gentlemen sprayed the dusty road before them with the garden hose  the place had also for me an agreeable alien suggestion and in passing the long row of cottages i was slightly reminded of scheveningen beyond the cottage settlements is a struggling little park dedicated to the only indian saint i ever heard of though there may be others  his statue colossal in sheetlead and painted the copper color of his race offers any heathen comer the choice between a bible in one of his hands and a tomahawk in the other at the entrance of the park and there are other sheetlead groups and figures in the white of allegory at different points  it promises to be a pretty enough little place in future years but as yet it is not much resorted to by the excursions which largely form the prosperity of the beach  the concerts and the highclass vaudeville promised have not flourished in the pavilion provided for them and one of two monkeys in the zoological department has perished of the public inattention  this has not fatally affected the captive bear who rises to his hind legs and eats peanuts and doughnuts in that position like a fellowcitizen  with the cockatoos and parrots and the dozen deer in an inclosure of wire netting he is no mean attraction but he does not charm the excursionists away from the summer village at the shore where they spend long afternoons splashing among the waves or in lolling groups of men women and children on the sand  in the more active gayeties i have seen nothing so decided during the whole season as the behavior of three young girls who once came up out of the sea and obliged me by dancing a measure on the smooth hard beach in their bathingdresses  i thought it very pretty but i do not believe such a thing could have been seen on our beach which is safe from all excursionists and sacred to the cottage and hotel life of the port  besides our beach and its bathing we have a readingclub for the men evolved from one of the old native houses and verandaed round for summer use and we have golflinks and a golf clubhouse within easy trolley reach  the links are as energetically if not as generally frequented as the sands and the sport finds the favor which attends it everywhere in the decay of tennis  the tenniscourts which i saw thronged about by eager girlcrowds here seven years ago are now almost wholly abandoned to the lovers of the game who are nearly always men  perhaps the only thing besides of course our common mortality which we have in common with the excursionists is our love of the trolleyline this by its admirable equipment and by the terror it inspires in horses has wellnigh abolished driving and following the old country roads as it does with an occasional shortcut though the deep green lighted woods or across the prismatic salt meadows it is of a picturesque variety entirely satisfying  after a year of fervent opposition and protest the whole communitywhether of summer or of winter folksnow gladly accepts the trolley and the grandest cottager and the lowliest hotel dweller meet in a grateful appreciation of its beauty and comfort  some pass a great part of every afternoon on the trolley and one lady has achieved celebrity by spending four dollars a week in trolleyrides the exhilaration of these is varied with an occasional apprehension when the car pitches down a sharp incline and twists almost at right angles on a sudden curve at the bottom without slacking its speed  a lady who ventured an appeal to the conductor at one such crisis was reassured and at the same time taught her place by his reply that motormans life maam is just as precious to him as what yours is to you  she had perhaps really ventured too far for ordinarily the employees of the trolley do not find occasion to use so much severity with their passengers  they look after their comfort as far as possible and seek even to anticipate their wants in unexpected cases if i may believe a story which was told by a witness  she had long expected to see some one thrown out of the open car at one of the sharp curves and one day she actually saw a woman hurled from the seat into the road  luckily the woman slighted on her feet and stood looking round in a daze  oh oh exclaimed another woman in the seat behind shes left her umbrella  the conductor promptly threw it out to her  why demanded the witness did that lady wish to get out here  the conductor hesitated before he jerked the bellpull to go on then he said well shell want her umbrella anyway  the conductors are in fact very civil as well as kind  if they see a horse in anxiety at the approach of the car they considerately stop and let him get by with his driver in safety  by such means with their frequent trips and low fares and with the ease and comfort of their cars they have conciliated public favor and the trolley has drawn travel away from the steam railroad in such measure that it ran no trains last winter  the trolley in fact is a fad of the summer folks this year but what it will be another no one knows it may be their hissing and byword  in the mean time as i have already suggested they have other amusements these are not always of a nature so general as the trolley or so particular as the tea  but each of the larger hotels has been fully supplied with entertainments for the benefit of their projectors though nearly everything of the sort had some sort of charitable slant  i assisted at a stereopticon lecture on alaska for the aid of some youthful alaskans of both sexes who were shown first in their savage state and then as they appeared after a merely rudimental education in the costumes and profiles of our own civilization  i never would have supposed that education could do so much in so short a time and i gladly gave my mite for their further development in classic beauty and a final elegance  my mite was taken up in a hat which passed round among the audience is a common means of collecting the spectators expressions of appreciation  other entertainments of a prouder frame exact an admission fee but i am not sure that these are better than some of the hatshows as they are called  the tale of our summer amusements would be sadly incomplete without some record of the bullfights given by the spanish prisoners of war on the neighboring island where they were confined the year of the war admission to these could be had only by favor of the officers in charge and even among the elite of the colony those who went were a more elect few  still the day i went there were some fifty or seventyfive spectators who arrived by trolley near the island and walked to the stockade which confined the captives  a real bullfight i believe is always given on sunday and puritan prejudice yielded to usage even in the case of a burlesque bullfight at any rate it was on a sunday that we crouched in an irregular semicircle on a rising ground within the prison pale and faced the captive audience in another semicircle across a little alley for the entrances and exits of the performers  the president of the bullfight was first brought to the place of honor in a handcart and then came the banderilleros the picadores and the espada wonderfully effective and correct in white muslin and colored tissuepaper  much may be done in personal decoration with advertising placards and the lofty mural crown of the president urged the public on both sides to use plug cut  the picadors pasteboard horse was attached to his middle fore and aft and looked quite the sort of hapless jade which is ordinarily sacrificed to the bulls  the toro himself was composed of two prisoners whose horizontal backs were covered with a brown blanket and his feet sometimes bare and sometimes shod with indiarubber boots were of the human pattern  practicable horns of a somewhat too yielding substance branched from a front of pasteboard and a cloth tail apt to come off in the charge swung from his rear  i have never seen a genuine corrida but a lady present who had told me that this was conducted with all the right circumstance and it is certain that the performers entered into their parts with the artistic gust of their race  the picador sustained some terrific falls and in his quality of horse had to be taken out repeatedly and sewed up the banderilleros tormented and eluded the toro with tablecovers one red and two drab till the espada took him from them and with due ceremony after a speech to the president drove his blade home to the bulls heart  i stayed to see three bulls killed the last was uncommonly fierce and when his hindquarters came off or out his forequarters charged joyously among the aficionados on the prisoners side and made havoc in their thickly packed ranks  the espada who killed this bull was showered with cigars and cigarettes from our side  i do not know what the sabbathkeeping shades of the old puritans made of our presence at such a fete on sunday but possibly they had got on so far in a better life as to be less shocked at the decay of piety among us than pleased at the rise of such christianity as had brought us like friends and comrades together with our public enemies in this harmless fun  i wish to say that the tobacco lavished upon the espada was collected for the behoof of all the prisoners  our fiction has made so much of our summer places as the mise en scene of its love stories that i suppose i ought to say something of this side of our colonial life  but after sixty i suspect that ones eyes are poor for that sort of thing and i can only say that in its earliest and simplest epoch the port was particularly famous for the good times that the young people had  they still have good times though whether on just the old terms i do not know  i know that the river is still here with its canoes and rowboats its meadowy reaches apt for dual solitude and its groves for picnics  there is not much bicyclingthe roads are rough and hillybut there is something of it and it is mighty pretty to see the youth of both sexes bicycling with their heads bare  they go about bareheaded on foot and in buggies too and the young girls seek the tan which their mothers used so anxiously to shun  the sailboats manned by weatherworn and weatherwise skippers are rather for the pleasure of such older summer folks as have a taste for codfishing which is here very good  but at every age and in whatever sort our colonists amuse themselves it is with the least possible ceremony  it is as if nature having taken them so hospitably to her heart they felt convention an affront to her  around their cottages as i have said they prefer to leave her primitive beauty untouched and she rewards their forbearance with such a profusion of wild flowers as i have seen nowhere else  the low pink laurel flushed all the stony fields to the edges of their verandas when we first came the meadows were milk white with daisies in the swampy places delicate orchids grew in the pools the flags and flowering rushes all the paths and waysides were set with dogroses the hollows and stony tops were broadly matted with ground juniper  since then the goldenrod has passed from glory to glory first mixing its yellowpowdered plumes with the redpurple tufts of the ironweed and then with the wild asters everywhere  there has come later a dwarf sort six or ten inches high wonderfully rich and fine which with a low white aster seems to hold the field against everything else though the taller goldenrod and the masses of the high blue asters nod less thickly above it  but these smaller blooms deck the ground in incredible profusion and have an innocent air of being stuck in as if they had been fancifully used for ornament by children or indians  in a little while now as it is almost the end of september all the feathery gold will have faded to the soft pale ghosts of that loveliness  the summer birds have long been silent the crows as if they were so many exultant natives are shouting in the blue sky above the windrows of the rowan in jubilant prescience of the depopulation of our colony which fled the hotels a fortnight ago  the days are growing shorter and the red evenings falling earlier so that the cottagers husbands who come up every saturday from town might well be impatient for a monday of final return  those who came from remoter distances have gone back already and the lady cottagers lingering hardily on till october must find the sight of the empty hotels and the windows of the neighboring houses which no longer brighten after the chilly nightfall rather depressing  every one says that this is the loveliest time of year and that it will be divine here all through october  but there are sudden and unexpected defections there is a steady pull of the heart cityward which it is hard to resist  the first great exodus was on the first of the month when the hotels were deserted by fourfifths of their guests  the rest followed half of them within the week and within a fortnight none but an all but inaudible and invisible remnant were left who made no impression of summer sojourn in the deserted trolleys  the days now go by in moods of rapid succession  there have been days when the sea has lain smiling in placid derision of the recreants who have fled the lingering summer there have been nights when the winds have roared round the cottages in wild menace of the faithful few who have remained  we have had a magnificent storm which came as an equinoctial storm should exactly at the equinox and for a day and a night heaped the sea upon the shore in thundering surges twenty and thirty feet high  i watched these at their awfulest from the wide windows of a cottage that crouched in the very edge of the surf with the effect of clutching the rocks with one hand and holding its roof on with the other  the sea was such a sight as i have not seen on shipboard and while i luxuriously shuddered at it i had the advantage of a mellow logfire at my back purring and softly crackling in a quiet indifference to the storm  twentyfour hours more made all serene again  bloodcurdling tales of lobsterpots carried to sea filled the air but the air was as blandly unconscious of ever having been a fury as a lady who has found her lost temper  swift alternations of weather are so characteristic of our colonial climate that the other afternoon i went out with my umbrella against the raw cold rain of the morning and had to raise it against the broiling sun  three days ago i could say that the green of the woods had no touch of hectic in it but already the low trees of the swampland have flamed into crimson  every morning when i look out this crimson is of a fierier intensity and the trees on the distant uplands are beginning slowly to kindle with a sort of inner glow which has not yet burst into a blaze  here and there the goldenrod is rusting but there seems only to be more and more asters sorts and i have seen ladies coming home with sheaves of blue gentians i have heard that the orchids are beginning again to light their tender lamps from the burning blackberry vines that stray from the pastures to the edge of the swamps  after an apparently total evanescence there has been a like resuscitation of the spirit of summer society  in the very last week of september we have gone to a supper which lingered far out of its season like one of these late flowers and there has been an afternoon tea which assembled an astonishing number of cottagers all secretly surprised to find one another still here and professing openly a pity tinged with contempt for those who are here no longer  i blamed those who had gone home but i myself sniff the asphalt afar the roar of the street calls to me with the magic that the voice of the sea is losing  just now it shines entreatingly it shines winningly in the sun which is mellowing to an october tenderness and it shines under a moon of perfect orb which seems to have the whole heavens to itself in the first watch of the night except for the red planet mars  this begins to burn in the west before the flush of sunset has passed from it and then later a few moonwashed stars pierce the vast vault with their keen points  the stars which so powdered the summer sky seem mostly to have gone back to town where no doubt people take them for electric lights     etext editors bookmarks  ladies make up the pomps which they the men forego summer folks have no idea how pleasant it is when they are gone their consciences needed no bossing in the performance     end of this project gutenberg etext of confessions of a summer colonist by william dean howells       literature and lifethe young contributor  by william dean howells    the editors relations with the young contributor   one of the trustiest jokes of the humorous paragrapher is that the editor is in great and constant dread of the young contributor but neither my experience nor my observation bears out his theory of the case  of course one must not say anything to encourage a young person to abandon an honest industry in the vain hope of early honor and profit from literature but there have been and there will be literary men and women always and these in the beginning have nearly always been young and i cannot see that there is risk of any serious harm in saying that it is to the young contributor the editor looks for rescue from the old contributor or from his failing force and charm  the chances naturally are against the young contributor and vastly against him but if any periodical is to live and to live long it is by the infusion of new blood and nobody knows this better than the editor who may seem so unfriendly and uncareful to the young contributor  the strange voice the novel scene the odor of fresh woods and pastures new the breath of morning the dawn of tomorrowthese are what the editor is eager for if he is fit to be an editor at all and these are what the young contributor alone can give him  a man does not draw near the sixties without wishing people to believe that he is as young as ever and he has not written almost as many books as he has lived years without persuading himself that each new work of his has all the surprise of spring but possibly there are wonted traits and familiar airs and graces in it which forbid him to persuade others i do not say these characteristics are not charming i am very far from wishing to say that but i do say and must say that after the fiftieth time they do not charm for the first time and this is where the advantage of the new contributor lies if he happens to charm at all     i  the new contributor who does charm can have little notion how much he charms his first reader who is the editor  that functionary may bide his pleasure in a short stiff note of acceptance or he may mask his joy in a check of slender figure but the contributor may be sure that he has missed no merit in his work and that he has felt perhaps far more than the public will feel such delight as it can give  the contributor may take the acceptance as a token that his efforts have not been neglected and that his achievements will always be warmly welcomed that even his failures will be leniently and reluctantly recognized as failures and that he must persist long in failure before the friend he has made will finally forsake him  i do not wish to paint the situation wholly rose color the editor will have his moods when he will not see so clearly or judge so justly as at other times when he will seem exacting and fastidious and will want this or that mistaken thing done to the story or poem or sketch which the author knows to be simply perfect as it stands but he is worth bearing with and he will be constant to the new contributor as long as there is the least hope of him  the contributor may be the man or the woman of one story one poem one sketch for there are such but the editor will wait the evidence of indefinite failure to this effect  his hope always is that he or she is the man or the woman of many stories many poems many sketches all as good as the first  from my own long experience as a magazine editor i may say that the editor is more doubtful of failure in one who has once done well than of a second success  after all the writer who can do but one good thing is rarer than people are apt to think in their love of the improbable but the real danger with a young contributor is that he may become his own rival  what would have been quite good enough from him in the first instance is not good enough in the second because he has himself fixed his standard so high  his only hope is to surpass himself and not begin resting on his laurels too soon perhaps it is never well soon or late to rest upon ones laurels  it is well for one to make ones self scarce and the best way to do this is to be more and more jealous of perfection in ones work  the editors conditions are that having found a good thing he must get as much of it as he can and the chances are that he will be less exacting than the contributor imagines  it is for the contributor to be exacting and to let nothing go to the editor as long as there is the possibility of making it better  he need not be afraid of being forgotten because he does not keep sending the editors memory is simply relentless he could not forget the writer who has pleased him if he would for such writers are few  i do not believe that in my editorial service on the atlantic monthly which lasted fifteen years in all i forgot the name or the characteristic quality or even the handwriting of a contributor who had pleased me and i forgot thousands who did not  i never lost faith in a contributor who had done a good thing to the end i expected another good thing from him  i think i was always at least as patient with him as he was with me though he may not have known it  at the time i was connected with that periodical it had almost a monopoly of the work of longfellow emerson holmes lowell whittier mrs stowe parkman higginson aldrich stedman and many others not so well known but still well known  these distinguished writers were frequent contributors and they could be counted upon to respond to almost any appeal of the magazine yet the constant effort of the editors was to discover new talent and their wish was to welcome it  i know that so far as i was concerned the success of a young contributor was as precious as if i had myself written his paper or poem and i doubt if it gave him more pleasure  the editor is in fact a sort of second self for the contributor equally eager that he should stand well with the public and able to promote his triumphs without egotism and share them without vanity     ii  in fact my curious experience was that if the public seemed not to feel my delight in a contribution i thought good my vexation and disappointment were as great as if the work hod been my own  it was even greater for if i had really written it i might have had my misgivings of its merit but in the case of another i could not console myself with this doubt  the sentiment was at the same time one which i could not cherish for the work of an old contributor such a one stood more upon his own feet and the young contributor may be sure that the editors pride selfinterest and sense of editorial infallibility will all prompt him to stand by the author whom he has introduced to the public and whom he has vouched for  i hope i am not giving the young contributor too high an estimate of his value to the editor  after all he must remember that he is but one of a great many others and that the editors affections if constant are necessarily divided  it is good for the literary aspirant to realize very early that he is but one of many for the vice of our comparatively virtuous craft is that it tends to make each of us imagine himself central if not sole  as a matter of fact however the universe does not revolve around any one of us we make our circuit of the sun along with the other inhabitants of the earth a planet of inferior magnitude  the thing we strive for is recognition but when this comes it is apt to turn our heads  i should say then that it was better it should not come in a great glare and aloud shout all at once but should steal slowly upon us ray by ray breath by breath  in the mean time if this happens we shall have several chances of reflection and can ask ourselves whether we are really so great as we seem to other people or seem to seem  the prime condition of good work is that we shall get ourselves out of our minds  sympathy we need of course and encouragement but i am not sure that the lack of these is not a very good thing too  praise enervates flattery poisons but a smart brisk snub is always rather wholesome  i should say that it was not at all a bad thing for a young contributor to get his manuscript back even after a first acceptance and even a general newspaper proclamation that he is one to make the immortals tremble for their wreaths of asphodelor is it amaranth  i am never sure which  of course one must have ones hour or day or week of disabling the editors judgment of calling him to ones self fool and rogue and wretch but after that if one is worth while at all one puts the rejected thing by or sends it off to some other magazine and sets about the capture of the erring editor with something better or at least something else     iii  i think it a great pity that editors ever deal other than frankly with young contributors or put them off with smooth generalities of excuse instead of saying they do not like this thing or that offered them  it is impossible to make a criticism of all rejected manuscripts but in the case of those which show promise i think it is quite possible and if i were to sin my sins over again i think i should sin a little more on the side of candid severity  i am sure i should do more good in that way and i am sure that when i used to dissemble my real mind i did harm to those whose feelings i wished to spare  there ought not in fact to be question of feeling in the editors mind  i know from much suffering of my own that it is terrible to get back a manuscript but it is not fatal or i should have been dead a great many times before i was thirty when the thing mostly ceased for me  one survives it again and again and one ought to make the reflection that it is not the first business of a periodical to print contributions of this one or of that but that its first business is to amuse and instruct its readers  to do this it is necessary to print contributions but whose they are or how the writer will feel if they are not printed cannot be considered the editor can consider only what they are and the young contributor will do well to consider that although the editor may not be an infallible judge or quite a good judge it is his business to judge and to judge without mercy  mercy ought no more to qualify judgment in an artistic result than in a mathematical result     iv  i suppose since i used to have it myself that there is a superstition with most young contributors concerning their geographical position  i used to think that it was a disadvantage to send a thing from a small or unknown place and that it doubled my insignificance to do so  i believed that if my envelope had borne the postmark of new york or boston or some other city of literary distinction it would have arrived on the editors table with a great deal more authority  but i am sure this was a mistake from the first and when i came to be an editor myself i constantly verified the fact from my own dealings with contributors a contribution from a remote and obscure place at once piqued my curiosity and i soon learned that the fresh things the original things were apt to come from such places and not from the literary centres one of the most interesting facts concerning the arts of all kinds is that those who wish to give their lives to them do not appear where the appliances for instruction in them exist  an artistic atmosphere does not create artists a literary atmosphere does not create literators poets and painters spring up where there was never a verse made or a picture seen  this suggests that god is no more idle now than he was at the beginning but that he is still and forever shaping the human chaos into the instruments and means of beauty  it may also suggest to that scholar pride that vanity of technique which is so apt to vaunt itself in the teacher that the best he can do after all is to let the pupil teach himself  if he comes with divine authority to the thing he attempts he will know how to use the appliances of which the teacher is only the first  the editor if he does not consciously perceive the truth will instinctively feel it and will expect the acceptable young contributor from the country the village the small town and he will look eagerly at anything that promises literature from montana or texas for he will know that it also promises novelty  if he is a wise editor he will wish to hold his hand as much as possible he will think twice before he asks the contributor to change this or correct that he will leave him as much to himself as he can the young contributor on his part will do well to realize this and to receive all the editorial suggestions which are veiled commands in most cases as meekly and as imaginatively as possible  the editor cannot always give his reasons however strongly he may feel them but the contributor if sufficiently docile can always divine them  it behooves him to be docile at all times for this is merely the willingness to learn and whether he learns that he is wrong or that the editor is wrong still he gains knowledge  a great deal of knowledge comes simply from doing and a great deal more from doing over and this is what the editor generally means  i think that every author who is honest with himself must own that his work would be twice as good if it were done twice  i was once so fortunately circumstanced that i was able entirely to rewrite one of my novels and i have always thought it the best written or at least indefinitely better than it would have been with a single writing  as a matter of fact nearly all of them have been rewritten in a certain way they have not actually been rewritten throughout as in the case i speak of but they have been gone over so often in manuscript and in proof that the effect has been much the same  unless you are sensible of some strong frame within your work something vertebral it is best to renounce it and attempt something else in which you can feel it  if you are secure of the frame you must observe the quality and character of everything you build about it you must touch you must almost taste you must certainly test every material you employ every bit of decoration must undergo the same scrutiny as the structure  it will be some vague perception of the want of this vigilance in the young contributors work which causes the editor to return it to him for revision with those suggestions which he will do well to make the most of for when the editor once finds a contributor he can trust he rejoices in him with a fondness which the contributor will never perhaps understand  it will not do to write for the editor alone the wise editor understands this and averts his countenance from the contributor who writes at him but if he feels that the contributor conceives the situation and will conform to the conditions which his periodical has invented for itself arid will transgress none of its unwritten laws if he perceives that he has put artistic conscience in every general and detail and though he has not done the best has done the best that he can do he will begin to liberate him from every trammel except those he must wear himself and will be only too glad to leave him free  he understands if he is at all fit for his place that a writer can do well only what he likes to do and his wish is to leave him to himself as soon as possible   v  in my own case i noticed that the contributors who could be best left to themselves were those who were most amenable to suggestion and even correction who took the blue pencil with a smile and bowed gladly to the rod of the proofreader  those who were on the alert for offence who resented a marginal note as a slight and bumptiously demanded that their work should be printed just as they had written it were commonly not much more desired by the reader than by the editor  of course the contributor naturally feels that the public is the test of his excellence but he must not forget that the editor is the beginning of the public and i believe he is a faithfuller and kinder critic than the writer will ever find again  since my time there is a new tradition of editing which i do not think so favorable to the young contributor as the old  formerly the magazines were made up of volunteer contributions in much greater measure than they are now  at present most of the material is invited and even engaged it is arranged for a long while beforehand and the space that can be given to the aspirant the unknown good the potential excellence grows constantly less and less  a great deal can be said for either tradition perhaps some editor will yet imagine a return to the earlier method  in the mean time we must deal with the thing that is and submit to it until it is changed  the moral to the young contributor is to be better than ever to leave nothing undone that shall enhance his small chances of acceptance if he takes care to be so good that the editor must accept him in spite of all the pressure upon his pages he will not only be servinghimself best but may be helping the editor to a conception of his duty that shall be more hospitable to all other young contributors  as it is however it must be owned that their hope of acceptance is very very small and they will do well to make sure that they love literature so much that they can suffer long and often repeated disappointment in its cause  the love of it is the great and only test of fitness for it  it is really inconceivable how any one should attempt it without this but apparently a great many do  it is evident to every editor that a vast number of those who write the things he looks at so faithfully and reads more or less have no artistic motive  people write because they wish to be known or because they have heard that money is easily made in that way or because they think they will chance that among a number of other things  the ignorance of technique which they often show is not nearly so disheartening as the palpable factitiousness of their product  it is something that they have made it is not anything that has grown out of their lives  i should think it would profit the young contributor before he puts pen to paper to ask himself why he does so and if he finds that he has no motive in the love of the thing to forbear  am i interested in what i am going to write about  do i feel it strongly  do i know it thoroughly  do i imagine it clearly  the young contributor had better ask himself all these questions and as many more like them as he can think of  perhaps he will end by not being a young contributor  but if he is able to answer them satisfactorily to his own conscience by all means let him begin  he may at once put aside all anxiety about style that is a thing that will take care of itself it will be added unto him if he really has something to say for style is only a mans way of saying a thing  if he has not much to say or if he has nothing to say perhaps he will try to say it in some other mans way or to hide his own vacuity with rags of rhetoric and tags and fringes of manner borrowed from this author and that  he will fancy that in this disguise his work will be more literary and that there is somehow a quality a grace imparted to it which will charm in spite of the inward hollowness  his vain hope would be pitiful if it were not so shameful but it is destined to suffer defeat at the first glance of the editorial eye  if he really has something to say however about something he knows and loves he is in the best possible case to say it well  still from time to time he may advantageously call a halt and consider whether he is saying the thing clearly and simply  if he has a good ear he will say it gracefully and musically and i would by no means have him aim to say it barely or sparely  it is not so that people talk who talk well and literature is only the thought of the writer flowing from the pen instead of the tongue  to aim at succinctness and brevity merely as some teach is to practice a kind of quackery almost as offensive as the charlatanry of rhetoric in either case the life goes out of the subject  to please ones self honestly and thoroughly is the only way to please others in matters of art  i do not mean to say that if you please yourself you will always please others but that unless you please yourself you will please no one else  it is the sweet and sacred privilege of work done artistically to delight the doer  art is the highest joy but any work done in the love of it is art in a kind and it strikes the note of happiness as nothing else can  we hear much of drudgery but any sort of work that is slighted becomes drudgery poetry fiction painting sculpture acting architecture if you do not do your best by them turn to drudgery sore as digging ditches hewing wood or drawing water and these by the same blessings of god become arts if they are done with conscience and the sense of beauty  the young contributor may test his work before the editor assays it if he will and he may know by a rule that is pretty infallible whether it is good or not from his own experience in doing it  did it give him pleasure  did he love it as it grew under his hand  was he glad and willing with it  or did he force himself to it and did it hang heavy upon him  there is nothing mystical in all this it is a matter of plain everyday experience and i think nearly every artist will say the same thing about it if he examines himself faithfully  if the young contributor finds that he has no delight in the thing he has attempted he may very well give it up for no one else will delight in it  but he need not give it up at once perhaps his mood is bad let him wait for a better and try it again  he may not have learned how to do it well and therefore he cannot love it but perhaps he can learn to do it well  the wonder and glory of art is that it is without formulas  or rather each new piece of work requires the invention of new formulas which will not serve again for another  you must apprentice yourself afresh at every fresh undertaking and our mastery is always a victory over certain unexpected difficulties and not a dominion of difficulties overcome before  i believe in other words that mastery is merely the strength that comes of overcoming and is never a sovereign power that smooths the path of all obstacles  the combinations in art are infinite and almost never the same you must make your key and fit it to each and the key that unlocks one combination will not unlock another     vi  there is no royal road to excellence in literature but the young contributor need not be dismayed at that  royal roads are the ways that kings travel and kings are mostly dull fellows and rarely have a good time  they do not go along singing the spring that trickles into the mossy log is not for them nor                 the wildwood flower that simply blows  but the traveller on the country road may stop for each of these and it is not a bad condition of his progress that he must move so slowly that he can learn every detail of the landscape both earth and sky by heart  the trouble with success is that it is apt to leave life behind or apart  the successful writer especially is in danger of becoming isolated from the realities that nurtured in him the strength to win success  when he becomes famous he becomes precious to criticism to society to all the things that do not exist from themselves or have not the root of the matter in them  therefore i think that a young writers upward course should be slow and beset with many obstacles even hardships  not that i believe in hardships as having inherent virtues i think it is stupid to regard them in that way but they oftener bring out the virtues inherent in the sufferer from them than what i may call the softships and at least they stop him and give him time to think  this is the great matter for if we prosper forward rapidly we have no time for anything but prospering forward rapidly  we have no time for art even the art by which we prosper  i would have the young contributor above all things realize that success is not his concern  good work true work beautiful work is his affair and nothing else  if he does this success will take care of itself  he has no business to think of the thing that will take  it is the editors business to think of that and it is the contributors business to think of the thing that he can do with pleasure the high pleasure that comes from the sense of worth in the thing done  let him do the best he can and trust the editor to decide whether it will take  it will take far oftener than anything he attempts perfunctorily and even if the editor thinks it will not take and feels obliged to return it for that reason he will return it with a real regret with the honor and affection which we cannot help feeling for any one who has done a piece of good work and with the will and the hope to get something from him that will take the next time or the next or the next     etext editors bookmarks  an artistic atmosphere does not create artists any sort of work that is slighted becomes drudgery put aside all anxiety

project gutenberg etext of the young contributor by william dean howells       literature and lifelast days in a dutch hotel  by william dean howells    last days in a dutch hotel  1897   when we said that we were going to scheveningen in the middle of september the portier of the hotel at the hague was sure we should be very cold perhaps because we had suffered so much in his house already and he was right for the wind blew with a dutch tenacity of purpose for a whole week so that the guests thinly peopling the vast hostelry seemed to rustle through its chilly halls and corridors like so many autumn leaves  we were but a poor hundred at most where five hundred would not have been a crowd and when we sat down at the long tables dhote in the great diningroom we had to warm our hands with our plates before we could hold our spoons  from time to time the weather varied as it does in europe american weather is of an exemplary constancy in comparison and three or four times a day it rained and three or four times it cleared but through all the wind blew cold and colder  we were promised however that the hotel would not close till october and we made shift with a warm chimney in one room and three gasburners in another if not to keep warm quite yet certainly to get used to the cold     i  in the mean time the seabathing went resolutely on with all its forms every morning the bathing machines were drawn down to the beach from the esplanade where they were secured against the gale every night and every day a halfdozen hardy invalids braved the rigors of wind and wave at the discreet distance which one ought always to keep one could not always be sure whether these bold bathers were mermen or mermaids for the sea costume of both sexes is the same here as regards an absence of skirts and a presence of what are after the first plunge effectively tights  the first time i walked down to the beach i was puzzled to make out some object rolling about in the low surf which looked like a barrel and which two bathingmachine men were watching with apparently the purpose of fishing it out  suddenly this object reared itself from the surf and floundered towards the steps of a machine then i saw that it was evidently not a barrel but a lady and after that i never dared carry my researches so far  i suppose that the bathingtights are more becoming in some cases than in others but i hold to a modest preference for skirts however brief in the seagear of ladies  without them there may sometimes be the effect of beauty and sometimes the effect of barrel  for the convenience and safety of the bathers there were even in the last half of september some twenty machines and half as many bathmen and bathwomen who waded into the water and watched that the bathers came to no harm instead of a solitary lifeguard showing his statuesque shape as he paced the shore beside the lifelines or cynically rocked in his boat beyond the breakers as the custom is on long island  here there is no need of lifelines and unless one held his head resolutely under water i do not see how he could drown within quarter of a mile of the shore  perhaps it is to prevent suicide that the bathmen are so plentifully provided  they are a provision of the hotel i believe which does not relax itself in any essential towards its guests as they grow fewer  it seems on the contrary to use them with a more tender care and to console them as it may for the inevitable parting near at hand  now within three or four days of the end the kitchen is as scrupulously and vigilantly perfect as it could be in the height of the season and our dwindling numbers sit down every night to a dinner that we could not get for much more love or vastly more money in the month of august at any shore hotel in america it is true that there are certain changes going on but they are going on delicately almost silently  a strip of carpeting has come up from along our corridor but we hardly miss it from the matting which remains through the open doors of vacant chambers we can see that beds are coming down and the dismantling extends into the halls at places  certain decorative carved chairs which repeated themselves outside the doors have ceased to be there but the pictures still hang on the walls and within our own rooms everything is as conscientious as in midsummer  the service is instant and if there is some change in it the change is not for the worse  yesterday our waiter bade me goodbye and when i said i was sorry he was going he alleged a boil on his cheek in excuse he would not allow that his going had anything to do with the closing of the hotel and he was promptly replaced by another who speaks excellent english  now that the first is gone i may own that he seemed not to speak any foreign language long but when cornered in english took refuge in french and then fled from pursuit in that to german and brought up in final dutch where he was practically inaccessible  the elevator runs regularly if not rapidly the papers arrive unfailingly in the readingroom including a solitary london times which even i do not read perhaps because i have no englishreading rival to contend for it with  till yesterday an english artist sometimes got it but he then instantly offered it to me and i had to refuse it because i would not be outdone in politeness  now even he is gone and on all sides i find myself in an unbroken circle of dutch and german where no one would dispute the times with me if he could  every night the corridors are fully lighted and some mornings swept while the washing that goes on all over holland night and morning does not always spare our unfrequented halls and stairs  i note these little facts for the contrast with those of an american hotel which we once assisted in closing and where the elevator stopped two weeks before we left and we fell from electricity to naphthagas and even this died out before us except at long intervals in the passages while there were lightning changes in the service and a final failure of it till we had to go down and get our own icewater of the lingering roomclerk after the last bellboy had winked out     ii  but in europe everything is permanent and in america everything is provisional  this is the great distinction which if always kept in mind will save a great deal of idle astonishment  it is in nothing more apparent than in the preparation here at scheveningen for centuries of summer visitors while at our long island hotel there was a losing bet on a scant generation of them  when it seemed likely that it might be a winning bet the sand was planked there in front of the hotel to the sea with spruce boards  it was very handsomely planked but it was never afterwards touched apparently for any manner of repairs  here for half a mile the dune on which the hotel stands is shored up with massive masonry and bricked for carriages and tiled for footpassengers and it is all kept as clean as if wheel or foot had never passed over it  i am sure that there is not a broken brick or a broken tile in the whole length or breadth of it  but the hotel here is not a bet it is a business  it has come to stay and on long island it had come to see how it would like it  beyond the walk and drive however the dunes are left to the winds and to the vegetation with which the dutch planting clothes them against the winds  first a coarse grass or rush is sown then a finer herbage comes then a tough brushwood with flowers and blackberryvines so that while the seaward slopes of the dunes are somewhat patched and tattered the landward side and all the pleasant hollows between are fairly held against such gales as on long island blow the lower dunes hither and yon the sheep graze in the valleys at some points in many a little pocket of the dunes i found a potatopatch of about the bigness of a city lot and on weekdays i saw woodenshod men slowly slowly gathering in the crop on sundays i saw the pleasant nooks and corners of these sandy hillocks devoted as the dunes of long island were to whispering lovers who are here as freely and fearlessly affectionate as at home  rocking there is not and cannot be in the nature of things as there used to be at mount desert but what is called twoing at york harbor is perfectly practicable  it is practicable not only in the nooks and corners of the dunes but on discreeter terms in those hooded willow chairs so characteristic of the dutch seaside  these if faced in pairs towards each other must be as favorable to the exchange of vows as of opinions and if the crowd is ever very great perhaps one chair could be made to hold two persons it was distinctly a pang the other day to see men carrying them up from the beach and putting them away to hibernate in the basement of the hotel  not all but most of them were taken though i dare say that on fine days throughout october they will go trooping back to the sands on the heads of the same men like a procession of monstrous twolegged crabs  such a day was last sunday and then the beach offered a lively image of its summer gayety  it was dotted with hundreds of hooded chairs which foregathered in gossiping groups or confidential couples and as the sun shone quite warm the flaps of the little tents next the dunes were let down against it and ladies in summer white saved themselves from sunstroke in their shelter  the wooden booths for the sale of candies and mineral waters and beer and sandwiches were flushed with a sudden prosperity so that when i went to buy my pound of grapes from the good woman who understands my dutch i dreaded an indifference in her which by no means appeared  she welcomed me as warmly as if i had been her sole customer and did not put up the price on me perhaps because it was already so very high that her imagination could not rise above it  the hotel showed the same admirable constancy  the restaurant was thronged with newcomers who spread out even over the manytabled esplanade before it but it was in no wise demoralized  that night we sat down in multiplied numbers to a table dhote of serenely unconscious perfection and we permanent guestsalas we are now becoming transient toowere used with unfaltering recognition of our superior worth  we shared the respect which all over europe attaches to establishment and which sometimes makes us poor americans wish for a hereditary nobility so that we could all mirror our ancestral value in the deference of our inferiors  where we should get our inferiors is another thing but i suppose we could import them for the purpose if the duties were not too great under our tariff  we have not yet imported the idea of a european hotel in any respect though we long ago imported what we call the european plan  no travelled american knows it in the extortionate prices of rooms when he gets home or the preposterous charges of our restaurants where one portion of roast beef swimming in a lake of lukewarm juice costs as much as a diversified and delicate dinner in germany or holland  but even if there were any proportion in these things the european hotel will not be with us till we have the european portier who is its spring and inspiration he must not dear homekeeping reader be at all imagined in the moral or material figure of our hotel porter who appears always in his shirt sleeves and speaks with the accent of cork or of congo  the european portier wears a uniform i do not know why and a goldbanded cap and he inhabits a little office at the entrance of the hotel  he speaks eight or ten languages up to certain limit rather better than people born to them and his presence commands an instant reverence softening to affection under his universal helpfulness  there is nothing he cannot tell you cannot do for you and you may trust yourself implicitly to him  he has the priceless gift of making each nationality each personality believe that he is devoted to its service alone  he turns lightly from one language to another as if he had each under his tongue and he answers simultaneously a fussy french woman an angry english tourist a stiff prussian major and a thinvoiced american girl in behalf of a timorous mother and he never mixes the replies  he is an inexhaustible bottle of dialects but this is the least of his merits of his miracles  our portier here is a tall slim dutchman most dutchmen are tall and slim and in spite of the waning season he treats me as if i were multitude while at the same time he uses me with the distinction due the last of his guests  twenty times in as many hours he wishes me goodday putting his hand to his cap for the purpose and to oblige me he wears silver braid instead of gilt on his cap and coat  i apologized yesterday for troubling him so often for stamps and said that i supposed he was much more bothered in the season  between the first of august and the fifteenth he answered you cannot think  all that you can do is to say yes no yes no  and he left me to imagine his responsibilities  i am sure he will hold out to the end and will smile me a friendly farewell from the door of his office which is also his diningroom as i know from often disturbing him at his meals there  i have no fear of the waiters either or of the little errandboys who wear suits of sailor blue and touch their foreheads when they bring you your letters like so many ancient seadogs  i do not know why the elevatorboy prefers a suit of snuffcolor but i know that he will salute us as we step out of his elevator for the last time as unfalteringly as if we had just arrived at the beginning of the summer     iv  it is our last day in the hotel at scheveningen and i will try to recall in their pathetic order the events of the final week  nothing has been stranger throughout than the fluctuation of the guests at times they have dwindled to so small a number that one must reckon chiefly upon their quality for consolation at other times they swelled to such a tide as to overflow the table long or short at dinner and eddy round a second board beside it  there have been nights when i have walked down the long corridor to my seaward room through a harking solitude of empty chambers there have been mornings when i have come out to breakfast past doormats cheerful with boots of both sexes and door post hooks where dangling coats and trousers peopled the place with a lively if a somewhat flaccid semblance of human presence  the worst was that when some one went we lost a friend and when some one came we only won a stranger  among the first to go were the kindly english folk whose acquaintance we made across the table the first night and who took with them so large a share of our facile affections that we quite forgot the ancestral enmities and grieved for them as much as if they had been americans there have been in fact no americans here but ourselves and we have done what we could with the germans who spoke english  the nicest of these were a charming family from f father and mother and son and daughter with whom we had a pleasant week of dinners  at the very first we disagreed with the parents so amicably about ibsen and sudermann that i was almost sorry to have the son take our modern side of the controversy and declare himself an admirer of those authors with us our frank literary difference established a kindness between us that was strengthened by our community of english and when they went they left us to the sympathy of another german family with whom we had mainly our humanity in common  they spoke no english and i only a german which they must have understood with their hearts rather than their heads since it consisted chiefly of goodwill  but in the air of their sweet natures it flourished surprisingly and sufficed each day for praise of the weather after it began to be fine and at parting for some fond regrets not unmixed with philosophical reflections sadly perplexed in the genders and the order of the verbs with me the verb will seldom wait as it should in german to the end  both of these families very different in social tradition i fancied were one in the amiability which makes the alien forgive so much militarism to the german nation and hope for its final escape from the drillsergeant  when they went we were left for some meals to our own american tongue with a brief interval of that english painter and his wife with whom we spoke our language as nearly like english as we could  then followed a desperate lunch and dinner where an unbroken forest of german and a still more impenetrable morass of dutch hemmed us in  but last night it was our joy to be addressed in our own speech by a lady who spoke it as admirably as our dear friends from f  she was dutch and when she found we were americans she praised our historian motley and told us how his portrait is gratefully honored with a place in the queens palace the house in the woods near scheveningen     v  she had come up from her place in the country four hours away for the last of the concerts here which have been given throughout the summer by the best orchestra in europe and which have been thronged every afternoon and evening by people from the hague  one honored day this week even the queen and the queen mother came down to the concert and gave us incomparably the greatest event of our waning season  i had noticed all the morning a floral perturbation about the main entrance of the hotel which settled into the form of banks of autumnal bloom on either side of the specially carpeted stairs and put forth on the roof of the arcade in a crown much bigger round than a barrel of orangecolored asters in honor of the queens ancestral house of orange  flags of blue white and red fluttered nervously about in the breeze from the sea and imparted to us an agreeable anxiety not to miss seeing the queens as the dutch succinctly call their sovereign and her parent and at three oclock we saw them drive up to the hotel certain officials in civil dress stood at the door of the concertroom to usher the queens in and a bareheaded baldheaded dignity of military figure backed up the stairs before them  i would not rashly commit myself to particulars concerning their dress but i am sure that the elder queen wore black and the younger white  the mother has one of the best and wisest faces i have seen any woman wear and most of the good wise faces in this imperfectly balanced world are womens and the daughter one of the sweetest and prettiest  pretty is the word for her face and it showed pink through her blond veil as she smiled and bowed right and left her features are small and fine and she is not above the middle height  as soon as she had passed into the concertroom we who had waited to see her go in ran round to another door and joined the two or three thousand people who were standing to receive the queens  these had already mounted to the royal box and they stood there while the orchestra played one of the dutch national airs  one air is not enough for the dutch they must have two  then the mother faded somewhere into the background and the daughter sat alone in the front on a gilt throne with a gilt crown at top and a very uncomfortable carved gothic back she looked so young so gentle and so good that the rudest republican could not have helped wishing her well out of a position so essentially and irreparably false as a hereditary sovereigns  one forgot in the presence of her innocent seventeen years that most of the ruling princes of the world had left it the worse for their having been in it at moments one forgot her altogether as a princess and saw her only as a charming young girl who had to sit up rather stiffly  at the end of the programme the queens rose and walked slowly out while the orchestra played the other national air     vi  i call them the queens because the dutch do and i like holland so much that i should hate to differ with the dutch in anything  but as a matter of fact they are neither of them quite queens the mother is the regent and the daughter will not be crowned till next year  but such as they are they imparted a supreme emotion to our dying season and thrilled the hotel with a fulness of summer life  since they went the season faintly pulses and respires so that one can just say that it is still alive  last sunday was fine and great crowds came down from the hague to the concert and spread out on the seaward terrace of the hotel around the little tables which i fancied that the waiters had each morning wiped dry of the dew from a mere dutch desire of cleaning something  the hooded chairs covered the beach the children played in the edges of the surf and delved in the sand the lovers wandered up into the hollows of the dunes  there was only the human life however  i have looked in vain for the crabs big and little that swarm on the long island shore and there are hardly any gulls even perhaps because there are no crabs for them to eat if they eat crabs i never saw gulls doing it but they must eat something  dogs there are of course wherever there are people but they are part of the human life  dutch dogs are in fact very human and one i saw yesterday behaved quite as badly as a bad boy with respect to his muzzle  he did not like his muzzle and by dint of turning somersaults in the sand he got it off and went frolicking to his master in triumph to show him what he had done     vii  it is now the last day and the desolation is thickening upon our hotel this morning the doorposts up and down my corridor showed not a single pair of trousers not a pair of boots flattered the lonely doormats  in the lower hall i found the tables of the great diningroom assembled and the chairs inverted on them with their legs in the air but decently decorously not with the reckless abandon displayed by the chairs in our long island hotel for weeks before it closed  in the smaller diningroom the table was set for lunch as if we were to go on dining there forever in the breakfastroom the service and the provision were as perfect as ever  the coffee was good the bread delicious the butter of an unfaltering sweetness and the glaze of wear on the polished dresscoats of the waiters as respectable as it could have been on the first day of the season  all was correct and if of a funereal correctness to me i am sure this effect was purely subjective  the little bellboys in sailor suits perhaps they ought to be spelled bellbuoys clustered about the elevatorboy like so many roman sentinels at their posts the elevatorboy and his elevator were ready to take us up or down at any moment  the portier and i ignored together the hour of parting which we had definitely ascertained and agreed upon and we exchanged some compliments to the weather which is now settled as if we expected to enjoy it long together  i rather dread going in to lunch however for i fear the empty places     viii  all is over we are off  the lunch was an heroic effort of the hotel to hide the fact of our separation  it was perfect unless the boiled beef was a confession of human weakness but even this boiled beef was exquisite and the horseradish that went with it was so mellowed by art that it checked rather than provoked the parting tear  the table dhote had reserved a final surprise for us and when we sat down with the fear of nothing but german around us we heard the sound of our own speech from the pleasantest english pair we had yet encountered and the travelling english are pleasant i will say it who am said by sir walter besant to be the only american who hates their nation  it was really an added pang to go on their account but the carriage was waiting at the door the domestique had already carried our baggage to the steamtram station the kindly menial train formed around us for an ultimate douceur and we were off after the portier had shut us into our vehicle and touched his ofttouched cap for the last time while the hotel facade dissembled its grief by architecturally smiling in the soft dutch sun  i liked this manner of leaving better than carrying part of my own baggage to the train as i had to do on long island though that too had its charm the charm of the whole fresh pungent american life which at this distance is so dear     end of this project gutenberg etext of last days in a dutch hotel by william dean howells       literature and lifesome anomalies of the short story  by william dean howells    some anomalies of the short story   the interesting experiment of one of our great publishing houses in putting out serially several volumes of short stories with the hope that a courageous persistence may overcome the popular indifference to such collections when severally administered suggests some questions as to this eldest form of fiction which i should like to ask the readers patience with  i do not know that i shall be able to answer them or that i shall try to do so the vitality of a question that is answered seems to exhale in the event it palpitates no longer curiosity flutters away from the faded flower which is fit then only to be folded away in the hortus siccus of accomplished facts  in view of this i may wish merely to state the problems and leave them for the readers solution or more amusingly for his mystification     i  one of the most amusing questions concerning the short story is why a form which is singly so attractive that every one likes to read a short story when he finds it alone is collectively so repellent as it is said to be  before now i have imagined the case to be somewhat the same as that of a number of pleasant people who are most acceptable as separate householders but who lose caste and cease to be desirable acquaintances when gathered into a boardinghouse  yet the case is not the same quite for we see that the short story where it is ranged with others of its species within the covers of a magazine is so welcome that the editor thinks his number the more brilliant the more short story writers he can call about his board or under the roof of his pension  here the boardinghouse analogy breaks breaks so signally that i was lately moved to ask a distinguished editor why a book of short stories usually failed and a magazine usually succeeded because of them  he answered gayly that the short stories in most books of them were bad that where they were good they went and he alleged several wellknown instances in which books of prime short stories had a great vogue  he was so handsomely interested in my inquiry that i could not well say i thought some of the short stories which he had boasted in his last number were indifferent good and yet as he allowed had mainly helped sell it  i had in mind many books of short stories of the first excellence which had failed as decidedly as those others had succeeded for no reason that i could see possibly there is really no reason in any literary success or failure that can be predicted or applied in another base  i could name these books if it would serve any purpose but in my doubt i will leave the reader to think of them for i believe that his indolence or intellectual reluctance is largely to blame for the failure of good books of short stories  he is commonly so averse to any imaginative exertion that he finds it a hardship to respond to that peculiar demand which a book of good short stories makes upon him  he can read one good short story in a magazine with refreshment and a pleasant sense of excitement in the sort of spur it gives to his own constructive faculty  but if this is repeated in ten or twenty stories he becomes fluttered and exhausted by the draft upon his energies whereas a continuous fiction of the same quantity acts as an agreeable sedative  a condition that the short story tacitly makes with the reader through its limitations is that he shall subjectively fill in the details and carry out the scheme which in its small dimensions the story can only suggest and the greater number of readers find this too much for their feeble powers while they cannot resist the incitement to attempt it  my theory does not wholly account for the fact no theory wholly accounts for any fact and i own that the same objections would lie from the reader against a number of short stories in a magazine  but it may be that the effect is not the same in the magazine because of the variety in the authorship and because it would be impossibly jolting to read all the short stories in a magazine seriatim  on the other hand the identity of authorship gives a continuity of attraction to the short stories in a book which forms that exhausting strain upon the imagination of the involuntary copartner     ii  then what is the solution as to the form of publication for short stories since people do not object to them singly but collectively and not in variety but in identity of authorship  are they to be printed only in the magazines or are they to be collected in volumes combining a variety of authorship  rather i could wish it might be found feasible to purvey them in some pretty shape where each would appeal singly to the reader and would not exhaust him in the subjective afterwork required of him  in this event many short stories now cramped into undue limits by the editorial exigencies of the magazines might expand to greater length and breadth and without ceasing to be each a short story might not make so heavy a demand upon the subliminal forces of the reader  if any one were to say that all this was a little fantastic i should not contradict him but i hope there is some reason in it if reason can help the short story to greater favor for it is a form which i have great pleasure in as a reader and pride in as an american  if we have not excelled all other moderns in it we have certainly excelled in it possibly because we are in the period of our literary development which corresponds to that of other peoples when the short story preeminently flourished among them  but when one has said a thing like this it immediately accuses one of loose and inaccurate statement and requires one to refine upon it either for ones own peace of conscience or for ones safety from the thoughtful reader  i am not much afraid of that sort of reader for he is very rare but i do like to know myself what i mean if i mean anything in particular  in this instance i am obliged to ask myself whether our literary development can be recognized separately from that of the whole english speaking world  i think it can though as i am always saying american literature is merely a condition of english literature  in some sense every european literature is a condition of some other european literature yet the impulse in each eventuates if it does not originate indigenously  a younger literature will choose by a sort of natural selection some things for assimilation from an elder literature for no more apparent reason than it will reject other things and it will transform them in the process so that it will give them the effect of indigeneity  the short story among the italians who called it the novella and supplied us with the name devoted solely among us to fiction of epical magnitude refined indefinitely upon the greek romance if it derived from that it retrenched itself in scope and enlarged itself in the variety of its types  but still these remained types and they remained types with the french imitators of the italian novella  it was not till the spaniards borrowed the form of the novella and transplanted it to their racier soil that it began to bear character and to fruit in the richness of their picaresque fiction  when the english borrowed it they adapted it in the metrical tales of chaucer to the genius of their nation which was then both poetical and humorous  here it was full of character too and more and more personality began to enlarge the bounds of the conventional types and to imbue fresh ones  but in so far as the novella was studied in the italian sources the french spanish and english literatures were conditions of italian literature as distinctly though of course not so thoroughly as american literature is a condition of english literature  each borrower gave a national cast to the thing borrowed and that is what has happened with us in the full measure that our nationality has differenced itself from the english  whatever truth there is in all this and i will confess that a good deal of it seems to me hardy conjecture rather favors my position that we are in some such period of our literary development as those other peoples when the short story flourished among them  or if i restrict our claim i may safely claim that they abundantly had the novella when they had not the novel at all and we now abundantly have the novella while we have the novel only subordinately and of at least no such quantitative importance as the english french spanish norwegians russians and some others of our esteemed contemporaries not to name the italians  we surpass the germans who like ourselves have as distinctly excelled in the modern novella as they have fallen short in the novel  or if i may not quite say this i will make bold to say that i can think of many german novelle that i should like to read again but scarcely one german novel and i could honestly say the same of american novelle though not of american novels     iii  the abeyance not to say the desuetude that the novella fell into for several centuries is very curious and fully as remarkable as the modern rise of the short story  it began to prevail in the dramatic form for a play is a short story put on the stage it may have satisfied in that form the early love of it and it has continued to please in that form but in its original shape it quite vanished unless we consider the little studies and sketches and allegories of the spectator and tatler and idler and rambler and their imitations on the continent as guises of the novella  the germ of the modern short story may have survived in these or in the metrical form of the novella which appeared in chaucer and never wholly disappeared  with crabbe the novella became as distinctly the short story as it has become in the hands of miss wilkins but it was not till our time that its great merit as a form was felt for until our time so great work was never done with it  i remind myself of boccaccio and of the arabian nights without the wish to hedge from my bold stand  they are all elemental compared with some finer modern work which deepens inward immeasurably they are all of their superficial limits  they amuse but they do not hold the mind and stamp it with large and profound impressions  an occidental cannot judge the literary quality of the eastern tales but i will own my suspicion that the perfection of the italian work is philological rather than artistic while the web woven by mr james or miss jewett by kielland or bjornson by maupassant by palacio valdes by giovanni verga by tourguenief in one of those little frames seems to me of an exquisite color and texture and of an entire literary preciousness not only as regards the diction but as regards those more intangible graces of form those virtues of truth and reality and those lasting significances which distinguish the masterpiece  the novella has in fact been carried so far in the short story that it might be asked whether it had not left the novel behind as to perfection of form though one might not like to affirm this  yet there have been but few modern fictions of the novels dimensions which have the beauty of form many a novella embodies  is this because it is easier to give form in the small than in the large or only because it is easier to hide formlessness  it is easier to give form in the novella than in the novel because the design of less scope can be more definite and because the persons and facts are fewer and each can be more carefully treated but on the other hand the slightest error in execution shows more in the small than in the large and a fault of conception is more evident the novella must be clearly imagined above all things for there is no room in it for those felicities of characterization or comment by which the artist of faltering design saves himself in the novel     iv  the question as to where the short story distinguishes itself from the anecdote is of the same nature as that which concerns the bound set between it and the novel  in both cases the difference of the novella is in the motive or the origination  the anecdote is too palpably simple and single to be regarded as a novella though there is now and then a novella like the father by bjornson which is of the actual brevity of the anecdote but which when released in the readers consciousness expands to dramatic dimensions impossible to the anecdote  many anecdotes have come down from antiquity but not i believe one short story at least in prose and the italians if they did not invent the story gave us something most sensibly distinguishable from the classic anecdote in the novella  the anecdote offers an illustration of character or records a moment of action the novella embodies a drama and develops a type  it is not quite so clear as to when and where a piece of fiction ceases to be a novella and becomes a novel  the frontiers are so vague that one is obliged to recognize a middle species or rather a middle magnitude which paradoxically but necessarily enough we call the novelette first we have the short story or novella then we have the long story or novel and between these we have the novelette which is in name a smaller than the short story though it is in point of fact two or three times longer than a short story  we may realize them physically if we will adopt the magazine parlance and speak of the novella as a onenumber story of the novel as a serial and of the novelette as a twonumber or a threenumber story if it passes the threenumber limit it seems to become a novel  as a twonumber or threenumber story it is the despair of editors and publishers  the interest of so brief a serial will not mount sufficiently to carry strongly over from month to month when the tale is completed it will not make a book which the trade inexorable force cares to handle  it is therefore still awaiting its authoritative avatar which it will be some ones prosperity and glory to imagine for in the novelette are possibilities for fiction as yet scarcely divined  the novelette can have almost as perfect form as the novella  in fact the novel has form in the measure that it approaches the novelette and some of the most symmetrical modern novels are scarcely more than novelettes like tourgueniefs dmitri rudine or his smoke or spring floods  the vicar of wakefield the father of the modern novel is scarcely more than a novelette and i have sometimes fancied but no doubt vainly that the ultimated novel might be of the dimensions of hamlet  if any one should say there was not room in hamlet for the character and incident requisite in a novel i should be ready to answer that there seemed a good deal of both in hamlet  but no doubt there are other reasons why the novel should not finally be of the length of hamlet and i must not let my enthusiasm for the novelette carry me too far or rather bring me up too short  i am disposed to dwell upon it i suppose because it has not yet shared the favor which the novella and the novel have enjoyed and because until somebody invents a way for it to the public it cannot prosper like the onenumber story or the serial  i should like to say as my last word for it here that i believe there are many novels which if stripped of their padding would turn out to have been all along merely novelettes in disguise  it does not follow however that there are many novelle which if they were duly padded would be found novelettes  in that dim subjective region where the aesthetic origins present themselves almost with the authority of inspirations there is nothing clearer than the difference between the shortstory motive and the longstory motive  one if one is in that line of work feels instinctively just the size and carrying power of the given motive  or if the reader prefers a different figure the mind which the seed has been dropped into from somewhere is mystically aware whether the seed is going to grow up a bush or is going to grow up a tree if left to itself  of course the mind to which the seed is intrusted may play it false and wilfully dwarf the growth or force it to unnatural dimensions but the critical observer will easily detect the fact of such treasons  almost in the first germinal impulse the inventive mind forefeels the ultimate difference and recognizes the essential simplicity or complexity of the motive  there will be a prophetic subdivision into a variety of motives and a multiplication of characters and incidents and situations or the original motive will be divined indivisible and there will be a small group of people immediately interested and controlled by a single or predominant fact the uninspired may contend that this is bosh and i own that something might be said for their contention but upon the whole i think it is gospel  the right novel is never a congeries of novelle as might appear to the uninspired  if it indulges even in episodes it loses in reality and vitality  it is one stock from which its various branches put out and form it a living growth identical throughout  the right novella is never a novel cropped back from the size of a tree to a bush or the branch of a tree stuck into the ground and made to serve for a bush  it is another species destined by the agencies at work in the realm of unconsciousness to be brought into being of its own kind and not of another     v  this was always its case but in the process of time the short story while keeping the natural limits of the primal novella if ever there was one has shown almost limitless possibilities within them  it has shown itself capable of imparting the effect of every sort of intention whether of humor or pathos of tragedy or comedy or broad farce or delicate irony of character or action  the thing that first made itself known as a little tale usually salacious dealing with conventionalized types and conventionalized incidents has proved itself possibly the most flexible of all the literary forms in its adaptation to the needs of the mind that wishes to utter itself inventively or constructively upon some fresh occasion or wishes briefly to criticise or represent some phase or fact of life  the riches in this shape of fiction are effectively inestimable if we consider what has been done in the short story and is still doing everywhere  the good novels may be easily counted but the good novelle since boccaccio began if it was he that first began to make them cannot be computed  in quantity they are inexhaustible and in quality they are wonderfully satisfying  then why is it that so very very few of the most satisfactory of that innumerable multitude stay by you as the country people say in characterization or action  how hard it is to recall a person or a fact out of any of them out of the most signally good  we seem to be delightfully nourished as we read but is it after all a full meal  we become of a perfect intimacy and a devoted friendship with the men and women in the short stories but not apparently of a lasting acquaintance  it is a single meeting we have with them and though we instantly love or hate them dearly recurrence and repetition seem necessary to that familiar knowledge in which we hold the personages in a novel  it is here that the novella so much more perfect in form shows its irremediable inferiority to the novel and somehow to the play to the very farce which it may quantitatively excel  we can all recall by name many characters out of comedies and farces but how many characters out of short stories can we recall  most persons of the drama give themselves away by name for types mere figments of allegory and perhaps oblivion is the penalty that the novella pays for the fineness of its characterizations but perhaps also the dramatic form has greater facilities for repetition and so can stamp its persons more indelibly on the imagination than the narrative form in the same small space  the narrative must give to description what the drama trusts to representation but this cannot account for the superior permanency of the dramatic types in so great measure as we might at first imagine for they remain as much in mind from reading as from seeing the plays  it is possible that as the novella becomes more conscious its persons will become more memorable but as it is though we now vividly and with lasting delight remember certain short stories we scarcely remember by name any of the people in them  i may be risking too much in offering an instance but who in even such signal instances as the revolt of mother by miss wilkins or the dulham ladies by miss jewett can recall by name the characters that made them delightful     vi  the defect of the novella which we have been acknowledging seems an essential limitation but perhaps it is not insuperable and we may yet have short stories which shall supply the delighted imagination with creations of as much immortality as we can reasonably demand  the structural change would not be greater than the moral or material change which has been wrought in it since it began as a yarn gross and palpable which the narrator spun out of the coarsest and often the filthiest stuff to snare the thick fancy or amuse the lewd leisure of listeners willing as children to have the same persons and the same things over and over again  now it has not only varied the persons and things but it has refined and verified them in the direction of the natural and the supernatural until it is above all other literary forms the vehicle of reality and spirituality  when one thinks of a bit of mr jamess psychology in this form or a bit of vergas or kiellands sociology or a bit of miss jewetts exquisite veracity one perceives the immense distance which the short story has come on the way to the height it has reached  it serves equally the ideal and the real that which it is loath to serve is the unreal so that among the short stories which have recently made reputations for their authors very few are of that peculiar cast which we have no name for but romanticistic  the only distinguished modern writer of romanticistic novelle whom i can think of is mr bret harte and he is of a period when romanticism was so imperative as to be almost a condition of fiction  i am never so enamoured of a cause that i will not admit facts that seem to tell against it and i will allow that this writer of romanticistic short stories has more than any other supplied us with memorable types and characters  we remember mr john oakhurst by name we remember kentuck and tennessees partner at least by nickname and we remember their several qualities  these figures if we cannot quite consent that they are persons exist in our memories by force of their creators imagination and at the moment i cannot think of any others that do out of the myriad of american short stories except rip van winkle out of irvings legend of sleepy hollow and marjorie daw out of mr aldrichs famous little caprice of that title and mr jamess daisy miller  it appears to be the fact that those writers who have first distinguished themselves in the novella have seldom written novels of prime order mr kipling is an eminent example but mr kipling has yet a long life before him in which to upset any theory about him and one can only instance him provisionally  on the other hand one can be much more confident that the best novelle have been written by the greatest novelists conspicuously maupassant verga bjornson mr thomas hardy mr james mr cable tourguenief tolstoy valdes not to name others these have in fact all done work so good in this form that one is tempted to call it their best work  it is really not their best but it is work so good that it ought to have equal acceptance with their novels if that distinguished editor was right who said that short stories sold well when they were good short stories  that they ought to do so is so evident that a devoted reader of them to whom i was submitting the anomaly the other day insisted that they did  i could only allege the testimony of publishers and authors to the contrary and this did not satisfy him  it does not satisfy me and i wish that the general reader with whom the fault lies could be made to say why if he likes one short story by itself and four short stories in a magazine he does not like or will not have a dozen short stories in a book  this was the baffling question which i began with and which i find myself forced to end with after all the light i have thrown upon the subject  i leave it where i found it but perhaps that is a good deal for a critic to do  if i had left it anywhere else the reader might not feel bound to deal with it practically by reading all the books of short stories he could lay hands on and either divining why he did not enjoy them or else forever foregoing his prejudice against them because of his pleasure in them     end of this project gutenberg etext of some anomalies of the short story by william dean howells       literature and lifespanish prisoners of war  by william dean howells    spanish prisoners of war   certain summers ago our cruisers the st louis and the harvard arrived at portsmouth new hampshire with sixteen or seventeen hundred spanish prisoners from santiago de cuba  they were partly soldiers of the land forces picked up by our troops in the fights before the city but by far the greater part were sailors and marines from cerveras illfated fleet i have not much stomach for war but the poetry of the fact i have stated made a very potent appeal to me on my literary side and i did not hold out against it longer than to let the st louis get away with cervera to annapolis when only her less dignified captives remained with those of the harvard to feed either the vainglory or the pensive curiosity of the spectator  then i went over from our summer colony to kittery point and got a boat and sailed out to have a look at these subordinate enemies in the first hours of their imprisonment     i  it was an afternoon of the brilliancy known only to an afternoon of the american summer and the water of the swift piscataqua river glittered in the sun with a really incomparable brilliancy  but nothing could light up the great monster of a ship painted the dismal leadcolor which our white squadrons put on with the outbreak of the war and she lay sullen in the stream with a look of ponderous repose to which the activities of the coalingbarges at her side and of the sailors washing her decks seemed quite unrelated  a long gun forward and a long gun aft threatened the fleet of launches tugs dories and catboats which fluttered about her but the harvard looked tired and bored and seemed as if asleep she had in fact finished her mission  the captives whom death had released had been carried out and sunk in the sea those who survived to a further imprisonment had all been taken to the pretty island a mile farther up in the river where the tide rushes back and forth through the narrows like a torrent  its defiant rapidity has won it there the graphic name of pullandbedamned and we could only hope to reach the island by a series of skilful tacks which should humor both the wind and the tide both dead against us  our boatman one of those shore new englanders who are born with a knowledge of sailing was easily master of the art of this but it took time and gave me more than the leisure i wanted for trying to see the shore with the strange eyes of the captives who had just looked upon it  it was beautiful i had to own even in my quality of exile and prisoner  the meadows and the orchards came down to the water or where the wandering line of the land was broken and lifted in black fronts of rock they crept to the edge of the cliff and peered over it  a summer hotel stretched its verandas along a lovely level everywhere in clovery hollows and on breezy knolls were gray old farm houses and summer cottageslike weatherbeaten birds nests and like freshly painted martenboxes but all of a cold new england neatness which made me homesick for my malodorous spanish fishingvillage shambling down in stony lanes to the warm tides of my native seas  here every place looked as if it had been newly scrubbed with soap and water and rubbed down with a coarse towel and was of an antipathetic alertness  the sweet keen breeze made me shiver and the northern sky from which my blinding southern sun was blazing was as hard as sapphire i tried to bewilder myself in the ignorance of a catalonian or asturian fisherman and to wonder with his darkened mind why it should all or any of it have been and why i should have escaped from the iron hell in which i had fought no quarrel of my own to fall into the hands of strangers and to be haled over seas to these alien shores for a captivity of unknown term  but i need not have been at so much pains the intelligence i do not wish to boast of an american author would have sufficed for if there is anything more grotesque than another in war it is its monstrous inconsequence  if we had a grief with the spanish government and if it was so mortal we must do murder for it we might have sent a joint committee of the house and senate and with the improved means of assassination which modern science has put at our command killed off the spanish cabinet and even the queenmother and the little king  this would have been consequent logical and in a sort reasonable but to butcher and capture a lot of wretched spanish peasants and fishermen hapless conscripts to whom personally and nationally we were as so many men in the moon was that melancholy and humiliating necessity of war which makes it homicide in which there is not even the saving grace of hate or the excuse of hot blood  i was able to console myself perhaps a little better for the captivity of the spaniards than if i had really been one of them as we drew nearer and nearer their prison isle and it opened its knotty points and little ravines overrun with sweetfern blueberrybushes bay and low blackberryvines and rigidly traversed with a high stockade of yellow pine boards  six or eight long low wooden barracks stretched side by side across the general slope with the captive officers quarters sheathed in weatherproof black paper at one end of them  about their doors swarmed the common prisoners spilling out over the steps and on the grass where some of them lounged smoking  one operatic figure in a long blanket stalked athwart an open space but there was such poverty of drama in the spectacle at the distance we were keeping that we were glad of so much as a shirtsleeved contractor driving out of the stockade in his buggy  on the heights overlooking the enclosure gatling guns were posted at three or four points and every thirty or forty feet sentries met and parted so indifferent to us apparently that we wondered if we might get nearer we ventured but at a certain moment a sentry called to us fifty yards off please  our young skipper answered all right and as the sentry had a gun on his shoulder which we had every reason to believe was loaded it was easily our pleasure to retreat to the specified limit  in fact we came away altogether after that so little promise was there of our being able to satisfy our curiosity further we came away care fully nursing such impression as we had got of a spec tacle whose historical quality we did our poor best to feel  it related us after solicitation to the wars against the moors against the mexicans and peruvians against the dutch to the italian campaigns of the gran capitan to the siege of florence to the sack of rome to the wars of the spanish succession and what others  i do not deny that there was a certain aesthetic joy in having the spanish prisoners there for this effect we came away duly grateful for what we had seen of them and we had long duly resigned ourselves to seeing no more when word was sent to us that our young skipper had got a permit to visit the island and wished us to go with him     ii  it was just such another afternoon when we went again but this time we took the joyous trolleycar and bounded and pirouetted along as far as the navyyard of kittery and there we dismounted and walked among the vast ghostly shipsheds so long empty of ships  the grass grew in the kittery navyyard but it was all the pleasanter for the grass and those pale silent sheds were far more impressive in their silence than they would have been if resonant with saw and hammer  at several points an unarmed marine left his leisure somewhere and lunged across our path with a mute appeal for our permit but we were nowhere delayed till we came to the office where it had to be countersigned and after that we had presently crossed a bridge by shady rustic ways and were on the prison island  here if possible the sense of something pastoral deepened a man driving a file of cows passed before us under kindly trees and the bell which the foremost of these milky mothers wore about her silken throat sent forth its clear tender note as if from the depth of some grassy bosk and instantly witched me away to the woodspastures which my boyhood knew in southern ohio  even when we got to what seemed fortifications they turned out to be the walls of an old reservoir and bore on their gate a paternal warning that children unaccompanied by adults were not allowed within  we mounted some stone steps over this portal and were met by a young marine who left his gatling gun for a moment to ask for our permit and then went back satisfied  then we found ourselves in the presence of a sentry with a rifle on his shoulder who was rather more exacting still he only wished to be convinced and when he had pointed out the headquarters where we were next to go he let us over his beat  at the headquarters there was another sentry equally serious but equally civil and with the intervention of an orderly our leader saw the officer of the day  he came out of the quarters looking rather blank for he had learned that his pass admitted our party to the lines but not to the stockade which we might approach at a certain point of vantage and look over into but not penetrate  we resigned ourselves as we must and made what we could of the nearest prison barrack whose door overflowed and whose windows swarmed with swarthy captives  here they were at such close quarters that their black eager eyes easily pierced the pockets full of cigarettes which we had brought for them  they looked mostly very young and there was one smiling rogue at the first window who was obviously prepared to catch anything thrown to him  he caught in fact the first box of cigarettes shied over the stockade the next box flew open and spilled its precious contents outside the deadline under the window where i hope some compassionate guard gathered them up and gave them to the captives  our fellows looked capable of any kindness to their wards short of letting them go  they were a most friendly company with an effect of picnicking there among the sweetfern and blueberries where they had pitched their wooden tents with as little disturbance to the shrubbery as possible  they were very polite to us and when after that misadventure with the cigarettes i had put our young leader up to throwing the box merely supplying the corpus delicti myself i wandered vaguely towards a gatling gun planted on an earthen platform where the laurel and the dogroses had been cut away for it the man in charge explained with a smile of apology that i must not pass a certain path i had already crossed  one always accepts the apologies of a man with a gatling gun to back them and i retreated  that seemed the end and we were going crestfallenly away when the officer of the day came out and allowed us to make his acquaintance  he permitted us with laughing reluctance to learn that he had been in the fight at santiago and had come with the prisoners and he was most obligingly sorry that our permit did not let us into the stockade  i said i had some cigarettes for the prisoners and i supposed i might send them in but he said he could not allow this for they had money to buy tobacco and he answered another of our party who had not a soul above buttons and who asked if she could get one from the spaniards that so far from promoting her wish he would have been obliged to take away any buttons she might have got from them  the fact is he explained youve come to the wrong end for transactions in buttons and tobacco  but perhaps innocence so great as ours had wrought upon him  when we said we were going and thanked him for his unavailing goodwill he looked at his watch and said they were just going to feed the prisoners and after some parley he suddenly called out music of the guard instead of a regimental band which i had supposed summoned a single corporal ran out the barracks touching his cap  take this party round to the gate the officer said and he promised us that he would see us there and hoped we would not mind a rough walk  we could have answered that to see his prisoners fed we would wade through fathoms of redtape but in fact we were arrested at the last point by nothing worse than the barbed wire which fortified the outer gate  here two marines were willing to tell us how well the prisoners lived while we stared into the stockade through an inner gate of plank which was run back for us  they said the spaniards had a breakfast of coffee and hash or stew and potatoes and a dinner of soup and roast and now at five oclock they were to have bread and coffee which indeed we saw the whitecapped whitejacketed cooks bringing out in huge tin washboilers our marines were of opinion and no doubt rightly that these poor spaniards had never known in their lives before what it was to have full stomachs  but the marines said they never acknowledged it and the one who had a german accent intimated that gratitude was not a virtue of any roman i suppose he meant latin people  but i do not know that if i were a prisoner for no fault of my own i should be very explicitly thankful for being unusually well fed  i thought or i think now that a fig or a bunch of grapes would have been more acceptable to me under my own vine and figtree than the stew and roast of captors who were indeed showing themselves less my enemies than my own government but were still not quite my hosts     iii  how is it the great pieces of good luck fall to us  the clock strikes twelve as it strikes two and with no more premonition  as we stood there expecting nothing better of it than three at the most it suddenly struck twelve  our officer appeared at the inner gate and bade our marines slide away the gate of barbed wire and let us into the enclosure where he welcomed us to seats on the grass against the stockade with many polite regrets that the tough little knots of earth beside it were not chairs  the prisoners were already filing out of their quarters at a rapid trot towards the benches where those great washboilers of coffee were set each man had a soupplate and bowl of enamelled tin and each in his turn received quarter of a loaf of fresh bread and a big ladleful of steaming coffee which he made off with to his place at one of the long tables under a shed at the side of the stockade  one young fellow tried to get a place not his own in the shade and our officer when he came back explained that he was a guerrillero and rather unruly  we heard that eight of the prisoners were in irons by sentence of their own officers for misconduct but all save this guerrillero here were docile and obedient enough and seemed only too glad to get peacefully at their bread and coffee  first among them came the men of the cristobal colon and these were the best looking of all the captives  from their pretty fair average the others varied to worse and worse till a very scrub lot said to be ex convicts brought up the rear  they were nearly all little fellows and very dark though here and there a sixfooter towered up or a blond showed among them  they were joking and laughing together harmlessly enough but i must own that they looked a crew of rather sorry jail birds though whether any run of humanity clad in misfits of our navy blue and white and other chance garments with closeshaven heads and sometimes bare feet would have looked much less like jailbirds i am not sure  still they were not prepossessing and though some of them were pathetically young they had none of the charm of boyhood  no doubt they did not do themselves justice and to be herded there like cattle did not improve their chances of making a favorable impression on the observer they were kindly used by our officer and his subordinates who mixed among them and straightened out the confusion they got into at times and perhaps sometimes wilfully  their guards employed a few handy words of spanish with them where these did not avail they took them by the arm and directed them but i did not hear a harsh tone and i saw no violence or even so much indignity offered them as the ordinary trolley car passenger is subjected to in broadway  at a certain buglecall they dispersed when they had finished their bread and coffee and scattered about over the grass or returned to their barracks  we were told that these children of the sun dreaded its heat and kept out of it whenever they could even in its decline but they seemed not so much to withdraw and hide themselves from that as to vanish into the history of old unhappy faroff times where prisoners of war properly belong  i roused myself with a start as if i had lost them in the past  our officer came towards us and said gayly well you have seen the animals fed and let us take our grateful leave  i think we were rather a loss in our going to the marines who seemed glad of a chance to talk  i am sure we were a loss to the man on guard at the inner gate who walked his beat with reluctance when it took him from us and eagerly when it brought him back  then he delayed for a rapid and comprehensive exchange of opinions and ideas successfully blending military subordination with american equality in his manner  the whole thing was very american in the perfect decorum and the utter absence of ceremony  those good fellows were in the clothes they wore through the fights at santiago and they could not have put on much splendor if they had wished but apparently they did not wish  they were simple straightforward and adequate  there was some dry joking about the superiority of the prisoners rations and lodgings and our officer ironically professed his intention of messing with the spanish officers but there was no grudge and not a shadow of ill will or of that stupid and atrocious hate towards the public enemy which abominable newspapers and politicians had tried to breed in the popular mind  there was nothing manifest but a sort of cheerful purpose to live up to that military ideal of duty which is so much nobler than the civil ideal of selfinterest  perhaps duty will yet become the civil ideal when the peoples shall have learned to live for the common good and are united for the operation of the industries as they now are for the hostilities     iv  shall i say that a sense of something domestic something homelike imparted itself from what i had seen  or was this more properly an effect from our visit on the way back to the hospital where a hundred and fifty of the prisoners lay sick of wounds and fevers  i cannot say that a humaner spirit prevailed here than in the camp it was only a more positive humanity which was at work  most of the sufferers were stretched on the clean cots of two long airy wooden shells which received them four days after the orders for their reception had come with every equipment for their comfort  at five oclock when we passed down the aisles between their beds many of them had a gay nonchalant effect of having toothpicks or cigarettes in their mouths but it was really the thermometers with which the nurses were taking their temperature  it suggested a possibility to me however and i asked if they were allowed to smoke and being answered that they did smoke anyway whenever they could i got rid at last of those boxes of cigarettes which had been burning my pockets as it were all afternoon i gave them to such as i was told were the most deserving among the sick captives but heaven knows i would as willingly have given them to the least  they took my largesse gravely as became spaniards one said smiling sadly muchas gracias but the others merely smiled sadly and i looked in vain for the response which would have twinkled up in the faces of even moribund italians at our looks of pity  italians would have met our sympathy halfway but these poor fellows were of another tradition and in fact not all the latin peoples are the same though we sometimes conveniently group them together for our detestation  perhaps there are even personal distinctions among their several nationalities and there are some spaniards who are as true and kind as some americans when we remember cortez let us not forget las casas  they lay in their beds there these little spanish men whose dark faces their sickness could not blanch to more than a sickly sallow and as they turned their dull black eyes upon us i must own that i could not support the government so fiercely as i might have done elsewhere  but the truth is i was demoralized by the looks of these poor little men who in spite of their character of public enemies did look so much like somebodys brothers and even somebodys children  i may have been infected by the air of compassion of scientific compassion which prevailed in the place  there it was as wholly business to be kind and to cure as in another branch of the service it was business to be cruel and to kill  how droll these things are  the surgeons had their favorites among the patients to all of whom they were equally devoted inarticulate friendships had sprung up between them and certain of their hapless foes whom they spoke of as a sort of pets  one of these was very useful in making the mutinous take their medicine another was liked apparently because he was so likable  at a certain cot the chief surgeon stopped and said we did not expect this boy to live through the night he took the boys wrist between his thumb and finger and asked tenderly as he leaned over him poco mejor  the boy could not speak to say that he was a little better he tried to smilesuch things do move the witness nor does the sight of a man whose bandaged cheek has been half chopped away by a machete tend to restore ones composure     end of this project gutenberg etext of spanish prisoners of war by william dean howells       literature and lifeamerican literary centers  by william dean howells    american literary centres   one of the facts which we americans have a difficulty in making clear to a rather inattentive world outside is that while we have apparently a literature of our own we have no literary centre  we have so much literature that from time to time it seems even to us we must have a literary centre  we say to ourselves with a good deal of logic where there is so much smoke there must be some fire or at least a fireplace but it is just here that misled by tradition and even by history we deceive ourselves  really we have no fireplace for such fire as we have kindled or if any one is disposed to deny this then i say we have a dozen fireplaces which is quite as bad so far as the notion of a literary centre is concerned if it is not worse  i once proved this fact to my own satisfaction in some papers which i wrote several years ago but it appears from a question which has lately come to me from england that i did not carry conviction quite so far as that island and i still have my work all before me if i understand the london friend who wishes a comparative view of the centres of literary production among us how and why they change how they stand at present and what is the relation for instance of boston to other such centres     i  here if i cut my coat according to my cloth t should have a garment which this whole volume would hardly stuff out with its form and i have a fancy that if i begin by answering as i have sometimes rather too succinctly done that we have no more a single literary centre than italy or than germany has or had before their unification i shall not be taken at my word  i shall be right all the same and if i am told that in those countries there is now a tendency to such a centre i can only say that there is none in this and that so far as i can see we get further every day from having such a centre  the fault if it is a fault grows upon us for the whole present tendency of american life is centrifugal and just so far as literature is the language of our life it shares this tendency  i do not attempt to say how it will be when in order to spread ourselves over the earth and convincingly to preach the blessings of our deeply incorporated civilization by the mouths of our eightinch guns the mind of the nation shall be politically centred at some capital that is the function of prophecy and i am only writing literary history on a very small scale with a somewhat crushing sense of limits  once twice thrice there was apparently an american literary centre at philadelphia from the time franklin went to live there until the death of charles brockden brown our first romancer then at new york during the period which may be roughly described as that of irving poe willis and bryant then at boston for the thirty or forty years illumined by the presence of longfellow lowell whittier hawthorne emerson holmes prescott parkman and many lesser lights  these are all still great publishing centres  if it were not that the house with the largest list of american authors was still at boston i should say new york was now the chief publishing centre but in the sense that london and paris or even madrid and petersburg are literary centres with a controlling influence throughout england and france spain and russia neither new york nor boston is now our literary centre whatever they may once have been  not to take philadelphia too seriously i may note that when new york seemed our literary centre irving alone among those who gave it lustre was a newyorker and he mainly lived abroad bryant who was a new englander was alone constant to the city of his adoption willis a bostonian and poe a marylander went and came as their poverty or their prosperity compelled or invited neither dwelt here unbrokenly and poe did not even die here though he often came near starving  one cannot then strictly speak of any early american literary centre except boston and boston strictly speaking was the new england literary centre  however we had really no use for an american literary centre before the civil war for it was only after the civil war that we really began to have an american literature  up to that time we had a colonial literature a knickerbocker literature and a new england literature but as soon as the country began to feel its life in every limb with the coming of peace it began to speak in the varying accents of all the different sectionsnorth east south west and farthest west but not before that time     ii  perhaps the first note of this national concord or discord was sounded from california in the voices of mr bret harte of mark twain of mr charles warren stoddard i am sorry for those who do not know his beautiful idyls of the south seas and others of the remarkable group of poets and humorists whom these names must stand for  the san francisco school briefly flourished from 1867 till 1872 or so and while it endured it made san francisco the first national literary centre we ever had for its writers were of every american origin except californian  after the pacific slope the great middle west found utterance in the dialect verse of mr john hay and after that began the exploitation of all the local parlances which has sometimes seemed to stop and then has begun again  it went on in the south in the fables of mr joel chandler harriss uncle remus and in the fiction of miss murfree who so long masqueraded as charles egbert craddock  louisiana found expression in the creole stories of mr g w cable indiana in the hoosier poems of mr james whitcomb riley and central new york in the novels of mr harold frederic but nowhere was the new impulse so firmly and finely directed as in new england where miss sarah orne jewetts studies of country life antedated miss mary wilkinss work  to be sure the portrayal of yankee character began before either of these artists was known lowells bigelow papers first reflected it mrs stowes old town stories caught it again and again mrs harriet prescott spofford in her unromantic moods was of an excellent fidelity to it and mrs rose terry cooke was even truer to the new england of connecticut  with the later group mrs lily chase wyman has pictured rhode island worklife with truth pitiless to the beholder and full of that tender humanity for the material which characterizes russian fiction  mr james lane allen has let in the light upon kentucky the red men and white of the great plains have found their interpreter in mr owen wister a young philadelphian witness of their dramatic conditions and characteristics mr hamlin garlafid had already expressed the sad circumstances of the rural northwest in his pathetic idyls colored from the experience of one who had been part of what he saw  later came mr henry b fuller and gave us what was hardest and most sordid as well as something of what was most touching and most amusing in the burlyburly of chicago     iii  a survey of this sort imparts no just sense of the facts and i own that i am impatient of merely naming authors and books that each tempt me to an expansion far beyond the limits of this essay for if i may be so personal i have watched the growth of our literature in americanism with intense sympathy  in my poor way i have always liked the truth and in times past i am afraid that i have helped to make it odious to those who believed beauty was something different but i hope that i shall not now be doing our decentralized literature a disservice by saying that its chief value is its honesty its fidelity to our decentralized life sometimes i wish this were a little more constant but upon the whole i have no reason to complain and i think that as a very interested spectator of new york i have reason to be content with the veracity with which some phases of it have been rendered  the lightningor the flash light to speak more accuratelyhas been rather late in striking this ungainly metropolis but it has already got in its work with notable effect at some points  this began i believe with the local dramas of mr edward harrigan a species of farces or sketches of character loosely hung together with little sequence or relevancy upon the thread of a plot which would keep the stage for two or three hours  it was very rough magic as a whole but in parts it was exquisite and it held the mirror up towards politics on their social and political side and gave us eastside typesirish german negro and italianwhich were instantly recognizable and deliciously satisfying  i never could understand why mr harrigan did not go further but perhaps he had gone far enough and at any rate he left the field open for others  the next to appear noticeably in it was mr stephen crane whose red badge of courage wronged the finer art which he showed in such new york studies as maggie a girl of the streets and georges mother  he has been followed by abraham cahan a russian hebrew who has done portraits of his race and nation with uncommon power  they are the very russian hebrews of hester street translated from their native yiddish into english which the author mastered after coming here in his early manhood  he brought to his work the artistic qualities of both the slav and the jew and in his jekl a story of the ghetto he gave proof of talent which his more recent book of sketchesthe imported bride groomconfirms  he sees his people humorously and he is as unsparing of their sordidness as he is compassionate of their hard circumstance and the somewhat frowsy pathos of their lives  he is a socialist but his fiction is wholly without tendentiousness  a good many years agoten or twelve at leastmr harry harland had shown us some politer new york jews with a romantic coloring though with genuine feeling for the novelty and picturesqueness of his material but i do not think of any one who has adequately dealt with our gentile society  mr james has treated it historically in washington square and more modernly in some passages of the bostonians as well as in some of his shorter stories mr edgar fawcett has dealt with it intelligently and authoritatively in a novel or two and mr brander matthews has sketched it in this aspect and that with his gallic cleverness neatness and point  in the novel his fathers son he in fact faces it squarely and renders certain forms of it with masterly skill  he has done something more distinctive still in the action and the word one of the best american stories i know  but except for these writers our literature has hardly taken to new york society     iv  it is an even thing new york society has not taken to our literature new york publishes it criticises it and circulates it but i doubt if new york society much reads it or cares for it and new york is therefore by no means the literary centre that boston once was though a large number of our literary men live in or about new york  boston in my time at least had distinctly a literary atmosphere which more or less pervaded society but new york has distinctly nothing of the kind in any pervasive sense  it is a vast mart and literature is one of the things marketed here but our good society cares no more for it than for some other products bought and sold here it does not care nearly so much for books as for horses or for stocks and i suppose it is not unlike the good society of any other metropolis in this  to the general here journalism is a far more appreciable thing than literature and has greater recognition for some very good reasons but in boston literature had vastly more honor and even more popular recognition than journalism  there journalism desired to be literary and here literature has to try hard not to be journalistic  if new york is a literary centre on the business side as london is boston was a literary centre as weimar was and as edinburgh was  it felt literature as those capitals felt it and if it did not love it quite so much as might seem it always respected it  to be quite clear in what i wish to say of the present relation of boston to our other literary centres i must repeat that we have now no such literary centre as boston was  boston itself has perhaps outgrown the literary consciousness which formerly distinguished it from all our other large towns  in a place of nearly a million people i count in the outlying places newspapers must be more than books and that alone says everything  mr aldrich once noticed that whenever an author died in boston the new yorkers thought they had a literary centre and it is by some such means that the primacy has passed from boston even if it has not passed to new york  but still there is enough literature left in the body at boston to keep her first among equals in some things if not easily first in all  mr aldrich himself lives in boston and he is with mr stedman the foremost of our poets  at cambridge live colonel t w higginson an essayist in a certain sort without rival among us and mr william james the most interesting and the most literary of psychologists whose repute is european as well as american  mr charles eliot norton alone survives of the earlier cambridge grouplongfellow lowell richard henry dana louis agassiz francis j child and henry james the father of the novelist and the psychologist  to boston mr james ford rhodes the latest of our abler historians has gone from ohio and there mr henry cabot lodge the massachusetts senator whose work in literature is making itself more and more known was born and belongs politically socially and intellectually  mrs julia ward howe a poet of wide fame in an elder generation lives there mr t b aldrich lives there and thereabouts live mrs elizabeth stuart phelps ward and mrs harriet prescott spofford the first of a fame beyond the last who was known to us so long before her  then at boston or near boston live those artists supreme in the kind of short story which we have carried so far miss jewett miss wilkins miss alice brown mrs chasewyman and miss gertrude smith who comes from kansas and writes of the prairie farmlife though she leaves mr e w howe of the story of a country town and presently of the atchison daily globe to constitute with the humorous poet ironquill a frontier literary centre at topeka  of boston too though she is of western pennsylvania origin is mrs margaret deland one of our most successful novelists  miss wilkins has married out of massachusetts into new jersey and is the neighbor of mr h m alden at metuchen  all these are more or less embodied and represented in the atlantic monthly still the most literary and in many things still the first of our magazines  finally after the chief publishing house in new york the greatest american publishing house is in boston with by far the largest list of the best american books  recently several firms of younger vigor and valor have recruited the wasted ranks of the boston publishers and are especially to be noted for the number of rather nice new poets they give to the light     v  dealing with the question geographically in the right american way we descend to hartford obliquely by way of springfield massachusetts where in a little city of fifty thousand a newspaper of metropolitan influence and of distinctly literary tone is published  at hartford while charles dudley warner lived there was an indisputable literary centre mark twain lives there no longer and now we can scarcely count hartford among our literary centres though it is a publishing centre of much activity in subscription books  at new haven yale university has latterly attracted mr william h bishop whose novels i always liked for the best reasons and has long held professor j t lounsbury who is since professor childs death at cambridge our best chaucer scholar  mr donald g  mitchell once endeared to the whole fickle american public by his reveries of a bachelor and his dream life dwells on the borders of the pleasant town which is also the home of mr j w de forest the earliest real american novelist and for certain gifts in seeing and telling our life also one of the greatest  as to new york where the imagination may arrive daily from new haven either by a sound boat or by eight or ten of the swiftest express trains in the world i confess i am more and more puzzled  here abide the poets mr r h stoddard mr e c stedman mr r w gilder and many whom an envious etcetera must hide from view the fictionists mr r h davis mrs kate douglas wiggin mr brander matthews mr frank hopkinson smith mr abraham cahan mr frank norris and mr james lane allen who has left kentucky to join the large southern contingent which includes mrs burton harrison and mrs mcenery stuart the historians professor william m sloane and dr eggleston reformed from a novelist the literary and religious and economic essayists mr hamilton w mabie mr h m alden mr j j chapman and mr e l godkin with critics dramatists satirists magazinists and journalists of literary stamp in number to convince the wavering reason against itself that here beyond all question is the great literary centre of these states  there is an authors club which alone includes a hundred and fifty authors and if you come to editors there is simply no end  magazines are published here and circulated hence throughout the land by millions and books by the ton are the daily output of our publishers who are the largest in the country  if these things do not mean a great literary centre it would be hard to say what does and i am not going to try for a reason against such facts it is not quality that is wanting but perhaps it is the quantity of the quality there is leaven but not for so large a lump  it may be that new york is going to be our literary centre as london is the literary centre of england by gathering into itself all our writing talent but it has by no means done this yet  what we can say is that more authors come here from the west and south than go elsewhere but they often stay at home and i fancy very wisely  mr joel chandler harris stays at atlanta in georgia mr james whitcomb riley stays at indianapolis mr maurice thompson spent his whole literary life and general lew wallace still lives at crawfordsville indiana mr madison cawein stays at louisville kentucky miss murfree stays at st louis missouri francis r stockton spent the greater part of the year at his place in west virginia and came only for the winter months to new york mr edward bellamy until his failing health exiled him to the far west remained at chicopee massachusetts and i cannot think of one of these writers whom it would have advantaged in any literary wise to dwell in new york  he would not have found greater incentive than at home and in society he would not have found that literary tone which all society had or wished to have in boston when boston was a great town and not yet a big town  in fact i doubt if anywhere in the world there was ever so much taste and feeling for literature as there was in that boston  at edinburgh as i imagine it there was a large and distinguished literary class and at weimar there was a cultivated court circle but in boston there was not only such a group of authors as we shall hardly see here again for hundreds of years but there was such regard for them and their calling not only in good society but among the extremely wellread people of the whole intelligent city as hardly another community has shown  new york i am quite sure never was such a centre and i see no signs that it ever will be  it does not influence the literature of the whole country as boston once did through writers whom all the young writers wished to resemble it does not give the law and it does not inspire the love that literary boston inspired  there is no ideal that it represents  a glance at the map of the union will show how very widely our smaller literary centres are scattered and perhaps it will be useful in following me to other more populous literary centres  dropping southward from new york now we find ourselves in a literary centre of importance at philadelphia since that is the home of mr j b mcmasters the historian of the american people of mr owen wister whose fresh and vigorous work i have mentioned and of dr weir mitchell a novelist of power long known to the better public and now recognized by the larger in the immense success of his historical romance hugh wynne  if i skip baltimore i may ignore a literary centre of great promise but while i do not forget the excellent work of johns hopkins university in training men for the solider literature of the future no baltimore names to conjure with occur to me at the moment and we must really get on to washington  this till he became ambassador at the court of st james was the home of mr john hay a poet whose biography of lincoln must rank him with the historians and whose public service as secretary of state classes him high among statesmen  he blotted out one literary centre at cleveland ohio when he removed to washington and mr thomas nelson page another at richmond virginia when he came to the national capital mr paul dunbar the first negro poet to divine and utter his race carried with him the literary centre of dayton ohio when he came to be an employee in the congressional library and mr charles warren stoddard in settling at washington as professor of literature in the catholic university brought somewhat indirectly away with him the last traces of the old literary centre at san francisco  a more recent literary centre in the californian metropolis went to pieces when mr gelett burgess came to new york and silenced the lark a bird of as new and rare a note as ever made itself heard in this air but since he has returned to california there is hope that the literary centre may form itself there again  i do not know whether mrs charlotte perkins stetson wrecked a literary centre in leaving los angeles or not i am sure only that she has enriched the literary centre of new york by the addition of a talent in sociological satire which would be extraordinary even if it were not altogether unrivalled among us  could one say too much of the literary centre at chicago  i fancy yes or too much at least for the taste of the notable people who constitute it  in mr henry b fuller we have reason to hope from what he has already done an american novelist of such greatness that he may well leave being the great american novelist to any one who likes taking that role  mr hamlin garland is another writer of genuine and original gift who centres at chicago and mrs mary catherwood has made her name well known in romantic fiction  miss edith wyatt is a talent newly known of the finest quality in minor fiction mr robert herrick mr will payne in their novels and mr george ade and mr peter dump in their satires form with those named a group not to be matched elsewhere in the country it would be hard to match among our critical journals the dial of chicago and with a fair amount of publishing in a sort of books often as good within as they are uncommonly pretty without chicago has a claim to rank with our first literary centres  it is certainly to be reckoned not so very far below london which with mr henry james mr harry harland and mr bret harte seems to me an american literary centre worthy to be named with contemporary boston which is our chief literary centre however i am not after all ready to say  when i remember mr g w cable at northampton massachusetts i am shaken in all my preoccupations when i think of mark twain it seems to me that our greatest literary centre is just now at riverdale onthehudson     etext editors bookmarks  leaven but not for so large a lump mark twain not lack of quality but  quantity of the quality our deeply incorporated civilization     end of this project gutenberg etext of american literary centers by william dean howells       literature and lifethe standard householdeffect company  by william dean howells   the standard householdeffect company   my friend came in the other day before we had left town and looked round at the appointments of the room in their summer shrouds and said with a faint sigh i see you have had the eternalwomanly with you too     i  isnt the eternalwomanly everywhere  what has happened to you i asked  i wish you would come to my house and see  every rug has been up for a month and we have been living on bare floors  everything that could be tied up has been tied up everything that could be sewed up has been sewed up  everything that could be mothballed and put away in chests has been mothballed and put away  everything that could be taken down has been taken down  bags with drawstrings at their necks have been pulled over the chandeliers and tied  the pictures have been hidden in cheesecloth and the mirrors veiled in gauze so that i cannot see my own miserable face anywhere  come  thats something  yes its something  but i have been thinking this matter over very seriously and i believe it is going from bad to worse  i have heard praises of the thorough housekeeping of our grandmothers but the housekeeping of their granddaughters is a thousand times more intense  do you really believe that  i asked  and if you do what of it  simply this that if we dont put a stop to it at the gait its going it will put a stop to the eternalwomanly  i suppose we should hate that  yes it would be bad  it would be very bad and i have been turning the matter over in my mind and studying out a remedy  the highest type of philosopher turns a thing over in his mind and lets some one else study out a remedy  yes i know  i feel that i may be wrong in my processes but i am sure that i am right in my results  the reason why our grandmothers could be such good housekeepers without danger of putting a stop to the eternal womanly was that they had so few things to look after in their houses life was indefinitely simpler with them  but the modern improvements as we call them have multiplied the cares of housekeeping without subtracting its burdens as they were expected to do  every novel convenience and comfort every article of beauty and luxury every means of refinement and enjoyment in our houses has been so much added to the burdens of housekeeping and the granddaughters have inherited from the grandmothers an undiminished conscience against rust and the moth which will not suffer them to forget the least duty they owe to the naughtiest of their superfluities  yes i see what you mean i said  this is what one usually says when one does not quite know what another is driving at but in this case i really did know or thought i did  that survival of the conscience is a very curious thing especially in our eternalwomanly  i suppose that the north american conscience was evolved from the rudimental european conscience during the first centuries of struggle here and was more or less religious and economical in its origin  but with the advance of wealth and the decay of faith among us the conscience seems to be simply conscientious or if it is otherwise it is social  the eternalwomanly continues along the old lines of housekeeping from an atavistic impulse and no one woman can stop because all the other women are going on  it is something in the air or something in the blood  perhaps it is something in both  yes said my friend quite as i had said already i see what you mean but i think it is in the air more than in the blood  i was in paris about this time last year perhaps because i was the only thing in my house that had not been swathed in cheesecloth or tied up in a bag with drawstrings or rolled up with mothballs and put away in chests  at any rate i was there  one day i left my wife in new york carefully tagging three wornout feather dusters and putting them into a pillowcase and tagging it and putting the pillowcase into a camphorated selfsealing paper sack and tagging it and another day i was in paris dining at the house of a lady whom i asked how she managed with the things in her house when she went into the country for the summer  leave them just as they are she said  but what about the dust and the moths and the rust and the tarnish  she said why the things would have to be all gone over when i came back in the autumn anyway and why should i give myself double trouble  i asked her if she didnt even roll anything up and put it away in closets and she said oh you mean that old american horror of getting ready to go away  i used to go through all that at home too but i shouldnt dream of it here  in the first place there are no closets in the house and i couldnt put anything away if i wanted to and really nothing happens  i scatter some persian powder along the edges of things and under the lower shelves and in the dim corners and i pull down the shades  when i come back in the fall i have the powder swept out and the shades pulled up and begin living again  suppose a little dust has got in and the moths have nibbled a little here and there  the whole damage would not amount to half the cost of putting everything away and taking everything out not to speak of the weeks of discomfort and the wear and tear of spirit  no thank goodnessi left american housekeeping in america  i asked her but if you went back and she gave a sigh and said  i suppose i should go back to that along with all the rest  everybody does it there  so you see my friend concluded its in the air rather than the blood  then your famous specific is that our eternalwomanly should go and live in paris  oh dear not said my friend  nothing so drastic as all that  merely the extinction of household property  i see what you mean i said  butwhat do you mean  simply that hired houses such as most of us live in shall all be furnished houses and that the landlord shall own every stick in them and every appliance down to the last spoon and ultimate towel  there must be no compromise by which the tenant agrees to provide his own linen and silver that would neutralize the effect i intend by the expropriation of the personal proprietor if that says what i mean  it must be in the lease with severe penalties against the tenant in case of violation that the landlord into furnish everything in perfect order when the tenant comes in and is to put everything in perfect order when the tenant goes out and the tenant is not to touch anything to clean it or dust it or roll it up in mothballs and put it away in chests all is to be so sacredly and inalienably the property of the landlord that it shall constitute a kind of trespass if the tenant attempts to close the house for the summer or to open it for the winter in the usual way that houses are now closed and opened  otherwise my scheme would be measurably vitiated  i see what you mean i murmured  well  some years ago my friend went on when we came home from europe we left our furniture in storage for a time while we rather drifted about and did not settle anywhere in particular  during that interval my wife opened and closed five furnished houses in two years  and she has lived to tell the tale  she has lived to tell it a great many times  she can hardly be kept from telling it yet  but it is my belief that although she brought to the work all the anguish of a quickened conscience under the influence of the american conditions she had returned to she suffered far less in her encounters with either of those furnished houses than she now does with our own furniture when she shuts up our house in the summer and opens it for the winter  but if there had been a clause in the lease as there should have been forbidding her to put those houses in order when she left them life would have been simply a rapture  why in europe custom almost supplies the place of statute in such cases and you come and go so lightly in and out of furnished houses that you do not mind taking them for a month or a few weeks  we are very far behind in this matter but i have no doubt that if we once came to do it on any extended scale we should do it as we do everything else we attempt more perfectly than any other people in the world  you see what i mean  i am not sure that i do  but go on  i would invert the whole henry george principle and i would tax personal property of the household kind so heavily that it would necessarily pass out of private hands i would make its tenure so costly that it would be impossible to any but the very rich who are also the very wicked and ought to suffer  oh come now  i refer you to your testament  in the end all household property would pass into the hands of the state  arent you getting worse and worse  oh im not supposing there wont be a long interval when household property will be in the hands of powerful monopolies and many millionaires will be made by letting it out to middleclass tenants like you and me along with the houses we hire of them  i have no doubt that there will be a standard householdeffect company which will extend its relations to europe and get the household effects of the whole world into its grasp  it will be a fearful oppression and we shall probably groan under it for generations but it will liberate us from our personal ownership of them and from the far more crushing weight of the moth ball  we shall suffer but  i see what you mean i hastened to interrupt at this point but these suggestive remarks of yours are getting beyonddo you think you could defer the rest of your incompleted sentence for a week  well for not more than a week said my friend with an air of discomfort in his arrest     ii  we shall not suffer so much as we do under our present system said my friend completing his sentence after the interruption of a week  by this time we had both left town and were taking up the talk again on the veranda of a seaside hotel  as for the eternalwomanly it will be her salvation from herself  when once she is expropriated from her household effects and forbidden under severe penalties from meddling with those of the standard householdeffect company she will begin to get back her peace of mind and be the same blessing she was before she began housekeeping  that may all very well be i assented though i did not believe it and i found something almost too fantastical in my friends scheme  but when we are expropriated from all our dearest belongings what is to become of our tender and sacred associations with them  what has become of devotion to the family gods and the worship of ancestors  once the graves of the dead were at the door of the living so that libations might be conveniently poured out on them and the ground where they lay was inalienable because it was supposed to be used by their spirits as well as their bodies  a man could not sell the bones because he could not sell the ghosts of his kindred  byand by when religion ceased to be domestic and became social and the service of the gods was carried on in temples common to all it was found that the tombs of ones forefathers could be sold without violence to their spectres  i dare say it wouldnt be different in the case of our tender and sacred associations with tables and chairs pots and pans beds and bedding pictures and bricabrac  we have only to evolve a little further  in fact we have already evolved far beyond the point that troubles you  most people in modern towns and cities have changed their domiciles from ten to twenty times during their lives and have not paid the slightest attention to the tender and sacred associations connected with them  i dont suppose you would say that a man has no such associations with the house that has sheltered him while he has them with the stuff that has furnished it  no i shouldnt say that  if anything the house should be dearer than the household gear  yet at each remove we drag a lengthening chain of tables chairs sideboards portraits landscapes bedsteads washstands stoves kitchen utensils and bricabrac after us because as my wife says we cannot bear to part with them  at several times in our own lives we have accumulated stuff enough to furnish two or three house and have paid a pretty stiff houserent in the form of storage for the overflow  why i am doing that very thing now  arent you  i amin a certain degree i assented  we all are we welltodo people as we think ourselves  once my wife and i revolted by a common impulse against the ridiculous waste and slavery of the thing  we went to the storage warehouse and sent three or four vanloads of the rubbish to the auctioneer  some of the pieces we had not seen for years and as each was hauled out for us to inspect and decide upon we condemned it to the auctionblock with shouts of rejoicing  tender and sacred associations  we hadnt had such light hearts since we had put everything in storage and gone to europe indefinitely as we had when we left those things to be carted out of our lives forever  not one had been a pleasure to us the sight of every one had been a pang  all we wanted was never to set eyes on them again  i must say you have disposed of the tender and sacred associations pretty effectually so far as they relate to things in storage  but the things that we have in daily use  it is exactly the same with them  why should they be more to us than the floors and walls of the houses we move in and move out of with no particular pathos  and i think we ought not to care for them certainly not to the point of letting them destroy our eternalwomanly with the anxiety she feels for them  she is really much more precious if she could but realize it than anything she swathes in cheesecloth or wraps up with mothballs  the proof of the fact that the whole thing is a piece of mere sentimentality is that we may live in a furnished house for years amid all the accidents of birth and death joy and sorrow and yet not form the slightest attachment to the furniture  why should we have tender and sacred associations with a thing we have bought and not with a thing we have hired  i confess i dont know  and do you really think we could liberate ourselves from our belongings if they didnt belong to us  wouldnt the eternalwomanly still keep putting them away for summer and taking them out for winter  at first yes there might be some such mechanical action in her but it would be purely mechanical and it would soon cease  when the standard householdeffect company came down on the temporalmanly with a penalty for violation of the lease the eternalwomanly would see the folly of her ways and stop for the eternalwomanly is essentially economical whatever we say about the dressmakers bills and the very futilities of putting away and taking out that she now wears herself to a thread with are founded in the instinct of saving  but i asked wouldnt our household belongings lose a good deal of character if they didnt belong to us  wouldnt our domestic interiors become dreadfully impersonal  how many houses now have characterpersonality  most people let the different dealers choose for them as it is  why not let the standard householdeffect company and finally the state  i am sure that either would choose much more wisely than people choose for themselves in the few cases where they even seem to choose for themselves  in most interiors the appointments are without fitness taste or sense they are the mere accretions of accident in the greater number of cases where they are the result of design they are worse  i see what you mean by character and personality in them  you mean the sort of madness that let itself loose a few years ago in what was called household art and has since gone to make the junkshops hideous  each of the eternalwomanly was supposed suddenly to have acquired a talent for decoration and a gift for the selection and arrangement of furniture and each began to stamp herself upon our interiors  one painted a highshouldered stone bottle with a stork and stood it at the right corner of the mantel on a scarf another gilded the bottle and stood it at the left corner and tied the scarf through its handle  one knotted a ribbon around the arm of a chair another knotted it around the leg  in a day an hour a moment the chairs suddenly became angular cushionless springless and the sofas were stood across corners or parallel with the fireplace in slants expressive of the personality of the presiding genius  the walls became all frieze and dado and instead of the simple and dignified ugliness of the impersonal period our interiors abandoned themselves to a hysterical chaos full of character  some people had their doors painted black and the daughter or mother of the house then decorated them with morningglories  i saw such a door in a house i looked at the other day thinking i might hire it  the sight of that black door and its morning glories made me wish to turn aside and live with the cattle as walt whitman says  no the less we try to get personality and character into our household effects the more beautiful and interesting they will be as soon as we put the standard householdeffect company in possession and render it a relentless monopoly it will corrupt a competent architect and decorator in each of our large towns and cities and when you hire a new house these will be sent to advise with the eternalwomanly concerning its appointments and tell her what she wants and what she will like for at present the eternal womanly as soon as she has got a thing she wants begins to hate it  the companys agents will begin by convincing her that she does not need half the things she has lumbered up her house with and that every useless thing is an ugly thing even in the region of pure aesthetics  i once asked an italian painter if he did not think a certain nobly imagined drawingroom was fine and he said si  ma troppa roba  there were too many rugs tables chairs sofas pictures vases statues chandeliers  troppa roba is the vice of all our household furnishing and it will be the death of the eternalwomanly if it is not stopped  but the corrupt agents of a giant monopoly will teach the eternalwomanly something of the wise simplicity of the south and she will end by returning to the ideal of housekeeping as it prevails among the latin races whom it began with whom civilization began with what of a harmless necessary moth or two or even a few fleas  that might be all very well as far as furniture and carpets and curtains are concerned i said but surely you wouldnt apply it to pictures and objects of art  i would apply it to them first of all and above all rejoined my friend hardily  among all the people who buy and own such things there is not one in a thousand who has any real taste or feeling for them and the objects they choose are generally such as can only deprave and degrade them further  the pictures statues and vases supplied by the standard householdeffect company would be selected by agents with a real sense of art and a knowledge of it  when the houseletting and house furnishing finally passed into the hands of the state these things would be lent from the public galleries or from immense municipal stores for the purpose  and i suppose you would have ancestral portraits supplied along with the other pictures  i sneered  ancestral portraits of course said my friend with unruffled temper so few people have ancestors of their own that they will be very glad to have ancestral portraits chosen for them out of the collections of the company or the state  the agents of the one or the officers of the other will study the existing type of family face and will select ancestors and ancestresses whose modelling coloring and expression agree with it and will keep in view the race and nationality of the family whose ancestral portraits are to be supplied so that there shall be no chance of the grossly improbable effect which ancestral portraits now have in many cases  yes i see no flaw in the scheme my friend concluded and no difficulty that cant be easily overcome  we must alienate our household furniture and make it so sensitively and exclusively the property of some impersonal agencycompany or community i dont care whichthat any care of it shall be a sort of crime any sense of responsibility for its preservation a species of incivism punishable by fine or imprisonment  this and nothing short of it will be the salvation of the eternalwomanly  and the perdition of something even more precious than that  what can be more precious  individuality  my dear friend demanded my visitor who had risen and whom i was gradually edging to the door do you mean to say there is any individuality in such things now  what have we been saying about character  ah i see what you mean i said     etext editors bookmark  as soon as she has got a thing she wants begins to hate it heard praises of the thorough housekeeping of our grandmothers yes i see what you mean     end of this project gutenberg etext of standard household effect co by william dean howells       literature and lifestaccato notes of a vanished summer  by william dean howells    staccato notes of a vanished summer   monday afternoon the storm which had been beating up against the southeasterly wind nearly all day thickened fold upon fold in the northwest  the gale increased and blackened the harbor and whitened the open sea beyond where sail after sail appeared round the reef of whaleback light and ran in a wild scamper for the safe anchorages within  since noon cautious coasters of all sorts had been dropping in with a casual air the coal schooners and barges had rocked and nodded knowingly to one another with their taper and truncated masts on the breast of the invisible swell and the flock of little yachts and pleasureboats which always fleck the bay huddled together in the safe waters  the craft that came scurrying in just before nightfall were mackerel seiners from gloucester  they were all of one graceful shape and one size they came with all sail set taking the waning light like sunshine on their flyingjibs and trailing each two dories behind them with their seines piled in black heaps between the thwarts  as soon as they came inside their jibs weakened and fell and the anchorchains rattled from their bows  before the dark hid them we could have counted sixty or seventy ships in the harbor and as the night fell they improvised a little venice under the hill with their lights which twinkled rhythmically like the lamps in the basin of st mark between the maine and new hampshire coasts  there was a dash of rain and we thought the storm had begun but that ended it as so many times this summer a dash of rain has ended a storm the morning came veiled in a fog that kept the shipping at anchor through the day but the next night the weather cleared  we woke to the clucking of tackle and saw the whole fleet standing dreamily out to sea  when they were fairly gone the summer which had held aloof in dismay of the sudden cold seemed to return and possess the land again and the succession of silver days and crystal nights resumed the tranquil round which we thought had ceased     i  one says of every summer when it is drawing near its end there never was such a summer but if the summer is one of those which slip from the feeble hold of elderly hands when the days of the years may be reckoned with the scientific logic of the insurance tables and the sad conviction of the psalmist one sees it go with a passionate prescience of never seeing its like again such as the younger witness cannot know  each new summer of the few left must be shorter and swifter than the last its junes will be thirty days long and its julys and augusts thirtyone in compliance with the almanac but the days will be of so small a compass that fourteen of them will rattle round in a week of the old size like shrivelled peas in a pod  to be sure they swell somewhat in the retrospect like the same peas put to soak and i am aware now of some june days of those which we first spent at kittery point this year which were nearly twentyfour hours long  even the days of declining years linger a little here where there is nothing to hurry them and where it is pleasant to loiter and muse beside the sea and shore which are so netted together at kittery point that they hardly know themselves apart  the days whatever their length are divided not into hours but into mails  they begin without regard to the sun at eight oclock when the first mail comes with a few letters and papers which had forgotten themselves the night before  at halfpast eleven the great midday mail arrives at four oclock there is another indifferent and scattering post much like that at eight in the morning and at seven the last mail arrives with the boston evening papers and the new york morning papers to make you forget any letters you were looking for  the opening of the midday mail is that which most throngs with summer folks the little postoffice under the elms opposite the weatherbeaten mansion of sir william pepperrell but the evening mail attracts a large and mainly disinterested circle of natives  the days work on land and sea is then over and the village leisure perched upon fences and stayed against house walls is of a picturesqueness which we should prize if we saw it abroad and which i am not willing to slight on our own ground     ii  the type is mostly of a seafaring brown a complexion which seems to be inherited rather than personally acquired for the commerce of kittery point perished long ago and the fishing fleets that used to fit out from her wharves have almost as long ago passed to gloucester  all that is left of the fishing interest is the weir outside which supplies fitfully and uncertainly the fish shipped fresh to the nearest markets  but in spite of this the tint taken from the suns and winds of the sea lingers on the local complexion and the local manner is that freer and easier manner of people who have known other coasts and are in some sort citizens of the world  it is very different from the inland new england manner as different as the gentle slow speech of the shore from the clipped nasals of the hillcountry  the lounging native walk is not the heavy plod taught by the furrow but has the lurch and the sway of the deck in it  nothing could be better suited to progress through the long village which rises and sinks beside the shore like a landscape with its sealegs on and nothing could be more charming and friendly than this village it is quite untainted as yet by the summer cottages which have covered so much of the coast and made it look as if the aesthetic suburbs of new york and boston had gone ashore upon it  there are two or three old fashioned summer hotels but the summer life distinctly fails to characterize the place  the people live where their forefathers have lived for two hundred and fifty years and for the century since the baronial domain of sir william was broken up and his possessions confiscated by the young republic they have dwelt in small red or white houses on their small holdings along the slopes and levels of the low hills beside the water where a man may pass with the least inconvenience and delay from his threshold to his gunwale  not all the houses are small some are spacious and ambitious to be of ugly modern patterns but most are simple and homelike  their gardens following the example of sir williams vanished pleasaunce drop southward to the shore where the lobstertraps and the hencoops meet in unembarrassed promiscuity  but the fishflakes which once gave these inclines the effect of terraced vineyards have passed as utterly as the proud parterres of the old baronet and kittery point no longer makes a cod or a haddock for the market  three groceries a butcher shop and a small variety store study the few native wants and with a little money one may live in as great real comfort here as for much in a larger place  the street takes care of itself the seafaring housekeeping of new england is not of the insatiable dutch type which will not spare the stones of the highway but within the houses are of almost terrifying cleanliness  the other day i found myself in a kitchen where the stove shone like oxidized silver the pump and sink were clad in oilcloth as with blue tiles the walls were papered the stainless floor was strewn with homemade hooked and braided rugs and i felt the place so altogether too good for me that i pleaded to stay there for the transaction of my business lest a sharper sense of my unfitness should await me in the parlor  the village with scarcely an interval of farmlands stretches four miles along the waterside to portsmouth but it seems to me that just at the point where our lines have fallen there is the greatest concentration of its character  this has apparently not been weakened it has been accented by the trolleyline which passes through its whole length with gayly freighted cars coming and going every halfhour  i suppose they are not longer than other trolleycars but they each affect me like a procession  they are cheerful presences by day and by night they light up the dim winding street with the flare of their electric bulbs and bring to the country a vision of city splendor upon terms that do not humiliate or disquiet  during july and august they are mostly filled with summer folks from a great summer resort beyond us and their lights reveal the pretty fashions of hats and gowns in all the charm of the latest lines and tints  but there is an increasing democracy in these splendors and one might easily mistake a passing excursionist from some neighboring inland town or even a local native with the instinct of clothes for a social leader from york harbor  with the falling leaf the bargelike open cars close up into wellwarmed saloons and falter to hourly intervals in their course  but we are still far from the falling leaf we are hardly come to the blushing or fading leaf  here and there an impassioned maple confesses the autumn the ancient pepperrell elms fling down showers of the baronets fairy gold in the september gusts the sumacs and the blackberry vines are ablaze along the tumbling black stone walls but it is still summer it is still summer i cannot allow otherwise     iii  the other day i visited for the first time in the opulent indifference of one who could see it any time the stately tomb of the first pepperrell who came from cornwall to these coasts and settled finally at kittery point  he laid there the foundations of the greatest fortune in colonial new england which revolutionary new england seized and dispersed as i cannot but feel a little ruthlessly  in my personal quality i am of course averse to all great fortunes and in my civic capacity i am a patriot  but still i feel a sort of grace in wealth a century old and if i could now have my way i would not have had their possessions reft from those kindly pepperrells who could hardly help being loyal to the fountain of their baronial honors  sir william indeed had helped more than any other man to bring the people who despoiled him to a national consciousness  if he did not imagine he mainly managed the plucky new england expedition against louisbourg at cape breton a half century before the war of independence and his splendid success in rending that stronghold from the french taught the colonists that they were americans and need be englishmen no longer than they liked  his soldiers were of the stamp of all succeeding american armies and his leadership was of the neighborly and fatherly sort natural to an amiable man who knew most of them personally  he was already the richest man in america and his grateful king made him a baronet but he came contentedly back to kittery and took up his old life in a region where he had the comfortable consideration of an unrivalled magnate  he built himself the dignified mansion which still stands across the way from the postoffice on kittery point within an easy stones cast of the far older house where his father wedded margery bray when he came a thrifty young welsh fisherman from the isles of shoals and established his family on kittery  the bray house had been the finest in the region a hundred years before the pepperrell mansion was built it still remembers its consequence in the panelling and wainscoting of the large square parlor where the young people were married and in the elaborate staircase cramped into the little square hall and the bray fortune helped materially to swell the wealth of the pepperrells  i do not know that i should care now to have a man able to ride thirty miles on his own land but i do not mind sir williams having done it here a hundred and fifty years ago and i wish the confiscations had left his family say about a mile of it  they could now indeed enjoy it only in the collateral branches for all sir williams line is extinct the splendid mansion which he built his daughter is in alien hands and the fine old house which lady pepperrell built herself after his death belongs to the remotest of kinsmen  a group of these the descendants of a prolific sister of the baronet meets every year at kittery point as the pepperrell association and in a tent hard by the little grove of drooping spruces which shade the admirable renaissance cenotaph of sir williams father cherishes the family memories with due american proceedings     iv  the meeting of the pepperrell association was by no means the chief excitement of our summer  in fact i do not know that it was an excitement at all and i am sure it was not comparable to the presence of our naval squadron when for four days the mighty dragon and kraken shapes of steel which had crumbled the decrepit pride of spain in the fight at santiago weltered in our peaceful waters almost under my window  i try now to dignify them with handsome epithets but while they were here i had moments of thinking they looked like a lot of whited locomotives which had broken through from some trestle in a recent accident and were waiting the offices of a wreckingtrain  the poetry of the manofwar still clings to the threedecker out of the foam of the past it is too soon yet for it to have cast a mischievous halo about the modern battleship and i looked at the new york and the texas and the brooklyn and the rest and thought ah but for you and our need of proving your dire efficiency perhaps we could have got on with the wickedness of spanish rule in cuba and there had been no war  under my reluctant eyes the great dreadful spectacle of the santiago fight displayed itself in peaceful kittery harbor  i saw the spanish ships drive upon the reef where a man from dover new hampshire was camping in a little wooden shanty unconscious and i heard the dying screams of the spanish sailors seethed and scalded within the steel walls of their own wicked warkettles  as for the guns battle or no battle our ships like kind lieutenant belay of the hot crossbun seemed to be banging away the whole day long  they set a bad example to the dreamy old fort on the newcastle shore which till they came only recollected itself to salute the sunrise and sunset with a single gun but which under provocation of the squadron formed a habit of firing twenty or thirty times at noon  other martial shows and noises were not so bad  i rather liked seeing the morning drill of the marines and the bluejackets on the iron decks with the lively music that went with it  the bugle calls and the bells were charming the weeks wash hung out to dry had its picturesqueness by day and by night the spectral play of the searchlights along the waves and shores and against the startled skies was even more impressive there was a band which gave us every evening the airs of the latest coon songs and the national anthems which we have borrowed from various nations and yes i remember the white squadron kindly though i was so glad to have it go and let us lapse back into our summer silence and calm  it was i do not mind saying now a majestic sight to see those grotesque monsters gather themselves together and go wallowing one after another out of the harbor and drop behind the ledge of whaleback light as if they had sunk into the sea   v  a deep peace fell upon us when they went and it must have been at this most receptive moment when all our sympathies were adjusted in a mood of hospitable expectation that jim appeared  jim was and still is and i hope will long be a cat but unless one has lived at kittery point and realized from observation and experience what a leading part cats may play in society one cannot feel the full import of this fact  not only has every house in kittery its cat but every house seems to have its halfdozen cats large little old and young of divers colors tending mostly to a dark tortoiseshell  with a whole ocean inviting to the tragic rite i do not believe there is ever a kitten drowned in kittery the illimitable sea rather employs itself in supplying the fish to which no cats averse but which the cats of kittery demand to have cooked  they do not like raw fish they say it plainly and they prefer to have the bones taken out for them though they do not insist upon that point  at least jim never did so from the time when he first scented the odor of delicate young mackerel in the evening air about our kitchen and dropped in upon the maids there with a fine casual effect of being merely out for a walk and feeling it a neighborly thing to call  he had on a silver collar engraved with his name and surname which offered itself for introduction like a visitingcard  he was too polite to ask himself to the table at once but after he had been welcomed to the family circle he formed the habit of finding himself with us at breakfast and supper when he sauntered in like one who should say did i smell fish but would not go further in the way of hinting  he had no need to do so  he was made at home and freely invited to our best not only in fish but in chicken for which he showed a nice taste and in sweetcorn for which he revealed a most surprising fondness when it was cut from the cob for him  after he had breakfasted or supped he gracefully suggested that he was thirsty by climbing to the table where the waterpitcher stood and stretching his fine feline head towards it when he had lapped up his saucer of water he marched into the parlor and riveted the chains upon our fondness by taking the best chair and going to sleep in it in attitudes of egyptian of assyrian majesty his arts were few or none he rather disdained to practise any he completed our conquest by maintaining himself simply a fascinating presence and perhaps we spoiled jim  it is certain that he came under my window at two oclock one night and tried the kitchen door  it resisted his efforts to get in and then jim began to use language which i had never heard from the lips of a cat before and seldom from the lips of a man  i will not repeat it enough that it carried to the listener the conviction that jim was not sober  where he could have got his liquor in the totally abstinent state of maine i could not positively say but probably of some sailor who had brought it from the neighboring new hampshire coast  there could be no doubt however that jim was drunk and a dash from the waterpitcher seemed the only thing for him the water did not touch him but he started back in surprise and grief and vanished into the night without a word  his feelings must have been deeply wounded for it was almost a week before he came near us again and then i think that nothing but young lobster would have brought him  he forgave us finally and made us of his party in the quarrel he began gradually to have with the large yellow cat of a nextdoor neighbor  this culminated one afternoon after a long exchange of mediaeval defiance and insult in a battle upon a bed of rag weed with wild shrieks of rage and prodigious feats of ground and lofty tumbling  it seemed to our anxious eyes that jim was getting the worst of it but when we afterwards visited the battlefield and picked up several tufts of blond fur we were in a doubt which was afterwards heightened by jims invasion of the yellow cats territory where he stretched himself defiantly upon the grass and seemed to be challenging the yellow cat to come out and try to put him off the premises     etext editors bookmarks  ambitious to be of ugly modern

storage      floating down the river on the ohio     worries of a winter walk  the other winter as i was taking a morning walk down to the east river i came upon a bit of our motley life a fact of our piebald civilization which has perplexed me from time to time ever since and which i wish now to leave with the reader for his or her more thoughtful consideration     i  the morning was extremely cold  it professed to be sunny and there was really some sort of hard glitter in the air which so far from being tempered by this effulgence seemed all the stonier for it  blasts of frigid wind swept the streets and buffeted each other in a fury of resentment when they met around the corners  although i was passing through a populous tenementhouse quarter my way was not hindered by the sports of the tenementhouse children who commonly crowd one from the sidewalks no frowzy head looked out over the fireescapes there were no peddlers carts or voices in the roadway not above three or four shawl hooded women cowered out of the little shops with small purchases in their hands not so many tiny girls with jugs opened the doors of the beer saloons  the butchers windows were painted with patterns of frost through which i could dimly see the frozen meats hanging like hideous stalactites from the roof  when i came to the river i ached in sympathy with the shipping painfully atilt on the rocklike surface of the brine which broke against the piers and sprayed itself over them like showers of powdered quartz  but it was before i reached this final point that i received into my consciousness the moments of the human comedy which have been an increasing burden to it  within a block of the river i met a child so small that at first i almost refused to take any account of her until she appealed to my sense of humor by her amusing disproportion to the pail which she was lugging in front of her with both of her little mittened hands  i am scrupulous about mittens though i was tempted to write of her little naked hands red with the pitiless cold  this would have been more effective but it would not have been true and the truth obliges me to own that she had a stout warmlooking knit jacket on the pailwhich was half her height and twice her bulkwas filled to overflowing with small pieces of coal and coke and if it had not been for this i might have taken her for a child of the better classes she was so comfortably clad  but in that case she would have had to be fifteen or sixteen years old in order to be doing so efficiently and responsibly the work which as the child of the worse classes she was actually doing at five or six  we must indeed allow that the early selfhelpfulness of such children is very remarkable and all the more so because they grow up into men and women so stupid that according to the theories of all polite economists they have to have their discontent with their conditions put into their heads by malevolent agitators  from time to time this tiny creature put down her heavy burden to rest it was of course only relatively heavy a man would have made nothing of it  from time to time she was forced to stop and pick up the bits of coke that tumbled from her heaping pail  she could not consent to lose one of them and at last when she found she could not make all of them stay on the heap she thriftily tucked them into the pockets of her jacket and trudged sturdily on till she met a boy some years older who planted himself in her path and stood looking at her with his hands in his pockets  i do not say he was a bad boy but i could see in his furtive eye that she was a sore temptation to him  the chance to have fun with her by upsetting her bucket and scattering her coke about till she cried with vexation was one which might not often present itself and i do not know what made him forego it but i know that he did and that he finally passed her as i have seen a young dog pass a little cat after having stopped it and thoughtfully considered worrying it  i turned to watch the child out of sight and when i faced about towards the river again i received the second instalment of my present perplexity  a cart heavily laden with coke drove out of the coalyard which i now perceived i had come to and after this cart followed two brisk old women snugly clothed and tightly tucked in against the cold like the child who vied with each other in catching up the lumps of coke that were jolted from the load and filling their aprons with them such old women so hale so spry so tough and tireless with the withered apples red in their cheeks i have not often seen  they may have been about sixty years or sixtyfive the time of life when most women are grandmothers and are relegated on their merits to the cushioned seats of their childrens homes softly silkgowned and lacecapped dear visions of lilac and lavender to be loved and petted by their grandchildren the fancy can hardly put such sweet ladies in the place of those nimble beldams who hopped about there in the windswept street plucking up their days supply of firing from the involuntary bounty of the cart even the attempt is unseemly and whether mine is at best but a feeble fancy not bred to strenuous feats of any kind it fails to bring them before me in that figure  i cannot imagine ladies doing that kind of thing i can only imagine women who had lived hard and worked hard all their lives doing it who had begun to fight with want from their cradles like that little one with the pail and must fight without ceasing to their graves  but i am not unreasonable i understand and i understood what i saw to be one of the things that must be for the perfectly good and sufficient reason that they always have been and at the moment i got what pleasure i could out of the stolid indifference of the cartdriver who never looked about him at the scene which interested me but jolted onward leaving a trail of pungent odors from his pipe in the freezing eddies of the air behind him     ii  it is still not at all or not so much the fact that troubles me it is what to do with the fact  the question began with me almost at once or at least as soon as i faced about and began to walk homeward with the wind at my back  i was then so much more comfortable that the aesthetic instinct thawed out in me and i found myself wondering what use i could make of what i had seen in the way of my trade  should i have something very pathetic like the old grandmother going out day after day to pick up coke for her sick daughters freezing orphans till she fell sick herself  what should i do with the family in that case  they could not be left at that point and i promptly imagined a granddaughter a girl of about eighteen very pretty and rather proud a sort of belle in her humble neighborhood who should take her grandmothers place  i decided that i should have her italian because i knew something of italians and could manage that nationality best and i should call her maddalena either maddalena or marina marina would be more venetian and i saw that i must make her venetian  here i was on safe ground and at once the loveinterest appeared to help me out  by virtue of the law of contrasts it appeared to me in the person of a scandinavian lover tall silent blond whom i at once felt i could do from my acquaintance with scandinavian lovers in norwegian novels  his name was janssen a good distinctive scandinavian name i do not know but it is swedish and i thought he might very well be a swede i could imagine his manner from that of a swedish waitress we once had  janssenjan janssen saydrove the cokecart which marinas grandmother used to follow out of the cokeyard to pick up the bits of coke as they were jolted from it and he had often noticed her with deep indifference at first he noticed marinaor nina as i soon saw i must call herwith the same unconcern for in her grandmothers hood and jacket and check apron with her head held shamefacedly downward she looked exactly like the old woman  i thought i would have nina make her selfsacrifice rebelliously as a girl like her would be apt to do and follow the cokecart with tears  this would catch janssens notice and he would wonder perhaps with a little pang what the old woman was crying about and then he would see that it was not the old woman  he would see that it was nina and he would be in love with her at once for she would not only be very pretty but he would know that she was good if she were willing to help her family in that way  he would respect the girl in his dull sluggish northern way  he would do nothing to betray himself  but little by little he would begin to befriend her  he would carelessly overload his cart before he left the yard so that the coke would fall from it more lavishly and not only this but if he saw a stone or a piece of coal in the street he would drive over it so that more coke would be jolted from his load  nina would get to watching for him  she must not notice him much at first except as the driver of the overladen carelessly driven cart but after several mornings she must see that he is very strong and handsome  then after several mornings more their eyes must meet her vivid black eyes with the tears of rage and shame in them and his cold blue eyes  this must be the climax and just at this point i gave my fancy a rest while i went into a drugstore at the corner of avenue b to get my hands warm  they were abominably cold even in my pockets and i had suffered past several places trying to think of an excuse to go in  i now asked the druggist if he had something which i felt pretty sure he had not and this put him in the wrong so that when we fell into talk he was very polite  we agreed admirably about the hard times and he gave way respectfully when i doubted his opinion that the winters were getting milder  i made him reflect that there was no reason for this and that it was probably an illusion from that deeper impression which all experiences made on us in the past when we were younger i ought to say that he was an elderly man too  i said i fancied such a morning as this was not very mild for people that had no fires and this brought me back again to janssen and marina by way of the cokecart  the thought of them rapt me so far from the druggist that i listened to his answer with a glazing eye and did not know what he said  my hands had now got warm and i bade him goodmorning with a parting regret which he civilly shared that he had not the thing i had not wanted and i pushed out again into the cold which i found not so bad as before  my hero and heroine were waiting for me there and i saw that to be truly modern to be at once realistic and mystical to have both delicacy and strength i must not let them get further acquainted with each other the affair must simply go on from day to day till one morning jan must note that it was again the grandmother and no longer the girl who was following his cart  she must be very weak from a long sicknessi was not sure whether to have it the grippe or not but i decided upon that provisionally and she must totter after janssen so that he must get down after a while to speak to her under pretence of arranging the tailboard of his cart or something of that kind i did not care for the detail they should get into talk in the broken english which was the only language they could have in common and she should burst into tears and tell him that now nina was sick i imagined making this very simple but very touching and i really made it so touching that it brought the lump into my own throat and i knew it would be effective with the reader then i had jan get back upon his cart and drive stolidly on again and the old woman limp feebly after  there should not be any more i decided except that one very cold morning like that jan should be driving through that street and should be passing the door of the tenement house where nina had lived just as a little procession should be issuing from it  the fact must be told in brief sentences with a total absence of emotionality  the last touch must be jans cart turning the street corner with jans figure sharply silhouetted against the clear cold morning light  nothing more  but it was at this point that another notion came into my mind so antic so impish so fiendish that if there were still any evil one in a world which gets on so poorly without him i should attribute it to his suggestion and this was that the procession which jan saw issuing from the tenementhouse door was not a funeral procession as the reader will have rashly fancied but a wedding procession with nina at the head of it quite well again and going to be married to the little brown youth with earrings who had long had her heart  with a truly perverse instinct i saw how strong this might be made at the fond readers expense to be sure and how much more pathetic in such a case the silhouetted figure on the cokecart would really be i should of course make it perfectly plain that no one was to blame and that the whole affair had been so tacit on jans part that nina might very well have known nothing of his feeling for her  perhaps at the very end i might subtly insinuate that it was possible he might have had no such feeling towards her as the reader had been led to imagine     iii  the question as to which ending i ought to have given my romance is what has ever since remained to perplex me and it is what has prevented my ever writing it  here is material of the best sort lying useless on my hands which if i could only make up my mind might be wrought into a short story as affecting as any that wring our hearts in fiction and i think i could get something fairly unintelligible out of the broken english of jan and ninas grandmother and certainly something novel all that i can do now however is to put the case before the reader and let him decide for himself how it should end  the mere humanist i suppose might say that i am rightly served for having regarded the fact i had witnessed as material for fiction at all that i had no business to bewitch it with my miserable art that i ought to have spoken to that little child and those poor old women and tried to learn something of their lives from them that i might offer my knowledge again for the instruction of those whose lives are easy and happy in the indifference which ignorance breeds in us  i own there is something in this but then on the other hand i have heard it urged by nice people that they do not want to know about such squalid lives that it is offensive and out of taste to be always bringing them in and that we ought to be writing about good society and especially creating grandes dames for their amusement  this sort of people could say to the humanist that he ought to be glad there are cokecarts for fuel to fall off from for the lower classes and that here was no case for sentiment for if one is to be interested in such things at all it must be aesthetically though even this is deplorable in the presence of fiction already overloaded with low life and so poor in grades dames as ours       summer isles of eden  it may be all an illusion of the map where the summer islands glimmer a small and solitary little group of dots and wrinkles remote from continental shores with a straight line descending southeastwardly upon them to show how sharp and swift the ships course is but they seem so far and alien from my wonted place that it is as if i had slid down a steepy slant from the homeplanet to a group of asteroids nebulous somewhere in middle space and were resting there still vibrant from the rush of the meteoric fall  there were of course facts and incidents contrary to such a theory a steamer starting from new york in the raw march morning and lurching and twisting through two days of diagonal seas with people aboard dining and undining and talking and smoking and cocktailing and hotscotching and beefteaing but when the ship came in sight of the islands and they began to lift their cedared slopes from the turquoise waters and to explain their drifted snows as the white walls and white roofs of houses then the waking sense became the dreaming sense and the sweet impossibility of that drop through air became the sole reality     i  everything here indeed is so strange that you placidly accept whatever offers itself as the simplest and naturalest fact  those low hills that climb with their tough dark cedars from the summer sea to the summer sky might have drifted down across the gulf stream from the coast of maine but when upon closer inspection you find them skirted with palms and bananas and hedged with oleanders you merely wonder that you had never noticed these growths in maine before where you were so familiar with the cedars  the hotel itself which has brought the green mountains with it in every detail from the dormerwindowed mansardroof and the whitepainted greenshuttered walls to the neat schoolmistressly waitresses in the diningroom has a clump of palmettos beside it swaying and sighing in the tropic breeze and you know that when it migrates back to the new england hillcountry at the end of the season you shall find it with the palmettos still before its veranda and equally at home somewhere in the vermont or new hampshire july  there will be the same american groups looking out over them and rocking and smoking though alas not so many smoking as rocking  but where in that translation would be the gold braided red or blue jackets of the british army and navy which lend their lustre and color here to the veranda groups  where should one get the house walls of whitewashed stone and the garden walls which everywhere glow in the sun and belt in little spaces full of roses and lilies  these things must come from some other association and in the case of him who here confesses the lustrous uniforms and the glowing walls rise from waters as far away in time as in space and a longago apparition of venetian junes haunts the coral shore  they are beginning to say the shore is not coral but no matter  to be sure the white roofs are not accounted for in this visionary presence and if one may not relate them to the snowfalls of home winters then one must frankly own them absolutely tropical together with the greenpillared and greenlatticed galleries they at least suggest the tropical scenery of prue and i as one remembers seeing it through titbottoms spectacles and yet if one supplies roofs of brownred tiles it is all venetian enough with the lagoonlike expanses that lend themselves to the fond effect  it is so venetian indeed that it wants but a few silent gondolas and noisy gondoliers in place of the dark taciturn oarsmen of the clumsy native boats to complete the coming and going illusion and there is no good reason why the rough little isles that fill the bay should not call themselves respectively san giorgio and san clemente and sant elena and san lazzaro they probably have no other names     ii  these summer isles of eden have this advantage over the scriptural eden that apparently it was not woman and her seed who were expelled when once she set foot here but the serpent and his seed women now abound in the summer islands and there is not a snake anywhere to be found  there are some tortoises and a great many frogs in their season but no other reptiles  the frogs are fabled of a note so deep and hoarse that its vibration almost springs the environing mines of dynamite though it has never yet done so the tortoises grow to a great size and a patriarchal age and are fond of boston brown bread and baked beans if their preferences may be judged from those of a colossal specimen in the care of an american family living on the islands  the observer who contributes this fact to science is able to report the case of a parrot fish on the same premises so exactly like a large brown and purple cockatoo that seeing such a cockatoo later on dry land it was with a sense of something like cruelty in its exile from its native waters the angelfish he thinks not so much like angels they are of a transparent purity of substance and a cherubic innocence of expression but they terminate in two tails which somehow will not lend themselves to the resemblance  certainly the angelfish is not so well named as the parrotfish it might better be called the ghostfish it is so like a moonbeam in the pools it haunts and of such a convertible quality with the iridescent vegetable growths about it  all things here are of a weird convertibility to the alien perception and the richest and rarest facts of nature lavish themselves in humble association with the commonest and most familiar  you drive through long stretches of wayside willows and realize only now and then that these willows are thick clumps of oleanders and through them you can catch glimpses of bananaorchards which look like dishevelled patches of gigantic cornstalks  the fields of easter lilies do not quite live up to their photographs they are presently suffering from a mysterious blight and their flowers are not frequent enough to lend them that sculpturesque effect near to which they wear as far off as new york  the potatofields on the other hand are of a tender delicacy of coloring which compensates for the lilies lack and the palms give no just cause for complaint unless because they are not nearly enough to characterize the landscape which in spite of their presence remains so northern in aspect  they were much whipped and torn by a late hurricane which afflicted all the vegetation of the islands and some of the royal palms were blown down  where these are yet standing as four or five of them are in a famous avenue now quite onesided they are of a majesty befitting that of any king who could pass by them no sovereign except philip of macedon in his least judicial moments could pass between them  the centuryplant which here does not require pampering under glass but boldly takes its place out doors with the other trees of the garden employs much less than a hundred years to bring itself to bloom it often flowers twice or thrice in that space of time and ought to take away the reproach of the inhabitants for a want of industry and enterprise a centuryplant at least could do no more in any air and it merits praise for its activity in the breath of these languorous seas one such must be in bloom at this very writing in the garden of a house which this very writer marked for his own on his first drive ashore from the steamer to the hotel when he bestowed in its dim unknown interior one of the many multiples of himself which are now pretty well dispersed among the pleasant places of the earth  it fills the night with a heavy heliotropean sweetness and on the herb beneath in the effulgence of the waxing moon the multiple which has spiritually expropriated the legal owners stretches itself in an interminable reverie and hears youth come laughing back to it on the waters kissing the adjacent shore where other white houses which also it inhabits bathe their snowy underpinning in this dream the multiple drives home from the balls of either hotel with the young girls in the little victorias which must pass its sojourn and being but a vision itself fore casts the shapes of flirtation which shall nightlong gild the visions of their sleep with the flash of military and naval uniforms  of course the multiple has been at the dance too with a shadowy heartache for the dances of forty years ago and knows enough not to confuse the uniforms     iii  in whatever way you walk at whatever hour the birds are sweetly calling in the wayside oleanders and the wild sagebushes and the cedartops they are mostly catbirds quite like our own and bluebirds but of a deeper blue than ours and redbirds of as liquid a note but not so varied as that of the redbirds of our woods  how came they all here seven hundred miles from any larger land  some think on the stronger wings of tempests for it is not within the knowledge of men that men brought them  men did indeed bring the pestilent sparrows which swarm about their habitations here and beat away the gentler and lovelier birds with a ferocity unknown in the human occupation of the islands still the sparrows have by no means conquered and in the wilder places the catbird makes common cause with the bluebird and the redbird and holds its own against them  the little grounddoves mimic in miniature the form and markings and the gait and mild behavior of our turtledoves but perhaps not their melancholy cooing  nature has nowhere anything prettier than these exquisite creatures unless it be the longtailed white gulls which sail over the emerald shallows of the landlocked seas and take the green upon their translucent bodies as they trail their meteoric splendor against the midday sky  full twentyfour inches they measure from the beak to the tip of the single pen that protracts them a foot beyond their real bulk but it is said their tempers are shorter than they and they attack fiercely anything they suspect of too intimate a curiosity concerning their nests  they are probably the only shorttempered things in the summer islands where time is so long that if you lose your patience you easily find it again  sweetness if not light seems to be the prevailing human quality and a good share of it belongs to such of the natives as are in no wise light  our poor brethren of a different pigment are in the large majority and they have been seventy years out of slavery with the full enjoyment of all their civil rights without lifting themselves from their old inferiority  they do the hard work in their own easy way and possibly do not find life the burden they make it for the white man whom here as in our own country they load up with the conundrum which their existence involves for him  they are not very gay and do not rise to a joke with that flashing eagerness which they show for it at home  if you have them against a background of bananastems or low palms or feathery canes nothing could be more acceptably characteristic of the air and sky nor are they out of place on the box of the little victorias where visitors of the more inquisitive sex put them to constant question  such visitors spare no islander of any color  once in the pretty public garden which the multiple had claimed for its private property three unmerciful american women suddenly descended from the heavens and began to question the multiples gardener who was peacefully digging at the rate of a spadeful every five minutes  presently he sat down on his wheelbarrow and then shifted without relief from one handle of it to the other  then he rose and braced himself desperately against the tool house where when his tormentors drifted away he seemed to the soft eye of pity pinned to the wall by their cruel interrogations whose barbed points were buried in the stucco behind him and whose feathered shafts stuck out half a yard before his breast  whether he was black or not pity could not see but probably he was at least the garrison of the islands is all black being a jamaican regiment of that color and when one of the warriors comes down the white street with his swaggerstick in his hand and flaming in scarlet and gold upon the ground of his own blackness it is as if a gigantic oriole were coming towards you or a mighty tulip  these gorgeous creatures seem so much readier than the natives to laugh that you wish to test them with a joke  but it might fail  the summer islands are a british colony and the joke does not flourish so luxuriantly here as some other things  to be sure one of the native fruits seems a sort of joke when you hear it first named and when you are offered a loquat if you are of a frivolous mind you search your mind for the connection with loquor which it seems to intimate  failing in this you taste the fruit and then if it is not perfectly ripe you are as far from loquaciousness as if you had bitten a green persimmon  but if it is ripe it is delicious and may be consumed indefinitely  it is the only native fruit which one can wish to eat at all with an unpractised palate though it is claimed that with experience a relish may come for the pawpaws  these break out in clusters of the size of oranges at the top of a thick pole which may have some leaves or may not and ripen as they fancy in the indefinite summer  they are of the color and flavor of a very insipid little muskmelon which has grown too near a patch of squashes  one may learn to like this pawpaw yes but one must study hard  it is best when plucked by a young islander of italian blood whose father orders him up the bare pole in the sunny sunday morning air to oblige the signori and then with a pawpaw in either hand stands talking with them about the two bad years there have been in bermuda and the probability of his doing better in nuova york  he has not imagined our winter however and he shrinks from its boldly pictured rigors and lets the signori go with a sigh and a bunch of pink and crimson roses  the roses are here budding and blooming in the quiet bewilderment which attends the flowers and plants from the temperate zone in this latitude and which in the case of the strawberries offered with cream and cake at another public garden expresses itself in a confusion of red ripe fruit and white blossoms on the same stem  they are a pleasure to the nose and eye rather than the palate as happens with so many growths of the tropics if indeed the summer islands are tropical which some plausibly deny though why should not strawberries fresh picked from the plant in midmarch enjoy the right to be indifferent sweet     iv  what remains  the events of the summer islands are few and none out of the order of athletics between teams of the army and navy and what may be called societetics have happened in the past enchanted fortnight but far better things than events have happened sunshine and rain of such like quality that one could not grumble at either and gales now from the south and now from the north with the languor of the one and the vigor of the other in them  there were drives upon drives that were always to somewhere but would have been delightful the same if they had been mere goings and comings past the white houses overlooking little lawns through the umbrage of their palmtrees  the lawns professed to be of grass but were really mats of close little herbs which were not grass but which where the sparse cattle were grazing them seemed to satisfy their inexacting stomachs  they are never very green and in fact the landscape often has an air of exhaustion and pause which it wears with us in late august and why not after all its interminable innumerable summers  everywhere in the gentle hollows which the coral hills if they are coral sink into are the patches of potatoes and lilies and onions drawing their geometrical lines across the brownred weedless soil and in very sheltered spots are bananaorchards which are never so snugly sheltered there but their broad leaves are whipped to shreds  the white road winds between gray walls crumbling in an amiable disintegration but held together against ruin by a network of maidenhair ferns and creepers of unknown name and overhung by trees where the cactus climbs and hangs in spiky links or if another sort pierces them with speary stems as tall and straight as the stalks of the neighboring bamboo  the loquattrees clusterlike quinces in the garden closes and show their pale golden plumshaped fruit  for the most part the road runs by still inland waters but sometimes it climbs to the high downs beside the open sea grotesque with windworn and waveworn rocks and beautiful with opalescent beaches and the black legs of the negro children paddling in the tints of the prostrate rainbow  all this seems probable and natural enough at the writing but how will it be when one has turned ones back upon it  will it not lapse into the gross fable of travellers and be as the things which the liars who swap them cannot themselves believe  what will be said to you when you tell that in the summer islands one has but to saw a hole in his back yard and take out a house of soft creamy sandstone and set it up and go to living in it  what when you relate that among the northern and southern evergreens there are deciduous trees which in a clime where there is no fall or spring simply drop their leaves when they are tired of keeping them on and put out others when they feel like it  what when you pretend that in the absence of serpents there are centipedes a span long and spiders the bigness of bats and mosquitoes that sweetly sing in the drowsing ear but bite not or that there are swamps but no streams and in the marshes stand mangrovetrees whose branches grow downward into the ooze as if they wished to get back into the earth and pull in after them the holes they emerged from  these everyday facts seem not only incredible to the liar himself even in their presence but when you begin the ascent of that steep slant back to new york you foresee that they will become impossible  as impossible as the summit of the slant now appears to the sense which shudderingly figures it a bermuda pawpawtree seven hundred miles high and fruiting icicles and snowballs in the march air       wild flowers of the asphalt  looking through mrs caroline a creeveys charming book on the flowers of field hill and swamp the other day i was very forcibly reminded of the number of these pretty wilding growths which i had been finding all the season long among the streets of asphalt and the sidewalks of artificial stone in this city and i am quite sure that any one who has been kept in new york as i have been this year beyond the natural time of going into the country can have as real a pleasure in this sylvan invasion as mine if he will but give himself up to a sense of it     i  of course it is altogether too late now to look for any of the early spring flowers but i can recall the exquisite effect of the tender blue hepatica fringing the centre rail of the gripcars all up and down broadway and apparently springing from the hollow beneath where the cable ran with such a brooklike gurgle that any dampliving plant must find itself at home there  the waterpimpernel may now be seen by any sympathetic eye blowing delicately along the track in the breeze of the passing cabs and elastically lifting itself from the rush of the cars the reader can easily verify it by the picture in mrs creeveys book he knows it by its other name of brook weed and he will have my delight i am sure in the cardinalflower which will be with us in august  it is a shy flower loving the more sequestered nooks and may be sought along the shady stretches of third avenue where the elevated road overhead forms a shelter as of interlacing boughs  the arrowhead likes such swampy expanses as the converging surface roads form at dead mans curve and the corners of twenty third street  this is in flower now and will be till september and stjohnswort which some call the false golden rod is already here  you may find it in any moist low ground but the gutters of wall street or even the banks of the stock exchange are not too dry for it  the real goldenrod is not much in evidence with us for it comes only when summer is on the wane  the other night however on the promenade of the madison square roof garden i was delighted to see it growing all over the oblong dome of the auditorium in response to the cry of a homesick cricket which found itself in exile there at the base of a potted ever green  this lonely insect had no sooner sounded its winterboding note than the fond flower began sympathetically to wave and droop along those tarry slopes as i have seen it on how many hillside pastures  but this may have been only a transitory response to the cricket and i cannot promise the visitor to the roof garden that he will find goldenrod there every night  i believe there is always golden seal but it is the kind that comes in bottles and not in the gloom of deep cool moist woods where mrs creevey describes it as growing along with other wildings of such sweet names or quaint as celandine and dwarf larkspur and squirrelcorn and dutchmans breeches and pearlwort and woodsorrel and bishopscap and wintergreen and indianpipe and snowberry and adderstongue and wakerobin and dragonroot and adamandeve and twenty more which must have got their names from some fairy of genius  i should say it was a female fairy of genius who called them so and that she had her own sex among mortals in mind when she invented their nomenclature and was thinking of little girls and slim pretty maids and happy young wives  the author tells how they all look with a fine sense of their charm in her words but one would know how they looked from their names and when you call them over they at once transplant themselves to the depths of the dells between our skyscrapers and find a brief sojourn in the cavernous excavations whence other skyscrapers are to rise     ii  that night on the roof garden when the crickets cry flowered the dome with goldenrod the tall stems of rye growing among the orchestra sloped all one way at times just like the bows of violins in the halfdollar gale that always blows over the city at that height  but as one turns the leaves of mrs creeveys magic bookperhaps one ought to say turns its petalsthe forests and the fields come and make themselves at home in the city everywhere  by virtue of it i have been more in the country in a halfhour than if i had lived all june there  when i lift my eyes from its pictures or its letterpress my vision prints the eidolons of wild flowers everywhere as it prints the image of the sun against the air after dwelling on his brightness  the rosemallow flaunts along fifth avenue and the golden threads of the dodder embroider the house fronts on the principal cross streets and i might think at times that it was all mere fancy it has so much the quality of a pleasing illusion  yet mrs creeveys book is not one to lend itself to such a deceit by any of the ordinary arts  it is rather matter of fact in form and manner and largely owes what magic it has to the inherent charm of its subject one feels this in merely glancing at the index and reading such titles of chapters as wet meadows and low grounds dry fieldswaste places waysides hills and rocky woods open woods and deep cool moist woods each a poem in itself lyric or pastoral and of a surpassing opulence of suggestion  the spring and summer months pass in stately processional through the book each with her fillet inscribed with the names of her characteristic flowers or blossoms and brightened with the blooms themselves  they are plucked from where nature bade them grow in the wild places or their own wayward wills led them astray  a singularly fascinating chapter is that called escaped from gardens in which some of these pretty runagates are catalogued  i supposed in my liberal ignorance that the bouncing bet was the only one of these but i have learned that the pansy and the sweet violet love to gad and that the caraway the snapdragon the princes feather the summer savory the star of bethlehem the daylily and the tigerlily and even the sluggish stone crop are of the vagrant fragrant company  one is not surprised to meet the tigerlily in it that must always have had the jungle in its heart but that the babys breath should be found wandering by the roadsides from massachusetts and virginia to ohio gives one a tender pang as for a lost child  perhaps the poor human tramps who sleep in barns and feed at back doors along those dusty ways are mindful of the babys breath and keep a kindly eye out for the little truant     iii  as i was writing those homely names i felt again how fit and lovely they were how much more fit and lovely than the scientific names of the flowers  mrs creevey will make a botanist of you if you will let her and i fancy a very good botanist though i cannot speak from experience but she will make a poet of you in spite of yourself as i very well know and she will do this simply by giving you first the familiar name of the flowers she loves to write of  i am not saying that the daylily would not smell as sweet by her title of hemerocallis fulva or that the homely hearty bouncing bet would not kiss as deliciously in her scholars cap and gown of saponaria officinalis but merely that their college degrees do not lend themselves so willingly to verse or even melodious prose which is what the poet is often after nowadays  so i like best to hail the flowers by the names that the fairies gave them and the children know them by especially when my longing for them makes them grow here in the city streets  i have a fancy that they would all vanish away if i saluted them in botanical terms  as long as i talk of cattail rushes the homeless grimalkins of the areas and the back fences help me to a vision of the swamps thickly studded with their stiff spears but if i called them typha latifolia or even typha angustifolia there is not the hardiest and fiercest prowler of the roof and the fireescape but would fly the sound of my voice and leave me forlorn amid the withered foliage of my dream  the street sparrows pestiferous and persistent as they are would forsake my sylvan pageant if i spoke of the birdfoot violet as the viola pedata and the commonest cur would run howling if he beard the gentle poison dogwood maligned as the rhus venenata  the very milkcans would turn to their native pumps in disgust from my attempt to invoke our simple american cowslip as the dodecatheon meadia     iv  yet i do not deny that such scientific nomenclature has its uses and i should be far from undervaluing this side of mrs creeveys book  in fact i secretly respect it the more for its botanical lore and if ever i get into the woods or fields again i mean to go up to some of the humblest flowers such as i can feel myself on easy terms with and tell them what they are in latin  i think it will surprise them and i dare say they will some of them like it and will want their initials inscribed on their leaves like those signatures which the medicinal plants bear or are supposed to bear  but as long as i am engaged in their culture amid this stone and iron and asphalt i find it best to invite their presence by their familiar names and i hope they will not think them too familiar  i should like to get them all naturalized here so that the thousands of poor city children who never saw them growing in their native places might have some notion of how bountifully the world is equipped with beauty and how it is governed by many laws which are not enforced by policemen  i think that would interest them very much and i shall not mind their plucking my barmecide blossoms and carrying them home by the armfuls  when goodwill costs nothing we ought to practise it even with the tramps and these are very welcome in their wanderings over the city pave to rest their weary limbs in any of my pleached bowers they come to       a circus in the suburbs  we dwellers in cities and large towns if we are welltodo have more than our fill of pleasures of all kinds and for now many years past we have been used to a form of circus where surfeit is nearly as great misery as famine in that kind could be  for our sins or some of our friends sins perhaps we have now gone so long to circuses of three rings and two raisedplatforms that we scarcely realize that in the country there are still circuses of one ring and no platform at all we are accustomed in the gross and foolishsuperfluity of these city circuses to see no feat quite through but to turn our greedy eyes at the most important instant in the hope of greater wonders in another ring  we have four or five clowns in as many varieties of grotesque costume as well as a lady clown in befitting dress but we hear none of them speak not even the lady clown while in the country circus the old clown of our childhood one and indivisible makes the same style of jokes if not the very same jokes that we used to hear there  it is not easy to believe all this and i do not know that i should quite believe it myself if i had not lately been witness of it in the suburban village where i was passing the summer     i  the circus announced itself in the good old way weeks beforehand by the vast posters of former days and by a profusion of small bills which fell upon the village as from the clouds and left it littered everywhere with their festive pink  they prophesied it in a name borne by the first circus i ever saw which was also an animal show but the animals must all have died during the fifty years past for there is now no menagerie attached to it  i did not know this when i heard the band braying through the streets of the village on the morning of the performance and for me the mangy old camels and the pimpled elephants of yore led the procession through accompanying ranks of boys who have mostly been in their graves for half a lifetime the distracted ostrich thrust an advertising neck through the top of its cage and the lion roared to himself in the darkness of his moving prison  i felt the old thrill of excitement the vain hope of something preternatural and impossible and i do not know what could have kept me from that circus as soon as i had done lunch  my heart rose at sight of the large tent which was yet so very little in comparison with the tents of the threering and two platform circuses the alluring and illusory sideshows of fat women and lean men the horses tethered in the background and stamping under the flybites the old weatherbeaten grand chariot which looked like the ghost of the grand chariot which used to drag me captive in its triumph and the canvas shelters where the cooks were already at work over their kettles on the evening meal of the circus folk  i expected to be kept a long while from the ticketwagon by the crowd but there was no crowd and perhaps there never used to be much of a crowd  i bought my admittances without a moments delay and the man who sold me my reserve seats had even leisure to call me back and ask to look at the change he had given me mostly nickels  i thought i didnt give you enough he said and he added one more and sent me on to the doorkeeper with my faith in human nature confirmed and refreshed it was cool enough outside but within it was very warm as it should be to give the men with palmleaf fans and icecold lemonade a chance  they were already making their rounds and crying their wares with voices from the tombs of the dead past and the child of the young mother who took my seatticket from me was going to sleep at full length on the lowermost tread of the benches so that i had to step across its prostrate form these reserved seats were carpeted but i had forgotten how little one rank was raised above another and how very trying they were upon the back and legs  but for the carpeting i could not see how i was advantaged above the commoner folk in the unreserved seats and i reflected how often in this world we paid for an inappreciable splendor i could not see but they were as well off as i they were much more gayly dressed and some of them were even smoking cigars while they were nearly all younger by ten twenty forty or fifty years and even more they did not look like the country people whom i rather hoped and expected to see but were apparently my fellowvillagers in different stages of excitement  they manifested by the usual signs their impatience to have the performance begin and i confess that i shared this though i did not take part in the demonstration     ii  i have no intention of following the events seriatim  front time to time during their progress i renewed my old onesided acquaintance with the circusmen  they were quite the same people i believe but strangely softened and ameliorated as i hope i am and looking not a day older which i cannot say of myself exactly  the supernumeraries were patently farmer boys who had entered newly upon that life in a spirit of adventure and who wore their partial liveries a braided coat here and a pair of striped trousers there with a sort of timorous pride a deprecating bravado as if they expected to be hooted by the spectators and were very glad when they were not  the man who went round with a dog to keep boys from hooking in under the curtain had grown gentler and his dog did not look as if he would bite the worst boy in town  the man came up and asked the young mother about her sleeping child and i inferred that the child had been sick and was therefore unusually interesting to all the great kindhearted simple circus family  he was good to the poor supes and instructed them not at all sneeringly how best to manage the guy ropes for the nets when the trapeze events began  there was in fact an air of pleasing domesticity diffused over the whole circus  this was perhaps partly an effect from our extreme proximity to its performances i had never been on quite such intimate terms with equitation and aerostation of all kinds but i think it was also largely from the good hearts of the whole company  a circus must become during the season a great brotherhood and sisterhood especially sisterhood and its members must forget finally that they are not united by ties of blood  i dare say they often become so as husbands and wives and fathers and mothers if not as brothers  the domestic effect was heightened almost poignantly when a young lady in a turkishtowel bathgown came out and stood close by the band waiting for her act on a barebacked horse of a conventional pattern  she really looked like a young goddess in a turkishtowel bathgown goddesses must have worn bathgowns especially venus who was often imagined in the bath or just out of it  but when this goddess threw off her bathgown and came bounding into the ring as gracefully as the clogs she wore on her slippers would let her she was much more modestly dressed than most goddesses  what i am trying to say however is that while she stood there by the band she no more interested the musicians than if she were their collective sister  they were all in their shirtsleeves for the sake of the coolness and they banged and trumpeted and fluted away as indifferent to her as so many born brothers  indeed when the gyrations of her horse brought her to our side of the ring she was visibly not so youthful and not so divine as she might have been but the girl who did the trapeze acts and did them wonderfully left nothing to be desired in that regard though really i do not see why we who have neither youth nor beauty should always expect it of other people  i think it would have been quite enough for her to do the trapeze acts so perfectly but her being so pretty certainly added a poignancy to the contemplation of her perils  one could follow every motion of her anxiety in that close proximity the tremor of her chin as she bit her lips before taking her flight through the air the straining eagerness of her eye as she measured the distance the frown with which she forbade herself any shrinking or reluctance     iii  how strange is life how sad and perplexing its contradictions  why should such an exhibition as that be supposed to give pleasure  perhaps it does not give pleasure but is only a necessary fulfilment of one of the many delusions we are in with regard to each other in this bewildering world  they are of all sorts and degrees these delusions and i suppose that in the last analysis it was not pleasure i got from the clown and his clowning clowned he ever so merrily  i remember that i liked hearing his old jokes not because they were jokes but because they were old and endeared by long association  he sang one song which i must have heard him sing at my first circus i am sure it was he about things that i dont like to see and i heartily agreed with him that his book of songs which he sent round to be sold was fully worth the halfdime asked for it though i did not buy it  perhaps the rival author in me withheld me but as a brother man i will not allow that i did not feel for him and suffer with him because of the thick white pigment which plentifully coated his face and with the sweat drops upon it made me think of a newly painted wall in the rain he was infinitely older than his personality than his oldest joke though you never can be sure how old a joke is and representatively i dare say he outdated the pyramids  they must have made clowns whiten their faces in the dawn of time and no doubt there were drolls among the antediluvians who enhanced the effect of their fun by that means  all the same i pitied this clown for it and i fancied in his wildest waggery the note of a real irascibility  shall i say that he seemed the only member of that little circus who was not of an amiable temper  but i do not blame him and i think it much to have seen a clown once more who jested audibly with the ringmaster and always got the better of him in repartee  it was long since i had known that pleasure     iv  throughout the performance at this circus i was troubled by a curious question whether it were really of the same moral and material grandeur as the circuses it brought to memory or whether these were thin and slight too  we all know how the places of our childhood the heights the distances shrink and dwindle when we go back to them and was it possible that i had been deceived in the splendor of my early circuses the doubt was painful but i was forced to own that there might be more truth in it than in a blind fealty to their remembered magnificence very likely circuses have grown not only in size but in the richness and variety of  their entertainments and i was spoiled for the simple joys of this  but i could see no reflection of my dissatisfaction on the young faces around me and i must confess that there was at least so much of the circus that i left when it was half over  i meant to go into the sideshows and see the fat woman and the living skeleton and take the giant by the hand and the armless man by his friendly foot if i might be so honored  but i did none of these things and i am willing to believe the fault was in me if i was disappointed in the circus  it was i who had shrunk and dwindled and not it  to real boys it was still the size of the firmament and was a world of wonders and delights  at least i can recognize this fact now and can rejoice in the peaceful progress all over the country of the simple circuses which the towns never see but which help to render the summer fairer and brighter to the unspoiled eyes and hearts they appeal to  i hope it will be long before they cease to find profit in the pleasure they give       a she hamlet  the other night as i sat before the curtain of the garden theatre and waited for it to rise upon the hamlet of mme bernhardt a thrill of the rich expectation which cannot fail to precede the rise of any curtain upon any hamlet passed through my eager frame  there is indeed no scene of drama which is of a finer horror eighteenthcentury horror than that which opens the great tragedy  the sentry pacing up and down upon the platform at elsinore under the winter night the greeting between him and the comrade arriving to relieve him with its hints of the bitter cold the entrance of horatio and marcellus to these before they can part the mention of the ghost and while the soldiers are in the act of protesting it a veridical phantom the apparition of the ghost taking the word from their lips and hushing all into a pulseless awe what could be more simply and sublimely real more naturally supernatural  what promise of high mystical things to come there is in the mere syllabling of the noble verse and how it enlarges us from ourselves for that time at least to a disembodied unity with the troubled soul whose martyry seems foreboded in the solemn accents as the many hamlets on which the curtain had risen in my time passed in long procession through my memory i seemed to myself so much of their world and so little of the world that arrogantly calls itself the actual one that i should hardly have been surprised to find myself one of the less considered persons of the drama who were seen but not heard in its course     i  the trouble in judging anything is that if you have the materials for an intelligent criticism the case is already prejudiced in your hands you do not bring a free mind to it and all your efforts to free your mind are a species of gymnastics more or less admirable but not really effective for the purpose  the best way is to own yourself unfair at the start and then you can have some hope of doing yourself justice if not your subject  in other words if you went to see the hamlet of mme bernhardt frankly expecting to be disappointed you were less likely in the end to be disappointed in your expectations and you could not blame her if you were  to be ideally fair to that representation it would be better not to have known any other hamlet and above all the hamlet of shakespeare  from the first it was evident that she had three things overwhelmingly against herher sex her race and her speech  you never ceased to feel for a moment that it was a woman who was doing that melancholy dane and that the woman was a jewess and the jewess a french jewess  these three removes put a gulf impassable between her utmost skill and the impassioned irresolution of that inscrutable northern nature which is in nothing so masculine as its feminine reluctances and hesitations or so little french as in those obscure emotions which the english poetry expressed with more than gallic clearness but which the french words always failed to convey  the battle was lost from the first and all you could feel about it for the rest was that if it was magnificent it was not war  while the battle went on i was the more anxious to be fair because i had as it were preespoused the winning side and i welcomed in the interest of critical impartiality another hamlet which came to mind through readily traceable associations  this was a hamlet also of french extraction in the skill and school of the actor but as much more deeply derived than the hamlet of mme bernhardt as the large imagination of charles fechter transcended in its virile range the effect of her subtlest womanish intuition  his was the first blond hamlet known to our stage and hers was also blond if a reddishyellow wig may stand for a complexion and it was of the quality of his hamlet in masterly technique     ii  the hamlet of fechter which rose ghostlike out of the gulf of the past and cloudily possessed the stage where the hamlet of mme  bernhardt was figuring was called a romantic hamlet thirty years ago and so it was in being a break from the classic hamlets of the angloamerican theatre it was romantic as shakespeare himself was romantic in an elder sense of the word and not romanticistic as dumas was romanticistic  it was therefore the most realistic hamlet ever yet seen because the most naturally poetic  mme  bernhardt recalled it by the perfection of her school for fechters poetic naturalness differed from the conventionality of the accepted hamlets in nothing so much as the superiority of its selfinstruction  in mme bernhardts hamlet as in his nothing was trusted to chance or inspiration  good or bad what one saw was what was meant to be seen  when fechter played edmond dantes or claude melnotte he put reality into those preposterous inventions and in hamlet even his alien accent helped him vitalize the part it might be held to be nearer the elizabethan accent than ours and after all you said hamlet was a foreigner and in your high content with what he gave you did not mind its being in a broken vessel  when he challenged the ghost with i call thee keeng father rawldane you would hardly have had the erring utterance bettered  it sufficed as it was and when he said to rosencrantz will you pleh upon this pyip it was with such a princely authority and comradely entreaty that you made no note of the slips in the vowels except to have pleasure of their quaintness afterwards  for the most part you were not aware of these betrayals of his speech and in certain high things it was soul interpreted to soul through the poetry of shakespeare so finely so directly that there was scarcely a sense of the histrionic means  he put such divine despair into the words except my life except my life except my life following the mockery with which he had assured polonius there was nothing he would more willingly part withal than his leave that the heartbreak of them had lingered with me for thirty years and i had been alert for them with every hamlet since  but before i knew mme bernhardt had uttered them with no effect whatever  her hamlet indeed cut many of the things that we have learned to think the points of hamlet and it so transformed others by its interpretation of the translators interpretation of shakespeare that they passed unrecognized  soliloquies are the weak invention of the enemy for the most part but as such things go that soliloquy of hamlets to be or not to be is at least very noble poetry and yet mme  bernhardt was so unimpressive in it that you scarcely noticed the act of its delivery perhaps this happened because the sumptuous and sombre melancholy of shakespeares thought was transmitted in phrases that refused it its proper mystery  but there was always a hardness not always from the translation upon this feminine hamlet  it was like a thick shell with no crevice in it through which the tenderness of shakespeares hamlet could show except for the one moment at ophelias grave where he reproaches laertes with those pathetic words                what is the reason that you use me thus                i loved you ever but it is no matter  here mme  bernhardt betrayed a real grief but as a woman would and not a man  at the close of the gonzago play when hamlet triumphs in a mad whirl her hamlet hopped up and down like a mischievous crow a mischievous shecrow  there was no repose in her hamlet though there were moments of leaden lapse which suggested physical exhaustion and there was no range in her elocution expressive of the large vibration of that tormented spirit her voice dropped out or jerked itself out and in the crises of strong emotion it was the voice of a scolding or a hysterical woman  at times her movements which she must have studied so hard to master were drolly womanish especially those of the whole person  her quickened pace was a womans nervous little run and not a mans swift stride and to give herself due stature it was her foible to wear a womans high heels to her shoes and she could not help tilting on them  in the scene with the queen after the play most english and american hamlets have required her to look upon the counterfeit presentment of two brothers in miniatures something the size of teaplates but mme bernhardts preferred fulllength lifesize family portraits  the dead kings effigy did not appear a flattered likeness in the scenepainters art but it was useful in disclosing his ghost by giving place to it in the wall at the right moment  she achieved a novelty by this treatment of the portraits and she achieved a novelty in the tone she took with the wretched queen  hamlet appeared to scold her mother but though it could be said that her mother deserved a scolding was it the part of a good daughter to give it her  one should of course say a good son but long before this it had become impossible to think at all of mme bernhardts hamlet as a man if it ever had been possible  she had traversed the bounds which tradition as well as nature has set and violated the only condition upon which an actress may personate a man  this condition is that there shall be always a hint of comedy in the part that the spectator shall know all the time that the actress is a woman and that she shall confess herself such before the play is over she shall be fascinating in the guise of a man only because she is so much more intensely a woman in it shakespeare had rather a fancy for women in mens roles which as womens roles in his time were always taken by pretty and clever boys could be more naturally managed then than now  but when it came to the eclaircissement and the pretty boys who had been playing the parts of women disguised as men had to own themselves women the effect must have been confused if not weakened  if mme bernhardt in the necessity of doing something shakespearean had chosen to do rosalind or viola or portia she could have done it with all the modern advantages of women in mens roles  these characters are of course lighter motions bounded in a shallower brain than the creation she aimed at but she could at least have made much of them and she does not make much of hamlet     iii  the strongest reason against any woman hamlet is that it does violence to an ideal  literature is not so rich in great imaginary masculine types that we can afford to have them transformed to women and after seeing mme bernhardts hamlet no one can altogether liberate himself from the fancy that the prince of denmark was a girl of uncertain age with crises of mannishness in which she did not seem quite a lady  hamlet is in nothing more a man than in the things to which as a man he found himself unequal for as a woman he would have been easily superior to them if we could suppose him a woman as mme bernhardt in spite of herself invites us to do we could only suppose him to have solved his perplexities with the delightful precipitation of his putative sex as the niece of a wicked uncle who in that case would have had to be a wicked aunt wedded to hamlets father hard upon the murder of her mother she would have made short work of her vengeance  no fine scruples would have delayed her she would not have had a moments question whether she had not better kill herself she would have out with her bare bodkin and ended the doubt by first passing it through her aunts breast  to be sure there would then have been no play of hamlet as we have it but a hamlet like that imagined a frankly feminine hamlet mme bernhardt could have rendered wonderfully  it is in attempting a masculine hamlet that she transcends the imaginable and violates an ideal  it is not thinkable  after you have seen it done you say as mr clemens is said to have said of bicycling yes i have seen it but its impossible  it doesnt stand to reason  art like law is the perfection of reason and whatever is unreasonable in the work of an artist is inartistic  by the time i had reached these bold conclusions i was ready to deduce a principle from them and to declare that in a true civilization such a thing as that hamlet would be forbidden as an offence against public morals a violence to something precious and sacred  in the absence of any public regulation the precious and sacred ideals in the arts must be trusted to the several artists who bring themselves to judgment when they violate them  after mme bernhardt was perversely willing to attempt the part of hamlet the question whether she did it well or not was of slight consequence  she had already made her failure in wishing to play the part  her wish impugned her greatness as an artist of a really great actress it would have been as unimaginable as the assumption of a sublime feminine role by a really great actor  there is an obscure law in this matter which it would be interesting to trace but for the present i must leave the inquiry with the reader  i can note merely that it seems somehow more permissible for women in imaginary actions to figure as men than for men to figure as women  in the theatre we have conjectured how and why this may be but the privilege for less obvious reasons seems yet more liberally granted in fiction  a woman may tell a story in the character of a man and not give offence but a man cannot write a novel in autobiographical form from the personality of a woman without imparting the sense of something unwholesome  one feels this true even in the work of such a master as tolstoy whose katia is a case in point  perhaps a woman may play hamlet with a less shocking effect than a man may play desdemona but all the same she must not play hamlet at all  that sublime ideal is the property of the human imagination and may not be profaned by a talent enamoured of the impossible  no harm could be done by the broadest burlesque the most irreverent travesty for these would still leave the ideal untouched hamlet after all the horseplay would be hamlet but hamlet played by a woman to satisfy her caprice or to feed her famine for a fresh effect is hamlet disabled for a long time at least in its vital essence i felt that it would take many returns to the hamlet of shakespeare to efface the impression of mme bernhardts hamlet and as i prepared to escape from my row of stalls in the darkening theatre i experienced a noble shame for having seen the dane so disnatured to use mr lowells word  i had not been obliged to come i had voluntarily shared in the wrong done by my presence i had made myself an accomplice in the wrong it was high ground but not too high for me and i recovered a measure of selfrespect in assuming it       the midnight platoon  he had often heard of it  connoisseurs of such matters young newspaper men trying to make literature out of life and smuggle it into print under the guard of unwary editors and young authors eager to get life into their literature had recommended it to him as one of the most impressive sights of the city and he had willingly agreed with them that he ought to see it  he imagined it very dramatic and he was surprised to find it in his experience so largely subjective  if there was any drama at all it was wholly in his own consciousness  but the thing was certainly impressive in its way     i  he thought it a great piece of luck that he should come upon it by chance and so long after he had forgotten about it that he was surprised to recognize it for the spectacle he had often promised himself the pleasure of seeing  pleasure is the right word for pleasure of the painful sort that all hedonists will easily imagine was what he expected to get from it though upon the face of it there seems no reason why a man should delight to see his fellowmen waiting in the winter street for the midnight dole of bread which must in some cases be their only meal from the last midnight to the next midnight  but the mere thought of it gave him pleasure and the sight of it from the very first instant  he was proud of knowing just what it was at once with the sort of pride which one has in knowing an earthquake though one has never felt one before  he saw the double file of men stretching up one street and stretching down the other from the corner of the bakery where the loaves were to be given out on the stroke of twelve and he hugged himself in a luxurious content with his perspicacity  it was all the more comfortable to do this because he was in a coup warmly shut against the sharp wholesome christmasweek weather and was wrapped to the chin in a long fur overcoat which he wore that night as a duty to his family with a conscience against taking cold and alarming them for his health  he now practised another piece of selfdenial he let the cabman drive rapidly past the interesting spectacle and carry him to the house where he was going to fetch away the child from the christmas party  he wished to be in good time so as to save the child from anxiety about his coming but he promised himself to stop going back and glut his sensibility in a leisurely study of the scene  he got the child with her arms full of things from the christmastree into the coup and then he said to the cabman respectfully leaning as far over from his box to listen as his thick greatcoat would let him when you get up there near that bakery again drive slowly  i want to have a look at those men  all right sir said the driver intelligently and he found his why skilfully out of the street among the high banks of the seasonable christmasweek snow which the streetcleaners had heaped up there till they could get round to it with their carts  when they were in broadway again it seemed lonelier and silenter than it was a few minutes before  except for their own coup the cablecars with their flaming foreheads and the mechanical clangor of their gongs at the corners seemed to have it altogether to themselves  a tall lumbering united states mail van rolled by and impressed my friend in the coup with a cheap and agreeable sense of mystery relative to the letters it was carrying to their varied destination at the grand central station  he listened with half an ear to the childs account of the fun she had at the party and he watched with both eyes for the sight of the men waiting at the bakery for the charity of the midnight loaves  he played with a fear that they might all have vanished and with an apprehension that the cabman might forget and whirl him rapidly by the place where he had left them  but the driver remembered and checked his horses in good time and there were the men still but in even greater number than before stretching farther up broadway and farther out along the side street  they stood slouched in dim and solemn phalanx under the night sky so seasonably clear and frostily atwinkle with christmasweek stars two by two they stood slouched close together perhaps for their mutual warmth perhaps in an unconscious effort to get near the door where the loaves were to be given out in time to share in them before they were all gone     ii  my friends heart beat with glad anticipation  he was really to see this important this representative thing to the greatest possible advantage he rapidly explained to his companion that the giver of the midnight loaves got rid of what was left of his daily bread in that way the next day it could not be sold and he preferred to give it away to those who needed it rather than try to find his account in it otherwise  she understood and he tried to think that sometimes coffee was given with the bread but he could not make sure of this though he would have liked very much to have it done it would have been much more dramatic afterwards he learned that it was done and he was proud of having fancied it  he decided that when he came alongside of the broadway file he would get out and go to the side door of the bakery and watch the men receiving the bread  perhaps he would find courage to speak to them and ask them about themselves  at the time it did not strike him that it would be indecent  a great many things about them were open to reasonable conjecture  it was not probable that they were any of them there for their health as the saying is  they were all there because they were hungry or else they were there in behalf of some one else who was hungry  but it was always possible that some of them were impostors and he wondered if any test was applied to them that would prove them deserving or undeserving if one were poor one ought to be deserving if one were rich it did not so much matter  it seemed to him very likely that if he asked these men questions they would tell him lies  a fantastic association of their double files and those of the galleyslaves whom don quixote released with the tonguey gines de passamonte at their head came into his mind  he smiled and then he thought how these men were really a sort of slaves and convicts slaves to want and selfconvicted of poverty  all at once he fancied them actually manacled there together two by two a coffle of captives taken in some cruel foray and driven to a market where no man wanted to buy  he thought how old their slavery was and he wondered if it would ever be abolished as other slaveries had been  would the world ever outlive it  would some newyears day come when some president would proclaim amid some dire struggle that their slavery was to be no more that would be fine     iii  he noticed how still the most of them were  a few of them stepped a little out of the line and stamped to shake off the cold but all the rest remained motionless shrinking into themselves and closer together they might have been their own dismal ghosts they were so still with no more need of defence from the cold than the dead have  he observed now that not one among them had a fur overcoat on and at a second glance he saw that there was not an overcoat of any kind among them  he made his reflection that if any of them were impostors and not true men with real hunger and if they were alive to feel that stiff wholesome christmasweek cold they were justly punished for their deceit  he was interested by the celerity the simultaneity of his impressions his reflections  it occurred to him that his abnormal alertness must be something like that of a drowning person or a person in mortal peril and being perfectly safe and well he was obscurely flattered by the fact  to test his condition further he took note of the fine mass of the great drygoods store on the hither corner blocking itself out of the blue black night and of the gothic beauty of the church beyond so near that the coffle of captives might have issued from its sculptured portal after vain prayer  fragments of conjecture of speculation drifted through his mind  how early did these files begin to form themselves for the midnight dole of bread  as early as ten as nine oclock  if so did the fact argue habitual destitution or merely habitual leisure  did the slaves in the coffle make acquaintance or remain strangers to one another though they were closely neighbored night after night by their misery  perhaps they joked away the weary hours of waiting they must have their jokes  which of them were oldcomers and which novices  did they ever quarrel over questions of precedence  had they some comity some etiquette which a man forced to leave his place could appeal to and so get it back  could one say to his nexthand man will you please keep my place  and would this man say to an interloper excuse me this place is engaged  how was it with them when the coffle worked slowly or swiftly past the door where the bread and coffee were given out and word passed to the rear that the supply was exhausted  this must sometimes happen and what did they do then     iv  my friend did not quite like to think  vague reproachful thoughts for all the remote and immediate luxury of his life passed through his mind if he reformed that and gave the saving to hunger and cold  but what was the use  there was so much hunger so much cold that it could not go round  the cabman was obeying his orders too faithfully  he was not only walking by the broadway coffle he was creeping by  his action caught the notice of the slaves and as the coups passed them they all turned and faced it like soldiers under review making ready to salute a superior  they were perfectly silent perfectly respectful but their eyes seemed to pierce the coupe through and through  my friend was suddenly aware of a certain quality of representivity he stood to these men for all the ease and safety that they could never never hope to know  he was society society that was to be preserved because it embodies civilization  he wondered if they hated him in his capacity of better classes  he no longer thought of getting out and watching their behavior as they took their bread and coffee  he would have liked to excuse that thought and protest that he was ashamed of it that he was their friend and wished them wellas well as might be without the sacrifice of his own advantages or superfluities which he could have persuaded them would be perfectly useless  he put his hand on that of his companion trembling on his arm with sympathy or at least with intelligence  you mustnt mind  what we are and what we do is all right  its what they are and what they suffer thats all wrong     v  does that view of the situation still satisfy you  i asked when he had told me of this singular experience i liked his apparently not coloring it at all  i dont know he answered  it seems to be the only way out  well its an easy way i admitted and its an idea that ought to gratify the midnight platoon       the beach at rockaway  i confess that i cannot hear people rejoice in their summer sojourn as beyond the reach of excursionists without a certain rebellion and yet i have to confess also that after spending a sunday afternoon of late july four or five years ago with the excursionists at one of the beaches near new york i was rather glad that my own summer sojourn was not within reach of them  i know very well that the excursionists must go somewhere and as a man and a brother i am willing they should go anywhere but as a friend of quiet and seclusion i should be sorry to have them come much where i am  it is not because i would deny them a share of any pleasure i enjoy but because they are so many and i am so few that i think they would get all the pleasure and i none  i hope the reader will see how this attitude distinguishes me from the selfish people who inhumanly exult in their remoteness from excursionists     i  it was at rockaway beach that i saw these fellowbeings whose mere multitude was too much for me  they were otherwise wholly without offence towards me and so far as i noted towards each other they were in fact the most entirely peaceable multitude i ever saw in any country and the very quietest  there were thousands mounting well up towards tens of thousands of them in every variety of age and sex yet i heard no voice lifted above the conversational level except that of some infant ignorant of its privileges in a day at the seaside or some showman crying the attractions of the spectacle in his charge  i used to think the american crowds rather boisterous and unruly and many years ago when i lived in italy i celebrated the greater amiability and selfcontrol of the italian crowds  but we have certainly changed all that within a generation and if what i saw the other day was a typical new york crowd then the popular joy of our poorer classes is no longer the terror it once was to the peaceful observer  the tough was not visibly present nor the toughness either of the pure native east side stock or of the celtic extraction yet there were large numbers of americans with rather fewer recognizable irish among the masses who were mainly germans russians poles and the jews of these several nationalities  there was eating and drinking without limit on every hand and in every kind at the booths abounding in fried seafood and at the tables under all the widespreading verandas of the hotels and restaurants yet i saw not one drunken man and of course not any drunken women  no one that i saw was even affected by drink and no one was guilty of any rude or unseemly behavior  the crowd was in short a monument to the democratic ideal of life in that very important expression of life personal conduct i have not any notion who or what the people were or how virtuous or vicious they privately might be but i am sure that no society assemblage could be of a goodlier outside and to be of a goodly outside is all that the mere spectator has a right to ask of any crowd  i fancied however that great numbers of this crowd or at least all the americans in it were longislanders from the inland farms and villages within easy distance of the beach  they had probably the hereditary habit of coming to it for it was a favorite resort in the time of their fathers and grandfathers who had                      many an hour whiled away                     listening to the breakers roar                     that washed the beach at rockaway  but the clothing store and the paper pattern have equalized the cheaper dress of the people so that you can no longer know citizen and countryman apart by their clothes still less citizeness and countrywoman and i can only conjecture that the foreignlooking folk i saw were from new york and brooklyn  they came by boat and came and went by the continually arriving and departing trains and last but not least by bicycles both sexes  a few came in the public carriages and omnibuses of the neighborhood but by far the vaster number whom neither the boats nor the trains had brought had their own vehicles the allpervading bicycles which no one seemed so poor as not to be able to keep  the bicyclers stormed into the frantic village of the beach the whole afternoon in the proportion of one woman to five men and most of these must have ridden down on their wheels from the great cities  boys ran about in the roadway with bunches of brasses to check the wheels and put them for safekeeping in what had once been the stableyards of the hotels the restaurants had racks for them where you could see them in solid masses side by side for a hundred feet and no shop was without its doorside rack which the wheelman might slide his wheel into when he stopped for a soda a cigar or a sandwich  all along the road the gay bicycler and bicycless swarmed upon the piazzas of the inns munching lunching while their wheels formed a fantastic decoration for the underpinning of the house and a novel balustering for the steps     ii  the amusements provided for these throngs of people were not different from those provided for throngs of people everywhere who must be of much the same mind and taste the world over  i had fine moments when i moved in an illusion of the midway plaisance again i was at the fete de neuilly with all of paris but the accent about me yet again the county agricultural fairs of my youth spread their spectral joys before me  at none of these places however was there a sounding sea or a mountainous chute and i made haste to experience the variety these afforded beginning with the chute since the sea was always there and the chute might be closed for the day if i waited to view it last  i meant only to enjoy the pleasure of others in it and i confined my own participation to the ascent of the height from which the boat plunges down the watery steep into the oblong pool below  when i bought my ticket for the car that carried passengers up they gave me also a pasteboard medal certifying for me you have shot the chute and i resolved to keep this and show it to doubting friends as a proof of my daring but it is a curious evidence of my unfitness for such deceptions that i afterwards could not find the medal  so i will frankly own that for me it was quite enough to see others shoot the chute and that i came tamely down myself in the car  there is a very charming view from the top of the sea with its ships and all the mad gayety of the shore but of course my main object was to exult in the wild absurdity of those who shot the chute there was always a lady among the people in the clumsy flatboat that flew down the long track and she tried usually to be a pretty girl who clutched her friends and lovers and shrieked aloud in her flight but sometimes it was a sober mother of a family with her brood about her who was probably meditating all the way the inculpation of their father for any harm that came of it  apparently no harm came of it in any case  the boat struck the water with the impetus gained from a half perpendicular slide of a hundred feet bounded high into the air struck again and again and so flounced awkwardly across the pond to the farther shore where the passengers debarked and went away to commune with their viscera and to get their breath as they could  i did not ask any of them what their emotions or sensations were but so far as i could conjecture the experience of shooting the chute must comprise the rare transport of a fall from a tenstory building and the delight of a tempestuous passage of the atlantic powerfully condensed  the mere sight was so athletic that it took away any appetite i might have had to witness the feats of strength performed by madame la noire at the nearest booth on my coming out though madame herself was at the doorto testify in her own living picture how much muscular force may be masked in vast masses of adipose  she had a weary bored look and was not without her pathos poor soul as few of those are who amuse the public but i could not find her quite justifiable as a sunday entertainment  one forgot however what day it was and for the time i did not pretend to be so much better than my neighbors that i would not compromise upon a visit to an animal show a little farther on  it was a pretty fair collection of beasts that had once been wild perhaps and in the cage of the lions there was a slight sadlooking longhaired young man exciting them to madness by blows of a whip and pistolshots whom i was extremely glad to have get away without being torn in pieces or at least bitten in two  a little later i saw him at the door of the tent very breathless dishevelled and as to his dress not of the spotlessness one could wish  but perhaps spotlessness is not compatible with the intimacy of lions and lionesses  he had had his little triumph one spectator of his feat had declared that you would not see anything like that at coney island and soiled and dusty as he was in his cotton tights he was preferable to the living picture of a young lady whom he replaced as an attraction of the show  it was professedly a moral show the manager exhorted us as we came out to say whether it was good or not and in the boxoffice sat a kind and motherly faced matron who would have apparently abhorred to look upon a living picture at any distance much less have it at her elbow  upon the whole there seemed a melancholy mistake in it all the people to whom the showmen made their appeal were all so much better evidently than the showmen supposed the showmen themselves appeared harmless enough and one could not say that there was personally any harm in the living picture rather she looked listless and dull but as to the face respectable enough  i would not give the impression that most of the amusements were not in every respect decorous  as a means of pleasure the merrygoround both horizontal with horses and vertical with swinging cradles prevailed and was none the worse for being called by the french name of carrousel for our people aniglicize the word and squeeze the last drop of gallic wickedness from it by pronouncing it carousal  at every other step there were machines for weighing you and ascertaining your height there were photographers booths and xray apparatus for showing you the inside of your watch and in one open tent i saw a gentleman with his back to the public having his fortune read in the lines of his hand by an egyptian seeress  of course there was everywhere soda and places of the softer drinks abounded     iii  i think you could only get a hard drink by ordering something to eat and sitting down to your wine or beer at a table  again i say that i saw no effects of drink in the crowd and in one of the great restaurants built out over the sea on piers where there was perpetual dancing to the braying of a brassband the cotillon had no fire imparted to its figures by the fumes of the bar  in fact it was a very rigid sobriety that reigned here governing the common behavior by means of the placards which hung from the roof over the heads of the dancers and repeatedly announced that gentlemen were not allowed to dance together or to carry umbrellas or canes while dancing while all were entreated not to spit on the floor  the dancers looked happy and harmless if not very wise or splendid they seemed people of the same simple neighborhoods village lovers young wives and husbands and parties of friends who had come together for the days pleasure  a slight mother much weighed down by a heavy baby passed rapt in an innocent envy of them and i think she and the childs father meant to join them as soon as they could find a place where to lay it  almost any place would do at another great restaurant i saw two chairs faced together and a baby sleeping on them as quietly amid the coming and going of lagers and frankfurters as if in its cradle at home  lagers and frankfurters were much in evidence everywhere especially frankfurters which seemed to have whole booths devoted to broiling them they disputed this dignity with softshell crabs and sections of eels piled attractively on large platters or sizzling to an impassioned brown in deep skillets of fat  the old acrid smell of frying brought back many holidays of italy to me and i was again at times on the riva at venice and in the mercato vecchio at florence  but the continental sunday cannot be felt to have quite replaced the old american sabbath yet the puritan leaven works still and though so many of our own people consent willingly to the transformation i fancy they always enjoy themselves on sunday with a certain consciousness of wrongdoing     iv  i have already said that the spectator quite lost sense of what day it was  nothing could be more secular than all the sights and sounds  it was the fourth of july less the firecrackers and the drunkenness and it was the high day of the week  but if it was very wicked and i must recognize that the scene would be shocking to most of my readers i feel bound to say that the people themselves did not look wicked  they looked harmless they even looked good the most of them  i am sorry to say they were not very goodlooking  the women were pretty enough and the men were handsome enough perhaps the average was higher in respect of beauty than the average is anywhere else i was lately from new england where the people were distinctly more hardfavored but among all those thousands at rockaway i found no striking types  it may be that as we grow older and our satisfaction with our own looks wanes we become more fastidious as to the looks of others  at any rate there seems to be much less beauty in the world than there was thirty or forty years ago  on the other hand the dresses seem indefinitely prettier as they should be in compensation  when we were all so handsome we could well afford to wear hoops or pegtop trousers but now it is different and the poor things must eke out their personal ungainliness with all the devices of the modiste and the tailor  i do not mean that there was any distinction in the dress of the crowd but i saw nothing positively ugly or grotesquely out of taste  the costumes were as good as the customs and i have already celebrated the manners of this crowd  i believe i must except the costumes of the bicyclesses who were unfailingly dumpy in effect when dismounted and who were all the more lamentable for tottering about in their short skirts upon the tips of their narrow little sharppointed silly highheeled shoes  how severe i am but those high heels seemed to take all honesty from their daring in the wholesome exercise of the wheel and to keep them in the tradition of cheap coquetry still and imbecilly dependent     v  i have almost forgotten in the interest of the human spectacle that there is a sea somewhere about at rockaway beach and it is this that the people have come for  i might well forget that modest sea it is so built out of sight by the restaurants and bathhouses and switchbacks and shops that border it and by the hotels and saloons and shows flaring along the road that divides the village and the planked streets that intersect this  but if you walk southward on any of the streets you presently find the planks foundering in sand which drifts far up over them and then you find yourself in full sight of the ocean and the ocean bathing  swarms and heaps of people in all lolling and lying and wallowing shapes strew the beach and the water is full of slopping and shouting and shrieking human creatures clinging with bare white arms to the lifelines that run from the shore to the buoys beyond these the lifeguard stays himself in his boat with outspread oars and rocks on the incoming surf  all that you can say of it is that it is queer  it is not picturesque or poetic or dramatic it is queer  an enfilading glance gives this impression and no other if you go to the balcony of the nearest marine restaurant for a flanking eyeshot it is still queer with the added effect in all those arms upstretched to the lifelines of frogs legs inverted in a downward plunge  on the sand before this spectacle i talked with a philosopher of humble condition who backed upon me and knocked my umbrella out of my hand this made us beg each others pardon he said that he did not know i was there and i said it did not matter  then we both looked at the bathing and he said  i dont like that  why i asked do you see any harm in it  no  but i dont like the looks of it  it aint nice  its queer  it was indeed like one of those uncomfortable dreams where you are not dressed sufficiently for company or perhaps at all and yet are making a very public appearance  this promiscuous bathing was not much in excess of the convention that governs the seabathing of the politest people it could not be and it was marked by no grave misconduct  here and there a gentleman was teaching a lady to swim with his arms round her here and there a wild nereid was splashing another a young jew pursued a flight of naiads with a section of dead eel in his hand  but otherwise all was a damp and dreary decorum  i challenged my philosopher in vain for a specific cause of his dislike of the scene  most of the people on the sand were in bathingdress but there were a multitude of others who had apparently come for the seaair and not the seabathing  a mother sat with a sick child on her knees babies were cradled in the sand asleep and people walked carefully round and over them  there were everywhere a great many poor mothers and children who seemed getting the most of the good that was going     vi  but upon the whole though i drove away from the beach celebrating the good temper and the good order of the scene to an applausive driver i have since thought of it as rather melancholy  it was in fact no wiser or livelier than a society function in the means of enjoyment it afforded  the best thing about it was that it left the guests very much to their own devices  the established pleasures were clumsy and tiresomelooking but one could eschew them  the more of them one eschewed the merrier perhaps for i doubt if the race is formed for much pleasure and even a days rest is more than most people can bear  they endure it in passing but they get home weary and cross even after a twentymile run on the wheel  the road bytheby was full of homeward wheels by this time single and double and tandem and my driver professed that their multitude greatly increased the difficulties of his profession       sawdust in the arena  it was in the old roman arena of beautiful verona that the circus events i wish to speak of took place in fact i had the honor and profit of seeing two circuses there  or strictly speaking it was one entire circus that i saw and the unique speciality of another the dying glory of a circus on its last legs the triumphal fall of a circus superb in adversity     i  the entire circus was altogether italian with the exception of the clowns who to the credit of our nation are always americans or advertised as such in italy  its chief and almost absorbing event was a reproduction of the tournament which had then lately been held at rome in celebration of prince tommasos coming of age and for a copy of a copy it was really fine  it had fitness in the arena which must have witnessed many such mediaeval shows in their time and i am sensible still of the pleasure its effects of color gave me  there was one beautiful woman a red blonde in a green velvet gown who might have ridden as she was out of a canvas of titians if he had ever painted equestrian pictures and who at any rate was an excellent carpaccio then the clowns americani were very amusing from a platform devoted solely to them and it was a source of pride if not of joy with me to think that we were almost the only people present who understood their jokes  in the vast oval of the arena however the circus ring looked very little not half so large say as the rim of a ladys hat in front of you at the play and on the gradines of the ancient amphitheatre we were all such a great way off that a good fieldglass would have been needed to distinguish the features of the actors  i could not make out therefore whether the clowns americani had the national expression or not but one of them i am sorry to say spoke the united states language with a cockney accent  i suspect that he was an englishman who had passed himself off upon the italian management as a true yankee and who had formed himself upon our school of clowning just as some of the recent english humorists have patterned after certain famous wits of ours  i do not know that i would have exposed this impostor even if occasion had offered for after all his fraud was a tribute to our own primacy in clowning and the veronese were none the worse for his erring aspirates  the audience was for me the best part of the spectacle as the audience always is in italy and i indulged my fancy in some cheap excursions concerning the place and people  i reflected that it was the same race essentially as that which used to watch the gladiatorial shows in that arena when it was new and that very possibly there were among these spectators persons of the same blood as those veronese patricians who had left their names carved on the front of the gradines in places to claim this or that seat for their own  in fact there was so little difference probably in their qualities from that time to this that i felt the process of the generations to be a sort of impertinence and if nature had been present i might very well have asked her why when she had once arrived at a given expression of humanity she must go on repeating it indefinitely  how were all those similar souls to know themselves apart in their common eternity  merely to have been differently circumstanced in time did not seem enough and i think nature would have been puzzled to answer me  but perhaps not she may have had her reasons as that you cannot have too much of a good thing and that when the type was so fine in most respects as the italian you could not do better than go on repeating impressions from it  certainly i myself could have wished no variation from it in the young officer of bersaglieri who had come down from antiquity to the topmost gradine of the arena over against me and stood there defined against the clear evening sky one hand on his hip and the other at his side while his thin cockerel plumes streamed in the light wind  i have since wondered if he knew how beautiful he was and i am sure that if he did not all the women there did and that was doubtless enough for the young officer of bersaglieri     ii  i think that he was preliminary to the sole event of that partial circus i have mentioned  this event was one that i have often witnessed elsewhere but never in such noble and worthy keeping  the top of the outer arena wall must itself be fifty feet high and the pole in the centre of its oval seemed to rise fifty feet higher yet  at its base an immense net was stretched and a man in a prince albert coat and a derby hat was figuring about anxiously directing the workmen who were fixing the guyropes and testing every particular of the preparation with his own hands  while this went on a young girl ran out into the arena and after a bow to the spectators quickly mounted to the top of the pole where she presently stood in statuesque beauty that took all eyes even from the loveliness of the officer of bersaglieri  there the man in the prince albert coat and the derby hat stepped back from the net and looked up at her  she called down in english that sounded like some delocalized denaturalized speech it was so strange then and there is it all right  he shouted back in the same alienated tongue yes keep to the left and she dived straight downward in the long plunge till just before she reached the net she turned a quick somersault into its elastic mesh  it was all so exquisitely graceful that one forgot how wickedly dangerous it was but i think that the brief english colloquy was the great wonder of the event for me and i doubt if i could ever have been perfectly happy again if chance had not amiably suffered me to satisfy my curiosity concerning the speakers  a few evenings after that i was at that copy of a copy of a tournament and a few gradines below me i saw the man of the prince albert coat and the derby hat  i had already made up my mind that he was an american for i supposed that an englishman would rather perish than wear such a coat with such a hat and as i had wished all my life to speak to a circusman i went down and boldly accosted him  are you a brother yankee  i asked and he laughed and confessed that he was an englishman but he said he was glad to meet any one who spoke english and he made a place for me by his side  he was very willing to tell how he happened to be there and he explained that he was the manager of a circus which had been playing to very good business all winter in spain  in an evil hour he decided to come to italy but he found the prices so ruinously low that he was forced to disband his company  this diving girl was all that remained to him of its many attractions and he was trying to make a living for both in a country where the admission to a circus was six of our cents with fifty for a reserved seat  but he was about to give it up and come to america where he said barnum had offered him an engagement  i hope he found it profitable and is long since an american citizen with as good right as any of us to wear a prince albert coat with a derby hat     iii  there used to be very good circuses in venice where many venetians had the only opportunity of their lives to see a horse  the horses were the great attraction for them and perhaps in concession to their habitual destitution in this respect the riding was providentially very good  it was so good that it did not bore me as circusriding mostly does especially that of the silkclad jockey who stands in his high boots on his backbared horse and ends by waving an american flag in triumph at having been so tiresome  i am at a loss to know why they make such an ado about the lady who jumps through paper hoops which have first had holes poked in them to render her transit easy or why it should be thought such a merit in her to hop over a succession of banners which are swept under her feet in a manner to minify her exertion almost to nothing but i observe it is so at all circuses  at my first venetian circus which was on a broad expanse of the riva degli schiavoni there was a girl who flung herself to the ground and back to her horse again holding by his mane with one hand quite like the goddess out of the bathgown at my village circus the other day and apparently there are more circuses in the world than circus events  it must be as hard to think up anything new in that kind as in romanticistic fiction which circusacting otherwise largely resembles  at a circus which played all one winter in florence i saw for the first timeoutside of polite societythe clown in evening dress who now seems essential to all circuses of metropolitan pretensions and whom i missed so gladly at my village circus  he is nearly as futile as the lady clown who is one of the saddest and strangest developments of new womanhood  of the clowns who do not speak i believe i like most the clown who catches a succession of peakcrowned soft hats on his head when thrown across the ring by an accomplice  this is a very pretty sight always and at the hippodrome in paris i once saw a gifted creature take his stand high up on the benches among the audience and catch these hats on his head from a flight of a hundred feet through the air  this made me proud of human nature which is often so humiliating and altogether i do not think that after a real country circus there are many better things in life than the hippodrome  it had a state a dignity a smoothness a polish which i should not know where to match and when the superb coach drove into the ring to convey the lady performers to the scene of their events there was a majesty in the effect which i doubt if courts have the power to rival  still it should be remembered that i have never been at court and speak from a knowledge of the hippodrome only       at a dime museum  i see said my friend that you have been writing a good deal about the theatre during the past winter  you have been attacking its high hats and its high prices and its low morals and i suppose that you think you have done good as people call it     i  this seemed like a challenge of some sort and i prepared myself to take it up warily  i said i should be very sorry to do good as people called it because such a line of action nearly always ended in spiritual pride for the doer and general demoralization for the doee  still i said a law had lately been passed in ohio giving a man who found himself behind a high hat at the theatre a claim for damages against the manager and if the passage of this law could be traced ever so faintly and indirectly to my teachings i should not altogether grieve for the good i had done i added that if all the states should pass such a law and other laws fixing a low price for a certain number of seats at the theatres or obliging the managers to give one free performance every month as the law does in paris and should then forbid indecent and immoral plays  i see what you mean said my friend a little impatiently  you mean sumptuary legislation  but i have not come to talk to you upon that subject for then you would probably want to do all the talking yourself i want to ask you if you have visited any of the cheaper amusements of this metropolis or know anything of the really clever and charming things one may see there for a very little money  ten cents for instance  yes  i answered that i would never own to having come as low down as that and i expressed a hardy and somewhat inconsistent doubt of the quality of the amusement that could be had for that money  i questioned if anything intellectual could be had for it  what do you say to the tencent magazines  my friend retorted  and do you pretend that the twodollar drama is intellectual  i had to confess that it generally was not and that this was part of my grief with it  then he said i dont contend that it is intellectual but i say that it is often clever and charming at the tencent shows just as it is less often clever and charming in the tencent magazines  i think the average of propriety is rather higher than it is at the twodollar theatres and it is much more instructive at the tencent shows if you come to that the other day said my friend and in squaring himself comfortably in his chair and finding room for his elbow on the corner of my table he knocked off some books for review i went to a dime museum for an hour that i had between two appointments and i must say that i never passed an hours time more agreeably  in the curio hall as one of the lecturers on the curios called itthey had several lecturers in white wigs and scholars caps and gownsthere was not a great deal to see i confess but everything was very highclass  there was the inventor of a perpetual motion who lectured upon it and explained it from a diagram there was a fortuneteller in a threefoot tent whom i did not interview there were five macaws in one cage and two gloomy apes in another  on a platform at the end of the hall was an australian family a good deal gloomier than the apes who sat in the costume of our latitude staring down the room with varying expressions all verging upon melancholy madness and who gave me such a pang of compassion as i have seldom got from the tragedy of the twodollar theatres  they allowed me to come quite close up to them and to feed my pity upon their wild dejection in exile without stint  i couldnt enter into conversation with them and express my regret at finding them so far from their native boomerangs and kangaroos and pinetree grubs but i know they felt my sympathy it was so evident  i didnt see their performance and i dont know that they had any  they may simply have been there ethnologically but this was a good object and the sight of their spiritual misery was alone worth the price of admission  after the inventor of the perpetual motion had brought his harangue to a close we all went round to the dais where a lady in blue spectacles lectured us upon a fireescape which she had invented and operated a small model of it  none of the events were so exciting that we could regret it when the chief lecturer announced that this was the end of the entertainment in the curio hall and that now the performance in the theatre was about to begin  he invited us to buy tickets at an additional charge of five ten or fifteen cents for the gallery orchestra circle or orchestra  i thought i could afford an orchestra stall for once  we were three in the orchestra another man and a young mother not counting the little boy she had with her there were two people in the gallery and a dozen at least in the orchestra circle  an attendant shouted hats off and the other man and i uncovered and a lady came up from under the stage and began to play the piano in front of it  the curtain rose and the entertainment began at once  it was a passage apparently from real life and it involved a dissatisfied boarder and the daughter of the landlady there was not much coherence in it but there was a good deal of conscience on the part of the actors who toiled through it with unflagging energy  the young woman was equipped for the dance she brought into it at one point rather than for the part she had to sustain in the drama  it was a very blameless dance and she gave it as if she was tired of it but was not going to falter  she delivered her lines with a hard southwestern accent and i liked fancying her having come up in a simplerhearted section of the country than ours encouraged by a strong local belief that she was destined to do juliet and lady macbeth or peg woffington at the least but very likely she had not  her performance was followed by an event involving a single character the actor naturally was blackened as to his skin but as to his dress he was all in white and at the first glance i could see that he had temperament  i suspect that he thought i had too for he began to address his entire drama to me  this was not surprising for it would not have been the thing for him to single out the young mother and the other man in the orchestra stalls seemed a vague and inexperienced youth whom he would hardly have given the preference over me  i felt the compliment but upon the whole it embarrassed me it was too intimate and it gave me a publicity i would willingly have foregone  i did what i could to reject it by feigning an indifference to his jokes i even frowned a measure of disapproval but this merely stimulated his ambition  he was really a merry creature and when he had got off a number of very good things which were received in perfect silence and looked over his audience with a woebegone eye and said with an effect of delicate apology i hope im not disturbing you any i broke down and laughed and that delivered me into his hand  he immediately said to me that now he would tell me about a friend of his who had a pretty large family eight of them living and one in philadelphia and then for no reason he seemed to change his mind and said he would sing me a song written expressly for himby an expressman and he went on from one wild gayety to another until he had worked his audience up to quite a frenzy of enthusiasm and almost had a recall when he went off  i was rather glad to be rid of him and i was glad that the next performers who were a lady and a gentleman contortionist of spanish american extraction behaved more impartially  they were really remarkable artists in their way and though its a painful way i couldnt help admiring their gift in bowknots and other difficult poses the gentleman got abundant applause but the lady at first got none  i think perhaps it was because with the correct feeling that prevailed among us we could not see a lady contort herself with so much approval as a gentleman and that there was a wound to our sense of propriety in witnessing her skill  but i could see that the poor girl was hurt in her artist pride by our severity and at the next thing she did i led off the applause with my umbrella  she instantly lighted up with a joyful smile and the young mother in the orchestra leaned forward to nod her sympathy to me while she clapped  we were fast becoming a domestic circle and it was very pleasant but i thought that upon the whole i had better go  and do you think you had a profitable hour at that show  i asked with a smile that was meant to be sceptical  profitable  said my friend  i said agreeable  i dont know about the profit  but it was very good variety and it was very cheap  i understand that this is the kind of thing you want the twodollar theatre to come down to or up to  not exactly or not quite i returned thoughtfully though i must say i think your time was as well spent as it would have been at most of the plays i have seen this winter  my friend left the point and said with a dreamy air it was all very pathetic in a way  three out of those five people were really clever and certainly artists  that colored brother was almost a genius a very common variety of genius but still a genius with a gift for his calling that couldnt be disputed  he was a genuine humorist and i sorrowed over himafter i got safely away from his intimacyas i should over some author who was struggling along without winning his public  why not  one is as much in the show business as the other  there is a difference of quality rather than of kind  perhaps byandby my colored humorist will make a strike with his branch of the public as you are always hoping to do with yours  you dont think youre making yourself rather offensive  i suggested  not intentionally  arent the arts one  how can you say that any art is higher than the others  why is it nobler to contort the mind than to contort the body  i am always saying that it is not at all noble to contort the mind i returned and i feel that to aim at nothing higher than the amusement of your readers is to bring yourself most distinctly to the level of the show business  yes i know that is your pose said my friend  and i dare say you really think that you make a distinction in facts when you make a distinction in terms  if you dont amuse your readers you dont keep them practically you cease to exist  you may call it interesting them if you like but really what is the difference  you do your little act and because the stage is large and the house is fine you fancy you are not of that sad brotherhood which aims to please in humbler places with perhaps cruder means  i dont know whether i like your saws less than your instances or your instances less than your saws i broke in  have you been at the circus yet     ii  yet  demanded my friend  i went the first night and i have been a good deal interested in the examination of my emotions ever since i cant find out just why i have so much pleasure in the trapeze half the time i want to shut my eyes and a good part of the time i do look away but i wouldnt spare any actor the most dangerous feat one of the poor girls that night dropped awkwardly into the net after her performance and limped off to the dressingroom with a sprained ankle  it made me rather sad to think that now she must perhaps give up her perilous work for a while and pay a doctor and lose her salary but it didnt take away my interest in the other trapezists flying through the air above another net  if i had honestly complained of anything it would have been of the superfluity which glutted rather than fed me  how can you watch three sets of trapezists at once  you really see neither well  its the same with the three rings  there should be one ring and each act should have a fair chance with the spectator if it took six hours i would willingly give the time  fancy three stages at the theatre with three plays going on at once  no dont fancy that i entreated  one play is bad enough  or fancy reading three novels simultaneously and listening at the same time to a lecture and a sermon which could represent the two platforms between the rings my friend calmly persisted  the three rings are an abuse and an outrage but i dont know but i object still more to the silencing of the clowns  they have a great many clowns now but they are all dumb and you only get half the good you used to get out of the single clown of the old onering circus  why its as if the literary humorist were to lead up to a charming conceit or a subtle jest and then put asterisks where the humor ought to come in  dont you think you are going from bad to worse  i asked  my friend went on im afraid the circus is spoiled for me  it has become too much of a good thing for it is a good thing almost the best thing in the way of an entertainment that there is  im still very fond of it but i come away defeated and defrauded because i have been embarrassed with riches and have been given more than i was able to grasp  my greed has been overfed  i think i must keep to those entertainments where you can come at ten in the morning and stay till ten at night with a perpetual change of bill only one stage and no fall of the curtain  i suppose you would object to them because theyre getting rather dear at the best of them now they ask you a dollar for the first seats  i said that i did not think this too much for twelve hours if the intellectual character of the entertainment was correspondingly high  its as high as that of some magazines said my friend though i could sometimes wish it were higher  its like the matter in the sunday papersabout that average  some of its good and most of it isnt some of it could hardly be worse  but there is a great deal of it and you get it consecutively and not simultaneously  that constitutes its advantage over the circus  my friend stopped with a vague smile and i asked  then do i understand that you would advise me to recommend the dime museums the circus and the perpetualmotion varieties in the place of the theatres  you have recommended books instead and that notion doesnt seem to have met with much favor though you urged their comparative cheapness  now why not suggest something that is really level with the popular taste       american literature in exile  a recently lecturing englishman is reported to have noted the unenviable primacy of the united states among countries where the struggle for material prosperity has been disastrous to the pursuit of literature he said or is said to have said one cannot be too careful in attributing to a public man the thoughts that may be really due to an imaginative frame in the reporter that among us the old race of writers of distinction such as longfellow bryant holmes and washington irving have sic died out and the americans who are most prominent in cultivated european opinion in art or literature like sargent henry james or marion crawford live habitually out of america and draw their inspiration from england france and italy     i  if this were true i confess that i am so indifferent to what many americans glory in that it would not distress me or wound me in the sort of selflove which calls itself patriotism  if it would at all help to put an end to that struggle for material prosperity which has eventuated with us in so many millionaires and so many tramps i should be glad to believe that it was driving our literary men out of the country  this would be a tremendous objectlesson and might be a warning to the millionaires and the tramps  but i am afraid it would not have this effect for neither our very rich nor our very poor care at all for the state of polite learning among us though for the matter of that i believe that economic conditions have little to do with it and that if a general mediocrity of fortune prevailed and there were no haste to be rich and to get poor the state of polite learning would not be considerably affected  as matters stand i think we may reasonably ask whether the americans most prominent in cultivated european opinion the americans who live habitually out of america are not less exiles than advance agents of the expansion now advertising itself to the world they may be the vanguard of the great army of adventurers destined to overrun the earth from these shores and exploit all foreign countries to our advantage  they probably themselves do not know it but in the act of drawing their inspiration from alien scenes or taking their own where they find it are not they simply transporting to europe the struggle for material prosperity which sir lepel supposes to be fatal to them here  there is a question however which comes before this and that is the question whether they have quitted us in such numbers as justly to alarm our patriotism  qualitatively in the authors named and in the late mr bret harte mr harry harland and the late mr harold frederic as well as in mark twain once temporarily resident abroad the defection is very great but quantitatively it is not such as to leave us without a fair measure of homekeeping authorship  our destitution is not nearly so great now in the absence of mr james and mr crawford as it was in the times before the struggle for material prosperity when washington irving went and lived in england and on the european continent wellnigh half his life  sir lepel griffinor sir lepel griffins reporterseems to forget the fact of irvings long absenteeism when he classes him with the old race of eminent american authors who stayed at home  but really none of those he names were so constant to our air as he seemsor his reporter seems to think  longfellow sojourned three or four years in germany spain and italy holmes spent as great time in paris bryant was a frequent traveller and each of them drew his inspiration now and then from alien sources  lowell was many years in italy spain and england motley spent more than half his life abroad hawthorne was away from us nearly a decade     ii  if i seem to be proving too much in one way i do not feel that i am proving too much in another  my facts go to show that the literary spirit is the true worldcitizen and is at home everywhere  if any good american were distressed by the absenteeism of our authors i should first advise him that american literature was not derived from the folk lore of the red indians but was as i have said once before a condition of english literature and was independent even of our independence then i should entreat him to consider the case of foreign authors who had found it more comfortable or more profitable to live out of their respective countries than in them  i should allege for his consolation the case of byron shelley and leigh hunt and more latterly that of the brownings and walter savage landor who preferred an italian to an english sojourn and yet more recently that of mr rudyard kipling who voluntarily lived several years in vermont and has drawn his inspiration in notable instances from the life of these states  it will serve him also to consider that the two greatest norwegian authors bjornsen and ibsen have both lived long in france and italy  heinrich heine loved to live in paris much better than in dusseldorf or even in hamburg and tourguenief himself who said that any mans country could get on without him but no man could get on without his country managed to dispense with his own in the french capital and died there after he was quite free to go back to st petersburg  in the last century rousseau lived in france rather than switzerland voltaire at least tried to live in prussia and was obliged to a long exile elsewhere goldoni left fame and friends in venice for the favor of princes in paris  literary absenteeism it seems to me is not peculiarly an american vice or an american virtue  it is an expression and a proof of the modern sense which enlarges ones country to the bounds of civilization i cannot think it justly a reproach in the eyes of the world and if any american feels it a grievance i suggest that he do what he can to have embodied in the platform of his party a plank affirming the right of american authors to a public provision that will enable them to live as agreeably at home as they can abroad on the same money  in the mean time their absenteeism is not a consequence of the struggle for material prosperity not a high disdain of the strife which goes on not less in europe than in america and must of course go on everywhere as long as competitive conditions endure but is the result of chances and preferences which mean nothing nationally calamitous or discreditable       the horse show  as good as the circusnot so good as the circusbetter than the circus  these were my varying impressions as i sat looking down upon the tanbark the other day at the horse show in madison square garden and i came away with their blend for my final opinion     i  i might think that the horse show which is so largely a man show and a woman show was better or worse than the circus or about as good but i could not get away from the circus in my impression of it  perhaps the circus is the norm of all splendors where the horse and his master are joined for an effect upon the imagination of the spectator  i am sure that i have never been able quite to dissociate from it the picturesqueness of chivalry and that it will hereafter always suggest to me the last correctness of fashion  it is through the horse that these far extremes meet in all times the horse has been the supreme expression of aristocracy and it may very well be that a dream of the elder world prophesied the ultimate type of the future when the swell shall have evolved into the centaur  some such teasing notion of their mystical affinity is what haunts you as you make your round of the vast ellipse with the wellgroomed men about you and the wellgroomed horses beyond the barrier  in this first affair of the newcomer the horses are not so much on show as the swells you get only glimpses of shining coats and tossing manes with a glint here and there of a flying hoof through the lines of people coming and going and the ranks of people three or four feet deep against the rails of the ellipse but the swells are there in perfect relief and it is they who finally embody the horse show to you the fact is that they are there to see of course but the effect is that they are there to be seen  the whole spectacle had an historical quality which i tasted with pleasure  it was the thing that had eventuated in every civilization and the american might feel a characteristic pride that what came to rome in five hundred years had come to america in a single century  there was something fine in the absolutely fatal nature of the result and i perceived that nowhere else in our life which is apt to be reclusive in its exclusiveness is the prime motive at work in it so dramatically apparent  yes i found myself thinking this is what it all comes to the subiti guadagni of the new rich made in large masses and seeking a swift and eager exploitation and the slowly accumulated fortunes put together from sparing and scrimping from slaving and enslaving in former times and now in the stainless white hands of the second or third generation they both meet here to the purpose of a common ostentation and create a horse show  i cannot say that its creators looked much as if they liked it now they had got it and so far as i have been able to observe them people of wealth and fashion always dissemble their joy and have the air of being bored in the midst of their amusements  this reserve of rapture may be their delicacy their unwillingness to awaken envy in the less prospered and i should not have objected to the swells at the horse show looking dreary if they had looked more like swells except for a certain hardness of the countenance which i found my own sympathetically taking on i should not have thought them very patrician and this hardness may have been merely the consequence of being so much stared at  perhaps indeed they were not swells whom i saw in the boxes but only companies of ordinary people who had clubbed together and hired their boxes i understand that this can be done and the student of civilization so far misled  but certainly if they were swells they did not look quite up to themselves though for that matter neither do the nobilities of foreign countries and on one or two occasions when i have seen them kings and emperors have failed me in like manner  they have all wanted that indescribable something which i have found so satisfying in aristocracies and royalties on the stage and here at the horse show while i made my tour i constantly met handsome actorlike folk on foot who could much better have taken the role of the people in the boxes the promenaders may not have been actors at all they may have been the real thing for which i was in vain scanning the boxes but they looked like actors who indeed set an example to us all in personal beauty and in correctness of dress  i mean nothing offensive either to swells or to actors  we have not distinction as a people matthew arnold noted that and it is not our business to have it when it is our business our swells will have it just as our actors now have it especially our actors of english birth i had not this reflection about me at the time to console me for my disappointment and it only now occurs to me that what i took for an absence of distinction may have been such a universal prevalence of it that the result was necessarily a species of indistinction  but in the complexion of any social assembly we americans are at a disadvantage with europeans from the want of uniforms  a few military scattered about in those boxes or even a few sporting bishops in shovelhats and aprons would have done much to relieve them from the reproach i have been heaping upon them  our women indeed poor things always do their duty in personal splendor and it is not of a poverty in their modes at the horse show that i am complaining  if the men had borne their part as well there would not have been these tears and yet what am i saying there was here and there a cleanshaven face which i will not believe was always an actors and here and there a figure superbly set up and so faultlessly appointed as to shoes trousers coat tie hat and gloves as to have a salience from the mass of good looks and good clothes which i will not at last call less than distinction     ii  at any rate i missed these marked presences when i left the lines of the promenaders around the ellipse and climbed to a seat some tiers above the boxes  i am rather anxious to have it known that my seat was not one of those cheap ones in the upper gallery but was with the virtuous poor who could afford to pay a dollar and a half for their tickets  i bought it of a speculator on the sidewalk who said it was his last so that i conceived it the last in the house but i found the chairs by no means all filled though it was as good an audience as i have sometimes seen in the same place at other circuses  the people about me were such as i had noted at the other circuses hotelsojourners kindlylooking comers from provincial towns and cities whom i instantly felt myself at home with and free to put off that gloomy severity of aspect which had grown upon me during my association with the swells below  my neighbors were sufficiently well dressed and if they had no more distinction than their betters or their richers they had not the burden of the occasion upon them and seemed really glad of what was going on in the ring  there again i was sensible of the vast advantage of costume  the bugler who stood up at one end of the central platform and blew a fine fanfare i hope it was a fanfare towards the gates where the horses were to enter from their stalls in the basement was a hussarlike shape that filled my romantic soul with joy and the other figures of the management i thought very fortunate compromises between grooms and ringmasters  at any rate their nondescript costumes were gay and a relief from the fashions in the boxes and the promenade they were costumes and costumes are always more sincere if not more effective than fashions  as i have hinted i do not know just what costumes they were but they took the light well from the girandole far aloof and from the thousands of little electric bulbs that beaded the roof in long lines and dispersed the sullenness of the dull rainy afternoon  when the knights entered the lists on the seats of their dogcarts with their squires beside them and their shining tandems before them they took the light well too and the spectacle was so brilliant that i trust my imagery may be forgiven a novelist pining for the pageantries of the past  i do not know to this moment whether these knights were bona fide gentlemen or only their deputies driving their tandems for them and i am equally at a loss to account for the variety of their hats  some wore tall shining silk hats some flattopped brown derbys some simple black pothatsand is there then no rigor as to the headgear of people driving tandems i felt that there ought to be and that there ought to be some rule as to where the number of each tandem should be displayed  as it was this was sometimes carelessly stuck into the seat of the cart sometimes it was worn at the back of the grooms waist and sometimes full upon his stomach  in the last position it gave a touch of burlesque which wounded me for these are vital matters and i found myself very exacting in them  with the horses themselves i could find no fault upon the grounds of my censure of the show in some other ways  they had distinction they were patrician they were swell  they felt it they showed it they rejoiced in it and the most reluctant observer could not deny them the glory of blood of birth which the thoroughbred horse has expressed in all lands and ages  their lordly port was a thing that no one could dispute and for an aristocracy i suppose that they had a high average of intelligence though there might be two minds about this  they made me think of mettled youths and haughty dames they abashed the humble spirit of the beholder with the pride of their highstepping their curvetting and caracoling as they jingled in their shining harness around the long ring  their noble uselessness took the fancy for i suppose that there is nothing so superbly superfluous as a tandem outside or inside of the best society  it is something which only the ambition of wealth and unbroken leisure can mount to and i was glad that the display of tandems was the first event of the horse show which i witnessed for it seemed to me that it must beyond all others typify the power which created the horse show  i wished that the human side of it could have been more unquestionably adequate but the equine side of the event was perfect still i felt a certain relief as in something innocent and simple and childlike in the next event     iii  this was the inundation of the tanbark with troops of pretty shetland ponies of all ages sizes and colors  a cry of delight went up from a group of little people near me and the spell of the horse show was broken  it was no longer a solemnity of fashion it was a sweet and kindly pleasure which every one could share or every one who had ever had or ever wished to have a shetland pony the touch of nature made the whole show kin  i could not see that the freakish kittenish creatures did anything to claim our admiration but they won our affection by every trait of ponyish caprice and obstinacy  the small colts broke away from the small mares and gambolled over the tanbark in wanton groups with gay or plaintive whinnyings which might well have touched a responsive chord in the bosom of fashion itself i dare say it is not so hard as it looks  the scene remanded us to a moment of childhood and i found myself so fond of all the ponies that i felt it invidious of the judges to choose among them for the prizes they ought every one to have had the prize  i suppose a shetland pony is not a very useful animal in our conditions no doubt a good tough stubbed donkey would be worth all their tribe when it came down to hard work but we cannot all be hardworking donkeys and some of us may be toys and playthings without too great reproach  i gazed after the broken refluent wave of these amiable creatures with the vague toleration here formulated but i was not quite at peace in it or fully consoled in my habitual ethicism till the next event brought the hunters with their highjumping into the ring  these noble animals unite use and beauty in such measure that the censor must be of catonian severity who can refuse them his praise  when i reflected that by them and their devoted riders our civilization had been assimilated to that of the mothercountry in its finest expression and another tie added to those that bind us to her through the language of shakespeare and milton that they had tamed the haughty spirit of the american farmer in several parts of the country so that he submitted for a consideration to have his crops ridden over and that they had all but exterminated the ferocious aniseseed bag once so common and destructive among us i was in a fit mood to welcome the bars and hurdles which were now set up at four or five places for the purposes of the highjumping as to the beauty of the huntinghorse though i think i must hedge a little while i stand firmly to my admiration of his use  to be honest the tandem horse is more to my taste  he is better shaped and he bears himself more proudly  the hunter is apt to behave whatever his reserve of intelligence like an excited hen he is apt to be ewenecked and bred away to nothing where the ideal horse abounds he has the behavior of a turkeyhen when not behaving like the common or garden hen  but there can be no question of his jumping which seems to be his chief business in a world where we are all appointed our several duties and i at once began to take a vivid pleasure in his proficiency  i have always felt a blind and insensate joy in running races which has no relation to any particular horse and i now experienced an impartial rapture in the performances of these hunters  they looked very much alike and if it had not been for the changing numbers on the signboard in the centre of the ring announcing that 650 675 or 602 was now jumping i might have thought it was 650 all the time  a high jump is not so fine a sight as a running race when the horses have got half a mile away and look like a covey of swift birds but it is still a fine sight  i became very fastidious as to which moment of it was the finest whether when the horse rose in profile or when his aerial hoof touched the ground with the effect of half jerking his riders head half off or when he showed a flying heel in perspective and i do not know to this hour which i prefer  but i suppose i was becoming gradually spoiled by my pleasure for as time went on i noticed that i was not satisfied with the monotonous excellence of the horses execution  will it be credited that i became willing something should happen anything to vary it  i asked myself why if some of the more exciting incidents of the huntingfield which i had read of must befall i should not see them  several of the horses had balked at the barriers and almost thrown their riders across them over their necks but not quite done it several had carried away the greentufted top rail with their heels when suddenly there came a loud clatter from the farther side of the ellipse where a whole panel of fence had gone down  i looked eagerly for the prostrate horse and rider under the bars but they were cantering safely away     iv  it was enough however  i perceived that i was becoming demoralized and that if i were to write of the horse show with at all the superiority one likes to feel towards the rich and great i had better come away  but i came away critical even in my downfall and feeling that circus for circus the greatest show on earth which i had often seen in that place had certain distinct advantages of the horse show  it had three rings and two platforms and for another thing the drivers and riders in the races when they won bore the banner of victory aloft in their hands instead of poorly letting a blue or red ribbon flicker at their horses ears  the events were more frequent and rapid the costumes infinitely more varied and picturesque  as for the people in the boxes i do not know that they were less distinguished than these at the horse show but if they were not of the same high level in which distinction was impossible they did not show it in their looks  the horse show in fine struck me as a circus of not all the first qualities and i had moments of suspecting that it was no more than the evolution of the county cattle show  but in any case i had to own that its great success was quite legitimate for the horse upon the whole appeals to a wider range of humanity vertically as well as horizontally than any other interest not excepting politics or religion  i cannot indeed regard him as a civilizing influence but then we cannot be always civilizing       the problem of the summer  it has sometimes seemed to me that the solution of the problem how and where to spend the summer was simplest with those who were obliged to spend it as they spent the winter and increasingly difficult in the proportion of ones ability to spend it wherever and however one chose few are absolutely released to this choice however and those few are greatly to be pitied  i know that they are often envied and hated for it by those who have no such choice but that is a pathetic mistake  if we could look into their hearts indeed we should witness there so much misery that we should wish rather to weep over them than to reproach them with their better fortune or what appeared so     i  for most people choice is a curse and it is this curse that the summer brings upon great numbers who would not perhaps otherwise be afflicted they are not in the happy case of those who must stay at home their hard necessity is that they can go away and try to be more agreeably placed somewhere else but although i say they are in great numbers they are an infinitesimal minority of the whole bulk of our population  their bane is not in its highest form that of the average american who has no choice of the kind and when one begins to speak of the summer problem one must begin at once to distinguish  it is the problem of the east rather than of the west where people are much more in the habit of staying at home the year round and it is the problem of the city and not of the country  i am not sure that there is one practical farmer in the whole united states who is obliged to witness in his household those sad dissensions which almost separate the families of professional men as to where and how they shall pass the summer  people of this class which is a class with some measure of money ease and taste are commonly of varying and decided minds and i once knew a family of the sort whose combined ideal for their summer outing was summed up in the simple desire for society and solitude mountainair and seabathing  they spent the whole months of april may and june in a futile inquiry for a resort uniting these attractions and on the first of july they drove to the station with no definite point in view  but they found that they could get return tickets for a certain place on an inland lake at a low figure and they took the first train for it  there they decided next morning to push on to the mountains and sent their baggage to the station but before it was checked they changed their minds and remained two weeks where they were  then they took train for a place on the coast but in the cars a friend told them they ought to go to another place they decided to go there but before arriving at the junction they decided again to keep on  they arrived at their original destination and the following day telegraphed for rooms at a hotel farther down the coast the answer came that there were no rooms and being by this time ready to start they started and in due time reported themselves at the hotel the landlord saw that something must be done and he got them rooms at a smaller house and mealed them as it used to be called at mt desert in his own  but upon experiment of the fare at the smaller house they liked it so well that they resolved to live there altogether and they spent a summer of the greatest comfort there so that they would hardly come away when the house closed in the fall  this was an extreme case and perhaps such a venture might not always turn out so happily but i think that people might oftener trust themselves to providence in these matters than they do  there is really an infinite variety of pleasant resorts of all kinds now and one could quite safely leave it to the man in the ticketoffice where one should go and check ones baggage accordingly  i think the chances of an agreeable summer would be as good in that way as in making a hardand fast choice of a certain place and sticking to it  my own experience is that in these things chance makes a very good choice for one as it does in most nonmoral things     ii  a joke dies hard and i am not sure that the life is yet quite out of the kindly ridicule that was cast for a whole generation upon the people who left their comfortable houses in town to starve upon farmboard or stifle in the narrow rooms of mountain and seaside hotels  yet such people were in the right and their mockers were in the wrong and their patient persistence in going out of town for the summer in the face of severe discouragements has multiplied indefinitely the kinds of summer resorts and reformed them altogether  i believe the city boardinghouse remains very much what it used to be but i am bound to say that the country boardinghouse has vastly improved since i began to know it  as for the summer hotel by steep or by strand it leaves little to be complained of except the prices  i take it for granted therefore that the outof town summer has come to stay for all who can afford it and that the chief sorrow attending it is that curse of choice which i have already spoken of  i have rather favored chance than choice because whatever choice you make you are pretty sure to regret it with a bitter sense of responsibility added which you cannot feel if chance has chosen for you i observe that people who own summer cottages are often apt to wish they did not and were footloose to roam where they listed and i have been told that even a yacht is not a source of unmixed content though so eminently detachable  to great numbers europe looks from this shore like a safe refuge from the american summer problem and yet i am not sure that it is altogether so for it is not enough merely to go to europe one has to choose where to go when one has got there  a european city is certainly always more tolerable than an american city but one cannot very well pass the summer in paris or even in london  the heart there as here will yearn for some blessed seat                where falls not hail or rain or any snow                nor ever wind blows loudly but it lies                deepmeadowd happy fair with orchard lawns                and bowery hollows crownd with summer sea  and still after your keel touches the strand of that alluring old world you must buy your ticket and register your trunk for somewhere in particular     iii  it is truly a terrible stress this summer problem and as i say my heart aches much more for those who have to solve it and suffer the consequences of their choice than for those who have no choice but must stay the summer through where their work is and be humbly glad that they have any work to keep them there  i am not meaning now of course business men obliged to remain in the city to earn the breador more correctly the cakeof their families in the country or even their clerks and bookkeepers and porters and messengers but such people as i sometimes catch sight of from the elevated trains in my reluctant midsummer flights through the city sweltering in upper rooms over sewingmachines or lapboards or stewing in the breathless tenement streets or driving clangorous trucks or monotonous cars or bending over washtubs at open windows for breaths of the noair without these all get on somehow and at the end of the summer they have not to accuse themselves of folly in going to one place rather than another their fate is decided for them and they submit to it whereas those who decide their fate are always rebelling against it  they it is whom i am truly sorry for and whom i write of with tears in my ink  their case is hard and it will seem all the harder if we consider how foolish they will look and how flat they will feel at the judgmentday when they are asked about their summer outings  i do not really suppose we shall be held to a very strict account for our pleasures because everybody else has not enjoyed them too that would be a pity of our lives and yet there is an oldfashioned compunction which will sometimes visit the heart if we take our pleasures ungraciously when so many have no pleasures to take  i would suggest then to those on whom the curse of choice between pleasures rests that they should keep in mind those who have chiefly pains to their portion in life  i am not i hope urging my readers to any active benevolence or counselling them to share their pleasures with others it has been accurately ascertained that there are not pleasures enough to go round as things now are but i would seriously entreat them to consider whether they could not somewhat alleviate the hardships of their own lot at the seaside or among the mountains by contrasting it with the lot of others in the sweatshops and the boilerfactories of life  i know very well that it is no longer considered very good sense or very good morality to take comfort in ones advantages from the disadvantages of others and this is not quite what i mean to teach  perhaps i mean nothing more than an overhauling of the whole subject of advantages and disadvantages which would be a light and agreeable occupation for the leisure of the summer outer  it might be very interesting and possibly it might be amusing for one stretched upon the beach or swaying in the hammock to inquire into the reasons for his or her being so favored and it is not beyond the bounds of expectation that a consensus of summer opinion on this subject would go far to enlighten the world upon a question that has vexed the world ever since mankind was divided into those who work too much and those who rest too much       aesthetic new york fiftyodd years ago  a study of new york civilization in 1849 has lately come into my hands with a mortifying effect which i should like to share with the reader to my pride of modernity  i had somehow believed that after half a century of material prosperity such as the world has never seen before new york in 1902 must be very different from new york in 1849 but if i am to trust either the impressions of the earlier student or my own new york is essentially the same now that it was then  the spirit of the place has not changed it is as it was splendidly and sordidly commercial  even the body of it has undergone little or no alteration it was as shapeless as incongruous as ugly when the author of new york in slices wrote as it is at this writing it has simply grown or overgrown on the moral and material lines which seem to have been structural in it from the beginning  he felt in his time the same vulgarity the same violence in its architectural anarchy that i have felt in my time and he noted how all dignity and beauty perished amid the warring forms with a prescience of my own affliction which deprives me of the satisfaction of a discoverer and leaves me merely the sense of being rather oldfashioned in my painful emotions     i  i wish i could pretend that my author philosophized the facts of his new york with something less than the raw haste of the young journalist but i am afraid i must own that new york in slices affects one as having first been printed in an evening paper and that the writer brings to the study of the metropolis something like the eager horror of a country visitor  this probably enabled him to heighten the effect he wished to make with readers of a kindred tradition and for me it adds a certain innocent charm to his work  i may make myself better understood if i say that his attitude towards the depravities of a smaller new york is much the same as that of mr stead towards the wickedness of a much larger chicago  he seizes with some such avidity upon the darker facts of the prisons the slums the gamblinghouses the mock auctions the toughs who then called themselves bhoys and ghals the quacks the theatres and even the intelligence offices and exploits their iniquities with a ready virtue which the wickedest reader can enjoy with him  but if he treated of these things alone i should not perhaps have brought his curious little book to the polite notice of my readers he treats also of the press the drama the art and above all the literary soirees of that remote new york of his in a manner to make us latest newyorkers feel our close proximity to it  fiftyodd years ago journalism had already become the absorbing remorseless clamorous thing we now know and very different from the thing it was when expresses were unheard of and telegraphs were uncrystallized from the lightnings blue and fiery film  reporterism was beginning to assume its present importance but it had not yet become the paramount intellectual interest and did not yet stand shoulder to shoulder with the countingroom in authority  great editors then as now ranked great authors in the public esteem or achieved a double primacy by uniting journalism and literature in the same personality  they were often the owners as well as the writers of their respective papers and they indulged for the advantage of the community the rancorous rivalries recriminations and scurrilities which often form the charm if not the chief use of our contemporaneous journals  apparently however notarially authenticated boasts of circulation had not yet been made the delight of their readers and the press had not become the detective agency that it now is nor the organizer and distributer of charities  but as dark a cloud of doubt rested upon its relations to the theatre as still eclipses the popular faith in dramatic criticism  how can you expect our author asks a frank and unbiassed criticism upon the performance of george frederick cooke snooks       when the editor or reporter who is to write it has just been supping on beefsteak and stewed potatoes at windusts and regaling himself on brandyandwater cold without at the expense of the aforesaid george frederick cooke snooks the severest censor of the press however would hardly declare now that as to such a thing as impartial and independent criticism upon theatres in the present state of the relations between editors reporters managers actorsand actressesthe thing is palpably out of the question and if matters were really at the pass hinted the press has certainly improved in fifty years if one may judge from its present frank condemnations of plays and players  the theatre apparently has not for we read that at that period a very great majority of the standard plays and farces on the stage depend mostly for their piquancy and their power of interesting an audience upon intrigues with married women elopements seductions bribery cheating and fraud of every description         stage costume too wherever there is half a chance is usually made as lascivious and immodest as possible and a freedom and impropriety prevails among the characters of the piece which would be kicked out of private society the instant it would have the audacity to make its appearance there     ii  i hope private society in new york would still be found as correct if not quite so violent and i wish i could believe that the fine arts were presently in as flourishing a condition among us as they were in 1849 that was the prosperous day of the art unions in which the artists clubbed their output and the subscribers parted the works among themselves by something so very like raffling that the art unions were finally suppressed under the law against lotteries  while they lasted however they had exhibitions thronged by our wealth fashion and intellect to name them in the order they hold the new york mind as our private views now are or ought to be and the author devotes an entire number of his series to a single institutionfearless of being accused of partiality by any who rightly appreciate the influences of the fine arts upon the morals and refinement of mankind  he devotes even more than an entire number to literature for besides treating of various literary celebrities at the literary soirees he imagines encountering several of them at the highclass restaurants at delmonicos where if you had french and money you could get in that day a dinner which as a work of art ranks with a picture by huntington a poem by willis or a statue by powers he meets such a musical critic as richard grant white such an intellectual epicurean as n p willis such a lyric poet as charles fenno hoffman  but it would be a warm day for delmonicos when the observer in this epoch could chance upon so much genius at its tables perhaps because genius among us has no longer the french or the money  indeed the author of new york in slices seems finally to think that he has gone too far even for his own period and brings himself up with the qualifying reservation that if willis and hoffman never did dine together at delmonicos they ought to have done so  he has apparently no misgivings as to the famous musical critic and he has no scruple in assembling for us at his literary soiree a dozen distinguishedlooking men and twice as many women listening to a tall deaconly man who stands between two candles held by a couple of sticks summoned from the recesses of the back parlor reading a basketful of giltedged notes  it is       the annual valentine party to which all the male and female authors have contributed for the purpose of saying on paper charming things of each other and at which for a few hours all are gratified with the full meed of that praise which a cold world is chary of bestowing upon its literary cobweb spinners  it must be owned that we have no longer anything so like a salon as this  it is indeed rather terrible and it is of a quality in its celebrities which may well carry dismay to any among us presently intending immortality  shall we one day we who are now in the rich and full enjoyment of our farreaching fame affect the imagination of posterity as these phantoms of the past affect ours  shall we too appear in some pale limbo of unimportance as thin and faded as john inman the getterup of innumerable things for the annuals and magazines or as dr rufus griswold supposed for picturesque purposes to be stalking about with an immense quarto volume under his arm      an early copy of his forthcoming female poets of america or as lewis gaylord clark the sunnyfaced smiling editor of the knickerbocker magazine who dont look as if the inkfiend had ever heard of him as he stands up to dance a polka with a demure lady who has evidently spilled the inkstand over her dress or as the stately mrs seba smith bending aristocratically over the centretable and talking in a bright cold steady stream like an antique fountain by moonlight or as the spiritual and dainty fanny osgood clapping her hands and crowing like a baby where she sits nestled under a shawl of heraldic devices like a bird escaped from its cage or as margaret fuller her large gray eyes tamping inspiration and her thin quivering lip prophesying like a pythoness  i hope not i earnestly hope not  whatever i said at the outset affirming the persistent equality of new york characteristics and circumstances i wish to take back at this point and i wish to warn malign foreign observers of the sort who have so often refused to see us as we see ourselves that they must not expect to find us now grouped in the taste of 1849  possibly it was not so much the taste of 1849 as the author of new york in slices would have us believe and perhaps any one who trusted his pictures of life among us otherwise would be deceived by a parity of the spirit in which they are portrayed with that of our modern society journalism       from new york into new england  there is of course almost a worlds difference between england and the continent anywhere but i do not recall just now any transition between continental countries which involves a more distinct change in the superficial aspect of things than the passage from the middle states into new england  it is all american but american of diverse ideals and you are hardly over the border before you are sensible of diverse effects which are the more apparent to you the more american you are  if you want the contrast at its sharpest you had better leave new york on a sound boat for then you sleep out of the middle state civilization and wake into the civilization of new england which seems to give its stamp to nature herself  as to man he takes it whether native or alien and if he is foreignborn it marks him another irishman italian canadian jew or negro from his brother in any other part of the united states     i  when you have a theory of any kind proofs of it are apt to seek you out and i who am rather fond of my faith in new englands influence of this sort had as pretty an instance of it the day after my arrival as i could wish  a colored brother of massachusetts birth as black as a man can well be and of a merely anthropoidal profile was driving me along shore in search of a seaside hotel when we came upon a weakminded young chicken in the road  the natural expectation is that any chicken in these circumstances will wait for your vehicle and then fly up before it with a loud screech but this chicken may have been overcome by the heat it was a land breeze and it drew like the breath of a furnace over the haycocks and the clover or it may have mistimed the wheel which passed over its head and left it to flop a moment in the dust and then fall still  the poor little tragedy was sufficiently distressful to me but i bore it well compared with my driver  he could hardly stop lamenting it and when presently we met a young farmer he pulled up you goin past jim mardens  yes  well i wish youd tell him i just run over a chicken of his and i killed it i guess  i guess it was a pretty big one  oh no i put in it was only a broiler  what do you think it was worth  i took out some money and the farmer noted the largest coin in my hand about half a dollar i guess  on this i put it all back in my pocket and then he said well if a chicken dont know enough to get out of the road i guess you aint to blame i expressed that this was my own view of the case and we drove on  when we parted i gave the halfdollar to my driver and begged him not to let the owner of the chicken come on me for damages and though he chuckled his pleasure in the joke i could see that he was still unhappy and i have no doubt that he has that pullet on his conscience yet unless he has paid for it  he was of a race which elsewhere has so immemorially plundered henroosts that chickens are as free to it as the air it breathes without any conceivable taint of private ownership  but the spirit of new england had so deeply entered into him that the imbecile broiler of another slain by pure accident and by its own contributory negligence was saddening him while i was off in my train without a pang for the owner and with only an agreeable pathos for the pullet     ii  the instance is perhaps extreme and at any rate it has carried me in a psychological direction away from the simpler differences which i meant to note in new england  they were evident as soon as our train began to run from the steamboat landing into the country and they have intensified if they have not multiplied themselves as i have penetrated deeper and deeper into the beautiful region  the land is poorer than the land to the southwardone sees that at once the soil is thin and often so thickly burdened with granite bowlders that it could never have borne any other crop since the first puritans or pilgrims cut away the primeval woods and betrayed its hopeless sterility to the light  but wherever you come to a farmhouse whether standing alone or in one of the village groups that new england farmhouses have always liked to gather themselves into it is of a neatness that brings despair and of a repair that ought to bring shame to the beholder from more easygoing conditions  everything is kept up with a strenuous virtue that imparts an air of selfrespect to the landscape which the bleaching and blackening stone walls wandering over the hillslopes divide into wood lots of white birch and pine stony pastures and little patches of potatoes and corn  the mowinglands alone are rich and if the new england year is in the glory of the latest june the breath of the clover blows honeysweet into the car windows and the fragrance of the newcut hay rises hot from the heavy swaths that seem to smoke in the sun  we have struck a hot spell one of those torrid mood of continental weather which we have telegraphed us ahead to heighten our suffering by anticipation  but the farmsteads and village houses are safe in the shade of their sheltering trees amid the fluctuation of the grass that grows so tall about them that the june roses have to strain upward to get themselves free of it  behind each dwelling is a billowy mass of orchard and before it the gothic archway of the elms stretches above the quiet street  there is no tree in the world so full of sentiment as the american elm and it is nowhere so graceful as in these new england villages which are themselves i think the prettiest and wholesomest of mortal sojourns  by a happy instinct their wooden houses are all painted white to a marble effect that suits our meridional sky and the contrast of their darkgreen shutters is deliciously refreshing  there was an evil hour the terrible moment of the aesthetic revival now happily past when white walls and green blinds were thought in bad taste and the village houses were often tinged a dreary ground color or a doleful olive or a gloomy red but now they have returned to their earlier love  not the first love that was a pale buff with white trim but i doubt if it were good for all kinds of village houses the eye rather demands the white  the pale buff does very well for large colonial mansions like lowells or longfellows in cambridge but when you come say to see the great square houses built in portsmouth new hampshire early in this century and painted white you find that white after all is the thing for our climate even in the towns  in such a village as my colored brother drove me through on the way to the beach it was of an absolute fitness and i wish i could convey a due sense of the exquisite keeping of the place  each white house was more or less closely belted in with a white fence of panels or pickets the grassy dooryards glowed with flowers and often a climbing rose embowered the doorway with its bloom  away backward or sidewise stretched the woodshed from the dwelling to the barn and shut the whole under one cover the turf grew to the wheeltracks of the roadway over which the elms rose and drooped and from one end of the village to the other you could not as the saying is find a stone to throw at a dog i know holland i have seen the wives of scheveningen scrubbing up for sunday to the very middle of their brick streets but i doubt if dutch cleanliness goes so far without or comes from so deep a scruple within as the cleanliness of new england  i felt so keenly the feminine quality of its motive as i passed through that village that i think if i had dropped so much as a piece of paper in the street i must have knocked at the first door and begged the lady of the house who would have opened it in person after wiping her hands from her work taking off her apron and giving a glance at herself in the mirror and at me through the window blind to report me to the selectmen in the interest of good morals     iii  i did not know at once quite how to reconcile the present foulness of the new england capital with the fairness of the new england country and i am still somewhat embarrassed to own that after new york even under the relaxing rule of tammany boston seemed very dirty when we arrived there at best i was never more than a naturalized bostonian but it used to give me great pleasureso penetratingly does the place qualify even the sojourning westernerto think of the defect of new york in the virtue that is next to godliness and now i had to hang my head for shame at the mortifying contrast of the boston streets to the wellswept asphalt which i had left frying in the new york sun the afternoon before  later however when i began to meet the sort of boston faces i remembered so wellgood just pure but set and severe with their look of challenge of interrogation almost of reproofthey not only ignored the disgraceful untidiness of the streets but they convinced me of a state of transition which would leave the place swept and garnished behind it and comforted me against the litter of the winding thoroughfares and narrow lanes where the dust had blown up against the brick walls and seemed permanently to have smutched and discolored them  in new york you see the american face as europe characterizes it in boston you see it as it characterizes europe and it is in boston that you can best imagine the strenuous grapple of the native forces which all alien things must yield to till they take the american cast  it is almost dismaying that physiognomy before it familiarizes itself anew and in the brief first moment while it is yet objective you ransack your conscience for any sins you may have committed in your absence from it and make ready to do penance for them  i felt almost as if i had brought the dirty streets with me and were guilty of having left them lying about so impossible were they with reference to the boston face  it is a face that expresses care even to the point of anxiety and it looked into the window of our carriage with the serious eyes of our elderly hackman to make perfectly sure of our destination before we drove away from the station  it was a little rigorous with us as requiring us to have a clear mind but it was not unfriendly not unkind and it was patient from long experience  in new york there are no elderly hackmen but in boston they abound and i cannot believe they would be capable of bad faith with travellers  in fact i doubt if this class is anywhere as predatory as it is painted but in boston it appears to have the public honor in its keeping  i do not mean that it was less mature less self respectful in portsmouth where we were next to arrive more so it could not be an equal sense of safety of ease began with it in both places and all through new england it is of native birth while in new york it is composed of men of many nations with a weight in numbers towards the celtic strain  the prevalence of the native in new england helps you sensibly to realize from the first moment that here you are in america as the first americans imagined and meant it and nowhere in new england is the original tradition more purely kept than in the beautiful old seaport of new hampshire  in fact without being quite prepared to defend a thesis to this effect i believe that portsmouth is preeminently american and in this it differs from newburyport and from salem which have suffered from different causes an equal commercial decline and though among the earliest of the great puritan towns after boston are now largely made up of aliens in race and religion these are actually the majority i believe in newburyport     iv  the adversity of portsmouth began early in the century but before that time she had prospered so greatly that her merchant princes were able to build themselves wooden palaces with white walls and green shutters of a grandeur and beauty unmatched elsewhere in the country  i do not know what architect had his way with them though his name is richly worth remembrance but they let him make them habitations of such graceful proportion and of such delicate ornament that they have become shrines of pious pilgrimage with the young architects of our day who hope to house our welltodo people fitly in country or suburbs  the decoration is oftenest spent on a porch or portal or a frieze of peculiar refinement or perhaps it feels its way to the carven casements or to the delicate ironwork of the transoms the rest is a simplicity and a faultless propriety of form in the stately mansions which stand under the arching elms with their gardens sloping or dropping by easy terraces behind them to the river or to the borders of other pleasances  they are all of wood except for the granite foundations and doorsteps but the stout edifices rarely sway out of the true line given them and they look as if they might keep it yet another century  between them in the sunshotten shade lie the quiet streets whose gravelled stretch is probably never cleaned because it never needs cleaning  even the business streets and the quaint square which gives the most american of towns an air so foreign and old worldly look as if the wind and rain alone cared for them but they are not foul and the narrower avenues where the smaller houses of gray unpainted wood crowd each other flush upon the pavements towards the waterside are doubtless unvisited by the hoe or broom and must be kept clean by a new england conscience against getting them untidy  when you get to the riverside there is one stretch of narrow high shouldered warehouses which recall holland especially in a few with their gables broken in steps after the dutch fashion  these with their mouldering piers and grassgrown wharves have their pathos and the whole place embodies in its architecture an interesting record of the past from the time when the homesick exiles huddled close to the waters edge till the period of postcolonial prosperity when proud merchants and opulent captains set their vast square houses each in its handsome space of gardened ground  my adjectives might mislead as to size but they could not as to beauty and i seek in vain for those that can duly impart the peculiar charm of the town  portsmouth still awaits her novelist he will find a rich field when he comes and i hope he will come of the right sex for it needs some minute and subtle feminine skill like that of jane austen to express a fit sense of its life in the past  of its life in the present i know nothing  i could only go by those delightful silent houses and sigh my longing soul into their dim interiors  when now and then a young shape in summer silk or a group of young shapes in diaphanous muslin fluttered out of them i was no wiser and doubtless my elderly fancy would have been unable to deal with what went on in them  some girl of those flitting through the warm odorous twilight must become the creative historian of the place i can at least imagine a jane austen now growing up in portsmouth     v  if miss jewett were of a little longer breath than she has yet shown herself in fiction i might say the jane austen of portsmouth was already with us and had merely not yet begun to deal with its precious material one day when we crossed the piscataqua from new hampshire into maine and took the trolleyline for a run along through the lovely coast country we suddenly found ourselves in the midst of her own people who are a little different sort of newenglanders from those of miss wilkins  they began to flock into the car young maidens and old mothers and grandmothers and nice boys and girls with a very very few farmer youth of marriageable age and more rustic and seafaring elders long past it all in the sunday best which they had worn to the graduation exercises at the high school where we took them mostly up  the womenkind were in a nervous twitter of talk and laughter and the men tolerantly gay beyond their wont passing the time of day with one another and helping the more tumultuous sex to get settled in the overcrowded open car  they courteously made room for one another and let the children stand between their knees or took them in their laps with that unfailing american kindness which i am prouder of than the american valor in battle observing in all that american decorum which is no bad thing either  we had chanced upon the high and mighty occasion of the neighborhood year when people might well have been a little off their balance but there was not a boisterous note in the subdued affair  as we passed the schoolhouse door three dear pretty maids in white gowns and white slippers stood on the steps and gently smiled upon our company  one could see that they were inwardly glowing and thrilling with the excitement of their graduation but were controlling their emotions to a calm worthy of the august event so that no one might ever have it to say that they had appeared silly  the car swept on and stopped to set down passengers at their doors or gates where they severally left it with an easy air as of private ownership into some sense of which the trolley promptly flatters people along its obliging lines  one comfortable matron in a cinnamon silk was just such a figure as that in the miss wilkinss story where the bridegroom fails to come on the weddingday but as i say they made me think more of miss jewetts people  the shore folk and the downeasters are specifically hers and these were just such as might have belonged in the country of the pointed firs or sister wisbys courtship or dulham ladies or an autumn ramble or twenty other entrancing tales sometimes one of them would try her front door and then with a bridling toss of the head express that she had forgotten locking it and slip round to the kitchen but most of the ladies made their way back at once between the roses and syringas of their grassy dooryards which were as neat and prim as their own persons or the best chamber in their white walled greenshuttered storyandahalf house and as perfectly kept as the very kitchen itself  the trolleyline had been opened only since the last september but in an effect of familiar use it was as if it had always been there and it climbed and crooked and clambered about with the easy freedom of the country road which it followed  it is a land of low hills broken by frequent reaches of the sea and it is most amusing most amazing to see how frankly the trolleycar takes and overcomes its difficulties  it scrambles up and down the little steeps like a cat and whisks round a sharp and sudden curve with a feline screech broadening into a loud caterwaul as it darts over the estuaries on its trestles  its course does not lack excitement and i suppose it does not lack danger but as yet there have been no accidents and it is not so disfiguring as one would think  the landscape has already accepted it and is making the best of it and to the country people it is an inestimable convenience it passes everybodys front door or back door and the farmers can get themselves or their produce for it runs an express car into portsmouth in an hour twice an hour all day long  in summer the cars are open with transverse seats and stout curtains that quite shut out a squall of wind or rain  in winter the cars are closed and heated by electricity the young motorman whom i spoke with while we waited on a siding to let a car from the opposite direction get by told me that he was caught out in a blizzard last winter and passed the night in a snowdrift  but the cah was so wam i neva suffed a mite  well i summarized it must be a great advantage to all the people along the line  well you wouldnt a thought so from the kick they made  i suppose the cottagersthe summer colonydidnt like the noise  oh yes thats what i mean  thes whe the kick was  the natives like it  i guess the summa folks ll like it too  he looked round at me with enjoyment of his joke in his eye for we both understood that the summer folks could not help themselves and must bow to the will of the majority       the art of the adsmith  the other day a friend of mine who professes all the intimacy of a bad conscience with many of my thoughts and convictions came in with a bulky book under his arm and said i see by a guilty look in your eye that you are meaning to write about spring  i am not i retorted and if i were it would be because none of the new things have been said yet about spring and because spring is never an old story any more than youth or love  i have heard something like that before said my friend and i understand  the simple truth of the matter is that this is the fagend of the season and you have run low in your subjects  now take my advice and dont write about spring it will make everybody hate you and will do no good  write about advertising  he tapped the book under his arm significantly  here is a theme for you     i  he had no sooner pronounced these words than i began to feel a weird and potent fascination in his suggestion  i took the book from him and looked it eagerly through  it was called good advertising and it was written by one of the experts in the business who have advanced it almost to the grade of an art or a humanity  but i see nothing here i said musingly which would enable a self respecting author to come to the help of his publisher in giving due hold upon the public interest those charming characteristics of his book which no one else can feel so penetratingly or celebrate so persuasively  i expected some such objection from you said my friend  you will admit that there is everything else here  everything but that most essential thing  you know how we all feel about it the bitter disappointment the heartsickening sense of insufficiency that the advertised praises of our books give us poor authors  the effect is far worse than that of the reviews for the reviewer is not your ally and copartner while your publisher  i see what you mean said my friend  but you must have patience if the author of this book can write so luminously of advertising in other respects i am sure he will yet be able to cast a satisfactory light upon your problem  the question is i believe how to translate into irresistible terms all that fond and exultant regard which a writer feels for his book all his pervasive appreciation of its singular beauty unique value and utter charm and transfer it to print without infringing upon the delicate and shrinking modesty which is the distinguishing ornament of the literary spirit  something like that  but you understand  perhaps a roentgen ray might be got to do it said my friend thoughtfully or perhaps this author may bring his mind to bear upon it yet  he seems to have considered every kind of advertising except book advertising  the most important of all i cried impatiently  you think so because you are in that line  if you were in the line of varnish or bicycles or soap or typewriters or extract of beef or of malt  still i should be interested in bookadvertising because it is the most vital of human interests  tell me said my friend do you read the advertisements of the books of rival authors  brother authors i corrected him  well brother authors  i said no candidly i did not and i forbore to add that i thought them little better than a waste of the publishers money     ii  my friend did not pursue his inquiry to my personal disadvantage but seemed to prefer a more general philosophy of the matter  i have often wondered he said at the enormous expansion of advertising and doubted whether it was not mostly wasted  but my author here has suggested a brilliant fact which i was unwittingly groping for  when you take up a sunday paperi shuddered and my friend smiled intelligence you are simply appalled at the miles of announcements of all sorts  who can possibly read them  who cares even to look at them  but if you want something in particularto furnish a house or buy a suburban place or take a steamer for europe or go to the theatrethen you find out at once who reads the advertisements and cares to look at them  they respond to the multifarious wants of the whole community  you have before you the living operation of that law of demand and supply which it has always been such a bore to hear about as often happens the supply seems to come before the demand but thats only an appearance  you wanted something and you found an offer to meet your want  then you dont believe that the offer to meet your want suggested it  i see that my author believes something of the kind  we may be full of all sorts of unconscious wants which merely need the vivifying influence of an advertisement to make them spring into active being but i have a feeling that the money paid for advertising which appeals to potential wants is largely thrown away  you must want a thing or think you want it otherwise you resent the proffer of it as a kind of impertinence  there are some kinds of advertisements all the same that i read without the slightest interest in the subject matter  simply the beauty of the style attracts me  i know  but does it ever move you to get what you dont want  never and i should be glad to know what your author thinks of that sort of advertising the literary or dramatic or humorous or quaint  he doesnt contemn it quite  but i think he feels that it may have had its day  do you still read such advertisements with your early zest  no the zest for nearly everything goes  i dont care so much for tourguenief as i used  still if i come upon the jaunty and laconic suggestions of a certain wellknown clothinghouse concerning the seasons wear i read them with a measure of satisfaction  the advertising expert  this author calls him the adsmith  delightful  ad is a loathly little word but we must come to it  its as legitimate as lunch  but as i was saying the adsmith seems to have caught the american business tone as perfectly as any of our novelists have caught the american social tone  yes said my friend and he seems to have prospered as richly by it you know some of those chaps make fifteen or twenty thousand dollars by adsmithing  they have put their art quite on a level with fiction pecuniarily  perhaps it is a branch of fiction  no they claim that it is pure fact  my author discourages the slightest admixture of fable  the truth clearly and simply expressed is the best in an ad  it is best in a wof too  i am always saying that  wof  well work of fiction  its another new word like lunch or ad  but in a wof said my friend instantly adopting it my author insinuates that the fashion of payment tempts you to verbosity while in an ad the conditions oblige you to the greatest possible succinctness in one case you are paid by the word in the other you pay by the word that is where the adsmith stands upon higher moral ground than the wofsmith  i should think your author might have written a recent article in the  reproaching fiction with its unhallowed gains  if you mean that for a sneer it is misplaced  he would have been incapable of it  my author is no more the friend of honesty in adsmithing than he is of propriety he deprecates jocosity in apothecaries and undertakers not only as bad taste but as bad business and he is as severe as any one could be upon ads that seize the attention by disgusting or shocking the reader  he is to be praised for that and for the other thing and i shouldnt have minded his criticising the ready wofsmith  i hope he attacks the use of display type which makes our newspapers look like the poster plastered fences around vacant lots  in new york there is only one paper whose advertisements are not typographically a shock to the nerves  well said my friend he attacks foolish and ineffective display  it is all foolish and ineffective  it is like a crowd of people trying to make themselves heard by shouting each at the top of his voice a paper full of display advertisements is an image of our whole congested and delirious state of competition but even in competitive conditions it is unnecessary and it is futile  compare any new york paper but one with the london papers and you will see what i mean  of course i refer to the ad pages the rest of our exception is as offensive with pictures and scare heads as all the rest  i wish your author could revise his opinions and condemn all display in ads  i dare say he will when he knows what you think said my friend with imaginable sarcasm     iii  i wish i went on that he would give us some philosophy of the prodigious increase of advertising within the last twentyfive years and some conjecture as to the end of it all  evidently it cant keep on increasing at the present rate  if it does there will presently be no room in the world for things it will be filled up with the advertisements of things  before that time perhaps my friend suggested adsmithing will have become so fine and potent an art that advertising will be reduced in bulk while keeping all its energy and even increasing its effectiveness  perhaps i said some silent electrical process will be contrived so that the attractions of a new line of dressgoods or the fascination of a spring or fall opening may be imparted to a ladys consciousness without even the agency of words  all other facts of commercial and industrial interest could be dealt with in the same way  a fine thrill could be made to go from the last new book through the whole community so that people would not willingly rest till they had it  yes one can see an indefinite future for advertising in that way  the adsmith may be the supreme artist of the twentieth century  he may assemble in his grasp and employ at will all the arts and sciences  yes said my friend with a sort of fall in his voice that is very well  but what is to become of the race when it is penetrated at every pore with a sense of the worlds demand and supply  oh that is another affair  i was merely imagining the possible resources of invention in providing for the increase of advertising while guarding the integrity of the planet  i think very likely if the thing keeps on we shall all go mad but then we shall none of us be able to criticise the others  or possibly the thing may work its own cure  you know the ingenuity of the political economists in justifying the egotism to which conditions appeal  they do not deny that these foster greed and rapacity in merciless degree but they contend that when the wealth winner drops off gorged there is a kind of miracle wrought and good comes of it all  i never could see how but if it is true why shouldnt a sort of ultimate immunity come back to us from the very excess and invasion of the appeals now made to us and destined to be made to us still more by the adsmith  come isnt there hope in that  i see a great opportunity for the wofsmith in some such dream said my friend  why dont you turn it to account  you know that isnt my line i must leave that sort of wofsmithing to the romantic novelist  besides i have my wellknown panacea for all the ills our state is heir to in a civilization which shall legislate foolish and vicious and ugly and adulterate things out of the possibility of existence  most of the adsmithing is now employed in persuading people that such things are useful beautiful and pure  but in any civilization they shall not even be suffered to be made much less foisted upon the community by adsmiths  i see what you mean said my friend and he sighed gently  i had much better let you write about spring       the psychology of plagiarism  a late incident in the history of a very widespread english novelist triumphantly closed by the statement of his friend that the novelist had casually failed to accredit a given passage in his novel to the real author has brought freshly to my mind a curious question in ethics the friend who vindicated the novelist or rather who contemptuously dismissed the matter not only confessed the fact of adoption but declared that it was one of many which could be found in the novelists works  the novelist he said was quite in the habit of so using material in the rough which he implied was like using any fact or idea from life and he declared that the novelist could not bother to answer critics who regarded these exploitations as a sort of depredation  in a manner he brushed the impertinent accusers aside assuring the general public that the novelist always meant at his leisure and in his own way duly to ticket the flies preserved in his amber     i  when i read this haughty vindication i thought at first that if the case were mine i would rather have several deadly enemies than such a friend as that but since i have not been so sure  i have asked myself upon a careful review of the matter whether plagiarism may not be frankly avowed as in nowise dishonest and i wish some abler casuist would take the affair into consideration and make it clear for me  if we are to suppose that offences against society disgrace the offender and that public dishonor argues the fact of some such offence then apparently plagiarism is not such an offence for in even very flagrant cases it does not disgrace  the dictionary indeed defines it as the crime of literary theft but as no penalty attaches to it and no lasting shame it is hard to believe it either a crime or a theft and the offence if it is an offence one has to call it something and i hope the word is not harsh is some such harmless infraction of the moral law as white lying  the muchperverted saying of moliere that he took his own where he found it is perhaps in the consciousness of those who appropriate the things other people have rushed in with before them  but really they seem to need neither excuse nor defence with the impartial public if they are caught in the act of reclaiming their property or despoiling the rash intruder upon their premises  the novelist in question is by no means the only recent example and is by no means a flagrant example  while the ratification of the treaty with spain was pending before the senate of the united states a member of that body opposed it in a speech almost word for word the same as a sermon delivered in new york city only a few days earlier and published broadcast  he was promptly exposed by the parallelcolumn system but i have never heard that his standing was affected or his usefulness impaired by the offence proven against him  a few years ago an eminent divine in one of our cities preached as his own the sermon of a brother divine no longer living he too was detected and promptly exposed by the parallelcolumn system but nothing whatever happened from the exposure  every one must recall like instances more or less remote  i remember one within my youthfuller knowledge of a journalist who used as his own all the denunciatory passages of macaulays article on barrere and applied them with changes of name to the character and conduct of a local politician whom he felt it his duty to devote to infamy  he was caught in the fact and by means of the parallel column pilloried before the community  but the community did not mind it a bit and the journalist did not either  he prospered on amid those who all knew what he had done and when he removed to another city it was to a larger one and to a position of more commanding influence from which he was long conspicuous in helping shape the destinies of the nation  so far as any effect from these exposures was concerned they were as harmless as those exposures of fraudulent spiritistic mediums which from time to time are supposed to shake the spiritistic superstition to its foundations  they really do nothing of the kind the tabletippings rappings materializations and levitations keep on as before and i do not believe that the exposure of the novelist who has been the latest victim of the parallel column will injure him a jot in the hearts or heads of his readers     ii  i am very glad of it being a disbeliever in punishments of all sorts i am always glad to have sinners get off for i like to get off from my own sins and i have a bad moment from my sense of them whenever anothers have found him out  but as yet i have not convinced myself that the sort of thing we have been considering is a sin at all for it seems to deprave no more than it dishonors or that it is what the dictionary with very unnecessary brutality calls a crime and a theft  if it is either it is differently conditioned if not differently natured from all other crimes and thefts  these may be more or less artfully and hopefully concealed but plagiarism carries inevitable detection with it  if you take a mans hat or coat out of his hall you may pawn it before the police overtake you if you take his horse out of his stable you may ride it away beyond pursuit and sell it if you take his purse out of his pocket you may pass it to a pal in the crowd and easily prove your innocence  but if you take his sermon or his essay or even his apposite reflection you cannot escape discovery the world is full of idle people reading books and they are only too glad to act as detectives they please their miserable vanity by showing their alertness and are proud to hear witness against you in the court of parallel columns  you have no safety in the obscurity of the author from whom you take your own there is always that most terrible reader the reader of one book who knows that very author and will the more indecently hasten to bring you to the bar because he knows no other and wishes to display his erudition  a man may escape for centuries and yet be found out  in the notorious case of william shakespeare the offender seemed finally secure of his prey and yet one poor lady who ended in a lunatic asylum was able to detect him at last and to restore the goods to their rightful owner sir francis bacon  in spite however of this almost absolute certainty of exposure plagiarism goes on as it has always gone on and there is no probability that it will cease as long as there are novelists senators divines and journalists hard pressed for ideas which they happen not to have in mind at the time and which they see going to waste elsewhere  now and then it takes a more violent form and becomes a real mania as when the plagiarist openly claims and urges his right to a wellknown piece of literary property  when mr william allen butlers famous poem of nothing to wear achieved its extraordinary popularity a young girl declared and apparently quite believed that she had written it and lost the ms in an omnibus  all her friends apparently believed so too and the friends of the different gentlemen and ladies who claimed the authorship of beautiful snow and rock me to sleep were ready to support them by affidavit against the real authors of those pretty worthless pieces  from all these facts it must appear to the philosophic reader that plagiarism is not the simple crime or theft that the lexicographers would have us believe  it argues a strange and peculiar courage on the part of those who commit it or indulge it since they are sure of having it brought home to them for they seem to dread the exposure though it involves no punishment outside of themselves  why do they do it or having done it why do they mind it since the public does not  their temerity and their timidity are things almost irreconcilable and the whole position leaves one quite puzzled as to what one would do if ones own plagiarisms were found out  but this is a mere question of conduct and of infinitely less interest than that of the nature or essence of the thing itself       puritanism in american fiction  the question whether the fiction which gives a vivid impression of reality does truly represent the conditions studied in it is one of those inquiries to which there is no very final answer  the most baffling fact of such fiction is that its truths are selfevident and if you go about to prove them you are in some danger of shaking the convictions of those whom they have persuaded  it will not do to affirm anything wholesale concerning them a hundred examples to the contrary present themselves if you know the ground and you are left in doubt of the verity which you cannot gainsay  the most that you can do is to appeal to your own consciousness and that is not proof to anybody else perhaps the best test in this difficult matter is the quality of the art which created the picture  is it clear simple unaffected  is it true to human experience generally  if it is so then it cannot well be false to the special human experience it deals with     i  not long ago i heard of something which amusingly which pathetically illustrated the sense of reality imparted by the work of one of our writers whose art is of the kind i mean  a lady was driving with a young girl of the lighterminded civilization of new york through one of those little towns of the north shore in massachusetts where the small wooden houses cling to the edges of the shallow bay and the schooners slip in and out on the hidden channels of the salt meadows as if they were blown about through the tall grass  she tried to make her feel the shy charm of the place that almost subjective beauty which those to the manner born are so keenly aware of in oldfashioned new england villages but she found that the girl was not only not looking at the sadcolored cottages with their weatherworn shingle walls their grassy dooryards lit by patches of summer bloom and their shutterless windows with their closedrawn shades but she was resolutely averting her eyes from them and staring straightforward until she should be out of sight of them altogether  she said that they were terrible and she knew that in each of them was one of those dreary old women or disappointed girls or unhappy wives or bereaved mothers she had read of in miss wilkinss stories  she had been too little sensible of the humor which forms the relief of these stories as it forms the relief of the bare duteous conscientious deeply individualized lives portrayed in them and no doubt this cannot make its full appeal to the heart of youth aching for their stoical sorrows  without being so very young i too have found the humor hardly enough at times and if one has not the habit of experiencing support in tragedy itself one gets through a remote new england village at nightfall say rather limp than otherwise and in quite the mood that miss wilkinss bleaker studies leave one in  at mid day or in the bright sunshine of the morning it is quite possible to fling off the melancholy which breathes the same note in the fact and the fiction and i have even had some pleasure at such times in identifying this or that onestory cottage with its leanto as a mary wilkins house and in placing one of her muted dramas in it  one cannot know the people of such places without recognizing her types in them and one cannot know new england without owning the fidelity of her stories to new england character though as i have already suggested quite another sort of stories could be written which should as faithfully represent other phases of new england village life  to the alien inquirer however i should be by no means confident that their truth would evince itself for the reason that human nature is seldom on show anywhere  i am perfectly certain of the truth of tolstoy and tourguenief to russian life yet i should not be surprised if i went through russia and met none of their people  i should be rather more surprised if i went through italy and met none of vergas or fogazzaros but that would be because i already knew italy a little  in fact i suspect that the last delight of truth in any art comes only to the connoisseur who is as well acquainted with the subject as the artist himself  one must not be too severe in challenging the truth of an author to life and one must bring a great deal of sympathy and a great deal of patience to the scrutiny  types are very backward and shrinking things after all character is of such a mimosan sensibility that if you seize it too abruptly its leaves are apt to shut and hide all that is distinctive in it so that it is not without some risk to an authors reputation for honesty that he gives his readers the impression of his truth     ii  the difficulty with characters in fiction is that the reader there finds them dramatized not only their actions but also their emotions are dramatized and the very same sort of persons when one meets them in real life are recreantly undramatic  one might go through a new england village and see mary wilkins houses and mary wilkins people and yet not witness a scene nor hear a word such as one finds in her tales  it is only too probable that the inhabitants one met would say nothing quaint or humorous or betray at all the nature that she reveals in them and yet i should not question her revelation on that account  the life of new england such as miss wilkins deals with and miss sarah o jewett and miss alice brown is not on the surface or not visibly so except to the accustomed eye  it is puritanism scarcely animated at all by the puritanic theology  one must not be very positive in such things and i may be too bold in venturing to say that while the belief of some new englanders approaches this theology the belief of most is now far from it and yet its penetrating individualism so deeply influenced the new england character that puritanism survives in the moral and mental make of the people almost in its early strength  conduct and manner conform to a dead religious ideal the wish to be sincere the wish to be just the wish to be righteous are before the wish to be kind merciful humble  a people are not a chosen people for half a dozen generations without acquiring a spiritual pride that remains with them long after they cease to believe themselves chosen  they are often stiffened in the neck and they are often hardened in the heart by it to the point of making them angular and cold but they are of an inveterate responsibility to a power higher than themselves and they are strengthened for any fate  they are what we see in the stories which perhaps hold the first place in american fiction  as a matter of fact the religion of new england is not now so puritanical as that of many parts of the south and west and yet the inherited puritanism stamps the new england manner and differences it from the manner of the straightest sects elsewhere  there was however always a revolt against puritanism when puritanism was severest and securest this resulted in types of shiftlessness if not wickedness which have not yet been duly studied and which would make the fortune of some novelist who cared to do a fresh thing  there is also a sentimentality or pseudoemotionality i have not the right phrase for it which awaits full recognition in fiction  this efflorescence from the dust of systems and creeds carried into natures left vacant by the ancestral doctrine has scarcely been noticed by the painters of new england manners  it is often a last state of unitarianism which prevailed in the larger towns and cities when the calvinistic theology ceased to be dominant and it is often an effect of the spiritualism so common in new england and in fact everywhere in america  then there is a widespread love of literature in the country towns and villages which has in great measure replaced the old interest in dogma and which forms with us an authors closest appreciation if not his best  but as yet little hint of all this has got into the short stories and still less of that larger intellectual life of new england or that exalted beauty of character which tempts one to say that puritanism was a blessing if it made the newenglanders what they are though one can always be glad not to have lived among them in the disciplinary period boston the capital of that new england nation which is fast losing itself in the american nation is no longer of its old literary primacy and yet most of our right thinking our high thinking still begins there and qualifies the thinking of the country at large  the good causes the generous causes are first befriended there and in a wholesome sort the new england culture as well as the new england conscience has imparted itself to the american people  even the power of writing short stories which we suppose ourselves to have in such excellent degree has spread from new england  that is indeed the home of the american short story and it has there been brought to such perfection in the work of miss wilkins of miss jewett of miss brown and of that most faithful forgotten painter of manners mrs rose terry cook that it presents upon the whole a truthful picture of new england village life in some of its more obvious phases  i say obvious because i must but i have already said that this is a life which is very little obvious and i should not blame any one who brought the portrait to the test of reality and found it exaggerated overdrawn and unnatural though i should be perfectly sure that such a critic was wrong       the what and the how in art  one of the things always enforcing itself upon the consciousness of the artist in any sort is the fact that those whom artists work for rarely care for their work artistically  they care for it morally personally partially  i suspect that criticism itself has rather a muddled preference for the what over the how and that it is always haunted by a philistine question of the material when it should aesthetically speaking be concerned solely with the form     i  the other night at the theatre i was witness of a curious and amusing illustration of my point  they were playing a most soulfilling melodrama of the sort which gives you assurance from the very first that there will be no trouble in the end but everything will come out just as it should no matter what obstacles oppose themselves in the course of the action  an overruling providence long accustomed to the exigencies of the stage could not fail to intervene at the critical moment in behalf of innocence and virtue and the spectator never had the least occasion for anxiety  not unnaturally there was a blackhearted villain in the piece so very blackhearted that he seemed not to have a single good impulse from first to last  yet he was in the keeping of the stage providence as harmless as a blank cartridge in spite of his deadly aims  he accomplished no more mischief in fact than if all his intents had been of the best except for the satisfaction afforded by the edifying spectacle of his defeat and shame he need not have been in the play at all and one might almost have felt sorry for him he was so continually baffled  but this was not enough for the audience or for that part of it which filled the gallery to the roof  perhaps he was such an uncommonly blackhearted villain so very very coldblooded in his wickedness that the justice unsparingly dealt out to him by the dramatist could not suffice  at any rate the gallery took such a vivid interest in his punishment that it had out the actor who impersonated the wretch between all the acts and hissed him throughout his deliberate passage across the stage before the curtain  the hisses were not at all for the actor but altogether for the character  the performance was fairly good quite as good as the performance of any virtuous part in the piece and easily up to the level of other villanous performances i never find much nature in them perhaps because there is not much nature in villany itself that is villany pure and simple but the mere conception of the wickedness this bad man had attempted was too much for an audience of the average popular goodness  it was only after he had taken poison and fallen dead before their eyes that the spectators forbore to visit him with a lively proof of their abhorrence apparently they did not care to give him a realizing sense that there was a punishment after death as the man in lincolns story did with the dead dog     ii  the whole affair was very amusing at first but it has since put me upon thinking i like to be put upon thinking the eighteenthcentury essayists were that the attitude of the audience towards this deplorable reprobate is really the attitude of most readers of books lookers at pictures and statues listeners to music and so on through the whole list of the arts  it is absolutely different from the artists attitude from the connoisseurs attitude it is quite irreconcilable with their attitude and yet i wonder if in the end it is not what the artist works for  art is not produced for artists or even for connoisseurs it is produced for the general who can never view it otherwise than morally personally partially from their associations and preconceptions  whether the effect with the general is what the artist works for or not he does not succeed without it  their brute liking or misliking is the final test it is universal suffrage that elects after all  only in some cases of this sort the polls do not close at four oclock on the first tuesday after the first monday of november but remain open forever and the voting goes on  still even the first days canvass is important or at least significant  it will not do for the artist to electioneer but if he is beaten he ought to ponder the causes of his defeat and question how he has failed to touch the chord of universal interest  he is in the world to make beauty and truth evident to his fellowmen who are as a rule incredibly stupid and ignorant of both but whose judgment he must nevertheless not despise  if he can make something that they will cheer or something that they will hiss he may not have done any great thing but if he has made something that they will neither cheer nor hiss he may well have his misgivings no matter how well how finely how truly he has done the thing  this is very humiliating but a tacit snub to ones artistpride such as one gets from public silence is not a bad thing for one  not long ago i was talking about pictures with a painter a very great painter to my thinking one whose pieces give me the same feeling i have from reading poetry and i was excusing myself to him with respect to art and perhaps putting on a little more modesty than i felt  i said that i could enjoy pictures only on the literary side and could get no answer from my soul to those excellences of handling and execution which seem chiefly to interest painters  he replied that it was a confession of weakness in a painter if he appealed merely or mainly to technical knowledge in the spectator that he narrowed his field and dwarfed his work by it and that if he painted for painters merely or for the connoisseurs of painting he was denying his office which was to say something clear and appreciable to all sorts of men in the terms of art  he even insisted that a picture ought to tell a story  the difficulty in humbling ones self to this view of art is in the ease with which one may please the general by art which is no art  neither the play nor the playing that i saw at the theatre when the actor was hissed for the wickedness of the villain he was personating was at all fine and yet i perceived on reflection that they had achieved a supreme effect  if i may be so confidential i will say that i should be very sorry to have written that piece yet i should be very proud if on the level i chose and with the quality i cared for i could invent a villain that the populace would have out and hiss for his surpassing wickedness  in other words i think it a thousand pities whenever an artist gets so far away from the general so far within himself or a little circle of amateurs that his highest and best work awakens no response in the multitude  i am afraid this is rather the danger of the arts among us and how to escape it is not so very plain  it makes one sick and sorry often to see how cheaply the applause of the common people is won  it is not an infallible test of merit but if it is wanting to any performance we may be pretty sure it is not the greatest performance     iii  the paradox lies in wait here as in most other human affairs to confound us and we try to baffle it in this way and in that  we talk for instance of poetry for poets and we fondly imagine that this is different from talking of cookery for cooks  poetry is not made for poets they have enough poetry of their own but it is made for people who are not poets  if it does not please these it may still be poetry but it is poetry which has failed of its truest office  it is none the less its truest office because some very wretched verse seems often to do it  the logic of such a fact is not that the poet should try to achieve this truest office of his art by means of doggerel but that he should study how and where and why the beauty and the truth he has made manifest are wanting in universal interest in human appeal  leaving the drama out of the question and the theatre which seems now to be seeking only the favor of the dull rich i believe that there never was a time or a race more open to the impressions of beauty and of truth than ours  the artist who feels their divine charm and longs to impart it has now and here a chance to impart it more widely than ever artist had in the world before  of course the means of reaching the widest range of humanity are the simple and the elementary but there is no telling when the complex and the recondite may not universally please  288  the art is to make them plain to every one for every one has them in him  lowell used to say that shakespeare was subtle but in letters a foot high  the painter sculptor or author who pleases the polite only has a success to be proud of as far as it goes and to be ashamed of that it goes no further  he need not shrink from giving pleasure to the vulgar because bad art pleases them  it is part of his reason for being that he should please them too and if he does not it is a proof that he is wanting in force however much he abounds in fineness  who would not wish his picture to draw a crowd about it  who would not wish his novel to sell five hundred thousand copies for reasons besides the sordid love of gain which i am told governs novelists  one should not really wish it any the less because chromos and historical romances are popular  sometime i believe the artist and his public will draw nearer together in a mutual understanding though perhaps not in our present conditions i put that understanding off till the good time when life shall be more than living more even than the question of getting a living but in the mean time i think that the artist might very well study the springs of feeling in others and if i were a dramatist i think i should quite humbly go to that play where they hiss the villain for his villany and inquire how his wickedness had been made so appreciable so vital so personal  not being a dramatist i still cannot indulge the greatest contempt of that play and its public       politics of american authors  no thornier theme could well be suggested than i was once invited to consider by an englishman who wished to know how far american politicians were scholars and how far american authors took part in politics  in my mind i first revolted from the inquiry and then i cast about in the fascination it began to have for me to see how i might handle it and prick myself least  in a sort which it would take too long to set forth politics are very intimate matters with us and if one were to deal quite frankly with the politics of a contemporary author one might accuse ones self of an unwarrantable personality  so in what i shall have to say in answer to the question asked me i shall seek above all things not to be quite frank     i  my uncandor need not be so jealously guarded in speaking of authors no longer living  not to go too far back among these it is perfectly safe to say that when the slavery question began to divide all kinds of men among us lowell longfellow whittier curtis emerson and bryant more or less promptly and openly took sides against slavery  holmes was very much later in doing so but he made up for his long delay by his final strenuousness as for hawthorne he was perhaps too essentially a spectator of life to be classed with either party though his associations if not his sympathies were with the northern men who had southern principles until the civil war came  after the war when our political questions ceased to be moral and emotional and became economic and sociological literary men found their standing with greater difficulty  they remained mostly republicans because the republicans were the antislavery party and were still waging war against slavery in their nerves  i should say that they also continued very largely the emotional tradition in politics and it is doubtful if in the nature of things the politics of literary men can ever be otherwise than emotional  in fact though the questions may no longer be so the politics of vastly the greater number of americans are so  nothing else would account for the fact that during the last ten or fifteen years men have remained republicans and remained democrats upon no tangible issues except of office which could practically concern only a few hundreds or thousands out of every million voters  party fealty is praised as a virtue and disloyalty to party is treated as a species of incivism next in wickedness to treason  if any one were to ask me why then american authors were not active in american politics as they once were i should feel a certain diffidence in replying that the question of other peoples accession to office was however emotional unimportant to them as compared with literary questions  i should have the more diffidence because it might be retorted that literary men were too unpractical for politics when they did not deal with moral issues  such a retort would be rather mild and civil as things go and might even be regarded as complimentary  it is not our custom to be tender with any one who doubts if any actuality is right or might not be bettered especially in public affairs  we are apt to call such a one out of his name and to punish him for opinions he has never held  this may be a better reason than either given why authors do not take part in politics with us  they are a thinskinned race fastidious often and always averse to hard knocks they are rather modest too and distrust their fitness to lead when they have quite a firm faith in their convictions  they hesitate to urge these in the face of practical politicians who have a confidence in their ability to settle all affairs of state not surpassed even by that of business men in dealing with economic questions  i think it is a pity that our authors do not go into politics at least for the sake of the material it would yield them but really they do not our politics are often vulgar but they are very picturesque yet so far our fiction has shunned them even more decidedly than it has shunned our good societywhich is not picturesque or apparently anything but a tiresome adaptation of the sort of drama that goes on abroad under the same name  in nearly the degree that our authors have dealt with our politics as material they have given the practical politicians only too much reason to doubt their insight and their capacity to understand the mere machinery the simplest motives of political life     ii  there are exceptions of course and if my promise of reticence did not withhold me i might name some striking ones  privately and unprofessionally i think our authors take as vivid an interest in public affairs as any other class of our citizens and i should be sorry to think that they took a less intelligent interest  now and then but only very rarely one of them speaks out and usually on the unpopular side in this event he is spared none of the penalties with which we like to visit difference of opinion rather they are accumulated on him  such things are not serious and they are such as no serious man need shrink from but they have a bearing upon what i am trying to explain and in a certain measure they account for a certain attitude in our literary men  no one likes to have stones not to say mud thrown at him though they are not meant to hurt him badly and may be partly thrown in joke  but it is pretty certain that if a man not in politics takes them seriously he will have more or less mud not to say stones thrown at him  he might burlesque or caricature them or misrepresent them with safety but if he spoke of public questions with heart and conscience he could not do it with impunity unless he were authorized to do so by some practical relation to them  i do not mean that then he would escape but in this country where there were once supposed to be no classes people are more strictly classified than in any other business to the business man law to the lawyer medicine to the physician politics to the politician and letters to the literary man that is the rule  one is not expected to transcend his function and commonly one does not  we keep each to his last as if there were not human interests civic interests which had a higher claim than the last upon our thinking and feeling  the tendency has grown upon us severally and collectively through the long persistence of our prosperity if public affairs were going ill private affairs were going so well that we did not mind the others and we americans are i think meridional in our improvidence  we are so essentially of today that we behave as if to morrow no more concerned us than yesterday  we have taught ourselves to believe that it will all come out right in the end so long that we have come to act upon our belief we are optimistic fatalists     iii  the turn which our politics have taken towards economics if i may so phrase the rise of the questions of labor and capital has not largely attracted literary men  it is doubtful whether edward bellamy himself whose fancy of better conditions has become the abiding faith of vast numbers of americans supposed that he was entering the field of practical politics or dreamed of influencing elections by his hopes of economic equality  but he virtually founded the populist party which as the vital principle of the democratic party came so near electing its candidate for the presidency some years ago and he is to be named first among our authors who have dealt with politics on their more human side since the days of the old antislavery agitation  without too great disregard of the reticence concerning the living which i promised myself i may mention dr edward everett hale and colonel thomas wentworth higginson as prominent authors who encouraged the nationalist movement eventuating in populism though they were never populists  it may be interesting to note that dr hale and colonel higginson who later came together in their sociological sympathies were divided by the schism of 1884 when the first remained with the republicans and the last went off to the democrats  more remotely colonel higginson was anti slavery almost to the point of abolitionism and he led a negro regiment in the war  dr hale was of those who were less radically opposed to slavery before the war but hardly so after it came  since the war a sort of refluence of the old antislavery politics carried from his moorings in southern tradition mr george w cable who against the white sentiment of his section sided with the former slaves and would if the indignant renunciation of his fellowsoutherners could avail have consequently ceased to be the first of southern authors though he would still have continued the author of at least one of the greatest american novels  if i must burn my ships behind me in alleging these modern instances as i seem really to be doing i may mention mr r w gilder the poet as an author who has taken part in the politics of municipal reform mr hamlin garland has been known from the first as a zealous george man or singletaxer  mr john hay mr theodore roosevelt and mr henry cabot lodge are republican politicians as well as recognized literary men mr joel chandler harris when not writing uncle remus writes political articles in a leading southern journal  mark twain is a leading anti imperialist     iv  i am not sure whether i have made out a case for our authors or against them perhaps i have not done so badly but i have certainly not tried to be exhaustive the exhaustion is so apt to extend from the subject to the reader and i wish to leave him in a condition to judge for himself whether american literary men take part in american politics or not i think they bear their share in the quieter sort of way which we hope it may be too fondly is the american way  they are none of them politicians in the latin sort  few if any of our statesmen have come forward with small volumes of verse in their hands as they used to do in spain none of our poets or historians have been chosen presidents of the republic as has happened to their french confreres no great novelist of ours has been exiled as victor hugo was or atrociously mishandled as zola has been though i have no doubt that if for instance one had once said the spanish war wrong he would be pretty generally conspue they have none of them reached the heights of political power as several english authors have done but they have often been ambassadors ministers and consuls though they may not often have been appointed for political reasons  i fancy they discharge their duties in voting rather faithfully though they do not often take part in caucuses or conventions  as for the other half of the questionhow far american politicians are scholarsones first impulse would be to say that they never were so but i have always had an heretical belief that there were snakes in ireland and it may be some such disposition to question authority that keeps me from yielding to this impulse  the law of demand and supply alone ought to have settled the question in favor of the presence of the scholar in our politics there has been such a cry for him among us for almost a generation past  perhaps the response has not been very direct but i imagine that our politicians have never been quite so destitute of scholarship as they would sometimes make appear  i do not think so many of them now write a good style or speak a good style as the politicians of forty or fifty or sixty years ago but this may be merely part of the impression of the general worsening of things familiar after middle life to every ones experience from the beginning of recorded time  if something not so literary is meant by scholarship if a study of finance of economics of international affairs is in question it seems to go on rather more to their own satisfaction than that of their critics  but without being always very proud of the result and without professing to know the facts very profoundly one may still suspect that under an outside by no means academic there is a process of thinking in our statesmen which is not so loose not so unscientific and not even so unscholarly as it might be supposed  it is not the effect of specific training and yet it is the effect of training  i do not find that the matters dealt with are anywhere in the world intrusted to experts and in this sense scholarship has not been called to the aid of our legislation or administration but still i should not like to say that none of our politicians were scholars  that would be offensive and it might not be true  in fact i can think of several whom i should be tempted to call scholars if i were not just here recalled to a sense of my purpose not to deal quite frankly with this inquiry       storage  it has been the belief of certain kindly philosophers that if the one half of mankind knew how the other half lived the two halves might be brought together in a family affection not now so observable in human relations  probably if this knowledge were perfect there would still be things to bar the perfect brotherhood and yet the knowledge itself is so interesting if not so salutary as it has been imagined that one can hardly refuse to impart it if one has it and can reasonably hope in the advantage of the ignorant to find ones excuse with the better informed     i  city and country are still so widely apart in every civilization that one can safely count upon a reciprocal strangeness in many everyday things for instance in the country when people break up housekeeping they sell their household goods and gods as they did in cities fifty or a hundred years ago but now in cities they simply store them and vast warehouses in all the principal towns have been devoted to their storage the warehouses are of all types from dusty lofts over stores and ammoniacal lofts over stables to buildings offering acres of space and carefully planned for the purpose  they are more or less fireproof slowburning or briskly combustible like the dwellings they have devastated  but the modern tendency is to a type where flames do not destroy nor moth corrupt nor thieves break through and steal  such a warehouse is a city in itself laid out in streets and avenues with the private tenements on either hand duly numbered and accessible only to the tenants or their order  the aisles are concreted the doors are iron and the roofs are ceiled with iron the whole place is heated by steam and lighted by electricity  behind the iron doors which in the new york warehouses must number hundreds of thousands and throughout all our other cities millions the furniture of a myriad households is storedthe effects of people who have gone to europe or broken up housekeeping provisionally or definitively or have died or been divorced  they are the dead bones of homes or their ghosts or their yet living bodies held in hypnotic trances destined again in some future time to animate some house or flat anew  in certain cases the spell lasts for many years in others for a few and in others yet it prolongs itself indefinitely  i may mention the case of one owner whom i saw visiting the warehouse to take out the household stuff that had lain there a long fifteen years he had been all that while in europe expecting any day to come home and begin life again in his own land  that dream had passed and now he was taking his stuff out of storage and shipping it to italy  i did not envy him his feelings as the parts of his longdead past rose round him in formless resurrection  it was not that they were all broken or defaced on the contrary they were in a state of preservation far more heartbreaking than any decay  in wellmanaged storage warehouses the things are handled with scrupulous care and they are so packed into the appointed rooms that if not disturbed they could suffer little harm in fifteen or fifty years  the places are wonderfully well kept and if you will visit them say in midwinter after the fall influx of furniture has all been hidden away behind the iron doors of the several cells you shall find their farbranching corridors scrupulously swept and dusted and shall walk up and down their concrete length with some such sense of secure finality as you would experience in pacing the aisle of your family vault  that is what it comes to  one may feign that these storage warehouses are cities but they are really cemeteries sad columbaria on whose shelves are stowed exanimate things once so intimately of their owners lives that it is with the sense of looking at pieces and bits of ones dead self that one revisits them  if one takes the fragments out to fit them to new circumstance one finds them not only uncomformable and incapable but so volubly confidential of the associations in which they are steeped that one wishes to hurry them back to their cell and lock it upon them forever  one feels then that the old way was far better and that if the things had been auctioned off and scattered up and down as chance willed to serve new uses with people who wanted them enough to pay for them even a tithe of their cost it would have been wiser failing this a fire seems the only thing for them and their removal to the cheaper custody of a combustible or slowburning warehouse the best recourse  desperate people aging husbands and wives who have attempted the reconstruction of their homes with these            portions and parcels of the dreadful past  have been known to wish for an earthquake even that would involve their belongings in an indiscriminate ruin     ii  in fact each new start in life should be made with material new to you if comfort is to attend the enterprise  it is not only sorrowful but it is futile to store your possessions if you hope to find the old happiness in taking them out and using them again  it is not that they will not go into place after a fashion and perform their old office but that the pang they will inflict through the suggestion of the other places where they served their purpose in other years will be only the keener for the perfection with which they do it now  if they cannot be sold and if no fire comes down from heaven to consume them then they had better be stored with no thought of ever taking them out again  that will be expensive or it will be inexpensive according to the sort of storage they are put into  the inexperienced in such matters may be surprised and if they have hearts they may be grieved to learn that the fireproof storage of the furniture of the average house would equal the rent of a very comfortable domicile in a small town or a farm by which a familys living can be earned with a decent dwelling in which it can be sheltered  yet the space required is not very great three fairsized rooms will hold everything and there is sometimes a fierce satisfaction in seeing how closely the things that once stood largely about and seemed to fill ample parlors and chambers can be packed away  to be sure they are not in their familiar attitudes they lie on their sides or backs or stand upon their heads between the legs of library or dining tables are stuffed all kinds of minor movables with cushions pillows pictures cunningly adjusted to the environment and mattresses pad the walls or interpose their soft bulk between pieces of furniture that would otherwise rend each other  carpets sewn in cotton against moths and rugs in long rolls the piano hovering under its ample frame a whole brood of helpless little guitars mandolins and banjos and supporting on its broad back a bulk of lighter cases to the fireproof ceiling of the cell paintings in boxes indistinguishable outwardly from their companioning mirrors barrels of china and kitchen utensils and all the whatnot of householding and housekeeping contribute to the repletion  there is a science observed in the arrangement of the various effects against the rear wall and packed along the floor and then in front of and on top of these is built a superstructure of the things that may be first wanted in case of removal or oftenest wanted in some exigency of the homeless life of the owners pending removal  the lightest and slightest articles float loosely about the door or are interwoven in a kind of fabric just within and curtaining the ponderous mass behind the effect is not so artistic as the mortuary mosaics which the roman capuchins design with the bones of their dead brethren in the crypt of their church but the warehousemen no doubt have their just pride in it and feel an artistic pang in its provisional or final disturbance  it had better never be disturbed for it is disturbed only in some futile dream of returning to the past and we never can return to the past on the old terms  it is well in all things to accept life implicitly and when an end has come to treat it as the end and not vainly mock it as a suspense of function  when the poor break up their homes with no immediate hope of founding others they must sell their belongings because they cannot afford to pay storage on them  the rich or richer store their household effects and cheat themselves with the illusion that they are going some time to rehabilitate with them just such a home as they have dismantled  but the illusion probably deceives nobody so little as those who cherish the vain hope  as long as they cherish it howeverand they must cherish it till their furniture or themselves fall to dustthey cannot begin life anew as the poor do who have kept nothing of the sort to link them to the past  this is one of the disabilities of the prosperous who will probably not be relieved of it till some means of storing the owner as well as the furniture is invented  in the immense range of modern ingenuity this is perhaps not impossible  why not while we are still in life some sweet oblivious antidote which shall drug us against memory and after time shall elapse for the reconstruction of a new home in place of the old shall repossess us of ourselves as unchanged as the things with which we shall again array it  here is a pretty idea for some dreamer to spin into the filmy fabric of a romance and i handsomely make a present of it to the first comer  if the dreamer is of the right quality he will know how to make the reader feel that with the universal longing to return to former conditions or circumstances it must always be a mistake to do so and he will subtly insinuate the disappointment and discomfort of the stored personality in resuming its old relations  with that just mixture of the comic and pathetic which we desire in romance he will teach convincingly that a stored personality is to be desired only if it is permanently stored with the implication of a like finality in the storage of its belongings  save in some signal exception a thing taken out of storage cannot be established in its former function without a sense of its comparative inadequacy  it stands in the old place it serves the old use and yet a new thing would be better it would even in some subtle wise be more appropriate if i may indulge so audacious a paradox for the time is new and so will be all the subconscious keeping in which our lives are mainly passed  we are supposed to have associations with the old things which render them precious but do not the associations rather render them painful  if that is true of the inanimate things how much truer it is of those personalities which once environed and furnished our lives take the article of old friends for instance has it ever happened to the reader to witness the encounter of old friends after the lapse of years  such a meeting is conventionally imagined to be full of tender joy a rapture that vents itself in manly tears perhaps and certainly in womanly tears  but really is it any such emotion  honestly is not it a cruel embarrassment which all the hypocritical pretences cannot hide the old friends smile and laugh and babble incoherently at one another but are they genuinely glad  is not each wishing the other at that end of the earth from which he came  have they any use for each other such as people of unbroken associations have  i have lately been privy to the reunion of two old comrades who are bound together more closely than most men in a community of interests occupations and ideals  during a long separation they had kept account of each others opinions as well as experiences they had exchanged letters from time to time in which they opened their minds fully to each other and found themselves constantly in accord  when they met they made a great shouting and each pretended that he found the other just what he used to be  they talked a long long time fighting the invisible enemy which they felt between them  the enemy was habit the habit of other minds and hearts the daily use of persons and things which in their separation they had not had in common  when the old friends parted they promised to meet every day and now since their lines had been cast in the same places again to repair the ravage of the envious years and become again to each other all that they had ever been  but though they live in the same town and often dine at the same table and belong to the same club yet they have not grown together again  they have grown more and more apart and are uneasy in each others presence tacitly selfreproachful for the same effect which neither of them could avert or repair  they had been respectively in storage and each in taking the other out has experienced in him the unfitness which grows upon the things put away for a time and reinstated in a former function     iii  i have not touched upon these facts of life without the purpose of finding some way out of the coil  there seems none better than the counsel of keeping ones face set well forward and ones eyes fixed steadfastly upon the future  this is the hint we will get from nature if we will heed her and note how she never recurs never stores or takes out of storage  fancy rehabilitating ones first love how nature would mock at that  we cannot go back and be the men and women we were any more than we can go back and be children  as we grow older each years change in us is more chasmal and complete  there is no elixir whose magic will recover us to ourselves as we were last year but perhaps we shall return to ourselves more and more in the times or the eternity to come  some instinct or inspiration implies the promise of this but only on condition that we shall not cling to the life that has been ours and hoard its mummified image in our hearts  we must not seek to store ourselves but must part with what we were for the use and behoof of others as the poor part with their worldly gear when they move from one place to another  it is a curious and significant property of our outworn characteristics that like our old furniture they will serve admirably in the life of some other and that this other can profitably make them his when we can no longer keep them ours or ever hope to resume them  they not only go down to successive generations but they spread beyond our lineages and serve the turn of those whom we never knew to be within the circle of our influence  civilization imparts itself by some such means and the lower classes are clothed in the cast conduct of the upper which if it had been stored would have left the inferiors rude and barbarous  we have only to think how socially naked most of us would be if we had not had the beautiful manners of our exclusive society to put on at each change of fashion when it dropped them  all earthly and material things should be worn out with use and not preserved against decay by any unnatural artifice  even when broken and disabled from overuse they have a kind of respectability which must commend itself to the observer and which partakes of the pensive grace of ruin  an old table with one leg gone and slowly lapsing to decay in the woodshed is the emblem of a fitter order than the same table with all its legs intact stored with the rest of the furniture from a broken home  spinningwheels gathering dust in the garret of a house that is itself falling to pieces have a dignity that deserts them when they are dragged from their refuge and furbished up with ribbons and a tuft of fresh tow and made to serve the hollow occasions of bricabrac as they were a few years ago  a pitcher broken at the fountain or a battered kettle on a rubbish heap is a venerable object but not crockery and copperware stored in the possibility of future need  however carefully handed down from one generation to another the old objects have a forlorn incongruity in their successive surroundings which appeals to the compassion rather than the veneration of the witness  it was from a truth deeply mystical that hawthorne declared against any sort of permanence in the dwellings of men and held that each generation should newly house itself  he preferred the perishability of the wooden american house to the durability of the piles of brick or stone which in europe affected him as with some moral miasm from the succession of sires and sons and grandsons that had died out of them  but even of such structures as these it is impressive how little the earth makes with the passage of time  where once a great city of them stood you shall find a few tottering walls scarcely more mindful of the past than the cellar and the well which holmes marked as the ultimate monuments the last witnesses to the existence of our more transitory habitations  it is the law of the patient sun that everything under it shall decay and if by reason of some swift calamity some fiery cataclysm the perishable shall be overtaken by a fate that fixes it in unwasting arrest it cannot be felt that the law has been set aside in the interest of mens happiness or cheerfulness  neither pompeii nor herculaneum invites the gayety of the spectator who as he walks their disinterred thoroughfares has the weird sense of taking a former civilization out of storage and the ache of finding it wholly unadapted to the actual world  as far as his comfort is concerned it had been far better that those cities had not been stored but had fallen to the ruin that has overtaken all their contemporaries     iv  no good friend sir or madam as the case may be but most likely madam if you are about to break up your household for any indefinite period and are not so poor that you need sell your things be warned against putting them in storage unless of the most briskly combustible type better far better give them away and disperse them by that means to a continuous use that shall end in using them up or if no one will take them then hire a vacant lot somewhere and devote them to the flames by that means you shall bear witness against a custom that insults the order of nature and crowds the cities with the cemeteries of dead homes where there is scarcely space for the living homes  do not vainly fancy that you shall take your stuff out of storage and find it adapted to the ends that it served before it was put in  you will not be the same or have the same needs or desire when you take it out and the new place which you shall hope to equip with it will receive it with cold reluctance or openly refuse it insisting upon forms and dimensions that render it ridiculous or impossible  the law is that nothing taken out of storage is the same as it was when put in and this law hieroglyphed in those rude graffiti apparently inscribed by accident in the process of removal has only such exceptions as prove the rule  the world to which it has returned is not the same and that makes all the difference  yet truth and beauty do not change however the moods and fashions change  the ideals remain and these alone you can go back to secure of finding them the same today and tomorrow that they were yesterday  this perhaps is because they have never been in storage but in constant use while the moods and fashions have been put away and taken out a thousand times  most people have never had ideals but only moods and fashions but such people least of all are fitted to find in them that pleasure of the rococo which consoles the idealist when the old moods and fashions reappear       floating down the river on the ohio  there was not much promise of pleasure in the sodden afternoon of a mid march day at pittsburg where the smoke of a thousand foundry chimneys gave up trying to rise through the thick soft air and fell with the constant rain which it dyed its own black  but early memories stirred joyfully in the two travellers in whose consciousness i was making my tour at sight of the familiar sternwheel steamboat lying beside the wharf boat at the foot of the dilapidated levee and doing its best to represent the hundreds of steamboats that used to lie there in the old days  it had the help of three others in its generous effort and the levee itself made a gallant pretence of being crowded with freight and succeeded in displaying several saturated piles of barrels and agricultural implements on the irregular pavement whose wheelworn stones in long stretches were sunken out of sight in their parent mud the boats and the levee were jointly quite equal to the demand made upon them by the lighthearted youngsters of sixtyfive and seventy who were setting out on their journey in fulfilment of a longcherished dream and for whom much less freight and much fewer boats would have rehabilitated the past     i  when they mounted the broad stairway tidily strewn with straw to save it from the mud of careless boots and entered the long saloon of the steamboat the promise of their fancy was more than made good for them from the clerks office where they eagerly paid their fare the saloon stretched two hundred feet by thirty away to the stern a cavernous splendor of white paint and gilding starred with electric bulbs and fenced at the stern with wide windows of painted glass  midway between the great stove in the bow where the men were herded and the great stove at the stern where the women kept themselves in the seclusion which the tradition of western river travel still guards after wellnigh a hundred years they were given ample staterooms whose appointments so exactly duplicated those they remembered from faroff days that they could have believed themselves awakened from a dream of insubstantial time with the events in which it had seemed to lapse mere feints of experience  when they sat down at the suppertable and were served with the sort of belated steamboat dinner which it recalled as vividly the kind sooty faces and snowy aprons of those who served them were so quite those of other days that they decided all repasts since were mere barmecide feasts and made up for the long fraud practised upon them with the appetites of the year 1850     ii  a rigider sincerity than shall be practised here might own that the table of the good steamboat avonek left something to be desired if tested by more sophisticated cuisines but in the article of cornbread it was of an inapproachable preeminence  this bread was made of the white corn which north knows not nor the hapless east and the buckwheat cakes at breakfast were without blame and there was a simple variety in the abundance which ought to have satisfied if it did not flatter the choice the only thing that seemed strangely that seemed sadly anomalous in a land flowing with ham and bacon was that the avonek had not imagined providing either for the guests no one of whom could have had a religious scruple against them  the thing indeed which was first and last conspicuous in the passengers was their perfectly american race and character  at the start when with an acceptable observance of western steamboat tradition the avonek left her wharf eight hours behind her appointed time there were very few passengers but they began to come aboard at the little towns of both shores as she swam southward and westward till all the tables were so full that in observance of another western steamboat tradition one did well to stand guard over his chair lest some other who liked it should seize it earlier  the passengers were of every age and condition except perhaps the highest condition and they seemed none the worse for being more like americans of the middle of the last century than of the beginning of this  their fashions were of an approximation to those of the present but did not scrupulously study detail their manners were those of simpler if not sincerer days  the women kept to themselves at their end of the saloon aloof from the study of any but their husbands or kindred but the men were everywhere else about and open to observation  they were not so open to conversation for your midwesterner is not a facile though not an unwilling talker  they sat by their tall castiron stove of the oval pattern unvaried since the earliest stove of the region and silently ruminated their tobacco and spat into the clustering cuspidors at their feet  they would always answer civilly if questioned and oftenest intelligently but they asked nothing in return and they seemed to have none of that curiosity once known or imagined in them by dickens and other averse aliens  they had mostly faces of resolute power and such a looking of knowing exactly what they wanted as would not have promised well for any collectively or individually opposing them  if ever the sense of human equality has expressed itself in the human countenance it speaks unmistakably from american faces like theirs  they were neither handsome nor unhandsome but for a few striking exceptions they had been impartially treated by nature and where they were notably plain their look of force made up for their lack of beauty they were notably handsomest in a tall young fellow of a lean face absolute greek in profile amply thwarted with a branching mustache and slender of figure on whom his clothes lustrous from much sitting down and leaning up grew like the bark on a tree and who moved slowly and gently about and spoke with a low kind voice  in his young comeliness he was like a god as the gods were fancied in the elder world a chewing and a spitting god indeed but divine in his passionless calm  he was a serious divinity and so were all the midwestern humanbeings about him  one heard no joking either of the dapper or cockney sort of cities or the quaint graphic phrasing of eastern country folk and it may have been not far enough west for the true western humor  at any rate when they were not silent these men still were serious  the women were apparently serious too and where they were associated with the men were if they were not really subject strictly abeyant in the spectators eye  the average of them was certainly not above the american womans average in good looks though one young mother of six children well grown save for the baby in her arms was of the type some masters loved to paint with eyes set wide under low arched brows  she had the placid dignity and the air of motherly goodness which goes fitly with such beauty and the sight of her was such as to disperse many of the misgivings that beset the beholder who looketh upon the woman when she is new  as she seemed so any man might wish to remember his mother seeming  all these river folk who came from the farms and villages along the stream and never from the great towns or cities were well mannered if quiet manners are good and though the men nearly all chewed tobacco and spat between meals at the table they were of an exemplary behavior  the use of the fork appeared strange to them and they handled it strenuously rather than agilely yet they never used their knives shovelwise however they planted their forks like daggers in the steak the steak deserved no gentler usage indeed  they were usually young and they were constantly changing bent upon short journeys between the shore villages they were mostly farm youth apparently though some were said to be going to find work at the great potteries up the river for wages fabulous to homekeeping experience  one personality which greatly took the liking of one of our tourists was a kentucky mountaineer who after three years exile in a west virginia oil town was gladly returning to the home for which he and all his broodof large and little comely redhaired boys and girlshad never ceased to pine  his eagerness to get back was more than touching it was awing for it was founded on a sort of mediaeval patriotism that could own no excellence beyond the borders of the natal region  he had prospered at high wages in his trade at that oil town and his wife and children had managed a hired farm so well as to pay all the family expenses from it but he was gladly leaving opportunity behind that he might return to a land where if you were passing a house at mealtime they came out and made you come in and eat  when you eat where ive been living you pay fifty cents he explained  and are you taking all your household stuff with you  only the cookstove  well ill tell you we made the other things ourselves made them out of plank and they were not worthmoving  here was the backwoods surviving into the day of trusts and yet we talk of a world drifted hopelessly far from the old ideals     iii  the new ideals the ideals of a pitiless industrialism were sufficiently expressed along the busy shores where the innumerable derricks of oil wells silhouetted their gibbet shapes against the horizon and the myriad chimneys of the foundries sent up the smoke of their torment into the quiet skies and flamed upon the forehead of the evening like baleful suns  but why should i be so violent of phrase against these guiltless means of millionairing  there must be iron and coal as well as wheat and corn in the world and without their combination we cannot have bread if the combination is in the form of a trust such as has laid its giant clutch upon all those warring industries beside the ohio and swept them into one great monopoly why it has still to show that it is worse than competition that it is not indeed merely the first blind stirrings of the universal cooperation of which the dreamers of ideal commonwealths have always had the vision  the derricks and the chimneys when one saw them seem to have all the land to themselves but this was an appearance only terrifying in its strenuousness but not after all the prevalent aspect  that was rather of farm farms and evermore farms lying along the rich levels of the stream and climbing as far up its beautiful hills as the plough could drive  in the spring and in the mall when it is suddenly swollen by the earlier and the later rains the river scales its banks and swims over those levels to the feet of those hills and when it recedes it leaves the cornfields enriched for the crop that has never failed since the forests were first cut from the land  other fertilizing the fields have never had any but they teem as if the guano islands had been emptied into their laps  they feel themselves so rich that they part with great lengths and breadths of their soil to the river which is not good for the river and is not well for the fields so that the farmers whose ease learns slowly are beginning more and more to fence their borders with the young willows which form a hedge in the shallow wash such a great part of the way up and down the ohio  elms and maples wade in among the willows and in time the river will be denied the indigestion which it confesses in shoals and bars at low water and in a difficulty of channel at all stages  meanwhile the fields flourish in spite of their unwise largesse to the stream whose shores the comfortable farmsteads keep so constantly that they are never out of sight  most commonly they are of brick but sometimes of painted wood and they are set on little eminences high enough to save them from the freshets but always so near the river that they cannot fail of its passing life  usually a group of planted evergreens half hides the house from the boat but its inmates will not lose any detail of the show and come down to the gate of the paling fence to watch the avonek float by motionless men and women who lean upon the supporting barrier and rapt children who hold by their skirts and hands  there is not the eager new england neatness about these homes now and then they have rather a sloven air which does not discord with their air of comfort and very very rarely they stagger drunkenly in a ruinous neglect  except where a log cabin has hardily survived the pioneer period the houses are nearly all of one pattern their facades front the river and low chimneys point either gable where a halfstory forms the attic of the two stories below  gardens of potherbs flank them and behind cluster the corncribs and the barns and stables stretch into the fields that stretch out to the hills now scantily wooded but ever lovely in the lines that change with the steamers course  except in the immediate suburbs of the large towns there is no ambition beyond that of rustic comfort in the buildings on the shore  there is no such thing apparently as a summer cottage with its mock humility of name up or down the whole tortuous length of the ohio  as yet the land is not openly depraved by shows of wealth those who amass it either keep it to themselves or come away to spend it in european travel or pause to waste it unrecognized on the ungrateful atlantic seaboard  the only distinctions that are marked are between the homes of honest industry above the banks and the homes below them of the leisure which it is hoped is not dishonest  but honest or dishonest it is there apparently to stay in the houseboats which line the shores by thousands and repeat on occidental terms in our new land the riverlife of old and far cathay  they formed the only feature of their travel which our tourists found absolutely novel they could clearly or dimly recall from the past every other feature but the houseboats which they instantly and gladly naturalized to their memories of it  the houses had in common the form of a freightcar set in a flatbottomed boat the car would be shorter or longer with one or two or three windows in its sides and a section of stovepipe softly smoking from its roof  the windows might be curtained or they might be bare but apparently there was no other distinction among the houseboat dwellers whose sluggish craft lay moored among the willows or tied to an elm or a maple or even made fast to a stake on shore  there were cases in which they had not followed the fall of the river promptly enough and lay slanted on the beach or propped up to a more habitable level on its slope in a sole sad instance the house had gone down with the boat and lay wallowing in the wash of the flood  but they all gave evidence of a tranquil and unhurried life which the soul of the beholder envied within him whether it manifested itself in the lord of the houseboat fishing from its bow or the lady coming to cleanse some household utensil at its stern  infrequently a group of the house boat dwellers seemed to be drawing a net and in one high event they exhibited a goodsized fish of their capture but nothing so strenuous characterized their attitude on any other occasion  the accepted theory of them was that they did by day as nearly nothing as men could do and live and that by night their forays on the bordering farms supplied the simple needs of people who desired neither to toil nor to spin but only to emulate solomon in his glory with the least possible exertion  the joyful witness of their ease would willingly have sacrificed to them any amount of the facile industrial or agricultural prosperity about them and left them slumberously afloat unmolested by dreams of landlord or tax gatherer  their existence for the fleeting time seemed the true interpretation of the sages philosophy the fulfilment of the poets aspiration       why should we only toil that are the roof and crown of things  how did they pass their illimitable leisure when they rested from the fishingnet by day and the chickencoop by night  did they read the new historical fictions aloud to one another  did some of them even meditate the thankless muse and not mind her ingratitude  perhaps the ladies of the houseboats when they found themselvesas they often didin companies of four or five had each other in to evenings at which one of them read a paper on some artistic or literary topic     iv  the traders boat of an elder and more authentic tradition sometimes shouldered the houseboats away from a village landing but it too was a peaceful home where the family life visibly went handinhand with commerce  when the trader has supplied all the wants and wishes of a neighborhood he unmoors his craft and drops down the rivers tide to where it meets the oceans tide in the farthermost mississippi and there either sells out both his boat and his stock or hitches his home to some returning steamboat and climbs slowly with many pauses back to the upper ohio  but his home is not so interesting as that of the houseboatman nor so picturesque as that of the raftsman whose floor of logs rocks flexibly under his shanty but securely rides the current  as the pilots said a steamboat never tries to hurt a raft of logs which is adapted to dangerous retaliation and by night it always gives a wide berth to the lantern tilting above the raft from a swaying pole  by day the raft forms one of the pleasantest aspects of the riverlife with its convoy of skiffs always searching the stream or shore for logs which have broken from it and which the skiffmen recognize by distinctive brands or stamps  here and there the logs lie in long ranks upon the shelving beaches mixed with the drift of trees and fencerails and frames of corncribs and hencoops and even house walls which the freshets have brought down and left stranded  the tops of the little willows are tufted gayly with hay and rags and other spoil of the flood and in one place a disordered mattress was lodged high among the boughs of a water maple where it would form building material for countless generations of birds  the fat cornfields were often littered with a varied wreckage which the farmers must soon heap together and burn to be rid of it and everywhere were proofs of the rivers power to devastate as well as enrich its shores  the dwellers there had no power against it in its moments of insensate rage and the land no protection from its encroachments except in the simple device of the willow hedges which if planted sometimes refused to grow but often came of themselves and kept the torrent from the loose unfathomable soil of the banks otherwise crumbling helplessly into it  the rafts were very well and the houseboats and the traders boats but the most majestic feature of the riverlife was the tow of coalbarges which going or coming the avonek met every few miles  whether going or coming they were pushed not pulled by the powerful steamer which gathered them in tens and twenties before her and rode the midcurrent with them when they were full or kept the slower water near shore when they were empty  they claimed the river where they passed and the avonek bowed to an unwritten law in giving them the full right of way from the time when their low bulk first rose in sight with the chimneys of their steamer towering above them and her gay contours gradually making themselves seen till she receded from the encounter with the wheel at her stern pouring a cataract of yellow water from its blades it was insurpassably picturesque always and not the tapering masts or the swelling sails of any seagoing craft could match it     v  so at least the travellers thought who were here revisiting the earliest scenes of childhood and who perhaps found them unduly endeared  they perused them mostly from an easy seat at the bow of the hurricanedeck and whenever the weather favored them spent the idle time in selecting shelters for their declining years among the farmsteads that offered themselves to their choice up and down the shores  the weather commonly favored them and there was at least one whole day on the lower river when the weather was divinely flattering  the soft dull air lulled their nerves while it buffeted their faces and the sun that looked through veils of mist and smoke gently warmed their aging frames and found itself again in their hearts  perhaps it was there that the water elms and watermaples chiefly budded and the redbirds sang and the drifting flocks of blackbirds called and clattered but surely these also spread their gray and pink against the sky and filled it with their voices  there were meadowlarks and robins without as well as within and it was no subjective plough that turned the earliest furrows in those opulent fields  when they were tired of sitting there they climbed invited or uninvited but always welcomed to the pilothouse where either pilot of the two who were always on watch poured out in an unstinted stream the lore of the river on which all their days had been passed  they knew from indelible association every everchanging line of the constant hills every dwelling by the low banks every aspect of the smoky towns every caprice of the river everytree every stump probably every bud and bird in the sky  they talked only of the river they cared for nothing else  the cuban cumber and the philippine folly were equally far from them the german prince was not only as if he had never been here but as if he never had been no public question concerned them but that of abandoning the canals which the ohio legislature was then foolishly debating  were not the canals waterways too like the river and if the state unnaturally abandoned them would not it be for the behoof of those railroads which the rivermen had always fought and which would have made a solitude of the river if they could  but they could not and there was nothing more surprising and delightful in this blissful voyage than the evident fact that the old river traffic had strongly survived and seemed to be more strongly reviving  perhaps it was not perhaps the fondness of those ohioriverborn passengers was abused by an illusion as subjective as that of the buds and birds of a vivid variety of business and pleasure on the beloved stream  but again perhaps not  they were seldom out of sight of the substantial proofs of both in the through or way packets they encountered or the nondescript steam craft that swarmed about the mouths of the contributory rivers and climbed their shallowing courses into the recesses of their remotest hills to the last lurkingplaces of their oil and coal     vi  the avonek was always stopping to put off or take on merchandise or men she would stop for a single passenger plaited in the mud with his telescope valise or gripsack under the edge of a lonely cornfield or to gather upon her decks the few or many casks or bales that a farmer wished to ship  she lay long hours by the wharfboats of busy towns exchanging one cargo for another in that anarchic fetching and carrying which we call commerce and which we drolly suppose to be governed by laws  but wherever she paused or parted she tested the pilots marvellous skill for no landing no matter how often she landed in the same place could be twice the same  at each return the varying stream and shore must be studied and every caprice of either divined  it was always a triumph a miracle whether by day or by night a constant wonder how under the pilots inspired touch she glided softly to her moorings and without a jar slipped from them again and went on her course  but the landings by night were of course the finest  then the wide fan of the searchlight was unfurled upon the point to be attained and the heavy staging lowered from the bow to the brink perhaps crushing the willow hedges in its fall and scarcely touching the land before a black ragged deckhand had run out through the splendor and made a line fast to the trunk of the nearest tree  then the work of lading or unlading rapidly began in the witching play of the light that set into radiant relief the black eager faces and the black eager figures of the deckhands struggling up or down the staging under boxes of heavy wares or kegs of nails or bales of straw or blocks of stone steadily mocked or cursed at in their shapeless effort till the last of them reeled back to the deck down the steep of the lifting stage and dropped to his broken sleep wherever he could coil himself doglike down among the heaps of freight  no dog indeed leads such a hapless life as theirs and ah and ah why should their sable shadows intrude in a picture that was meant to be all so gay and glad  but ah and ah where in what business of this hard world is not prosperity built upon the struggle of toiling men who still endeavor their poor best and writhe and writhe under the burden of their brothers above till they lie still under the lighter load of their mother earth     etext

the papers collected here under the name of my literary passions were printed serially in a periodical of such vast circulation that they might well have been supposed to have found there all the acceptance that could be reasonably hoped for them  nevertheless they were reissued in a volume the year after they first appeared in 1895 and they had a pleasing share of such favor as their authors books have enjoyed  but it is to be doubted whether any one liked reading them so much as he liked writing themsay some time in the years 1893 and 1894 in a new york flat where he could look from his lofty windows over two miles and a half of woodland in central park and halloo his fancy wherever he chose in that faery realm of books which he reentered in reminiscences perhaps too fond at times and perhaps always too eager for the readers following  the name was thought by the friendly editor of the popular publication where they were serialized a main part of such inspiration as they might be conjectured to have and was as seldom happens with editor and author cordially agreed upon before they were begun  the name says indeed so exactly and so fully what they are that little remains for their bibliographer to add beyond the meagre historical detail here given  their short and simple annals could be eked out by confidences which would not appreciably enrich the materials of the literary history of their time and it seems better to leave them to the imagination of such posterity as they may reach  they are rather helplessly frank but not i hope with all their rather helpless frankness offensively frank  they are at least not part of the polemic which their author sustained in the essays following them in this volume and which might have been called in conformity with my literary passions by the title of my literary opinions better than by the vague name which they actually wear  they deal to be sure with the office of criticism and the art of fiction and so far their present name is not a misnomer  it follows them from an earlier date and could not easily be changed and it may serve to recall to an elder generation than this the time when their author was breaking so many lances in the great forgotten war between realism and romanticism that the floor of the editors study in harpers magazine was strewn with the embattled splinters  the editors study is now quite another place but he who originally imagined it in 1886 and abode in it until 1892 made it at once the scene of such constant offence that he had no time if he had the temper for defence the great zola or call him the immense zola was the prime mover in the attack upon the masters of the romanticistic school but he lived to own that he had fought a losing fight and there are some proofs that he was right  the realists who were undoubtedly the masters of fiction in their passing generation and who prevailed not only in france but in russia in scandinavia in spain in portugal were overborne in all anglosaxon countries by the innumerable hosts of romanticism who to this day possess the land though still whenever a young novelist does work instantly recognizable for its truth and beauty among us he is seen and felt to have wrought in the spirit of realism  not even yet however does the average critic recognize this and such lesson as the editors study assumed to teach remains here in all its essentials for his improvement  month after month for the six years in which the editors study continued in the keeping of its first occupant its lesson was more or less stormily delivered to the exclusion for the greater part of other prophecy but it has not been found well to keep the tempestuous manner along with the fulminant matter in this volume  when the author came to revise the material he found sins against taste which his zeal for righteousness could not suffice to atone for  he did not hesitate to omit the proofs of these and so far to make himself not only a precept but an example in criticism  he hopes that in other and slighter things he has bettered his own instruction and that in form and in fact the book is altogether less crude and less rude than the papers from which it has here been a second time evolved  the papers as they appeared from month to month were not the product of those unities of time and place which were the happy conditioning of my literary passions  they could not have been written in quite so many places as times but they enjoyed a comparable variety of origin beginning in boston they were continued in a boston suburb on the shores of lake george in a western new york health resort in buffalo in nahant once twice and thrice in new york with reversions to boston and summer excursions to the hills and waters of new england until it seemed that their author had at last said his say and he voluntarily lapsed into silence with the applause of friends and enemies alike  the papers had made him more of the last than of the first but not as still appears to him with greater reason  at moments his deliverances seemed to stir people of different minds to fury in two continents so far as they were englishspeaking and on the coasts of the seven seas and some of these came back at him with such violent personalities as it is his satisfaction to remember that he never indulged in his attacks upon their theories of criticism and fiction  his opinions were always impersonal and now as their manner rather than their make has been slightly tempered it may surprise the belated reader to learn that it was the belief of one english critic that their author had placed himself beyond the pale of decency by them  it ought to be less surprising that since these dreadful words were written of him more than one magnanimous englishman has penitently expressed to the author the feeling that he was not so far wrong in his overboldly hazarded convictions  the penitence of his countrymen is still waiting expression but it may come to that when they have recurred to the evidences of his offence in their present shape  kittery point maine july 1909                                  my literary passions    i  the bookcase at home  to give an account of ones reading is in some sort to give an account of ones life and i hope that i shall not offend those who follow me in these papers if i cannot help speaking of myself in speaking of the authors i must call my masters my masters not because they taught me this or that directly but because i had such delight in them that i could not fail to teach myself from them whatever i was capable of learning  i do not know whether i have been what people call a great reader i cannot claim even to have been a very wise reader but i have always been conscious of a high purpose to read much more and more discreetly than i have ever really done and probably it is from the vantageground of this good intention that i shall sometimes be found writing here rather than from the facts of the case  but i am pretty sure that i began right and that if i had always kept the lofty level which i struck at the outset i should have the right to use authority in these reminiscences without a bad conscience  i shall try not to use authority however and i do not expect to speak here of all my reading whether it has been much or little but only of those books or of those authors that i have felt a genuine passion for  i have known such passions at every period of my life but it is mainly of the loves of my youth that i shall write and i shall write all the more frankly because my own youth now seems to me rather more alien than that of any other person  i think that i came of a reading race which has always loved literature in a way and in spite of varying fortunes and many changes  from a letter of my greatgrandmothers written to a stubborn daughter upon some unfilial behavior like running away to be married i suspect that she was fond of the highcolored fiction of her day for she tells the wilful child that she has planted a dagger in her mothers heart and i should not be surprised if it were from this finelanguaged lady that my grandfather derived his taste for poetry rather than from his father who was of a worldly wiser mind  to be sure he became a friend by convincement as the quakers say and so i cannot imagine that he was altogether worldly but he had an eye to the main chance he founded the industry of making flannels in the little welsh town where he lived and he seems to have grown richer for his day and place than any of us have since grown for ours  my grandfather indeed was concerned chiefly in getting away from the world and its wickedness  he came to this country early in the nineteenth century and settled his family in a logcabin in the ohio woods that they might be safe from the sinister influences of the village where he was managing some woollenmills  but he kept his affection for certain poets of the graver not to say gloomier sort and he must have suffered his children to read them pending that great question of their souls salvation which was a lifelong trouble to him  my father at any rate had such a decided bent in the direction of literature that he was not content in any of his several economical experiments till he became the editor of a newspaper which was then the sole means of satisfying a literary passion  his paper at the date when i began to know him was a living comfortable and decent but without the least promise of wealth in it or the hope even of a much better condition  i think now that he was wise not to care for the advancement which most of us have our hearts set upon and that it was one of his finest qualities that he was content with a lot in life where he was not exempt from work with his hands and yet where he was not so pressed by need but he could give himself at will not only to the things of the spirit but the things of the mind too  after a season of scepticism he had become a religious man like the rest of his race but in his own fashion which was not at all the fashion of my grandfather a friend who had married out of meeting and had ended a perfervid methodist  my father who could never get himself converted at any of the campmeetings where my grandfather often led the forces of prayer to his support and had at last to be given up in despair fell in with the writings of emanuel swedenborg and embraced the doctrine of that philosopher with a content that has lasted him all the days of his many years  ever since i can remember the works of swedenborg formed a large part of his library he read them much himself and much to my mother and occasionally a memorable relation from them to us children  but he did not force them upon our notice nor urge us to read them and i think this was very well  i suppose his conscience and his reason kept him from doing so but in regard to other books his fondness was too much for him and when i began to show a liking for literature he was eager to guide my choice  his own choice was for poetry and the most of our library which was not given to theology was given to poetry  i call it the library now but then we called it the bookcase and that was what literally it was because i believe that whatever we had called our modest collection of books it was a larger private collection than any other in the town where we lived  still it was all held and shut with glass doors in a case of very few shelves  it was not considerably enlarged during my childhood for few books came to my father as editor and he indulged himself in buying them even more rarely  my grandfathers book store it was also the village drugstore had then the only stock of literature for sale in the place and once when harper  brothers agent came to replenish it be gave my father several volumes for review  one of these was a copy of thomsons seasons a finely illustrated edition whose pictures i knew long before i knew the poetry and thought them the most beautiful things that ever were  my father read passages of the book aloud and he wanted me to read it all myself  for the matter of that he wanted me to read cowper from whom no one could get anything but good and he wanted me to read byron from whom i could then have got no harm we get harm from the evil we understand  he loved burns too and he used to read aloud from him i must own to my inexpressible weariness  i could not away with that dialect and i could not then feel the charm of the poets wit nor the tender beauty of his pathos  moore i could manage better and when my father read lalla rookh to my mother i sat up to listen and entered into all the woes of iran in the story of the fire worshippers  i drew the line at the veiled prophet of khorassan though i had some sense of the humor of the poets conception of the critic in fadladeen  but i liked scotts poems far better and got from ispahan to edinburgh with a glad alacrity of fancy  i followed the lady of the lake throughout and when i first began to contrive verses of my own i found that poem a fit model in mood and metre  among other volumes of verse on the top shelf of the bookcase of which i used to look at the outside without penetrating deeply within were popes translation of the iliad and the odyssey and drydens virgil pretty little tomes in treecalf published by james crissy in philadelphia and illustrated with small copperplates which somehow seemed to put the matter hopelessly beyond me  it was as if they said to me in so many words that literature which furnished the subjects of such pictures i could not hope to understand and need not try  at any rate i let them alone for the time and i did not meddle with a volume of shakespeare in green cloth and cruelly fine print which overawed me in like manner with its woodcuts  i cannot say just why i conceived that there was something unhallowed in the matter of the book perhaps this was a tint from the reputation of the rather profligate young man from whom my father had it  if he were not profligate i ask his pardon  i have not the least notion who he was but that was the notion i had of him whoever he was or wherever he now is  there may never have been such a young man at all the impression i had may have been pure invention of my own like many things with children who do not very distinctly know their dreams from their experiences and live in the world where both project the same quality of shadow  there were of course other books in the bookcase which my consciousness made no account of and i speak only of those i remember fiction there was none at all that i can recall except poes tales of the grotesque and the arabesque i long afflicted myself as to what those words meant when i might easily have asked and found out and bulwers last days of pompeii all in the same kind of binding  history is known to my young remembrance of that library by a history of the united states whose dust and ashes i hardly made my way through and by a chronicle of the conquest of granada by the ever dear and precious fray antonio agapida whom i was long in making out to be one and the same as washington irving  in school there was as little literature then as there is now and i cannot say anything worse of our school reading but i was not really very much in school and so i got small harm from it  the printing office was my school from a very early date  my father thoroughly believed in it and he had his beliefs as to work which he illustrated as soon as we were old enough to learn the trade he followed  we could go to school and study or we could go into the printingoffice and work with an equal chance of learning but we could not be idle we must do something for our souls sake though he was willing enough we should play and he liked himself to go into the woods with us and to enjoy the pleasures that manhood can share with childhood  i suppose that as the world goes now we were poor  his income was never above twelve hundred a year and his family was large but nobody was rich there or then we lived in the simple abundance of that time and place and we did not know that we were poor  as yet the unequal modern conditions were undreamed of who indeed could have dreamed of them forty or fifty years ago in the little southern ohio town where nearly the whole of my most happy boyhood was passed     ii  goldsmith  when i began to have literary likings of my own and to love certain books above others the first authors of my heart were goldsmith cervantes and irving  in the sharply foreshortened perspective of the past i seem to have read them all at once but i am aware of an order of time in the pleasure they gave me and i know that goldsmith came first he came so early that i cannot tell when or how i began to read him but it must have been before i was ten years old  i read other books about that time notably a small book on grecian and roman mythology which i perused with such a passion for those pagan gods and goddesses that if it had ever been a question of sacrificing to diana i do not really know whether i should have been able to refuse  i adored indiscriminately all the tribes of nymphs and naiads demigods and heroes as well as the high ones of olympus and i am afraid that by day i dwelt in a world peopled and ruled by them though i faithfully said my prayers at night and fell asleep in sorrow for my sins  i do not know in the least how goldsmiths greece came into my hands though i fancy it must have been procured for me because of a taste which i showed for that kind of reading and i can imagine no greater luck for a small boy in a small town of southwestern ohio wellnigh fifty years ago  i have the books yet two little stout volumes in fine print with the marks of wear on them but without those dishonorable blots or those other injuries which boys inflict upon books in resentment of their dulness or out of mere wantonness  i was always sensitive to the maltreatment of books i could not bear to see a book faced down or dogseared or brokenbacked  it was like a hurt or an insult to a thing that could feel  goldsmiths history of rome came to me much later but quite as immemorably and after i had formed a preference for the greek republics which i dare say was not mistaken  of course i liked athens best and yet there was something in the fine behavior of the spartans in battle which won a heart formed for heroworship  i mastered the notion of their communism and approved of their iron money with the poverty it obliged them to yet somehow their cruel treatment of the helots failed to shock me perhaps i forgave it to their patriotism as i had to forgive many ugly facts in the history of the romans to theirs  there was hardly any sort of bloodshed which i would not pardon in those days to the slayers of tyrants and the swagger form of such as despatched a despot with a fine speech was so much to my liking that i could only grieve that i was born too late to do and to say those things  i do not think i yet felt the beauty of the literature which made them all live in my fancy that i conceived of goldsmith as an artist using for my rapture the finest of the arts and yet i had been taught to see the loveliness of poetry and was already trying to make it on my own poor account  i tried to make verses like those i listened to when my father read moore and scott to my mother but i heard them with no such happiness as i read my beloved histories though i never thought then of attempting to write like goldsmith  i accepted his beautiful work as ignorantly as i did my other blessings  i was concerned in getting at the greeks and romans and i did not know through what nimble air and by what lovely ways i was led to them  some retrospective perception of this came long afterward when i read his essays and after i knew all of his poetry and later yet when i read the vicar of wakefield but for the present my eyes were holden as the eyes of a boy mostly are in the world of art  what i wanted with my greeks and romans after i got at them was to be like them or at least to turn them to account in verse and in dramatic verse at that  the romans were less civilized than the greeks and so were more like boys and more to a boys purpose  i did not make literature of the greeks but i got a whole tragedy out of the romans it was a rhymed tragedy and in octosyllabic verse like the lady of the lake  i meant it to be acted by my schoolmates but i am not sure that i ever made it known to them  still they were not ignorant of my reading and i remember how proud i was when a certain boy who had always whipped me when we fought together and so outranked me in that little boys world once sent to ask me the name of the roman emperor who lamented at nightfall when he had done nothing worthy that he had lost a day  the boy was going to use the story in a composition as we called the school themes then and i told him the emperors name i could not tell him now without turning to the book  my reading gave me no standing among the boys and i did not expect it to rank me with boys who were more valiant in fight or in play and i have since found that literature gives one no more certain station in the world of mens activities either idle or useful  we literary folk try to believe that it does but that is all nonsense  at every period of life among boys or men we are accepted when they are at leisure and want to be amused and at best we are tolerated rather than accepted i must have told the boys stories out of my goldsmiths greece and rome or it would not have been known that i had read them but i have no recollection now of doing so while i distinctly remember rehearsing the allegories and fables of the gesta romanorum a book which seems to have been in my hands about the same time or a little later  i had a delight in that stupid collection of monkish legends which i cannot account for now and which persisted in spite of the nightmare confusion it made of my ancient greeks and romans  they were not at all the ancient greeks and romans of goldsmiths histories  i cannot say at what times i read these books but they must have been odd times for life was very full of play then and was already beginning to be troubled with work  as i have said i was to and fro between the schoolhouse and the printingoffice so much that when i tired of the one i must have been very promptly given my choice of the other  the reading however somehow went on pretty constantly and no doubt my love for it won me a chance for it  there were some famous cherrytrees in our yard which as i look back at them seem to have been in flower or fruit the year round and in one of them there was a level branch where a boy could sit with a book till his dangling legs went to sleep or till some idler or busier boy came to the gate and called him down to play marbles or go swimming  when this happened the ancient world was rolled up like a scroll and put away until the next day with all its orators and conspirators its nymphs and satyrs gods and demigods though sometimes they escaped at night and got into the boys dreams  i do not think i cared as much as some of the other boys for the arabian nights or robinson crusoe but when it came to the ingenious gentleman of la mancha i was not only first i was sole  before i speak however of the beneficent humorist who next had my boyish heart after goldsmith let me acquit myself in full of my debt to that not unequal or unkindred spirit  i have said it was long after i had read those histories full of his inalienable charm mere potboilers as they were and far beneath his more willing efforts that i came to know his poetry  my father must have read the deserted village to us and told us something of the authors pathetic life for i cannot remember when i first knew of sweet auburn or had the light of the poets own troubled day upon the loveliest village of the plain the vicar of wakefield must have come into my life after that poem and before the traveler  it was when i would have said that i knew all goldsmith we often give ourselves credit for knowledge in this way without having any tangible assets and my reading has always been very desultory  i should like to say here that the reading of any one who reads to much purpose is always very desultory though perhaps i had better not say so but merely state the fact in my case and own that i never read any one author quite through without wandering from him to others  when i first read the vicar of wakefield for i have since read it several times and hope yet to read it many times i found its persons and incidents familiar and so i suppose i must have heard it read  it is still for me one of the most modern novels that is to say one of the best  it is unmistakably good up to a certain point and then unmistakably bad but with always good enough in it to be forever imperishable  kindness and gentleness are never out of fashion it is these in goldsmith which make him our contemporary and it is worth the while of any young person presently intending deathless renown to take a little thought of them  they are the source of all refinement and i do not believe that the best art in any kind exists without them  the style is the man and he cannot hide himself in any garb of words so that we shall not know somehow what manner of man he is within it his speech betrayeth him not only as to his country and his race but more subtly yet as to his heart and the loves and hates of his heart  as to goldsmith i do not think that a man of harsh and arrogant nature of worldly and selfish soul could ever have written his style and i do not think that in far greater measure than criticism has recognized his spiritual quality his essential friendliness expressed itself in the literary beauty that wins the heart as well as takes the fancy in his work  i should have my reservations and my animadversions if it came to close criticism of his work but i am glad that he was the first author i loved and that even before i knew i loved him i was his devoted reader i was not consciously his admirer till i began to read when i was fourteen a little volume of his essays made up i dare say from the citizen of the world and other unsuccessful ventures of his  it contained the papers on beau tibbs among others and i tried to write sketches and studies of life in their manner  but this attempt at goldsmiths manner followed a long time after i tried to write in the style of edgar a poe as i knew it from his tales of the grotesque erred arabesque  i suppose the very poorest of these was the devil in the belfry but such as it was i followed it as closely as i could in the devil in the smokepipes i meant tobaccopipes  the resemblance was noted by those to whom i read my story i alone could not see it or would not own it and i really felt it a hardship that i should be found to have produced an imitation  it was the first time i had imitated a prose writer though i had imitated several poets like moore campbell and goldsmith himself i have never greatly loved an author without wishing to write like him i have now no reluctance to confess that and i do not see why i should not say that it was a long time before i found it best to be as like myself as i could even when i did not think so well of myself as of some others  i hope i shall always be able and willing to learn something from the masters of literature and still be myself but for the young writer this seems impossible  he must form himself from time to time upon the different authors he is in love with but when he has done this he must wish it not to be known for that is natural too  the lover always desires to ignore the object of his passion and the adoration which a young writer has for a great one is truly a passion passing the love of women  i think it hardly less fortunate that cervantes was one of my early passions though i sat at his feet with no more sense of his mastery than i had of goldsmiths     iii  cervantes  i recall very fully the moment and the place when i first heard of don quixote while as yet i could not connect it very distinctly with anybodys authorship  i was still too young to conceive of authorship even in my own case and wrote my miserable verses without any notion of literature or of anything but the pleasure of seeing them actually come out rightly rhymed and measured  the moment was at the close of a summers day just before supper which in our house we had lawlessly late and the place was the kitchen where my mother was going about her work and listening as she could to what my father was telling my brother and me and an apprentice of ours who was like a brother to us both of a book that he had once read  we boys were all shelling peas but the story as it went on rapt us from the poor employ and whatever our fingers were doing our spirits were away in that strange land of adventures and mishaps where the fevered life of the knight truly without fear and without reproach burned itself out  i dare say that my father tried to make us understand the satirical purpose of the book i vaguely remember his speaking of the books of chivalry it was meant to ridicule but a boy could not care for this and what i longed to do at once was to get that book and plunge into its story  he told us at random of the attack on the windmills and the flocks of sheep of the night in the valley of the fullingmills with their triphammers of the inn and the muleteers of the tossing of sancho in the blanket of the island that was given him to govern and of all the merry pranks at the dukes and duchesss of the liberation of the galleyslaves of the capture of mambrinos helmet and of sanchos invention of the enchanted dulcinea and whatever else there was wonderful and delightful in the most wonderful and delightful book in the world  i do not know when or where my father got it for me and i am aware of an appreciable time that passed between my hearing of it and my having it  the event must have been most important to me and it is strange i cannot fix the moment when the precious story came into my hands though for the matter of that there is nothing more capricious than a childs memory what it will hold and what it will lose  it is certain my don quixote was in two small stout volumes not much bigger each than my goldsmiths greece bound in a sort of lawcalf well fitted to withstand the wear they were destined to undergo  the translation was of course the oldfashioned version of jervas which whether it was a closely faithful version or not was honest eighteenth century english and reported faithfully enough the spirit of the original  if it had any literary influence with me the influence must have been good  but i cannot make out that i was sensible of the literature it was the forever enchanting story that i enjoyed i exulted in the boundless freedom of the design the open air of that immense scene where adventure followed adventure with the natural sequence of life and the days and the nights were not long enough for the events that thronged them amidst the fields and woods the streams and hills the highways and byways hostelries and hovels prisons and palaces which were the setting of that matchless history  i took it as simply as i took everything else in the world about me  it was full of meaning that i could not grasp and there were significances of the kind that literature unhappily abounds in but they were lost upon my innocence  i did not know whether it was well written or not i never thought about that it was simply there in its vast entirety its inexhaustible opulence and i was rich in it beyond the dreams of avarice  my father must have told us that night about cervantes as well as about his don quixote for i seem to have known from the beginning that he was once a slave in algiers and that he had lost a hand in battle and i loved him with a sort of personal affection as if he were still living and he could somehow return my love  his name and nature endeared the spanish name and nature to me so that they were always my romance and to this day i cannot meet a spanish man without clothing him in something of the honor and worship i lavished upon cervantes when i was a child while i was in the full flush of this ardor there came to see our school one day a mexican gentleman who was studying the american system of education a mild fat saffron man whom i could almost have died to please for cervantes and don quixotes sake because i knew he spoke their tongue  but he smiled upon us all and i had no chance to distinguish myself from the rest by any act of devotion before the blessed vision faded though for long afterwards in impassioned reveries i accosted him and claimed him kindred because of my fealty and because i would have been spanish if i could  i would not have had the boyworld about me know anything of these fond dreams but it was my tastes alone my passions which were alien there in everything else i was as much a citizen as any boy who had never heard of don quixote  but i believe that i carried the book about with me most of the time so as not to lose any chance moment of reading it  even in the blank of certain years when i added little other reading to my store i must still have been reading it  this was after we had removed from the town where the earlier years of my boyhood were passed and i had barely adjusted myself to the strange environment when one of my uncles asked me to come with him and learn the drug business in the place forty miles away where he practised medicine  we made the long journey longer than any i have made since in the stagecoach of those days and we arrived at his house about twilight he glad to get home and i sick to death with yearning for the home i had left  i do not know how it was that in this state when all the world was one hopeless blackness around me i should have got my don quixote out of my bag i seem to have had it with me as an essential part of my equipment for my new career perhaps i had been asked to show it with the notion of beguiling me from my misery perhaps i was myself trying to drown my sorrows in it  but anyhow i have before me now the vision of my sweet young aunt and her young sister looking over her shoulder as they stood together on the lawn in the summer evening light  my aunt held my don quixote open in one hand while she clasped with the other the child she carried on her arm  she looked at the book and then from time to time she looked at me very kindly but very curiously with a faint smile so that as i stood there inwardly writhing in my bashfulness i had the sense that in her eyes i was a queer boy  she returned the book without comment after some questions and i took it off to my room where the confidential friend of cervantes cried himself to sleep  in the morning i rose up and told them i could not stand it and i was going home  nothing they could say availed and my uncle went down to the stageoffice with me and took my passage back  the horror of cholera was then in the land and we heard in the stage office that a man lay dead of it in the hotel overhead  but my uncle led me to his drugstore where the stage was to call for me and made me taste a little camphor with this prophylactic cervantes and i somehow got home together alive  the reading of don quixote went on throughout my boyhood so that i cannot recall any distinctive period of it when i was not more or less reading that book  in a boys way i knew it well when i was ten and a few years ago when i was fifty i took it up in the admirable new version of ormsby and found it so full of myself and of my own irrevocable past that i did not find it very gay  but i made a great many discoveries in it things i had not dreamt of were there and must always have been there and other things wore a new face and made a new effect upon me  i had my doubts my reserves where once i had given it my whole heart without question and yet in what formed the greatness of the book it seemed to me greater than ever  i believe that its free and simple design where event follows event without the fettering control of intrigue but where all grows naturally out of character and conditions is the supreme form of fiction and i cannot help thinking that if we ever have a great american novel it must be built upon some such large and noble lines  as for the central figure don quixote himself in his dignity and generosity his unselfish ideals and his fearless devotion to them he is always heroic and beautiful and i was glad to find in my latest look at his history that i had truly conceived of him at first and had felt the sublimity of his nature  i did not want to laugh at him so much and i could not laugh at all any more at some of the things done to him  once they seemed funny but now only cruel and even stupid so that it was strange to realize his qualities and indignities as both flowing from the same mind  but in my mature experience which threw a broader light on the fable i was happy to keep my old love of an author who had been almost personally dear to me     iv  irving  i have told how cervantes made his race precious to me and i am sure that it must have been he who fitted me to understand and enjoy the american author who now stayed me on spanish ground and kept me happy in spanish air though i cannot trace the tie in time and circumstance between irving and cervantes  the most i can make sure of is that i read the conquest of granada after i read don quixote and that i loved the historian so much because i had loved the novelist much more  of course i did not perceive then that irvings charm came largely from cervantes and the other spanish humorists yet unknown to me and that he had formed himself upon them almost as much as upon goldsmith but i dare say that this fact had insensibly a great deal to do with my liking  afterwards i came to see it and at the same time to see what was irvings own in irving to feel his native if somewhat attenuated humor and his original if somewhat too studied grace  but as yet there was no critical question with me  i gave my heart simply and passionately to the author who made the scenes of that most pathetic history live in my sympathy and companioned me with the stately and gracious actors in them  i really cannot say now whether i loved the moors or the spaniards more i fought on both sides i would not have had the spaniards beaten and yet when the moors lost i was vanquished with them and when the poor young king boabdil i was his devoted partisan and at the same time a follower of his fiery old uncle and rival hamet el zegri heaved the last sigh of the moor as his eyes left the roofs of granada forever it was as much my grief as if it had burst from my own breast  i put both these princes into the first and last historical romance i ever wrote i have now no idea what they did in it but as the story never came to a conclusion it does not greatly matter  i had never yet read an historical romance that i can make sure of and probably my attempt must have been based almost solely upon the facts of irvings history  i am certain i could not have thought of adding anything to them or at all varying them  in reading his chronicle i suffered for a time from its attribution to fray antonio agapida the pious monk whom he feigns to have written it just as in reading don quixote i suffered from cervantes masquerading as the moorish scribe cid hamet ben engeli  my father explained the literary caprice but it remained a confusion and a trouble for me and i made a practice of skipping those passages where either author insisted upon his invention  i will own that i am rather glad that sort of thing seems to be out of fashion now and i think the directer and franker methods of modern fiction will forbid its revival  thackeray was fond of such open disguises and liked to greet his reader from the mask of yellowplush and michael angelo titmarsh but it seems to me this was in his least modern moments  my conquest of granada was in two octavo volumes bound in drab boards and printed on paper very much yellowed with time at its irregular edges i do not know when the books happened in my hands  i have no remembrance that they were in any wise offered or commended to me and in a sort of way they were as authentically mine as if i had made them  i saw them at home not many months ago in my fathers library it has long outgrown the old bookcase which has gone i know not where and upon the whole i rather shrank from taking them down much more from opening them though i could not say why unless it was from the fear of perhaps finding the ghost of my boyish self within pressed flat like a withered leaf somewhere between the familiar pages  when i learned spanish it was with the purpose never yet fulfilled of writing the life of cervantes although i have since had some fortyodd years to do it in  i taught myself the language or began to do so when i knew nothing of the english grammar but the prosody at the end of the book  my father had the contempt of familiarity with it having himself written a very brief sketch of our accidence and he seems to have let me plunge into the sea of spanish verbs and adverbs nouns and pronouns and all the rest when as yet i could not confidently call them by name with the serene belief that if i did not swim i would still somehow get ashore without sinking  the end perhaps justified him and i suppose i did not do all that work without getting some strength from it but i wish i had back the time that it cost me i should like to waste it in some other way  however time seemed interminable then and i thought there would be enough of it for me in which to read all spanish literature or at least i did not propose to do anything less  i followed irving too in my later reading but at haphazard and with other authors at the same time  i did my poor best to be amused by his knickerbocker history of new york because my father liked it so much but secretly i found it heavy and a few years ago when i went carefully through it again  i could not laugh  even as a boy i found some other things of his uphill work  there was the beautiful manner but the thought seemed thin and i do not remember having been much amused by bracebridge hall though i read it devoutly and with a full sense that it would be very comme il faut to like it  but i did like the life of goldsmith i liked it a great deal better than the more authoritative life by forster and i think there is a deeper and sweeter sense of goldsmith in it  better than all except the conquest of granada i liked the legend of sleepy hollow and the story of rip van winkle with their humorous and affectionate caricatures of life that was once of our own soil and air and the tales of the alhambra which transported me again to the scenes of my youth beside the xenil  it was long after my acquaintance with his work that i came to a due sense of irving as an artist and perhaps i have come to feel a full sense of it only now when i perceive that he worked willingly only when he worked inventively at last i can do justice to the exquisite conception of his conquest of granada a study of history which in unique measure conveys not only the pathos but the humor of one of the most splendid and impressive situations in the experience of the race  very possibly something of the severer truth might have been sacrificed to the effect of the pleasing and touching tale but i do not under stand that this was really done upon the whole i am very well content with my first three loves in literature and if i were to choose for any other boy i do not see how i could choose better than goldsmith and cervantes and irving kindred spirits and each not a master only but a sweet and gentle friend whose kindness could not fail to profit him     v  first fiction and drama  in my own case there followed my acquaintance with these authors certain boeotian years when if i did not go backward i scarcely went forward in the paths i had set out upon  they were years of the work of the over work indeed which falls to the lot of so many that i should be ashamed to speak of it except in accounting for the fact  my father had sold his paper in hamilton and had bought an interest in another at dayton and we were all straining our utmost to help pay for it  my daily tasks began so early and ended so late that i had little time even if i had the spirit for reading and it was not till what we thought ruin but what was really release came to us that i got back again to my books  then we went to live in the country for a year and that stress of toil with the shadow of failure darkening all fell from me like the horror of an evil dream  the only new book which i remember to have read in those two or three years at dayton when i hardly remember to have read any old ones was the novel of jane eyre which i took in very imperfectly and which i associate with the first rumor of the rochester knockings then just beginning to reverberate through a world that they have not since left wholly at peace  it was a gloomy sunday afternoon when the book came under my hand and mixed with my interest in the story was an anxiety lest the pictures on the walls should leave their nails and come and lay themselves at my feet that was what the pictures had been doing in rochester and other places where the disembodied spirits were beginning to make themselves felt  the thing did not really happen in my case but i was alone in the house and it might very easily have happened  if very little came to me in those days from books on the other hand my acquaintance with the drama vastly enlarged itself  there was a hapless company of players in the town from time to time and they came to us for their printing  i believe they never paid for it or at least never wholly but they lavished free passes upon us and as nearly as i can make out at this distance of time i profited by their generosity every night  they gave two or three plays at every performance to houses ungratefully small but of a lively spirit and impatient temper that would not brook delay in the representation and they changed the bill each day  in this way i became familiar with shakespeare before i read him or at least such plays of his as were most given in those days and i saw macbeth and hamlet and above all richard iii again and again  i do not know why my delight in those tragedies did not send me to the volume of his plays which was all the time in the bookcase at home but i seem not to have thought of it and rapt as i was in them i am not sure that they gave me greater pleasure or seemed at all finer than rollo the wife the stranger barbarossa the miser of marseilles and the rest of the melodramas comedies and farces which i saw at that time  i have a notion that there were some clever people in one of these companies and that the lighter pieces at least were well played but i may be altogether wrong  the gentleman who took the part of villain with an unfailing love of evil in the different dramas used to come about the printingoffice a good deal and i was puzzled to find him a very mild and gentle person  to be sure he had a mustache which in those days devoted a man to wickedness but by day it was a blond mustache quite flaxen in fact and not at all the dark and deadly thing it was behind the footlights at night  i could scarcely gasp in his presence my heart bounded so in awe and honor of him when he paid a visit to us perhaps he used to bring the copy of the showbills  the company he belonged to left town in the adversity habitual with them  our own adversity had been growing and now it became overwhelming  we had to give up the paper we had struggled so hard to keep but when the worst came it was not half so bad as what had gone before  there was no more waiting till midnight for the telegraphic news no more waking at dawn to deliver the papers no more weary days at the case heavier for the doom hanging over us  my father and his brothers had long dreamed of a sort of family colony somewhere in the country and now the uncle who was most prosperous bought a milling property on a river not far from dayton and my father went out to take charge of it until the others could shape their business to follow him  the scheme came to nothing finally but in the mean time we escaped from the little city and its sorrowful associations of fruitless labor and had a year in the country which was blest at least to us children by sojourn in a logcabin while a house was building for us     vi  longfellows spanish student  this logcabin had a loft where we boys slept and in the loft were stored in barrels the books that had now begun to overflow the bookcase i do not know why i chose the loft to renew my longneglected friendship with them  the light could not have been good though if i brought my books to the little gable window that overlooked the groaning and whistling gristmill i could see well enough  but perhaps i liked the loft best because the books were handiest there and because i could be alone  at any rate it was there that i read longfellows spanish student which i found in an old paper copy of his poems in one of the barrels and i instantly conceived for it the passion which all things spanish inspired in me  as i read i not only renewed my acquaintance with literature but renewed my delight in people and places where i had been happy before those heavy years in dayton  at the same time i felt a little jealousy a little grudge that any one else should love them as well as i and if the poem had not been so beautiful i should have hated the poet for trespassing on my ground  but i could not hold out long against the witchery of his verse  the spanish student became one of my passions a minor passion not a grand one like don quixote and the conquest of granada but still a passion and i should dread a little to read the piece now lest i should disturb my old ideal of its beauty the heros rogue servant chispa seemed to me then and long afterwards so fine a bit of spanish character that i chose his name for my first pseudonym when i began to write for the newspapers and signed my legislative correspondence for a cincinnati paper with it  i was in love with the heroine the lovely dancer whose cachucha turned my head along with that of the cardinal but whose name even i have forgotten and i went about with the thought of her burning in my heart as if she had been a real person     vii  scott  all the while i was bringing up the long arrears of play which i had not enjoyed in the toilyears at dayton and was trying to make my spanish reading serve in the sports that we had in the woods and by the river we were moors and spaniards almost as often as we were british and americans or settlers and indians  i suspect that the large mild boy the son of a neighboring farmer who mainly shared our games had but a dim notion of what i meant by my strange people but i did my best to enlighten him and he helped me make a dream out of my life and did his best to dwell in the region of unrealities where i preferably had my being he was from time to time a moor when i think he would rather have been a mingo  i got hold of scotts poems too in that cabin loft and read most of the tales which were yet unknown to me after those earlier readings of my fathers  i could not say why harold the dauntless most took my fancy the fine strongly flowing rhythm of the verse had a good deal to do with it i believe  i liked these things all of them and in after years i liked the lady of the lake more and more and from mere love of it got great lengths of it by heart but i cannot say that scott was then or ever a great passion with me  it was a sobered affection at best which came from my sympathy with his love of nature and the whole kindly and humane keeping of his genius  many years later during the month when i was waiting for my passport as consul for venice and had the time on my hands i passed it chiefly in reading all his novels one after another without the interruption of other reading  ivanhoe i had known before and the bride of lammermoor and woodstock but the rest had remained in that sort of abeyance which is often the fate of books people expect to read as a matter of course and come very near not reading at all or read only very late  taking them in this swift sequence little or nothing of them remained with me and my experience with them is against that sort of ordered and regular reading which i have so often heard advised for young people by their elders  i always suspect their elders of not having done that kind of reading themselves  for my own part i believe i have never got any good from a book that i did not read lawlessly and wilfully out of all leading and following and merely because i wanted to read it and i here make bold to praise that way of doing  the book which you read from a sense of duty or because for any reason you must does not commonly make friends with you it may happen that it will yield you an unexpected delight but this will be in its own unentreated way and in spite of your good intentions little of the book read for a purpose stays with the reader and this is one reason why reading for review is so vain and unprofitable  i have done a vast deal of this but i have usually been aware that the book was subtly withholding from me the best a book can give since i was not reading it for its own sake and because i loved it but for selfish ends of my own and because i wished to possess myself of it for business purposes as it were  the reading that does one good and lasting good is the reading that one does for pleasure and simply and unselfishly as children do  art will still withhold herself from thrift and she does well for nothing but love has any right to her  little remains of the events of any period however vivid they were in passing  the memory may hold record of everything as it is believed but it will not be easily entreated to give up its facts and i find myself striving in vein to recall the things that i must have read that year in the country  probably i read the old things over certainly i kept on with cervantes and very likely with goldsmith  there was a delightful history of ohio stuffed with tales of the pioneer times which was a good deal in the hands of us boys and there was a book of western adventure full of indian fights and captivities which we wore to pieces  still i think that it was now that i began to have a literary sense of what i was reading  i wrote a diary and i tried to give its record form and style but mostly failed  the versifying which i was always at was easier and yielded itself more to my hand  i should be very glad to know at present what it dealt with     viii  lighter fancies  when my uncles changed their minds in regard to colonizing their families at the mills as they did in about a year it became necessary for my father to look about for some new employment and he naturally looked in the old direction  there were several schemes for getting hold of this paper and that and there were offers that came to nothing  in that day there were few salaried editors in the country outside of new york and the only hope we could have was of some place as printers in an office which we might finally buy  the affair ended in our going to the state capital where my father found work as a reporter of legislative proceedings for one of the daily journals and i was taken into the office as a compositor  in this way i came into living contact with literature again and the daydreams began once more over the familiar cases of type  a definite literary ambition grew up in me and in the long reveries of the afternoon when i was distributing my case i fashioned a future of overpowering magnificence and undying celebrity i should be ashamed to say what literary triumphs i achieved in those preposterous deliriums  what i actually did was to write a good many copies of verse in imitation never owned of moore and goldsmith and some minor poets whose work caught my fancy as i read it in the newspapers or put it into type  one of my pieces which fell so far short of my visionary performances as to treat of the lowly and familiar theme of spring was the first thing i ever had in print  my father offered it to the editor of the paper i worked on and i first knew with mingled shame and pride of what he had done when i saw it in the journal  in the tumult of my emotions i promised myself that if i got through this experience safely i would never suffer anything else of mine to be published but it was not long before i offered the editor a poem myself  i am now glad to think it dealt with so humble a fact as a farmers family leaving their old home for the west  the only fame of my poem which reached me was when another boy in the office quoted some lines of it in derision  this covered me with such confusion that i wonder that i did not vanish from the earth at the same time i had my secret joy in it and even yet i think it was attempted in a way which was not false or wrong  i had tried to sketch an aspect of life that i had seen and known and that was very well indeed and i had wrought patiently and carefully in the art of the poor little affair  my elder brother for whom there was no place in the office where i worked had found one in a store and he beguiled the leisure that light trade left on his hands by reading the novels of captain marryat  i read them after him with a great deal of amusement but without the passion that i bestowed upon my favorite authors  i believe i had no critical reserves in regard to them but simply they did not take my fancy still we had great fun with japhet in search of a father and with midshipman easy and we felt a fine physical shiver in the darkling moods of snarleyow the dogfiend  i do not remember even the names of the other novels except jacob faithful which i chanced upon a few years ago and found very hard reading  we children who were used to the free range of woods and fields were homesick for the country in our narrow city yard and i associate with this longing the farmers boy of bloomfield which my father got for me  it was a little book in blue cloth and there were some mild wood cuts in it  i read it with a tempered pleasure and with a vague resentment of its trespass upon thomsons ground in the division of its parts under the names of the seasons  i do not know why i need have felt this  i was not yet very fond of thomson  i really liked bloomfield better for one thing his poem was written in the heroic decasyllabics which i preferred to any other verse     ix  pope  i infer from the fact of this preference that i had already begun to read pope and that i must have read the deserted village of goldsmith i fancy also that i must by this time have read the odyssey for the battle of the frogs and mice was in the second volume and it took me so much that i paid it the tribute of a bald imitation in a mockheroic epic of a cat fight studied from the cat fights in our back yard with the wonted invocation to the muse and the machinery of partisan gods and goddesses  it was in some hundreds of verses which i did my best to balance as pope did with a caesura falling in the middle of the line and a neat antithesis at the end  the story of the odyssey charmed me of course and i had moments of being intimate friends with ulysses but i was passing out of that phase and was coming to read more with a sense of the author and less with a sense of his characters as real persons that is i was growing more literary and less human  i fell in love with pope whose life i read with an ardor of sympathy which i am afraid he hardly merited  i was of his side in all his quarrels as far as i understood them and if i did not understand them i was of his side anyway  when i found that he was a catholic i was almost ready to abjure the protestant religion for his sake but i perceived that this was not necessary when i came to know that most of his friends were protestants  if the truth must be told i did not like his best things at first but long remained chiefly attached to his rubbishing pastorals which i was perpetually imitating with a whole apparatus of swains and shepherdesses purling brooks enamelled meads rolling years and the like  after my days work at the case i wore the evening away in my boyish literary attempts forcing my poor invention in that unnatural kind and rubbing and polishing at my wretched verses till they did sometimes take on an effect which if it was not like popes was like none of mine with all my pains i do not think i ever managed to bring any of my pastorals to a satisfactory close  they all stopped somewhere about halfway  my swains could not think of anything more to say and the merits of my shepherdesses remained undecided  to this day i do not know whether in any given instance it was the champion of chloe or of sylvia that carried off the prize for his fair but i dare say it does not much matter  i am sure that i produced a rhetoric as artificial and treated of things as unreal as my master in the art and i am rather glad that i acquainted myself so thoroughly with a mood of literature which whatever we may say against it seems to have expressed very perfectly a mood of civilization  the severe schooling i gave myself was not without its immediate use i learned how to choose between words after a study of their fitness and though i often employed them decoratively and with no vital sense of their qualities still in mere decoration they had to be chosen intelligently and after some thought about their structure and meaning i could not imitate pope without imitating his methods and his method was to the last degree intelligent  he certainly knew what he was doing and although i did not always know what i was doing he made me wish to know and ashamed of not knowing  there are several truer poets who might not have done this and after all the modern contempt of pope he seems to me to have been at least one of the great masters if not one of the great poets  the poor mans life was as weak and crooked as his frail tormented body but he had a dauntless spirit and he fought his way against odds that might well have appalled a stronger nature i suppose i must own that he was from time to time a snob and from time to time a liar but i believe that he loved the truth and would have liked always to respect himself if he could  he violently revolted now and again from the abasement to which he forced himself and he always bit the heel that trod on him especially if it was a very high narrow heel with a clocked stocking and a hooped skirt above it i loved him fondly at one time and afterwards despised him but now i am not sorry for the love and i am very sorry for the despite  i humbly own a vast debt to him not the least part of which is the perception that he is a model of ever so much more to be shunned than to be followed in literature  he was the first of the writers of great annas time whom i knew and he made me ready to understand if he did not make me understand at once the order of mind and life which he belonged to  thanks to his pastorals i could long afterwards enjoy with the double sense requisite for full pleasure in them such divinely excellent artificialities at tassos aminta and guarinis pastor fido things which you will thoroughly like only after you are in the joke of thinking how people once seriously liked them as high examples of poetry  of course i read other things of popes besides his pastorals even at the time i read these so much  i read or not very easily or willingly read at his essay on man which my father admired and which he probably put popes works into my hands to have me read and i read the dunciad with quite a furious ardor in the tiresome quarrels it celebrates and an interest in its machinery which it fatigues me to think of  but it was only a few years ago that i read the rape of the lock a thing perfect of its kind whatever we may choose to think of the kind  upon the whole i think much better of the kind than i once did though still not so much as i should have thought if i had read the poem when the fever of my love for pope was at the highest  it is a nice question how far one is helped or hurt by ones idealizations of historical or imaginary characters and i shall not try to answer it fully  i suppose that if i once cherished such a passion for pope personally that i would willingly have done the things that he did and told the lies and vented the malice and inflicted the cruelties that the poor soul was full of it was for the reason partly that i did not see these things as they were and that in the glamour of his talent i was blind to all but the virtues of his defects which he certainly had and partly that in my love of him i could not take sides against him even when i knew him to be wrong  after all i fancy not much harm comes to the devoted boy from his enthusiasms for this imperfect hero or that  in my own case i am sure that i distinguished as to certain sins in my idols  i could not cast them down or cease to worship them but some of their frailties grieved me and put me to secret shame for them  i did not excuse these things in them or try to believe that they were less evil for them than they would have been for less people  this was after i came more or less to the knowledge of good and evil  while i remained in the innocence of childhood i did not even understand the wrong  when i realized what lives some of my poets had led how they were drunkards and swindlers and unchaste and untrue i lamented over them with a sense of personal disgrace in them and to this day i have no patience with that code of the world which relaxes itself in behalf of the brilliant and gifted offender rather he should suffer more blame the worst of the literature of past times before an ethical conscience began to inform it or the advance of the race compelled it to decency is that it leaves the mind foul with filthy images and base thoughts but what i have been trying to say is that the boy unless he is exceptionally depraved beforehand is saved from these through his ignorance  still i wish they were not there and i hope the time will come when the beastman will be so far subdued and tamed in us that the memory of him in literature shall be left to perish that what is lewd and ribald in the great poets shall be kept out of such editions as are meant for general reading and that the pedantpride which now perpetuates it as an essential part of those poets shall no longer have its way  at the end of the ends such things do defile they do corrupt we may palliate them or excuse them for this reason or that but that is the truth and i do not see why they should not be dropped from literature as they were long ago dropped from the talk of decent people the literary histories might keep record of them but it is loath some to think of those heaps of ordure accumulated from generation to generation and carefully passed down from age to age as something precious and vital and not justly regarded as the moral offal which they are  during the winter we passed at columbus i suppose that my father read things aloud to us after his old habit and that i listened with the rest  i have a dim notion of first knowing thomsons castle of indolence in this way but i was getting more and more impatient of having things read to me  the trouble was that i caught some thought or image from the text and that my fancy remained playing with that while the reading went on and i lost the rest  but i think the reading was less in every way than it had been because his work was exhausting and his leisure less  my own hours in the printingoffice began at seven and ended at six with an hour at noon for dinner which i often used for putting down such verses as had come to me during the morning  as soon as supper was over at night i got out my manuscripts which i kept in great disorder and written in several different hands on several different kinds of paper and sawed and filed and hammered away at my blessed popean heroics till nine when i went regularly to bed to rise again at five  sometimes the foreman gave me an afternoon off on saturdays and though the days were long the work was not always constant and was never very severe  i suspect now the office was not so prosperous as might have been wished  i was shifted from place to place in it and there was plenty of time for my daydreams over the distribution of my case  i was very fond of my work though and proud of my swiftness and skill in it  once when the perplexed foreman could not think of any task to set me he offered me a holiday but i would not take it so i fancy that at this time i was not more interested in my art of poetry than in my trade of printing  what went on in the office interested me as much as the quarrels of the augustan age of english letters and i made much more record of it in the crude and shapeless diary which i kept partly in verse and partly in prose but always of a distinctly lower literary kind than that i was trying otherwise to write there must have been some mention in it of the tremendous combat with wet sponges i saw there one day between two of the boys who hurled them back and forth at each other  this amiable fray carried on during the foremans absence forced upon my notice for the first time the boy who has come to be a name wellknown in literature  i admired his vigor as a combatant but i never spoke to him at that time and i never dreamed that he too was effervescing with verse probably as fiercely as myself  six or seven years later we met again when we had both become journalists and had both had poems accepted by mr lowell for the atlantic monthly and then we formed a literary friendship which eventuated in the joint publication of a volume of verse  the poems of two friends became instantly and lastingly unknown to fame the west waited as it always does to hear what the east should say the east said nothing and twothirds of the small edition of five hundred came back upon the publishers hands  i imagine these copies were ground up in the manner of worthless stock for i saw a single example of the book quoted the other day in a booksellers catalogue at ten dollars and i infer that it is so rare as to be prized at least for its rarity  it was a very pretty little book printed on tinted paper then called blush in the trade and it was manufactured in the same office where we had once been boys together unknown to each other  another boy of that time had by this time become foreman in the office and he was very severe with us about the proofs and sent us hurting messages on the margin perhaps he thought we might be going to take on airs and perhaps we might have taken on airs if the fate of our book had been different as it was i really think we behaved with sufficient meekness and after thirty four or five years for reflection i am still of a very modest mind about my share of the book in spite of the price it bears in the book sellers catalogue  but i have steadily grown in liking for my friends share in it and i think that there is at present no american of twenty three writing verse of so good a quality with an ideal so pure and high and from an impulse so authentic as john j piatts were then  he already knew how to breathe into his glowing rhyme the very spirit of the region where we were both native and in him the middle west has its true poet who was much more than its poet who had a rich and tender imagination a lovely sense of color and a touch even then securely and fully his own  i was reading over his poems in that poor little book a few days ago and wondering with shame and contrition that i had not at once known their incomparable superiority to mine  but i used then and for long afterwards to tax him with obscurity not knowing that my own want of simplicity and directness was to blame for that effect my reading from the first was such as to enamour me of clearness of definiteness anything left in the vague was intolerable to me but my long subjection to pope while it was useful in other ways made me so strictly literary in my point of view that sometimes i could not see what was if more naturally approached and without any technical preoccupation perfectly transparent  it remained for another great passion perhaps the greatest of my life to fuse these gyves in which i was trying so hard to dance and free me forever from the bonds which i had spent so much time and trouble to involve myself in  but i was not to know that passion for five or six years yet and in the mean time i kept on as i had been going and worked out my deliverance in the predestined way  what i liked then was regularity uniformity exactness  i did not conceive of literature as the expression of life and i could not imagine that it ought to be desultory mutable and unfixed even if at the risk of some vagueness     x  various preferences  my father was very fond of byron and i must before this have known that his poems were in our bookcase  while we were still in columbus i began to read them but i did not read so much of them as could have helped me to a truer and freer ideal  i read english bards and scotch reviewers and i liked its vulgar music and its heavyhanded sarcasm  these would perhaps have fascinated any boy but i had such a fanaticism for methodical verse that any variation from the octosyllabic and decasyllabic couplets was painful to me  the spencerian stanza with its rich variety of movement and its harmonious closes long shut childe harold from me and whenever i found a poem in any book which did not rhyme its second line with its first i read it unwillingly or not at all  this craze could not last of course but it lasted beyond our stay in columbus which ended with the winter when the legislature adjourned and my fathers employment ceased  he tried to find some editorial work on the paper which had printed his reports but every place was full and it was hopeless to dream of getting a proprietary interest in it  we had nothing and we must seek a chance where something besides money would avail us  this offered itself in the village of ashtabula in the northeastern part of the state and there we all found ourselves one moonlight night of early summer  the lake shore railroad then ended at ashtabula in a bank of sand and my elder brother and i walked up from the station while the rest of the family which pretty well filled the omnibus rode  we had been very happy at columbus as we were apt to be anywhere but none of us liked the narrowness of city streets even so near to the woods as those were and we were eager for the country again we had always lived hitherto in large towns except for that year at the mills and we were eager to see what a village was like especially a village peopled wholly by yankees as our father had reported it  i must own that we found it far prettier than anything we had known in southern ohio which we were so fond of and so loath to leave and as i look back it still seems to me one of the prettiest little places i have ever known with its white wooden houses glimmering in the dark of its elms and maples and their silent gardens beside each and the silent grass bordered sandy streets between them  the hotel where we rejoined our family lurked behind a group of lofty elms and we drank at the town pump before it just for the pleasure of pumping it  the village was all that we could have imagined of simply and sweetly romantic in the moonlight and when the day came it did not rob it of its charm  it was as lovely in my eyes as the loveliest village of the plain and it had the advantage of realizing the deserted village without being deserted     xi  uncle toms cabin  the book that moved me most in our stay of six months at ashtabula was then beginning to move the whole world more than any other book has moved it  i read it as it came out week after week in the old national era and i broke my heart over uncle toms cabin as every one else did  yet i cannot say that it was a passion of mine like don quixote or the other books that i had loved intensely  i felt its greatness when i read it first and as often as i have read it since i have seen more and more clearly that it was a very great novel  with certain obvious lapses in its art and with an art that is at its best very simple and perhaps primitive the book is still a work of art  i knew this in a measure then as i know it now and yet neither the literary pride i was beginning to have in the perception of such things nor the powerful appeal it made to my sympathies sufficed to impassion me of it  i could not say why this was so  why does the young mans fancy when it lightly turns to thoughts of love turn this way and not that  there seems no more reason for one than for the other  instead of remaining steeped to the lips in the strong interest of what is still perhaps our chief fiction i shed my tribute of tears and went on my way  i did not try to write a story of slaver as i might very well have done i did not imitate either the make or the manner of mrs stowes romance i kept on at my imitation of popes pastorals which i dare say i thought much finer and worthier the powers of such a poet as i meant to be  i did this as i must have felt then at some personal risk of a supernatural kind for my studies were apt to be prolonged into the night after the rest of the family had gone to bed and a certain ghost which i had every reason to fear might very well have visited the small room given me to write in  there was a story which i shrank from verifying that a former inmate of our house had hung himself in it but i do not know to this day whether it was true or not  the doubt did not prevent him from dangling at the doorpost in my consciousness and many a time i shunned the sight of this problematical suicide by keeping my eyes fastened on the book before me  it was a very simple device but perfectly effective as i think any one will find who employs it in like circumstances and i would really like to commend it to growing boys troubled as i was then  i never heard who the poor soul was or why he took himself out of the world if he really did so or if he ever was in it but i am sure that my passion for pope and my purpose of writing pastorals must have been powerful indeed to carry me through dangers of that kind  i suspect that the strongest proof of their existence was the gloomy and ruinous look of the house which was one of the oldest in the village and the only one that was for rent there  we went into it because we must and we were to leave it as soon as we could find a better  but before this happened we left ashtabula and i parted with one of the few possibilities i have enjoyed of seeing a ghost on his own ground as it were  i was not sorry for i believe i never went in or came out of the place by day or by night without a shudder more or less secret and at least now we should be able to get another house     xii  ossian  very likely the reading of ossian had something to do with my morbid anxieties  i had read byrons imitation of him before that and admired it prodigiously and when my father got me the bookas usual i did not know where or how he got itnot all the tall forms that moved before the eyes of haunted bards in the dusky vale of autumn could have kept me from it  there were certain outline illustrations in it which were very good in the cold flaxman manner and helped largely to heighten the fascination of the poems for me  they did not supplant the pastorals of pope in my affections and they were never the grand passion with me that popes poems had been  i began at once to make my imitations of ossian and i dare say they were not windier and mistier than the original  at the same time i read the literature of the subject and gave the pretensions of macpherson an unquestioning faith  i should have made very short work of any one who had impugned the authenticity of the poems but happily there was no one who held the contrary opinion in that village so far as i knew or who cared for ossian or had even heard of him  this saved me a great deal of heated controversy with my contemporaries but i had it out in many angry reveries with dr johnson and others who had dared to say in their time that the poems of ossian were not genuine lays of the gaelic bard handed down from father to son and taken from the lips of old women in highland huts as macpherson claimed  in fact i lived over in my small way the epoch of the eighteenth century in which these curious frauds found polite acceptance all over europe and i think yet that they were really worthier of acceptance than most of the artificialities that then passed for poetry  there was a light of nature in them and this must have been what pleased me so longshut up to the studiowork of pope  but strangely enough i did not falter in my allegiance to him or realize that here in this free form was a deliverance if i liked from the fetters and manacles which i had been at so much pains to fit myself with  probably nothing would then have persuaded me to put them off permanently or to do more than lay them aside for the moment while i tried that new stop and that new step  i think that even then i had an instinctive doubt whether formlessness was really better than formality  something it seems to me may be contained and kept alive in formality but in formlessness everything spills and wastes away  this is what i find the fatal defect of our american ossian walt whitman whose way is where artistic madness lies he had great moments beautiful and noble thoughts generous aspirations and a heart wide and warm enough for the whole race but he had no bounds no shape he was as liberal as the casing air but he was often as vague and intangible  i cannot say how long my passion for ossian lasted but not long i fancy for i cannot find any trace of it in the time following our removal from ashtabula to the county seat at jefferson  i kept on with pope i kept on with cervantes i kept on with irving but i suppose there was really not substance enough in ossian to feed my passion and it died of inanition     xiii  shakespeare  the establishment of our paper in the village where there had been none before and its enlargement from four to eight pages were events so filling that they left little room for any other excitement but that of getting acquainted with the young people of the village and going to parties and sleigh rides and walks and drives and picnics and dances and all the other pleasures in which that community seemed to indulge beyond any other we had known  the village was smaller than the one we had just left but it was by no means less lively and i think that for its size and time and place it had an uncommon share of what has since been called culture  the intellectual experience of the people was mainly theological and political as it was everywhere in that day but there were several among them who had a real love for books and when they met at the druggists as they did every night to dispute of the inspiration of the scriptures and the principles of the free soil party the talk sometimes turned upon the respective merits of dickens and thackeray gibbon and macaulay wordsworth and byron  there were law students who read noctes ambrosianae the age of reason and baileys festus as well as blackstones commentaries and there was a public library in that village of six hundred people small but very well selected which was kept in one of the lawyers offices and was free to all  it seems to me now that the people met there oftener than they do in most country places and rubbed their wits together more but this may be one of those pleasing illusions of memory which men in later life are subject to  i insist upon nothing but certainly the air was friendlier to the tastes i had formed than any i had yet known and i found a wider if not deeper sympathy with them  there was one of our printers who liked books and we went through don quixote together again and through the conquest of granada and we began to read other things of irvings  there was a very good little stock of books at the village drugstore and among those that began to come into my hands were the poems of dr holmes stray volumes of de quincey and here and there minor works of thackeray i believe i had no money to buy them but there was an open account or a comity between the printer and the bookseller and i must have been allowed a certain discretion in regard to getting books  still i do not think i went far in the more modern authors or gave my heart to any of them  suddenly it was now given to shakespeare without notice or reason that i can recall except that my friend liked him too and that we found it a double pleasure to read him together  printers in the oldtime offices were always spouting shakespeare more or less and i suppose i could not have kept away from him much longer in the nature of things  i cannot fix the time or place when my friend and i began to read him but it was in the fine print of that unhallowed edition of ours and presently we had great lengths of him by heart out of hamlet out of the tempest out of macbeth out of richard iii out of midsummernights dream out of the comedy of errors out of julius caesar out of measure for measure out of romeo and juliet out of two gentlemen of verona  these were the plays that we loved and must have read in common or at least at the same time but others that i more especially liked were the histories and among them particularly were the henrys where falstaff appeared  this gross and palpable reprobate greatly took my fancy i delighted in him immensely and in his comrades pistol and bardolph and nym  i could not read of his death without emotion and it was a personal pang to me when the prince crowned king denied him blackguard for blackguard i still think the prince the worse blackguard  perhaps i flatter myself but i believe that even then as a boy of sixteen i fully conceived of falstaffs character and entered into the authors wonderfully humorous conception of him  there is no such perfect conception of the selfish sensualist in literature and the conception is all the more perfect because of the wit that lights up the vice of falstaff a cold light without tenderness for he was not a good fellow though a merry companion  i am not sure but i should put him beside hamlet and on the name level for the merit of his artistic completeness and at one time i much preferred him or at least his humor  as to falstaff personally or his like i was rather fastidious and would not have made friends with him in the flesh much or little i revelled in all his appearances in the histories and i tried to be as happy where a factitious and perfunctory falstaff comes to life again in the merry wives of windsor though at the bottom of my heart i felt the difference  i began to make my imitations of shakespeare and i wrote 57 out passages where falstaff and pistol and bardolph talked together in that ercles vein which is so easily caught  this was after a year or two of the irregular and interrupted acquaintance with the author which has been my mode of friendship with all the authors i have loved  my worship of shakespeare went to heights and lengths that it had reached with no earlier idol and there was a supreme moment once when i found myself saying that the creation of shakespeare was as great as the creation of a planet  there ought certainly to be some bound beyond which the cult of favorite authors should not be suffered to go  i should keep well within the limit of that early excess now and should not liken the creation of shakespeare to the creation of any heavenly body bigger say than one of the nameless asteroids that revolve between mars and jupiter  even this i do not feel to be a true means of comparison and i think that in the case of all great men we like to let our wonder mount and mount till it leaves the truth behind and honesty is pretty much cast out as ballast a wise criticism will no more magnify shakespeare because he is already great than it will magnify any less man  but we are loaded down with the responsibility of finding him all we have been told he is and we must do this or suspect ourselves of a want of taste a want of sensibility  at the same time we may really be honester than those who have led us to expect this or that of him and more truly his friends  i wish the time might come when we could read shakespeare and dante and homer as sincerely and as fairly as we read any new book by the least known of our contemporaries  the course of criticism is towards this but when i began to read shakespeare i should not have ventured to think that he was not at every moment great  i should no more have thought of questioning the poetry of any passage in him than of questioning the proofs of holy writ  all the same i knew very well that much which i read was really poor stuff and the persons and positions were often preposterous  it is a great pity that the ardent youth should not be permitted and even encouraged to say this to himself instead of falling slavishly before a great author and accepting him at all points as infallible  shakespeare is fine enough and great enough when all the possible detractions are made and i have no fear of saying now that he would be finer and greater for the loss of half his work though if i had heard any one say such a thing then i should have held him as little better than one of the wicked  upon the whole it was well that i had not found my way to shakespeare earlier though it is rather strange that i had not  i knew him on the stage in most of the plays that used to be given  i had shared the conscience of macbeth the passion of othello the doubt of hamlet many times in my natural affinity for villains i had mocked and suffered with richard iii  probably no dramatist ever needed the stage less and none ever brought more to it  there have been few joys for me in life comparable to that of seeing the curtain rise on hamlet and hearing the guards begin to talk about the ghost and yet how fully this joy imparts itself without any material embodiment  it is the same in the whole range of his plays they fill the scene but if there is no scene they fill the soul  they are neither worse nor better because of the theatre  they are so great that it cannot hamper them they are so vital that they enlarge it to their own proportions and endue it with something of their own living force  they make it the size of life and yet they retire it so wholly that you think no more of it than you think of the physiognomy of one who talks importantly to you  i have heard people say that they would rather not see shakespeare played than to see him played ill but i cannot agree with them  he can better afford to be played ill than any other man that ever wrote  whoever is on the stage it is always shakespeare who is speaking to me and perhaps this is the reason why in the past i can trace no discrepancy between reading his plays and seeing them  the effect is so equal from either experience that i am not sure as to some plays whether i read them or saw them first though as to most of them i am aware that i never saw them at all and if the whole truth must be told there is still one of his plays that i have not read and i believe it is esteemed one of his greatest  there are several with all my reading of others that i had not read till within a few years and i do not think i should have lost much if i had never read pericles and winters tale  in those early days i had no philosophized preference for reality in literature and i dare say if i had been asked i should have said that the plays of shakespeare where reality is least felt were the most imaginative that is the belief of the puerile critics still but i suppose it was my instinctive liking for reality that made the great histories so delightful to me and that rendered macbeth and hamlet vital in their very ghosts and witches  there i found a world appreciable to experience a world inexpressibly vaster and grander than the poor little affair that i had only known a small obscure corner of and yet of one quality with it so that i could be as much at home and citizen in it as where i actually lived  there i found joy and sorrow mixed and nothing abstract or typical but everything standing for itself and not for some other thing  then i suppose it was the interfusion of humor through so much of it that made it all precious and friendly  i think i had a native love of laughing which was fostered in me by my fathers way of looking at life and had certainly been flattered by my intimacy with cervantes but whether this was so or not i know that i liked best and felt deepest those plays and passages in shakespeare where the alliance of the tragic and the comic was closest perhaps in a time when selfconsciousness is so widespread it is the only thing that saves us from ourselves  i am sure that without it i should not have been naturalized to that world of shakespeares histories where i used to spend so much of my leisure with such a sense of his own intimate companionship there as i had nowhere else  i felt that he must somehow like my being in the joke of it all and that in his great heart he had room for a boy willing absolutely to lose himself in him and be as one of his creations  it was the time of life with me when a boy begins to be in love with the pretty faces that then peopled this world so thickly and i did not fail to fall in love with the ladies of that shakespeareworld where i lived equally  i cannot tell whether it was because i found them like my ideals here or whether my ideals acquired merit because of their likeness to the realities there they appeared to be all of one degree of enchanting loveliness but upon the whole i must have preferred them in the plays because it was so much easier to get on with them there i was always much better dressed there i was vastly handsomer i was not bashful or afraid and i had some defects of these advantages to contend with here  that friend of mine the printer whom i have mentioned was one with me in a sense of the shakespearean humor and he dwelt with me in the sort of double being i had in those two worlds  we took the book into the woods at the ends of the long summer afternoons that remained to us when we had finished our work and on the shining sundays of the warm late spring the early warm autumn and we read it there on grassy slopes or heaps of fallen leaves so that much of the poetry is mixed for me with a rapturous sense of the outdoor beauty of this lovely natural world we read turn about one taking the story up as the other tired and as we read the drama played itself under the open sky and in the free air with such orchestral effects as the soughing woods or some rippling stream afforded  it was not interrupted when a squirrel dropped a nut on us from the top of a tall hickory and the plaint of a meadowlark prolonged itself with unbroken sweetness from one world to the other  but i think it takes two to read in the open air  the pressure of walls is wanted to keep the mind within itself when one reads alone otherwise it wanders and disperses itself through nature  when my friend left us for want of work in the office or from the vagarious impulse which is so strong in our craft i took my shakespeare no longer to the woods and fields but pored upon him mostly by night in the narrow little space which i had for my study under the stairs at home  there was a desk pushed back against the wall which the irregular ceiling eloped down to meet behind it and at my left was a window which gave a good light on the writingleaf of my desk  this was my workshop for six or seven years and it was not at all a bad one i have had many since that were not so much to the purpose and though i would not live my life over i would willingly enough have that little study mine again  but it is gone an utterly as the faces and voices that made home around it and that i was fierce to shut out of it so that no sound or sight should molest me in the pursuit of the end which i sought gropingly blindly with very little hope but with an intense ambition and a courage that gave way under no burden before no obstacle  long ago changes were made in the low rambling house which threw my little closet into a larger room but this was not until after i had left it many years and as long as i remained a part of that dear and simple home it was my place to read to write to muse to dream  i sometimes wish in these later years that i had spent less time in it or that world of books which it opened into that i had seen more of the actual world and had learned to know my brethren in it better  i might so have amassed more material for after use in literature but i had to fit myself to use it and i suppose that this was what i was doing in my own way and by such light as i had  i often toiled wrongly and foolishly but certainly i toiled and i suppose no work is wasted  some strength i hope was coming to me even from my mistakes and though i went over ground that i need not have traversed if i had not been left so much to find the way alone yet i was not standing still and some of the things that i then wished to do i have done  i do not mind owning that in others i have failed  for instance i have never surpassed shakespeare as a poet though i once firmly meant to do so but then it is to be remembered that very few other people have surpassed him and that it would not have been easy     xiv  ik marvel  my ardor for shakespeare must have been at its height when i was between sixteen and seventeen years old for i fancy when i began to formulate my admiration and to try to measure his greatness in phrases i was less simply impassioned than at some earlier time  at any rate i am sure that i did not proclaim his planetary importance in creation until i was at least nineteen  but even at an earlier age i no longer worshipped at a single shrine there were many gods in the temple of my idolatry and i bowed the knee to them all in a devotion which if it was not of one quality was certainly impartial  while i was reading and thinking and living shakespeare with such an intensity that i do not see how there could have been room in my consciousness for anything else there seem to have been half a dozen other divinities there great and small whom i have some present difficulty in distinguishing  i kept irving and goldsmith and cervantes on their old altars but i added new ones and these i translated from the contemporary literary world quite as often as from the past  i am rather glad that among them was the gentle and kindly ik marvel whose reveries of a bachelor and whose dream life the young people of that day were reading with a tender rapture which would not be altogether surprising i dare say to the young people of this  the books have survived the span of immortality fixed by our amusing copyright laws and seem now when any pirate publisher may plunder their author to have a new life before them  perhaps this is ordered by providence that those who have no right to them may profit by them in that divine contempt of such profit which providence so often shows  i cannot understand just how i came to know of the books but i suppose it was through the contemporary criticism which i was then beginning to read wherever i could find it in the magazines and newspapers and i could not say why i thought it would be very comme il faut to like them  probably the literary fine world which is always rubbing shoulders with the other fine world and bringing off a little of its powder and perfume was then dawning upon me and i was wishing to be of it and to like the things that it liked i am not so anxious to do it now  but if this is true i found the books better than their friends and had many a heartache from their pathos many a genuine glow of purpose from their high import many a tender suffusion from their sentiment  i dare say i should find their pose now a little old fashioned  i believe it was rather full of sighs and shrugs and starts expressed in dashes and asterisks and exclamations but i am sure that the feeling was the genuine and manly sort which is of all times and always the latest wear  whatever it was it sufficed to win my heart and to identify me with whatever was most romantic and most pathetic in it  i read dream life firstthough the reveries of a bachelor was written first and i believe is esteemed the better bookand dream life remains first in my affections  i have now little notion what it was about but i love its memory  the book is associated especially in my mind with one golden day of indian summer when i carried it into the woods with me and abandoned myself to a welter of emotion over its page i lay under a crimson maple and i remember how the light struck through it and flushed the print with the gules of the foliage  my friend was away by this time on one of his several absences in the northwest and i was quite alone in the absurd and irrelevant melancholy with which i read myself and my circumstances into the book  i began to read them out again in due time clothed with the literary airs and graces that i admired in it and for a long time i imitated ik marvel in the voluminous letters i wrote my friend in compliance with his shakespearean prayer            to milan let me hear from thee by letters           of thy success in love and what news else           betideth here in absence of thy friend           and i likewise will visit thee with mine  milan was then presently sheboygan wisconsin and verona was our little village but they both served the soul of youth as well as the real places would have done and were as really italian as anything else in the situation was really this or that  heaven knows what gaudy sentimental parade we made in our borrowed plumes but if the travesty had kept itself to the written word it would have been all well enough my misfortune was to carry it into print when i began to write a story in the ik marvel manner or rather to compose it in type at the case for that was what i did and it was not altogether imitated from ik marvel either for i drew upon the easier art of dickens at times and helped myself out with bald parodies of bleak house in many places  it was all very well at the beginning but i had not reckoned with the future sufficiently to have started with any clear ending in my mind and as i went on i began to find myself more and more in doubt about it  my material gave out incidents failed me the characters wavered and threatened to perish on my hands  to crown my misery there grew up an impatience with the story among its readers and this found its way to me one day when i overheard an old farmer who came in for his paper say that he did not think that story amounted to much  i did not think so either but it was deadly to have it put into words and how i escaped the mortal effect of the stroke i do not know  somehow i managed to bring the wretched thing to a close and to live it slowly into the past  slowly it seemed then but i dare say it was fast enough and there is always this consolation to be whispered in the ear of wounded vanity that the worlds memory is equally bad for failure and success that if it will not keep your triumphs in mind as you think it ought neither will it long dwell upon your defeats  but that experience was really terrible it was like some dreadful dream one has of finding ones self in battle without the courage needed to carry one creditably through the action or on the stage unprepared by study of the part which one is to appear in  i have hover looked at that story since so great was the shame and anguish that i suffered from it and yet i do not think it was badly conceived or attempted upon lines that were mistaken  if it were not for what happened in the past i might like some time to write a story on the same lines in the future     xv  dickens  what i have said of dickens reminds me that i had been reading him at the same time that i had been reading ik marvel but a curious thing about the reading of my later boyhood is that the dates do not sharply detach themselves one from another  this may be so because my reading was much more multifarious than it had been earlier or because i was reading always two or three authors at a time  i think macaulay a little antedated dickens in my affections but when i came to the novels of that masterful artist as i must call him with a thousand reservations as to the times when he is not a master and not an artist i did not fail to fall under his spell  this was in a season of great depression when i began to feel in broken health the effect of trying to burn my candle at both ends  it seemed for a while very simple and easy to come home in the middle of the afternoon when my task at the printingoffice was done and sit down to my books in my little study which i did not finally leave until the family were in bed but it was not well and it was not enough that i should like to do it  the most that can be said in defence of such a thing is that with the strong native impulse and the conditions it was inevitable  if i was to do the thing i wanted to do i was to do it in that way and i wanted to do that thing whatever it was more than i wanted to do anything else and even more than i wanted to do nothing i cannot make out that i was fond of study or cared for the things i was trying to do except as a means to other things  as far as my pleasure went or my natural bent was concerned i would rather have been wandering through the woods with a gun on my shoulder or lying under a tree or reading some book that cost me no sort of effort  but there was much more than my pleasure involved there was a hope to fulfil an aim to achieve and i could no more have left off trying for what i hoped and aimed at than i could have left off living though i did not know very distinctly what either was  as i look back at the endeavor of those days much of it seems mere purblind groping wilful and wandering  i can see that doing all by myself i was not truly a law to myself but only a sort of helpless force  i studied latin because i believed that i should read the latin authors and i suppose i got as much of the language as most schoolboys of my age but i never read any latin author but cornelius nepos  i studied greek and i learned so much of it as to read a chapter of the testament and an ode of anacreon  then i left it not because i did not mean to go farther or indeed stop short of reading all greek literature but because that friend of mine and i talked it over and decided that i could go on with greek any time but i had better for the present study german with the help of a german who had come to the village  apparently i was carrying forward an attack on french at the same time for i distinctly recall my failure to enlist with me an old gentleman who had once lived a long time in france and whom i hoped to get at least an accent from perhaps because he knew he had no accent worth speaking of or perhaps because he did not want the bother of imparting it he never would keep any of the engagements he made with me and when we did meet he so abounded in excuses and subterfuges that he finally escaped me and i was left to acquire an italian accent of french in venice seven or eight years later  at the same time i was reading spanish more or less but neither wisely nor too well  having had so little help in my studies i had a stupid pride in refusing all even such as i might have availed myself of without shame in books and i would not read any spanish author with english notes  i would have him in an edition wholly spanish from beginning to end and i would fight my way through him singlehanded with only such aid as i must borrow from a lexicon  i now call this stupid but i have really no more right to blame the boy who was once i than i have to praise him and i am certainly not going to do that  in his day and place he did what he could in his own way he had no true perspective of life but i do not know that youth ever has that  some strength came to him finally from the mere struggle undirected and misdirected as it often was and such mental fibre as he had was toughened by the prolonged stress  it could be said of course that the time apparently wasted in these effectless studies could have been well spent in deepening and widening a knowledge of english literature never yet too great and i have often said this myself but then again i am not sure that the studies were altogether effectless i have sometimes thought that greater skill had come to my hand from them than it would have had without and i have trusted that in making known to me the sources of so much english my little latin and less greek have enabled me to use my own speech with a subtler sense of it than i should have had otherwise  but i will by no means insist upon my conjecture  what is certain is that for the present my studies without method and without stint began to tell upon my health and that my nerves gave way in all manner of hypochondriacal fears  these finally resolved themselves into one incessant inexorable which i could escape only through bodily fatigue or through some absorbing interest that took me out of myself altogether and filled my morbid mind with the images of anothers creation  in this mood i first read dickens whom i had known before in the reading i had listened to  but now i devoured his books one after another as fast as i could read them  i plunged from the heart of one to another so as to leave myself no chance for the horrors that beset me  some of them remain associated with the gloom and misery of that time so that when i take them up they bring back its dreadful shadow  but i have since read them all more than once and i have had my time of thinking dickens talking dickens and writing dickens as we all had who lived in the days of the mighty magician  i fancy the readers who have come to him since he ceased to fill the world with his influence can have little notion how great it was  in that time he colored the parlance of the englishspeaking race and formed upon himself every minor talent attempting fiction  while his glamour lasted it was no more possible for a young novelist to escape writing dickens than it was for a young poet to escape writing tennyson  i admired other authors more i loved them more but when it came to a question of trying to do something in fiction i was compelled as by a law of nature to do it at least partially in his way  all the while that he held me so fast by his potent charm i was aware that it was a very rough magic now and again but i could not assert my sense of this against him in matters of character and structure  to these i gave in helplessly their very grotesqueness was proof of their divine origin and i bowed to the crudest manifestations of his genius in these kinds as if they were revelations not to be doubted without sacrilege  but in certain small matters as it were of ritual i suffered myself to think and i remember boldly speaking my mind about his style which i thought bad  i spoke it even to the quaint character whom i borrowed his books from and who might almost have come out of his books  he lived in dickens in a measure that i have never known another to do and my contumely must have brought him a pang that was truly a personal grief  he forgave it no doubt because i bowed in the dickens worship without question on all other points  he was then a man well on towards fifty and he had come to america early in life and had lived in our village many years without casting one of his english prejudices or ceasing to be of a contrary opinion on every question political religious and social he had no fixed belief but he went to the service of his church whenever it was held among us and he revered the book of common prayer while he disputed the authority of the bible with all comers  he had become a citizen but he despised democracy and achieved a hardy consistency only by voting with the proslavery party upon all measures friendly to the institution which he considered the scandal and reproach of the american name  from a heart tender to all he liked to say wanton savage and cynical things but he bore no malice if you gainsaid him  i know nothing of his origin except the fact of his being an englishman or what his first calling had been but he had evolved among us from a housepainter to an organbuilder and he had a passionate love of music he built his organs from the ground up and made every part of them with his own hands i believe they were very good and at any rate the churches in the country about took them from him as fast as he could make them  he had one in his own house and it was fine to see him as he sat before it with his long tremulous hands outstretched to the keys his noble head thrown back and his sensitive face lifted in the rapture of his music  he was a rarely intelligent creature and an artist in every fibre and if you did not quarrel with his manifold perversities he was a delightful companion  after my friend went away i fell much to him for society and we took long rambling walks together or sat on the stoop before his door or lounged over the books in the drugstore and talked evermore of literature  he must have been nearly three times my age but that did not matter we met in the equality of the ideal world where there is neither old nor young any more than there is rich or poor  he had read a great deal but of all he had read he liked dickens best and was always coming back to him with affection whenever the talk strayed he could not make me out when i criticised the style of dickens and when i praised thackerays style to the disadvantage of dickenss he could only accuse me of a sort of aesthetic snobbishness in my preference dickens he said was for the million and thackeray was for the upper ten thousand  his view amused me at the time and yet i am not sure that it was altogether mistaken  there is certainly a property in thackeray that somehow flatters the reader into the belief that he is better than other people  i do not mean to say that this was why i thought him a finer writer than dickens but i will own that it was probably one of the reasons why i liked him better if i appreciated him so fully as i felt i must be of a finer porcelain than the earthen pots which were not aware of any particular difference in the various liquors poured into them  in dickens the virtue of his social defect is that he never appeals to the principle which sniffs in his reader  the base of his work is the whole breadth and depth of humanity itself  it is helplessly elemental but it is not the less grandly so and if it deals with the simpler manifestations of character character affected by the interests and passions rather than the tastes and preferences it certainly deals with the larger moods through them  i do not know that in the whole range of his work he once suffers us to feel our superiority to a fellowcreature through any social accident or except for some moral cause  this makes him very fit reading for a boy and i should say that a boy could get only good from him  his view of the world and of society though it was very little philosophized was instinctively sane and reasonable even when it was most impossible  we are just beginning to discern that certain conceptions of our relations to our fellowmen once formulated in generalities which met with a dramatic acceptation from the world and were then rejected by it as mere rhetoric have really a vital truth in them and that if they have ever seemed false it was because of the false conditions in which we still live  equality and fraternity these are the ideals which once moved the world and then fell into despite and mockery as unrealities but now they assert themselves in our hearts once more  blindly unwittingly erringly as dickens often urged them these ideals mark the whole tendency of his fiction and they are what endear him to the heart and will keep him dear to it long after many a cunninger artificer in letters has passed into forgetfulness  i do not pretend that i perceived the full scope of his books but i was aware of it in the finer sense which is not consciousness  while i read him i was in a world where the right came out best as i believe it will yet do in this world and where merit was crowned with the success which i believe will yet attend it in our daily life untrammelled by social convention or economic circumstance  in that world of his in the ideal world to which the real world must finally conform itself i dwelt among the shows of things but under a providence that governed all things to a good end and where neither wealth nor birth could avail against virtue or right of course it was in a way all crude enough and was already contradicted by experience in the small sphere of my own being but nevertheless it was true with that truth which is at the bottom of things and i was happy in it  i could not fail to love the mind which conceived it and my worship of dickens was more grateful than that i had yet given any writer  i did not establish with him that onesided understanding which i had with cervantes and shakespeare with a contemporary that was not possible and as an american i was deeply hurt at the things he had said against us and the more hurt because i felt that they were often so just  but i was for the time entirely his and i could not have wished to write like any one else  i do not pretend that the spell i was under was wholly of a moral or social texture  for the most part i was charmed with him because he was a delightful storyteller because he could thrill me and make me hot and cold because he could make me laugh and cry and stop my pulse and breath at will  there seemed an inexhaustible source of humor and pathos in his work which i now find choked and dry i cannot laugh any more at pickwick or sam weller or weep for little nell or paul dombey their jokes their griefs seemed to me to be turned on and to have a mechanical action  but beneath all is still the strong drift of a genuine emotion a sympathy deep and sincere with the poor the lowly the unfortunate  in all that vast range of fiction there is nothing that tells for the strong because they are strong against the weak nothing that tells for the haughty against the humble nothing that tells for wealth against poverty  the effect of dickens is purely democratic and however contemptible he found our pseudoequality he was more truly democratic than any american who had yet written fiction  i suppose it was our instinctive perception in the region of his instinctive expression that made him so dear to us and wounded our silly vanity so keenly through our love when he told us the truth about our horrible sham of a slavebased freedom  but at any rate the democracy is there in his work more than he knew perhaps or would ever have known or ever recognized by his own life  in fact when one comes to read the story of his life and to know that he was really and lastingly ashamed of having once put up shoeblacking as a boy and was unable to forgive his mother for suffering him to be so degraded one perceives that he too was the slave of conventions and the victim of conditions which it is the highest function of his fiction to help destroy  i imagine that my early likes and dislikes in dickens were not very discriminating  i liked david copperfield and barnaby rudge and bleak house and i still like them but i do not think i liked them more than dombey  son and nicholas nickleby and the pickwick papers which i cannot read now with any sort of patience not to speak of pleasure  i liked martin chuzzlewit too and the other day i read a great part of it again and found it roughly true in the passages that referred to america though it was surcharged in the serious moods and caricatured in the comic  the english are always inadequate observers they seem too full of themselves to have eyes and ears for any alien people but as far as an englishman could dickens had caught the look of our life in certain aspects  his report of it was clumsy and farcical but in a large loose way it was like enough at least he had caught the note of our selfsatisfied intolerant and hypocritical provinciality and this was not altogether lost in his mocking horseplay  i cannot make out that i was any the less fond of dickens because of it i believe i was rather more willing to accept it as a faithful portraiture then than i should be now and i certainly never made any question of it with my friend the organbuilder  martin chuzzlewit was a favorite book with him and so was the old curiosity shop  no doubt a fancied affinity with tom pinch through their common love of music made him like that most sentimental and improbable personage whom he would have disowned and laughed to scorn if he had met him in life but it was a purely altruistic sympathy that he felt with little nell and her grandfather  he was fond of reading the pathetic passages from both books and i can still hear his rich vibrant voice as it lingered in tremulous emotion on the periods he loved  he would catch the volume up anywhere any time and begin to read at the bookstore or the harness shop or the lawoffice it did not matter in the wide leisure of a country village in those days before the war when people had all the time there was and he was sure of his audience as long as he chose to read  one christmas eve in answer to a general wish he read the christmas carol in the courthouse and people came from all about to hear him  he was an invalid and he died long since ending a life of suffering in the saddest way  several years before his death money fell to his family and he went with them to an eastern city where he tried in vain to make himself at home  he never ceased to pine for the village be had left with its old companionships its easy usages its familiar faces and he escaped to it again and again till at last every tie was severed and he could come back no more  he was never reconciled to the change and in a manner he did really die of the homesickness which deepened an hereditary taint and enfeebled him to the disorder that carried him off  my memories of dickens remain mingled with my memories of this quaint and most original genius and though i knew dickens long before i knew his lover i can scarcely think of one without thinking of the other     xvi  wordsworth lowell chaucer  certain other books i associate with another pathetic nature of whom the organbuilder and i were both fond  this was the young poet who looked after the book half of the village drug and book store and who wrote poetry in such leisure as he found from his duties and with such strength as he found in the disease preying upon him  he must have been far gone in consumption when i first knew him for i have no recollection of a time when his voice was not faint and husky his sweet smile wan and his blue eyes dull with the disease that wasted him away                 like wax in the fire                like snow in the sun  people spoke of him as once strong and vigorous but i recall him fragile and pale gentle patient knowing his inexorable doom and not hoping or seeking to escape it  as the end drew near he left his employment and went home to the farm some twenty miles away where i drove out to see him once through the deep snow of a winter which was to be his last my heart was heavy all the time but he tried to make the visit pass cheerfully with our wonted talk about books  only at parting when he took my hand in his thin cold clasp he said i suppose my disease is progressing with the patience he always showed  i did not see him again and i am not sure now that his gift was very distinct or very great  it was slight and graceful rather i fancy and if he had lived it might not have sufficed to make him widely known but he had a real and a very delicate sense of beauty in literature and i believe it was through sympathy with his preferences that i came into appreciation of several authors whom i had not known or had not cared for before  there could not have been many shelves of books in that store and i came to be pretty well acquainted with them all before i began to buy them  for the most part i do not think it occurred to me that they were there to be sold for this pale poet seemed indifferent to the commercial property in them and only to wish me to like them  i am not sure but i think it was through some volume which i found in his charge that i first came to know of de quincey he was fond of dr holmess poetry he loved whittier and longfellow each represented in his slender stock by some distinctive work  there were several stray volumes of thackerays minor writings and i still have the yellowplush papers in the smooth red cloth now pretty well tattered of appletons popular library which i bought there but most of the books were in the famous old brown cloth of ticknor  fields which was a warrant of excellence in the literature it covered  besides these there were standard volumes of poetry published by phillips  sampson from worn out plates for a birthday present my mother got me wordsworth in this shape and i am glad to think that i once read the excursion in it for i do not think i could do so now and i have a feeling that it is very right and fit to have read the excursion  to be honest it was very hard reading even then and i cannot truthfully pretend that i have ever liked wordsworth except in parts though for the matter of that i do not suppose that any one ever did  i tried hard enough to like everything in him for i had already learned enough to know that i ought to like him and that if i did not it was a proof of intellectual and moral inferiority in me  my early idol pope had already been tumbled into the dust by lowell whose lectures on english poetry had lately been given in boston and had met with my rapturous acceptance in such newspaper report as i had of them  so my preoccupations were all in favor of the lake school and it was both in my will and my conscience to like wordsworth  if i did not do so it was not my fault and the fault remains very much what it first was  i feel and understand him more deeply than i did then but i do not think that i then failed of the meaning of much that i read in him and i am sure that my senses were quick to all the beauty in him  after suffering once through the excursion i did not afflict myself with it again but there were other poems of his which i read over and over as i fancy it is the habit of every lover of poetry to do with the pieces he is fond of  still i do not make out that wordsworth was ever a passion of mine on the other hand neither was byron  him too i liked in passages and in certain poems which i knew before i read wordsworth at all i read him throughout but i did not try to imitate him and i did not try to imitate wordsworth  those lectures of lowells had a great influence with me and i tried to like whatever they bade me like after a fashion common to young people when they begin to read criticisms their aesthetic pride is touched they wish to realize that they too can feel the fine things the critic admires  from this motive they do a great deal of factitious liking but after all the affections will not be bidden and the critic can only avail to give a point of view to enlighten a perspective  when i read lowells praises of him i had all the will in the world to read spencer and i really meant to do so but i have not done so to this day and as often as i have tried i have found it impossible  it was not so with chaucer whom i loved from the first word of his which i found quoted in those lectures and in chamberss encyclopaedia of english literature which i had borrowed of my friend the organbuilder  in fact i may fairly class chaucer among my passions for i read him with that sort of personal attachment i had for cervantes who resembled him in a certain sweet and cheery humanity  but i do not allege this as the reason for i had the same feeling for pope who was not like either of them  kissing goes by favor in literature as in life and one cannot quite account for ones passions in either what is certain is i liked chaucer and i did not like spencer possibly there was an affinity between reader and poet but if there was i should be at a loss to name it unless it was the liking for reality and the sense of mother earth in human life  by the time i had read all of chaucer that i could find in the various collections and criticisms my father had been made a clerk in the legislature and on one of his visits home he brought me the poets works from the state library and i set about reading them with a glossary  it was not easy but it brought strength with it and lifted my heart with a sense of noble companionship  i will not pretend that i was insensible to the grossness of the poets time which i found often enough in the poets verse as well as the goodness of his nature and my father seems to have felt a certain misgiving about it  he repeated to me the librarians question as to whether he thought he ought to put an unexpurgated edition in the hands of a boy and his own answer that he did not believe it would hurt me it was a kind of appeal to me to make the event justify him and i suppose he had not given me the book without due reflection  probably he reasoned that with my greed for all manner of literature the bad would become known to me along with the good at any rate and i had better know that he knew it  the streams of filth flow down through the ages in literature which sometimes seems little better than an open sewer and as i have said i do not see why the time should not come when the noxious and noisome channels should be stopped but the base of the mind is bestial and so far the beast in us has insisted upon having his full say  the worst of lewd literature is that it seems to give a sanction to lewdness in the life and that inexperience takes this effect for reality that is the danger and the harm and i think the fact ought not to be blinked compared with the meaner poets the greater are the cleaner and chaucer was probably safer than any other english poet of his time but i am not going to pretend that there are not things in chaucer which a boy would be the better for not reading and so far as these words of mine shall be taken for counsel i am not willing that they should unqualifiedly praise him  the matter is by no means simple it is not easy to conceive of a means of purifying the literature of the past without weakening it and even falsifying it but it is best to own that it is in all respects just what it is and not to feign it otherwise  i am not ready to say that the harm from it is positive but you do get smeared with it and the filthy thought lives with the filthy rhyme in the ear even when it does not corrupt the heart or make it seem a light thing for the readers tongue and pen to sin in kind  i loved my chaucer too well i hope not to get some good from the best in him and my reading of criticism had taught me how and where to look for the best and to know it when i had found it  of course i began to copy him  that is i did not attempt anything like his tales in kind they must have seemed too hopelessly far away in taste and time but i studied his verse and imitated a stanza which i found in some of his things and had not found elsewhere i rejoiced in the freshness and sweetness of his diction and though i felt that his structure was obsolete there was in his wording something homelier and heartier than the imported analogues that had taken the place of the phrases he used  i began to employ in my own work the archaic words that i fancied most which was futile and foolish enough and i formed a preference for the simpler anglosaxon woof of our speech which was not so bad  of course being left so much as i was to my own whim in such things i could not keep a just mean i had an aversion for the latin derivatives which was nothing short of a craze  some halfbred critic whom i had read made me believe that english could be written without them and had better be written so and i did not escape from this lamentable error until i had produced with weariness and vexation of spirit several pieces of prose wholly composed of monosyllables  i suspect now that i did not always stop to consider whether my short words were not as latin by race as any of the long words i rejected and that i only made sure they were short  the frivolous ingenuity which wasted itself in this exercise happily could not hold out long and in verse it was pretty well helpless from the beginning  yet i will not altogether blame it for it made me know as nothing else could the resources of our tongue in that sort and in the revolt from the slavish bondage i took upon myself i did not go so far as to plunge into any very wild polysyllabic excesses  i still like the little word if it says the thing i want to say as well as the big one but i honor above all the word that says the thing  at the same time i confess that i have a prejudice against certain words that i cannot overcome the sight of some offends me the sound of others and rather than use one of those detested vocables even when i perceive that it would convey my exact meaning i would cast about long for some other i think this is a foible and a disadvantage but i do not deny it  an author who had much to do with preparing me for the quixotic folly in point was that thomas babington macaulay who taught simplicity of diction in phrases of as learned length and thundering sound as any he would have had me shun and who deplored the latinistic english of johnson in terms emulous of the great doctors orotundity and ronderosity  i wonder now that i did not see how my physician avoided his medicine but i did not and i went on to spend myself in an endeavor as vain and senseless as any that pedantry has conceived  it was none the less absurd because i believed in it so devoutly and sacrificed myself to it with such infinite pains and labor  but this was long after i read macaulay who was one of my grand passions before dickens or chaucer     xvii  macaulay  one of the many characters of the village was the machinist who had his shop under our printingoffice when we first brought our newspaper to the place and who was just then a machinist because he was tired of being many other things and had not yet made up his mind what he should be next  he could have been whatever he turned his agile intellect and his cunning hand to he had been a schoolmaster and a watchmaker and i believe an amateur doctor and irregular lawyer he talked and wrote brilliantly and he was one of the group that nightly disposed of every manner of theoretical and practical question at the drugstore it was quite indifferent to him which side he took what he enjoyed was the mental exercise  he was in consumption as so many were in that region and he carbonized against it as he said he took his carbon in the liquid form and the last time i saw him the carbon had finally prevailed over the consumption but it had itself become a seated vice that was many years since and it is many years since he died  he must have been known to me earlier but i remember him first as he swam vividly into my ken with a volume of macaulays essays in his hand one day  less figuratively speaking he came up into the printingoffice to expose from the book the nefarious plagiarism of an editor in a neighboring city who had adapted with the change of names and a word or two here and there whole passages from the essay on barere to the denunciation of a brother editor  it was a very simplehearted fraud and it was all done with an innocent trust in the popular ignorance which now seems to me a little pathetic but it was certainly very barefaced and merited the public punishment which the discoverer inflicted by means of what journalists call the deadly parallel column  the effect ought logically to have been ruinous for the plagiarist but it was really nothing of the kind  he simply ignored the exposure and the comments of the other city papers and in the process of time he easily lived down the memory of it and went on to greater usefulness in his profession  but for the moment it appeared to me a tremendous crisis and i listened as the minister of justice read his communication with a thrill which lost itself in the interest i suddenly felt in the plundered author those facile and brilliant phrases and ideas struck me as the finest things i had yet known in literature and i borrowed the book and read it through  then i borrowed another volume of macaulays essays and another and another till i had read them every one  it was like a long debauch from which i emerged with regret that it should ever end  i tried other essayists other critics whom the machinist had in his library but it was useless neither sidney smith nor thomas carlyle could console me i sighed for more macaulay and evermore macaulay  i read his history of england and i could measurably console myself with that but only measurably and i could not go back to the essays and read them again for it seemed to me i had absorbed them so thoroughly that i had left nothing unenjoyed in them  i used to talk with the machinist about them and with the organbuilder and with my friend the printer but no one seemed to feel the intense fascination in them that i did and that i should now be quite unable to account for  once more i had an author for whom i could feel a personal devotion whom i could dream of and dote upon and whom i could offer my intimacy in many an impassioned revery  i do not think t b macaulay would really have liked it i dare say he would not have valued the friendship of the sort of a youth i was but in the conditions he was helpless and i poured out my love upon him without a rebuff  of course i reformed my prose style which had been carefully modelled upon that of goldsmith and irving and began to write in the manner of macaulay in short quick sentences and with the prevalent use of brief anglosaxon words which he prescribed but did not practise  as for his notions of literature i simply accepted them with the feeling that any question of them would have been little better than blasphemy  for a long time he spoiled my taste for any other criticism he made it seem pale and poor and weak and he blunted my sense to subtler excellences than i found in him  i think this was a pity but it was a thing not to be helped like a great many things that happen to our hurt in life it was simply inevitable  how or when my frenzy for him began to abate i cannot say but it certainly waned and it must have waned rapidly for after no great while i found myself feeling the charm of quite different minds as fully as if his had never enslaved me  i cannot regret that i enjoyed him so keenly as i did it was in a way a generous delight and though he swayed me helplessly whatever way he thought i do not think yet that he swayed me in any very wrong way  he was a bright and clear intelligence and if his light did not go far it is to be said of him that his worst fault was only to have stopped short of the finest truth in art in morals in politics     xviii  critics and reviews  what remained to me from my love of macaulay was a love of criticism and i read almost as much in criticism as i read in poetry and history and fiction  it was of an eccentric doctor another of the village characters that i got the works of edgar a poe i do not know just how but it must have been in some exchange of books he preferred metaphysics  at any rate i fell greedily upon them and i read with no less zest than his poems the bitter and cruel and narrowminded criticisms which mainly filled one of the volumes  as usual i accepted them implicitly and it was not till long afterwards that i understood how worthless they were  i think that hardly less immoral than the lubricity of literature and its celebration of the monkey and the goat in us is the spectacle such criticism affords of the tigerish play of satire  it is monstrous that for no offence but the wish to produce something beautiful and the mistake of his powers in that direction a writer should become the prey of some ferocious wit and that his tormentor should achieve credit by his lightness and ease in rending his prey it is shocking to think how alluring and depraving the fact is to the young reader emulous of such credit and eager to achieve it  because i admired these barbarities of poes i wished to irritate them to spit some hapless victim on my own spear to make him suffer and to make the reader laugh  this is as far as possible from the criticism that enlightens and ennobles but it is still the ideal of most critics deny it as they will and because it is the ideal of most critics criticism still remains behind all the other literary arts  i am glad to remember that at the same time i exulted in these ferocities i had mind enough and heart enough to find pleasure in the truer and finer work the humaner work of other writers like hazlitt and leigh hunt and lamb which became known to me at a date i cannot exactly fix i believe it was hazlitt whom i read first and he helped me to clarify and formulate my admiration of shakespeare as no one else had yet done lamb helped me too and with all the dramatists and on every hand i was reaching out for light that should enable me to place in literary history the authors i knew and loved  i fancy it was well for me at this period to have got at the four great english reviews the edinburgh the westminster the london quarterly and the north british which i read regularly as well as blackwoods magazine  we got them in the american editions in payment for printing the publishers prospectus and their arrival was an excitement a joy and a satisfaction with me which i could not now describe without having to accuse myself of exaggeration  the love of literature and the hope of doing something in it had become my life to the exclusion of all other interests or it was at least the great reality and all other things were as shadows  i was living in a time of high political tumult and i certainly cared very much for the question of slavery which was then filling the minds of men i felt deeply the shame and wrong of our fugitive slave law i was stirred by the news from kansas where the great struggle between the two great principles in our nationality was beginning in bloodshed but i cannot pretend that any of these things were more than ripples on the surface of my intense and profound interest in literature  if i was not to live by it i was somehow to live for it  if i thought of taking up some other calling it was as a means only literature was always the end i had in view immediately or finally i did not see how it was to yield me a living for i knew that almost all the literary men in the country had other professions they were editors lawyers or had public or private employments or they were men of wealth there was then not one who earned his bread solely by his pen in fiction or drama or history or poetry or criticism in a day when people wanted very much less butter on their bread than they do now but i kept blindly at my studies and yet not altogether blindly for as i have said the reading i did had more tendency than before and i was beginning to see authors in their proportion to one another and to the body of literature  the english reviews were of great use to me in this i made a rule of reading each one of them quite through  to be sure i often broke this rule as people are apt to do with rules of the kind it was not possible for a boy to wade through heavy articles relating to english politics and economics but i do not think i left any paper upon a literary topic unread and i did read enough politics especially in blackwoods to be of tory opinions they were very fit opinions for a boy and they did not exact of me any change in regard to the slavery question     xix  a nonliterary episode  i suppose i might almost class my devotion to english reviews among my literary passions but it was of very short lease not beyond a year or two at the most  in the midst of it i made my first and only essay aside from the lines of literature or rather wholly apart from it  after some talk with my father it was decided mainly by myself i suspect that i should leave the printingoffice and study law and it was arranged with the united states senator who lived in our village and who was at home from washington for the summer that i was to come into his office  the senator was by no means to undertake my instruction himself his nephew who had just begun to read law was to be my fellowstudent and we were to keep each other up to the work and to recite to each other until we thought we had enough law to go before a board of attorneys and test our fitness for admission to the bar  this was the custom in that day and place as i suppose it is still in most parts of the country  we were to be fitted for practice in the courts not only by our reading but by a season of pettifogging before justices of the peace which i looked forward to with no small shrinking of my shy spirit but what really troubled me most and was always the grain of sand between my teeth was blackstones confession of his own original preference for literature and his perception that the law was a jealous mistress who would suffer no rival in his affections i agreed with him that i could not go through life with a divided interest i must give up literature or i must give up law  i not only consented to this logically but i realized it in my attempt to carry on the reading i had loved and to keep at the efforts i was always making to write something in verse or prose at night after studying law all day  the strain was great enough when i had merely the work in the printingoffice but now i came home from my blackstone mentally fagged and i could not take up the authors whom at the bottom of my heart i loved so much better  i tried it a month but almost from the fatal day when i found that confession of blackstones my whole being turned from the jealous mistress to the high minded muses i had not only to go back to literature but i had also to go back to the printingoffice i did not regret it but i had made my change of front in the public eye and i felt that it put me at a certain disadvantage with my fellow citizens as for the senator whose office i had forsaken i met him now and then in the street without trying to detain him and once when he came to the printingoffice for his paper we encountered at a point where we could not help speaking  he looked me over in my general effect of base mechanical and asked me if i had given up the law i had only to answer him i had and our conference ended  it was a terrible moment for me because i knew that in his opinion i had chosen a path in life which if it did not lead to the poor house was at least no way to the white house  i suppose now that he thought i had merely gone back to my trade and so for the time i had but i have no reason to suppose that he judged my case narrowmindedly and i ought to have had the courage to have the affair out with him and tell him just why i had left the law we had sometimes talked the english reviews over for he read them as well as i and it ought not to have been impossible for me to be frank with him but as yet i could not trust any one with my secret hope of some day living for literature although i had already lived for nothing else i preferred the disadvantage which i must be at in his eyes and in the eyes of most of my fellowcitizens i believe i had the applause of the organbuilder who thought the law no calling for me  in that village there was a social equality which if not absolute was as nearly so as can ever be in a competitive civilization and i could have suffered no slight in the general esteem for giving up a profession and going back to a trade if i was despised at all it was because i had thrown away the chance of material advancement i dare say some people thought i was a fool to do that  no one indeed could have imagined the rapture it was to do it or what a load rolled from my shoulders when i dropped the law from them  perhaps sinbad or christian could have conceived of my ecstatic relief yet so far as the popular vision reached i was not returning to literature but to the printing business and i myself felt the difference  my reading had given me criterions different from those of the simple life of our village and i did not flatter myself that my calling would have been thought one of great social dignity in the world where i hoped some day to make my living my convictions were all democratic but at heart i am afraid i was a snob and was unworthy of the honest work which i ought to have felt it an honor to do this whatever we falsely pretend to the contrary is the frame of every one who aspires beyond the work of his hands  i do not know how it had become mine except through my reading and i think it was through the devotion i then had for a certain author that i came to a knowledge not of good and evil so much as of common and superfine     xx  thackeray  it was of the organbuilder that i had thackerays books first  he knew their literary quality and their rank in the literary world but i believe he was surprised at the passion i instantly conceived for them he could not understand it he deplored it almost as a moral defect in me though he honored it as a proof of my critical taste  in a certain measure he was right  what flatters the worldly pride in a young man is what fascinates him with thackeray  with his air of looking down on the highest and confidentially inviting you to be of his company in the seat of the scorner he is irresistible his very confession that he is a snob too is balm and solace to the reader who secretly admires the splendors he affects to despise  his sentimentality is also dear to the heart of youth and the boy who is dazzled by his satire is melted by his easy pathos  then if the boy has read a good many other books he is taken with that abundance of literary turn and allusion in thackeray there is hardly a sentence but reminds him that he is in the society of a great literary swell who has read everything and can mock or burlesque life right and left from the literature always at his command  at the same time he feels his mastery and is abjectly grateful to him in his own simple love of the good for his patronage of the unassuming virtues it is so pleasing to ones vanity and so safe to be of the masters side when he assails those vices and foibles which are inherent in the system of things and which one can contemn with vast applause so long as one does not attempt to undo the conditions they spring from  i exulted to have thackeray attack the aristocrats and expose their wicked pride and meanness and i never noticed that he did not propose to do away with aristocracy which is and must always be just what it has been and which cannot be changed while it exists at all  he appeared to me one of the noblest creatures that ever was when he derided the shams of society and i was far from seeing that society as we have it was necessarily a sham when he made a mock of snobbishness i did not know but snobbishness was something that might be reached and cured by ridicule  now i know that so long as we have social inequality we shall have snobs we shall have men who bully and truckle and women who snub and crawl  i know that it is futile to spurn them or lash them for trying to get on in the world and that the world is what it must be from the selfish motives which underlie our economic life  but i did not know these things then nor for long afterwards and so i gave my heart to thackeray who seemed to promise me in his contempt of the world a refuge from the shame i felt for my own want of figure in it  he had the effect of taking me into the great world and making me a party to his splendid indifference to titles and even to royalties and i could not see that sham for sham he was unwittingly the greatest sham of all  i think it was pendennis i began with and i lived in the book to the very last line of it and made its alien circumstance mine to the smallest detail  i am still not sure but it is the authors greatest book and i speak from a thorough acquaintance with every line he has written except the virginians which i have never been able to read quite through most of his work i have read twice and some of it twenty times  after reading pendennis i went to vanity fair which i now think the poorest of thackerays novelscrude heavyhanded caricatured  about the same time i revelled in the romanticism of henry esmond with its pseudoeighteenthcentury sentiment and its appeals to an overwrought ideal of gentlemanhood and honor  it was long before i was duly revolted by esmonds transfer of his passion from the daughter to the mother whom he is successively enamoured of  i believe this unpleasant and preposterous affair is thought one of the fine things in the story i do not mind owning that i thought it so myself when i was seventeen and if i could have found a beatrix to be in love with and a lady castlewood to be in love with me i should have asked nothing finer of fortune the glamour of henry esmond was all the deeper because i was reading the spectator then and was constantly in the company of addison and steele and swift and pope and all the wits at wills who are presented evanescently in the romance  the intensely literary keeping as well as quality of the story i suppose is what formed its highest fascination for me but that effect of great world which it imparts to the reader making him citizen and if he will leading citizen of it was what helped turn my head  this is the toxic property of all thackerays writing  he is himself forever dominated in imagination by the world and even while he tells you it is not worth while he makes you feel that it is worth while  it is not the honest man but the man of honor who shines in his page his meek folk are proudly meek and there is a touch of superiority a glint of mundane splendor in his lowliest  he rails at the order of things but he imagines nothing different even when he shows that its baseness and cruelty and hypocrisy are wellnigh inevitable and for most of those who wish to get on in it quite inevitable  he has a good word for the virtues he patronizes the christian graces he pats humble merit on the head he has even explosions of indignation against the insolence and pride of birth and pursepride  but after all he is of the world worldly and the highest hope he holds out is that you may be in the world and despise its ambitions while you compass its ends  i should be far from blaming him for all this  he was of his time but since his time men have thought beyond him and seen life with a vision which makes his seem rather purblind  he must have been immensely in advance of most of the thinking and feeling of his day for people then used to accuse his sentimental pessimism of cynical qualities which we could hardly find in it now  it was the age of intense individualism when you were to do right because it was becoming to you say as a gentleman and you were to have an eye single to the effect upon your character if not your reputation you were not to do a mean thing because it was wrong but because it was mean  it was romanticism carried into the region of morals  but i had very little concern then as to that sort of error  i was on a very high esthetic horse which i could not have conveniently stooped from if i had wished it was quite enough for me that thackerays novels were prodigious works of art and i acquired merit at least with myself for appreciating them so keenly for liking them so much  it must be i felt with far less consciousness than my formulation of the feeling expresses that i was of some finer sort myself to be able to enjoy such a fine sort  no doubt i should have been a coxcomb of some kind if not that kind and i shall not be very strenuous in censuring thackeray for his effect upon me in this way  no doubt the effect was already in me and he did not so much produce it as find it  in the mean time he was a vast delight to me as much in the variety of his minor workshis yellowplush and letters of mr brown and adventures of major gahagan and the paris sketch book and the irish sketch book and the great hoggarty diamond and the book of snobs and the english humorists and the four georges and all the multitude of his essays and verses and caricaturesas in the spacious designs of his huge novels the newcomes and pendennis and vanity fair and henry esmond and barry lyndon  there was something in the art of the last which seemed to me then and still seems the farthest reach of the authors great talent  it is couched like so much of his work in the autobiographic form which next to the dramatic form is the most natural and which lends itself with such flexibility to the purpose of the author  in barry lyndon there is imagined to the life a scoundrel of such rare quality that he never supposes for a moment but he is the finest sort of a gentleman and so in fact he was as most gentlemen went in his day  of course the picture is overcolored it was the vice of thackeray or of thackerays time to surcharge all imitations of life and character so that a generation apparently much slower if not duller than ours should not possibly miss the artists meaning  but i do not think it is so much surcharged as esmond barry lyndon is by no manner of means so conscious as that mirror of gentlemanhood with its manifold self reverberations and for these reasons i am inclined to think he is the most perfect creation of thackerays mind  i did not make the acquaintance of thackerays books all at once or even in rapid succession and he at no time possessed the whole empire of my catholic not to say fickle affections during the years i was compassing a full knowledge and sense of his greatness and burning incense at his shrine  but there was a moment when he so outshone and overtopped all other divinities in my worship that i was effectively his alone as i have been the helpless and as it were hypnotized devotee of three or four others of the very great  from his art there flowed into me a literary quality which tinged my whole mental substance and made it impossible for me to say or wish to say anything without giving it the literary color  that is while he dominated my love and fancy if i had been so fortunate as to have a simple concept of anything in life i must have tried to give the expression of it some turn or tint that would remind the reader of books even before it reminded him of men  it is hard to make out what i mean but this is a try at it and i do not know that i shall be able to do better unless i add that thackeray of all the writers that i have known is the most thoroughly and profoundly imbued with literature so that when he speaks it is not with words and blood but with words and ink  you may read the greatest part of dickens as you may read the greatest part of hawthorne or tolstoy and not once be reminded of literature as a business or a cult but you can hardly read a paragraph hardly a sentence of thackerays without being reminded of it either by suggestion or downright allusion  i do not blame him for this he was himself and he could not have been any other manner of man without loss but i say that the greatest talent is not that which breathes of the library but that which breathes of the street the field the open sky the simple earth  i began to imitate this master of mine almost as soon as i began to read him this must be and i had a greater pride and joy in my success than i should probably have known in anything really creative i should have suspected that i should have distrusted that because i had nothing to test it by no model but here before me was the very finest and noblest model and i had but to form my lines upon it and i had produced a work of art altogether more estimable in my eyes than anything else could have been i saw the little world about me through the lenses of my masters spectacles and i reported its facts in his tone and his attitude with his selfflattered scorn his showy sighs his facile satire  i need not say i was perfectly satisfied with the result or that to be able to imitate thackeray was a much greater thing for me than to have been able to imitate nature  in fact i could have valued any picture of the life and character i knew only as it put me in mind of life and character as these had shown themselves to me in his books     xxi  lazarillo de tormes  at the same time i was not only reading many books besides thackerays but i was studying to get a smattering of several languages as well as i could with or without help  i could now manage spanish fairly well and i was sending on to new york for authors in that tongue  i do not remember how i got the money to buy them to be sure it was no great sum but it must have been given me out of the sums we were all working so hard to make up for the debt and the interest on the debt that is always the wicked pinch for the debtor we had incurred in the purchase of the newspaper which we lived by and the house which we lived in i spent no money on any other sort of pleasure and so i suppose it was afforded me the more readily but i cannot really recall the history of those acquisitions on its financial side  in any case if the sums i laid out in literature could not have been comparatively great the excitement attending the outlay was prodigious  i know that i used to write on to messrs roe lockwood  son new york for my spanish books and i dare say that my letters were sufficiently pedantic and filled with a simulated acquaintance with all spanish literature  heaven knows what they must have thought if they thought anything of their queer customer in that obscure little ohio village but he could not have been queerer to them than to his fellowvillagers i am sure  i haunted the postoffice about the time the books were due and when i found one of them in our deep box among a heap of exchange newspapers and business letters my emotion was so great that it almost took my breath  i hurried home with the precious volume and shut myself into my little den where i gave myself up to a sort of transport in it these books were always from the collection of spanish authors published by baudry in paris and they were in saffroncolored paper cover printed full of a perfectly intoxicating catalogue of other spanish books which i meant to read every one some time  the paper and the ink had a certain odor which was sweeter to me than the perfumes of araby  the look of the type took me more than the glance of a girl and i had a fever of longing to know the heart of the book which was like a lovers passion  some times i did not reach its heart but commonly i did  moratins origins of the spanish theatre and a large volume of spanish dramatic authors were the first spanish books i sent for but i could not say why i sent for them unless it was because i saw that there were some plays of cervantes among the rest  i read these and i read several comedies of lope de vega and numbers of archaic dramas in moratins history and i really got a fairish perspective of the spanish drama which has now almost wholly faded from my mind  it is more intelligible to me why i should have read condes dominion of the arabs in spain for that was in the line of my reading in irving which would account for my pleasure in the history of the civil wars of granada it was some time before i realized that the chronicles in this were a bundle of romances and not veritable records and my whole study in these things was wholly undirected and unenlightened  but i meant to be thorough in it and i could not rest satisfied with the spanishenglish grammars i had i was not willing to stop short of the official grammar of the spanish academy i sent to new york for it and my booksellers there reported that they would have to send to spain for it  i lived till it came to hand through them from madrid and i do not understand why i did not perish then from the pride and joy i had in it  but after all i am not a spanish scholar and can neither speak nor write the language  i never got more than a good reading use of it perhaps because i never really tried for more  but i am very glad of that because it has been a great pleasure to me and even some profit and it has lighted up many meanings in literature which must always have remained dark to me  not to speak now of the modern spanish writers whom it has enabled me to know in their own houses as it were i had even in that remote day a rapturous delight in a certain spanish book which was well worth all the pains i had undergone to get at it  this was the famous picaresque novel lazarillo de tormes by hurtado de mendoza whose name then so familiarized itself to my fondness that now as i write it i feel as if it were that of an old personal friend whom i had known in the flesh  i believe it would not have been always comfortable to know mendoza outside of his books he was rather a terrible person he was one of the spanish invaders of italy and is known in italian history as the tyrant of sierra  but at my distance of time and place i could safely revel in his friendship and as an author i certainly found him a most charming companion  the adventures of his rogue of a hero who began life as the servant and accomplice of a blind beggar and then adventured on through a most diverting career of knavery brought back the atmosphere of don quixote and all the landscape of that dear wonder world of spain where i had lived so much and i followed him with all the old delight  i do not know that i should counsel others to do so or that the general reader would find his account in it but i am sure that the intending author of american fiction would do well to study the spanish picaresque novels for in their simplicity of design he will find one of the best forms for an american story  the intrigue of close texture will never suit our conditions which are so loose and open and variable each mans life among us is a romance of the spanish model if it is the life of a man who has risen as we nearly all have with many ups and downs  the story of latzarillo is gross in its facts and is mostly unmeet for ladies like most of the fiction in all languages before our times but there is an honest simplicity in the narration a pervading humor and a rich feeling for character that gives it value  i think that a good deal of its foulness was lost upon me but i certainly understood that it would not do to present it to an american public just as it was in the translation which i presently planned to make i went about telling the story to people and trying to make them find it as amusing as i did but whether i ever succeeded i cannot say though the notion of a version with modifications constantly grew with me till one day i went to the city of cleveland with my father  there was a branch house of an eastern firm of publishers in that place and i must have had the hope that i might have the courage to propose a translation of lazarillo to them  my father urged me to try my fortune but my heart failed me  i was half blind with one of the headaches that tormented me in those days and i turned my sick eyes from the sign j p jewett  co publishers which held me fascinated and went home without at least having my muchdreamedof version of lazarillo refused     xxii  curtis longfellow schlegel  i am quite at a loss to know why my reading had this direction or that in those days  it had necessarily passed beyond my fathers suggestion and i think it must have been largely by accident or experiment that i read one book rather than another  he made some sort of newspaper arrangement with a bookstore in cleveland which was the means of enriching our home library with a goodly number of books shopworn but none the worse for that and new in the only way that books need be new to the lover of them  among these i found a treasure in curtiss two books the nile notes of a howadji and the howadji in syria  i already knew him by his potiphar papers and the everdelightful reveries which have since gone under the name of prue and i but those books of eastern travel opened a new world of thinking and feeling  they had at once a great influence upon me  the smooth richness of their diction the amiable sweetness of their mood their gracious caprice the delicacy of their satire which was so kind that it should have some other name their abundance of light and color and the deep heart of humanity underlying their airiest fantasticality all united in an effect which was different from any i had yet known  as usual i steeped myself in them and the first runnings of my fancy when i began to pour it out afterwards were of their flavor  i tried to write like this new master but whether i had tried or not i should probably have done so from the love i bore him  he was a favorite not only of mine but of all the young people in the village who were reading current literature so that on this ground at least i had abundant sympathy  the present generation can have little notion of the deep impression made upon the intelligence and conscience of the whole nation by the potiphar papers or how its fancy was rapt with the prue and i sketches these are among the most veritable literary successes we have had and probably we who were so glad when the author of these beautiful things turned aside from the flowery paths where he led us to battle for freedom in the field of politics would have felt the sacrifice too great if we could have dreamed it would be lifelong  but as it was we could only honor him the more and give him a place in our hearts which he shared with longfellow  this divine poet i have never ceased to read  his hiawatha was a new book during one of those terrible lake shore winters but all the other poems were old friends with me by that time  with a sister who is no longer living i had a peculiar affection for his pretty and touching and lightly humorous tale of kavanagh which was of a village life enough like our own in some things to make us know the truth of its delicate realism  we used to read it and talk it fondly over together and i believe some stories of like make and manner grew out of our pleasure in it  they were never finished but it was enough to begin them and there were few writers if any among those i delighted in who escaped the tribute of an imitation  one has to begin that way or at least one had in my day perhaps it is now possible for a young writer to begin by being himself but for my part that was not half so important as to be like some one else  literature not life was my aim and to reproduce it was my joy and my pride  i was widening my knowledge of it helplessly and involuntarily and i was always chancing upon some book that served this end among the great number of books that i read merely for my pleasure without any real result of the sort  schlegels lectures on dramatic literature came into my hands not long after i had finished my studies in the history of the spanish theatre and it made the whole subject at once luminous i cannot give a due notion of the comfort this book afforded me by the light it cast upon paths where i had dimly made my way before but which i now followed in the full day  of course i pinned my faith to everything that schlegel said i obediently despised the classic unities and the french and italian theatre which had perpetuated them and i revered the romantic drama which had its glorious course among the spanish and english poets and which was crowned with the fame of the cervantes and the shakespeare whom i seemed to own they owned me so completely  it vexes me now to find that i cannot remember how the book came into my hands or who could have suggested it to me  it is possible that it may have been that artist who came and stayed a month with us while she painted my mothers portrait she was fresh from her studies in new york where she had met authors and artists at the house of the carey sisters and had even once seen my adored curtis somewhere though she had not spoken with him  her talk about these things simply emparadised me it lifted me into a heaven of hope that i too might some day meet such elect spirits and converse with them face to face  my mood was sufficiently foolish but it was not such a frame of mind as i can be ashamed of and i could wish a boy no happier fortune than to possess it for a time at least     xxiii  tennyson  i cannot quite see now how i found time for even trying to do the things i had in hand more or less  it is perfectly clear to me that i did none of them well though i meant at the time to do none of them other than excellently  i was attempting the study of no less than four languages and i presently added a fifth to these  i was reading right and left in every direction but chiefly in that of poetry criticism and fiction from time to time i boldly attacked a history and carried it by a coup de main or sat down before it for a prolonged siege  there was occasionally an author who worsted me whom i tried to read and quietly gave up after a vain struggle but i must say that these authors were few  i had got a very fair notion of the range of all literature and the relations of the different literatures to one another and i knew pretty well what manner of book it was that i took up before i committed myself to the task of reading it  always i read for pleasure for the delight of knowing something more and this pleasure is a very different thing from amusement though i read a great deal for mere amusement as i do still and to take my mind away from unhappy or harassing thoughts there are very few things that i think it a waste of time to have read i should probably have wasted the time if i had not read them and at the period i speak of i do not think i wasted much time  my day began about seven oclock in the printingoffice where it took me till noon to do my task of so many thousand ems say four or five then we had dinner after the simple fashion of people who work with their hands for their dinners  in the afternoon i went back and corrected the proof of the type i had set and distributed my case for the next day  at two or three oclock i was free and then i went home and began my studies or tried to write something or read a book we had supper at six and after that i rejoiced in literature till i went to bed at ten or eleven  i cannot think of any time when i did not go gladly to my books or manuscripts when it was not a noble joy as well as a high privilege  but it all ended as such a strain must in the sort of break which was not yet known as nervous prostration  when i could not sleep after my studies and the sick headaches came oftener and then days and weeks of hypochondriacal misery it was apparent i was not well but that was not the day of anxiety for such things and if it was thought best that i should leave work and study for a while it was not with the notion that the case was at all serious or needed an uninterrupted cure  i passed days in the woods and fields gunning or picking berries i spent myself in heavy work i made little journeys and all this was very wholesome and very well but i did not give up my reading or my attempts to write no doubt i was secretly proud to have been invalided in so great a cause and to be sicklied over with the pale cast of thought rather than by some ignoble ague or the devastating consumption of that region  if i lay awake noting the wild pulsations of my heart and listening to the deathwatch in the wall i was certainly very much scared but i was not without the consolation that i was at least a sufferer for literature at the same time that i was so horribly afraid of dying i could have composed an epitaph which would have moved others to tears for my untimely fate  but there was really not impairment of my constitution and after a while i began to be better and little by little the health which has never since failed me under any reasonable stress of work established itself  i was in the midst of this unequal struggle when i first became acquainted with the poet who at once possessed himself of what was best worth having in me  probably i knew of tennyson by extracts and from the english reviews but i believe it was from reading one of curtiss easy chair papers that i was prompted to get the new poem of maud which i understood from the easy chair was then moving polite youth in the east  it did not seem to me that i could very well live without that poem and when i went to cleveland with the hope that i might have courage to propose a translation of lazarillo to a publisher it was with the fixed purpose of getting maud if it was to be found in any book store there  i do not know why i was so long in reaching tennyson and i can only account for it by the fact that i was always reading rather the earlier than the later english poetry  to be sure i had passed through what i may call a paroxysm of alexander smith a poet deeply unknown to the present generation but then acclaimed immortal by all the critics and put with shakespeare who must be a good deal astonished from time to time in his elysian quiet by the companionship thrust upon him  i read this now deadandgone immortal with an ecstasy unspeakable i raved of him by day and dreamed of him by night i got great lengths of his lifedrama by heart and i can still repeat several gorgeous passages from it i would almost have been willing to take the life of the sole critic who had the sense to laugh at him and who made his wicked fun in grahams magazine an extinct periodical of the old extinct philadelphian species  i cannot tell how i came out of this craze but neither could any of the critics who led me into it i dare say  the reading world is very susceptible of suchlunacies and all that can be said is that at a given time it was time for criticism to go mad over a poet who was neither better nor worse than many another thirdrate poet apotheosized before and since  what was good in smith was the reflected fire of the poets who had a vital heat in them and it was by mere chance that i bathed myself in his secondhand effulgence  i already knew pretty well the origin of the tennysonian line in english poetry wordsworth and keats and shelley and i did not come to tennysons worship a sudden convert but my devotion to him was none the less complete and exclusive like every other great poet he somehow expressed the feelings of his day and i suppose that at the time he wrote maud he said more fully what the whole englishspeaking race were then dimly longing to utter than any english poet who has lived  one need not question the greatness of browning in owning the fact that the two poets of his day who preeminently voiced their generation were tennyson and longfellow though browning like emerson is possibly now more modern than either  however i had then nothing to do with tennysons comparative claim on my adoration there was for the time no parallel for him in the whole range of literary divinities that i had bowed the knee to  for that while the temple was not only emptied of all the other idols but i had a richly flattering illusion of being his only worshipper  when i came to the sense of this error it was with the belief that at least no one else had ever appreciated him so fully stood so close to him in that holy of holies where he wrought his miracles  i say tawdily and ineffectively and falsely what was a very precious and sacred experience with me  this great poet opened to me a whole world of thinking and feeling where i had my being with him in that mystic intimacy which cannot be put into words  i at once identified myself not only with the hero of the poem but in some so with the poet himself when i read maud but that was only the first step towards the lasting state in which his poetry has upon the whole been more to me than that of any other poet  i have never read any other so closely and continuously or read myself so much into and out of his verse  there have been times and moods when i have had my questions and made my cavils and when it seemed to me that the poet was less than i had thought him and certainly i do not revere equally and unreservedly all that he has written that would be impossible  but when i think over all the other poets i have read he is supreme above them in his response to some need in me that he has satisfied so perfectly  of course maud seemed to me the finest poem i had read up to that time but i am not sure that this conclusion was wholly my own i think it was partially formed for me by the admiration of the poem which i felt to be everywhere in the critical atmosphere and which had already penetrated to me  i did not like all parts of it equally well and some parts of it seemed thin and poor though i would not suffer myself to say so then and they still seem so  but there were whole passages and spaces of it whose divine and perfect beauty lifted me above life  i did not fully understand the poem then i do not fully understand it now but that did not and does not matter for there something in poetry that reaches the soul by other enues than the intelligence  both in this poem and others of tennyson and in every poet that i have loved there are melodies and harmonies enfolding significance that appeared long after i had first read them and had even learned them by heart that lay weedy in my outer ear and were enough in their mere beauty of phrasing till the time came for them to reveal their whole meaning  in fact they could do this only to later and greater knowledge of myself and others as every one must recognize who recurs in afterlife to a book that he read when young then he finds it twice as full of meaning as it was at first  i could not rest satisfied with maud i sent the same summer to cleveland for the little volume which then held all the poets work and abandoned myself so wholly to it that for a year i read no other verse that i can remember  the volume was the first of that pretty blueand gold series which ticknor  fields began to publish in 1856 and which their imprint so rarely affixed to an unworthy book at once carried far and wide  their modest old brown cloth binding had long been a quiet warrant of quality in the literature it covered and now this splendid blossom of the bookmaking art as it seemed was fitly employed to convey the sweetness and richness of the loveliest poetry that i thought the world had yet known  after an old fashion of mine i read it continuously with frequent recurrences from each new poem to some that had already pleased me and with a most capricious range among the pieces  in memoriam was in that book and the princess i read the princess through and through and over and over but i did not then read in memoriam through and i have never read it in course i am not sure that i have even yet read every part of it  i did not come to the princess either until i had saturated my fancy and my memory with some of the shorter poems with the dream of fair women with the lotuseaters with the millers daughter with the morte darthur with edwin morris or the lake with love and duty and a score of other minor and briefer poems  i read the book night and day indoors and out to myself and to whomever i could make listen  i have no words to tell the rapture it was to me but i hope that in some more articulate being if it should ever be my unmerited fortune to meet that sommo poeta face to face it shall somehow be uttered from me to him and he will understand how completely he became the life of the boy i was then i think it might please or at least amuse that lofty ghost and that he would not resent it as he would probably have done on earth  i can well understand why the homage of his worshippers should have afflicted him here and i could never have been one to burn incense in his earthly presence but perhaps it might be done hereafter without offence i eagerly caught up and treasured every personal word i could find about him and i dwelt in that sort of charmed intimacy with him through his verse in which i could not presume nor he repel and which i had enjoyed in turn with cervantes and shakespeare without a snub from them  i have never ceased to adore tennyson though the rapture of the new convert could not last  that must pass like the flush of any other passion  i think i have now a better sense of his comparative greatness but a better sense of his positive greatness i could not have than i had at the beginning and i believe this is the essential knowledge of a poet  it is very well to say one is greater than keats or not so great as wordsworth that one is or is not of the highest order of poets like shakespeare and dante and goethe but that does not mean anything of value and i never find my account in it  i know it is not possible for any less than the greatest writer to abide lastingly in ones life  some dazzling comer may enter and possess it for a day but he soon wears his welcome out and presently finds the door to be answered with a notat home if he knocks again  but it was only this morning that i read one of the new last poems of tennyson with a return of the emotion which he first woke in me wellnigh forty years ago  there has been no year of those many when i have not read him and loved him with something of the early fire if not all the early conflagration and each successive poem of his has been for me a fresh joy  he went with me into the world from my village when i left it to make my first venture away from home  my father had got one of those legislative clerkships which used to fall sometimes to deserving country editors when their party was in power and we together imagined and carried out a scheme for corresponding with some city newspapers  we were to furnish a daily letter giving an account of the legislative proceedings which i was mainly to write up from material he helped me to get together  the letters at once found favor with the editors who agreed to take them and my father then withdrew from the work altogether after telling them who was doing it  we were afraid they might not care for the reports of a boy of nineteen but they did not seem to take my age into account and i did not boast of my youth among the lawmakers  i looked three or four years older than i was but i experienced a terrible moment once when a fatherly senator asked me my age  i got away somehow without saying but it was a great relief to me when my twentieth birthday came that winter and i could honestly proclaim that i was in my twentyfirst year  i had now the free range of the state library and i drew many sorts of books from it  largely however they were fiction and i read all the novels of bulwer for whom i had already a great liking from the caxtons and my novel  i was dazzled by them and i thought him a great writer if not so great a one as he thought himself  little or nothing of those romances with their swelling prefaces about the poet and his function their glittering criminals and showy rakes and rogues of all kinds and their patrician perfume and social splendor remained with me they may have been better or worse i will not attempt to say if i may call my fascination with them a passion at all i must say that it was but a fitful fever  i also read many volumes of zschokkes admirable tales which i found in a translation in the library and i think i began at the same time to find out de quincey  these authors i recall out of the many that passed through my mind almost as tracelessly as they passed through my hands  i got at some versions of icelandic poems in the metre of hiawatha i had for a while a notion of studying icelandic and i did take out an icelandic grammar and lexicon and decided that i would learn the language later  by this time i must have begun german which i afterwards carried so far with one author at least as to find in him a delight only second to that i had in tennyson but as yet tennyson was all in all to me in poetry  i suspect that i carried his poems about with me a great part of the time i am afraid that i always had that blueandgold tennyson in my pocket and i was ready to draw it upon anybody at the slightest provocation  this is the worst of the ardent lover of literature he wishes to make every one else share his rapture will he nill he  many good fellows suffered from my admiration of this author or that and many more pretty patient maids i wanted to read my favorite passages my favorite poems to them i am afraid i often did read when they would rather have been talking in the case of the poems i did worse i repeated them  this seems rather incredible now but it is true enough and absurd as it is it at least attests my sincerity  it was long before i cured myself of so pestilent a habit and i am not yet so perfectly well of it that i could be safely trusted with a fascinating book and a submissive listener  i dare say i could not have been made to understand at this time that tennyson was not so nearly the first interest of life with other people as he was with me i must often have suspected it but i was helpless against the wish to make them feel him as important to their prosperity and wellbeing as he was to mine  my head was full of him his words were always behind my lips and when i was not repeating his phrase to myself or to some one else i was trying to frame something of my own as like him as i could it was a time of melancholy from illhealth and of anxiety for the future in which i must make my own place in the world  work and hard work i had always been used to and never afraid of but work is by no means the whole story  you may get on without much of it or you may do a great deal and not get on  i was willing to do as much of it as i could get to do but i distrusted my health somewhat and i had many forebodings which my adored poet helped me to transfigure to the substance of literature or enabled me for the time to forget  i was already imitating him in the verse i wrote he now seemed the only worthy model for one who meant to be as great a poet as i did  none of the authors whom i read at all displaced him in my devotion and i could not have believed that any other poet would ever be so much to me  in fact as i have expressed none ever has been     xxiv  heine  that winter passed very quickly and happily for me and at the end of the legislative session i had acquitted myself so much to the satisfaction of one of the newspapers which i wrote for that i was offered a place on it i was asked to be city editor as it was called in that day and i was to have charge of the local reporting  it was a great temptation and for a while i thought it the greatest piece of good fortune  i went down to cincinnati to acquaint myself with the details of the work and to fit myself for it by beginning as reporter myself  one nights round of the police stations with the other reporters satisfied me that i was not meant for that work and i attempted it no farther  i have often been sorry since for it would have made known to me many phases of life that i have always remained ignorant of but i did not know then that life was supremely interesting and important  i fancied that literature that poetry was so and it was humiliation and anguish indescribable to think of myself torn from my high ideals by labors like those of the reporter i would not consent even to do the office work of the department and the proprietor and editor who was more especially my friend tried to make some other place for me  all the departments were full but the one i would have nothing to do with and after a few weeks of sufferance and suffering i turned my back on a thousand dollars a year and for the second time returned to the printingoffice  i was glad to get home for i had been all the time tormented by my old malady of homesickness  but otherwise the situation was not cheerful for me and i now began trying to write something for publication that i could sell  i sent off poems and they came back i offered little translations from the spanish that nobody wanted  at the same time i took up the study of german which i must have already played with at such odd times as i could find  my father knew something of it and that friend of mine among the printers was already reading it and trying to speak it  i had their help with the first steps so far as the recitations from ollendorff were concerned but i was impatient to read german or rather to read one german poet who had seized my fancy from the first line of his i had seen  this poet was heinrich heine who dominated me longer than any one author that i have known  where or when i first acquainted myself with his most fascinating genius i cannot be sure but i think it was in some article of the westminster review where several poems of his were given in english and german and their singular beauty and grace at once possessed my soul  i was in a fever to know more of him and it was my great good luck to fall in with a german in the village who had his books  he was a bookbinder one of those educated artisans whom the revolutions of 1848 sent to us in great numbers  he was a hanoverian and his accent was then i believe the standard though the berlinese is now the accepted pronunciation  but i cared very little for accent my wish was to get at heine with as little delay as possible and i began to cultivate the friendship of that bookbinder in every way  i dare say he was glad of mine for he was otherwise quite alone in the village or had no companionship outside of his own family  i clothed him in all the romantic interest i began to feel for his race and language which new took the place of the spaniards and spanish in my affections  he was a very quick and gay intelligence with more sympathy for my love of our authors humor than for my love of his sentiment and i can remember very well the twinkle of his little sharp black eyes with their tartar slant and the twitching of his keenly pointed sensitive nose when we came to some passage of biting satire or some phrase in which the bitter jew had unpacked all the insult of his soul  we began to read heine together when my vocabulary had to be dug almost word by word out of the dictionary for the bookbinders english was rather scanty at the best and was not literary  as for the grammar i was getting that up as fast as i could from ollendorff and from other sources but i was enjoying heine before i well knew a declension or a conjugation  as soon as my task was done at the office i went home to the books and worked away at them until supper  then my bookbinder and i met in my fathers editorial room and with a couple of candles on the table between us and our heine and the dictionary before us we read till we were both tired out  the candles were tallow and they lopped at different angles in the flat candlesticks heavily loaded with lead which compositors once used it seems to have been summer when our readings began and they are associated in my memory with the smell of the neighboring gardens which came in at the open doors and windows and with the fluttering of moths and the bumbling of the dorbugs that stole in along with the odors i can see the perspiration on the shining forehead of the bookbinder as he looks up from some brilliant passage to exchange a smile of triumph with me at having made out the meaning with the meagre facilities we had for the purpose he had beautiful red pouting lips and a stiff little branching mustache above them that went to the making of his smile sometimes in the truce we made with the text he told a little story of his life at home or some anecdote relevant to our reading or quoted a passage from some other author  it seemed to me the make of a high intellectual banquet and i should be glad if i could enjoy anything as much now  we walked home as far as his house or rather his apartment over one of the village stores and as he mounted to it by an outside staircase we exchanged a joyous gute nacht and i kept on homeward through the dark and silent village street which was really not that street but some other where heine had been some street out of the reisebilder of his knowledge or of his dream  when i reached home it was useless to go to bed  i shut myself into my little study and went over what we had read till my brain was so full of it that when i crept up to my room at last it was to lie down to slumbers which were often a mere phantasmagory of those witching pictures of travel  i was awake at my fathers call in the morning and before my mother had breakfast ready i had recited my lesson in ollendorff to him  to tell the truth i hated those grammatical studies and nothing but the love of literature and the hope of getting at it could ever have made me go through them  naturally i never got any scholarly use of the languages i was worrying at and though i could once write a passable literary german it has all gone from me now except for the purposes of reading it cost me so much trouble however to dig the sense out of the grammar and lexicon as i went on with the authors i was impatient to read that i remember the words very well in all their forms and inflections and i have still what i think i may call a fair german vocabulary  the german of heine when once you are in the joke of his capricious genius is very simple and in his poetry it is simple from the first so that he was perhaps the best author i could have fallen in with if i wanted to go fast rather than far  i found this out later when i attempted other german authors without the glitter of his wit or the lambent glow of his fancy to light me on my hard way  i should find it hard to say just why his peculiar genius had such an absolute fascination for me from the very first and perhaps i had better content myself with saying simply that my literary liberation began with almost the earliest word from him for if he chained me to himself he freed me from all other bondage  i had been at infinite pains from time to time now upon one model and now upon another to literarify myself if i may make a word which does not quite say the thing for me  what i mean is that i had supposed with the sense at times that i was all wrong that the expression of literature must be different from the expression of life that it must be an attitude a pose with something of state or at least of formality in it that it must be this style and not that that it must be like that sort of acting which you know is acting when you see it and never mistake for reality  there are a great many children apparently grownup and largely accepted as critical authorities who are still of this youthful opinion of mine  but heine at once showed me that this ideal of literature was false that the life of literature was from the springs of the best common speech and that the nearer it could be made to conform in voice look and gait to graceful easy picturesque and humorous or impassioned talk the better it was  he did not impart these truths without imparting certain tricks with them which i was careful to imitate as soon as i began to write in his manner that is to say instantly  his tricks he had mostly at second hand and mainly from sterne whom i did not know well enough then to know their origin  but in all essentials he was himself and my final lesson from him or the final effect of all my lessons from him was to find myself and to be for good or evil whatsoever i really was  i kept on writing as much like heine as i could for several years though and for a much longer time than i should have done if i had ever become equally impassioned of any other author  some traces of his method lingered so long in my work that nearly ten years afterwards mr lowell wrote me about something of mine that he had been reading you must sweat the heine out of your bones as men do mercury and his kindness for me would not be content with less than the entire expulsion of the poison that had in its good time saved my life  i dare say it was all well enough not to have it in my bones after it had done its office but it did do its office  it was in some prose sketch of mine that his keen analysis had found the heine but the foreign property had been so prevalent in my earlier work in verse that he kept the first contribution he accepted from me for the atlantic monthly a long time or long enough to make sure that it was not a translation of heine  then he printed it and i am bound to say that the poem now justifies his doubt to me in so much that i do not see why heine should not have had the name of writing it if he had wanted  his potent spirit became immediately so wholly my control as the mediums say that my poems might as well have been communications from him so far as any authority of my own was concerned and they were quite like other inspirations from the other world in being so inferior to the work of the spirit before it had the misfortune to be disembodied and obliged to use a medium  but i do not think that either heine or i had much lasting harm from it and i am sure that the good in my case at least was one that can only end with me  he undid my hands which had taken so much pains to tie behind my back and he forever persuaded me that though it may be ingenious and surprising to dance in chains it is neither pretty nor useful     xxv  de quincey goethe longfellow  another author who was a prime favorite with me about this time was de quincey whose books i took out of the state library one after another until i had read them all  we who were young people of that day thought his style something wonderful and so indeed it was especially in those passages abundant everywhere in his work relating to his own life with an intimacy which was alwaysmore rather than less  his rhetoric there and in certain of his historical studies had a sort of luminous richness without losing its colloquial ease  i keenly enjoyed this subtle spirit and the play of that brilliant intelligence which lighted up so many ways of literature with its lambent glow or its tricksy glimmer and i had a deep sympathy with certain morbid moods and experiences so like my own as i was pleased to fancy  i have not looked at his twelve caesars for twice as many years but i should be greatly surprised to find it other than one of the greatest historical monographs ever written  his literary criticisms seemed to me not only exquisitely humorous but perfectly sane and just and it delighted me to have him personally present with the warmth of his own temperament in regions of cold abstraction i am not sure that i should like that so much now  de quincey was hardly less autobiographical when he wrote of kant or the flight of the crimtartars than when he wrote of his own boyhood or the miseries of the opium habit  he had the hospitable gift of making you at home with him and appealing to your sense of comradery with something of the flattering confidentiality of thackeray but with a wholly different effect  in fact although de quincey was from time to time perfunctorily tory and always a good and faithful british subject he was so eliminated from his time and place by his single love for books that one could be in his company through the whole vast range of his writings and come away without a touch of snobbishness and that is saying a great deal for an english writer  he was a great little creature and through his intense personality he achieved a sort of impersonality so that you loved the man who was forever talkingof himself for his modesty and reticence he left you feeling intimate with him but by no means familiar with all his frailties and with all those freedoms he permitted himself with the lives of his contemporaries he is to me a figure of delicate dignity and winning kindness  i think it a misfortune for the present generation that his books have fallen into a kind of neglect and i believe that they will emerge from it again to the advantage of literature  in spite of heine and tennyson de quincey had a large place in my affections though this was perhaps because he was not a poet for more than those two great poets there was then not much room  i read him the first winter i was at columbus and when i went down from the village the next winter to take up my legislative correspondence again i read him more than ever  but that was destined to be for me a very disheartening time  i had just passed through a rheumatic fever which left my health more broken than before and one morning shortly after i was settled in the capital i woke to find the room going round me like a wheel  it was the beginning of a vertigo which lasted for six months and which i began to fight with various devices and must yield to at last  i tried medicine and exercise but it was useless and my father came to take my letters off my hands while i gave myself some ineffectual respites i made a little journey to my old home in southern ohio but there and everywhere the sure and firmset earth waved and billowed under my feet and i came back to columbus and tried to forget in my work the fact that i was no better  i did not give up trying to read as usual and part of my endeavor that winter was with schiller and uhland and even goethe whose wahlverwandschaften hardly yielded up its mystery to me  to tell the truth i do not think that i found my account in that novel it must needs be a disappointment after wilhelm meister which i had read in english but i dare say my disappointment was largely my own fault i had certainly no right to expect such constant proofs and instances of wisdom in goethe as the unwisdom of his critics had led me to hope for i remember little or nothing of the story which i tried to find very memorable as i held my sick way through it  longfellows miles standish came out that winter and i suspect that i got vastly more real pleasure from that one poem of his than i found in all my german authors put together the adored heine always excepted though certainly i felt the romantic beauty of uhland and was aware of something of schillers generous grandeur  of the american writers longfellow has been most a passion with me as the english and german and spanish and russian writers have been  i am sure that this was largely by mere chance  it was because i happened in such a frame and at such a time to come upon his books that i loved them above those of other men as great  i am perfectly sensible that lowell and emerson outvalue many of the poets and prophets i have given my heart to i have read them with delight and with a deep sense of their greatness and yet they have not been my life like those other those lesser men  but none of the passions are reasoned and i do not try to account for my literary preferences or to justify them  i dragged along through several months of that winter and did my best to carry out that notable scheme of not minding my vertigo  i tried doing halfwork and helping my father with the correspondence but when it appeared that nothing would avail he remained in charge of it till the close of the session and i went home to try what a complete and prolonged rest would do for me  i was not fit for work in the printing office but that was a simpler matter than the literary work that was always tempting me  i could get away from it only by taking my gun and tramping day after day through the deep primeval woods  the fatigue was wholesome and i was so bad a shot that no other creature suffered loss from my gain except one hapless wild pigeon  the thawing snow left the fallen beechnuts of the autumn before uncovered among the dead leaves and the forest was full of the beautiful birds  in most parts of the middle west they are no longer seen except in twos or threes but once they were like the sands of the sea for multitude  it was not now the season when they hid half the heavens with their flight day after day but they were in myriads all through the woods where their iridescent breasts shone like a sudden untimely growth of flowers when you came upon them from the front  when they rose in fright it was like the upward leap of fire and with the roar of flame  i use images which after all are false to the thing i wish to express but they must serve  i tried honestly enough to kill the pigeons but i had no luck or too much till i happened to bring down one of a pair that i found apart from the rest in a softy treetop  the poor creature i had widowed followed me to the verge of the woods as i started home with my prey and i do not care to know more personally the feelings of a murderer than i did then  i tried to shoot the bird but my aim was so bad that i could not do her this mercy and at last she flew away and i saw her no more  the spring was now opening and i was able to keep more and more with nature who was kinder to me than i was to her other children or wished to be and i got the better of my malady which gradually left me for no more reason apparently than it came upon me  but i was still far from well and i was in despair of my future  i began to read again i suppose i had really never altogether stopped  i borrowed from my friend the bookbinder a german novel which had for me a message of lasting cheer  it was the afraja of theodore mugge a story of life in norway during the last century and i remember it as a very lovely story indeed with honest studies of character among the norwegians and a tender pathos in the fate of the little lap heroine gula who was perhaps sufficiently romanced  the hero was a young dane who was going up among the fiords to seek his fortune in the northern fisheries and by a process inevitable in youth i became identified with him so that i adventured and enjoyed and suffered in his person throughout  there was a supreme moment when he was sailing through the fiords and finding himself apparently locked in by their mountain walls without sign or hope of escape but somehow always escaping by some unimagined channel and keeping on  the lesson for him was one of trust and courage and i who seemed to be then shut in upon a mountainwalled fiord without inlet or outlet took the lesson home and promised myself not to lose heart again it seems a little odd that this passage of a book by no means of the greatest should have had such an effect with me at a time when i was no longer so young as to be unduly impressed by what i read but it is true that i have never since found myself in circumstances where there seemed to be no getting forward or going back without a vision of that fiord scenery and then a rise of faith that if i kept on i should somehow come out of my prisoning environment     xxvi  george eliot hawthorne goethe heine  i got back health enough to be of use in the printing office that autumn and i was quietly at work there with no visible break in my surroundings when suddenly the whole world opened to me through what had seemed an impenetrable wall  the republican newspaper at the capital had been bought by a new management and the editorial force reorganized upon a footing of what we then thought metropolitan enterprise and to my great joy and astonishment i was asked to come and take a place in it  the place offered me was not one of lordly distinction in fact it was partly of the character of that i had already rejected in cincinnati but i hoped that in the smaller city its duties would not be so odious and by the time i came to fill it a change had taken place in the arrangements so that i was given charge of the news department  this included the literary notices and the book reviews and i am afraid that i at once gave my prime attention to these  it was an evening paper and i had nearly as much time for reading and study as i had at home  but now society began to claim a share of this leisure which i by no means begrudged it  society was very charming in columbus then with a pretty constant round of dances and suppers and an easy cordiality which i dare say young people still find in it everywhere  i met a great many cultivated people chiefly young ladies and there were several houses where we young fellows went and came almost as freely as if they were our own  there we had music and cards and talk about books and life appeared to me richly worth living if any one had said this was not the best planet in the universe i should have called him a pessimist or at least thought him so for we had not the word in those days  a world in which all those pretty and gracious women dwelt among the figures of the waltz and the lancers with chat between about the last instalment of the newcomes was good enough world for me i was only afraid it was too good  there were of course some girls who did not read but few openly professed indifference to literature and there was much lending of books back and forth and much debate of them  that was the day when adam bede was a new book and in this i had my first knowledge of that great intellect for which i had no passion indeed but always the deepest respect the highest honor and which has from time to time profoundly influenced me by its ethics  i state these things simply and somewhat baldly i might easily refine upon them and study that subtle effect for good and for evil which young people are always receiving from the fiction they read but this its not the time or place for the inquiry and i only wish to own that so far as i understand it the chief part of my ethical experience has been from novels  the life and character i have found portrayed there have appealed always to the consciousness of right and wrong implanted in me and from no one has this appeal been stronger than from george eliot her influence continued through many years and i can question it now only in the undue burden she seems to throw upon the individual and her failure to account largely enough for motive from the social environment there her work seems to me unphilosophical  it shares whatever error there is in its perspective with that of hawthorne whose marble faun was a new book at the same time that adam bede was new and whose books now came into my life and gave it their tinge  he was always dealing with the problem of evil too and i found a more potent charm in his more artistic handling of it than i found in george eliot  of course i then preferred the region of pure romance where he liked to place his action but i did not find his instances the less veritable because they shone out in            the light that never was on sea or land  i read the marble faun first and then the scarlet letter and then the house of seven gables and then the blithedale romance but i always liked best the last which is more nearly a novel and more realistic than the others  they all moved me with a sort of effect such as i had not felt before  they veers so far from time and place that although most of them related to our country and epoch i could not imagine anything approximate from them and hawthorne himself seemed a remote and impalpable agency rather than a person whom one might actually meet as not long afterward happened with me  i did not hold the sort of fancied converse with him that i held with ether authors and i cannot pretend that i had the affection for him that attracted me to them  but he held me by his potent spell and for a time he dominated me as completely as any author i have read  more truly than any other american author he has been a passion with me and lately i heard with a kind of pang a young man saying that he did not believe i should find the scarlet letter bear reading now  i did not assent to the possibility but the notion gave me a shiver of dismay  i thought how much that book had been to me how much all of hawthornes books had been and to have parted with my faith in their perfection would have been something i would not willingly have risked doing  of course there is always something fatally weak in the scheme of the pure romance which after the color of the contemporary mood dies out of it leaves it in danger of tumbling into the dust of allegory and perhaps this inherent weakness was what that bold critic felt in the scarlet letter  but none of hawthornes fables are without a profound and distant reach into the recesses of nature and of being  he came back from his researches with no solution of the question with no message indeed but the awful warning be true be true which is the burden of the scarlet letter yet in all his books there is the hue of thoughts that we think only in the presence of the mysteries of life and death it is not his fault that this is not intelligence that it knots the brow in sorer doubt rather than shapes the lips to utterance of the things that can never be said  some of his shorter stories i have found thin and cold to my later reading and i have never cared much for the house of seven gables but the other day i was reading the blithedale romance again and i found it as potent as significant as sadly and strangely true as when it first enthralled my soul  in those days when i tried to kindle my heart at the cold altar of goethe i did read a great deal of his prose and somewhat of his poetry but it was to be ten years yet before i should go faithfully through with his faust and come to know its power  for the present i read wilhelm meister and the wahlverwandschaften and worshipped him much at secondhand through heine  in the mean time i invested such germans as i met with the halo of their national poetry and there was one lady of whom i heard with awe that she had once known my heine  when i came to meet her over a glass of the mild eggnog which she served at her house on sunday nights and she told me about heine and how he looked and some few things he said i suffered an indescribable disappointment and if i could have been frank with myself i should have owned to a fear that it might have been something like that if i had myself met the poet in the flesh and tried to hold the intimate converse with him that i held in the spirit  but i shut my heart to all such misgivings and went on reading him much more than i read any other german author  i went on writing him too just as i went on reading and writing tennyson  heine was always a personal interest with me and every word of his made me long to have had him say it to me and tell me why he said it  in a poet of alien race and language and religion i found a greater sympathy than i have experienced with any other  perhaps the jews are still the chosen people but now they bear the message of humanity while once they bore the message of divinity  i knew the ugliness of heines nature his revengefulness and malice and cruelty and treachery and uncleanness and yet he was supremely charming among the poets i have read  the tenderness i still feel for him is not a reasoned love i must own but as i am always asking when was love ever reasoned  i had a roommate that winter in columbus who was already a contributor to the atlantic monthly and who read browning as devotedly as i read heine  i will not say that he wrote him as constantly but if that had been so i should not have cared  what i could not endure without pangs of secret jealousy was that he should like heine too and should read him though it was but an armslength in an english version  he had found the origins of those tricks and turns of heines in tristram shandy and the sentimental journey and this galled me as if he had shown that some mistress of my soul had studied her graces from another girl and that it was not all her own hair that she wore  i hid my rancor as well as i could and took what revenge lay in my power by insinuating that he might have a very different view if he read heine in the original  i also made haste to try my own fate with the atlantic and i sent off to mr  lowell that poem which he kept so long in order to make sure that heine had not written it as well as authorized it     xxvii  charles reade  this was the winter when my friend piatt and i made our first literary venture together in those poems of two friends which hardly passed the circle of our amity and it was altogether a time of high literary exaltation with me  i walked the streets of the friendly little city by day and by night with my head so full of rhymes and poetic phrases that it seemed as if their buzzing might have been heard several yards away and i do not yet see quite how i contrived to keep their music out of my newspaper paragraphs  out of the newspaper i could not keep it and from time to time i broke into verse in its columns to the great amusement of the leading editor who knew me for a young man with a very sharp tooth for such selfbetrayals in others  he wanted to print a burlesque review he wrote of the poems of two friends in our paper but i would not suffer it  i must allow that it was very funny and that he was always a generous friend whose wounds would have been as faithful as any that could have been dealt me then  he did not indeed care much for any poetry but that of shakespeare and the ingoldsby legends and when one morning a state senator came into the office with a volume of tennyson and began to read           the poet in a golden clime was born           with golden stars above           dowered with the hate of hate the scorn of scorn           the love of love  he hitched his chair about and started in on his leader for the day  he might have been more patient if he had known that this state senator was to be president garfield  but who could know anything of the tragical history that was so soon to follow that winter of 185960 not i at least i listened rapt by the poet and the reader and it seemed to me as if the making and the reading of poetry were to go on forever and that was to be all there was of it  to be sure i had my hard little journalistic misgivings that it was not quite the thing for a state senator to come round reading tennyson at ten oclock in the morning and i dare say i felt myself superior in my point of view though i could not resist the charm of the verse  i myself did not bring tennyson to the office at that time  i brought thackeray and i remember that one day when i had read half an hour or so in the book of snobs the leading editor said frankly well now he guessed we had had enough of that he apologized afterwards as if he were to blame and not i but i dare say i was a nuisance with my different literary passions and must have made many of my acquaintances very tired of my favorite authors  i had some consciousness of the fact but i could not help it  i ought not to omit from the list of these favorites an author who was then beginning to have his greatest vogue and who somehow just missed of being a very great one  we were all reading his jaunty nervy knowing books and some of us were questioning whether we ought not to set him above thackeray and dickens and george eliot tulli quanti so great was the effect that charles reade had with our generation  he was a man who stood at the parting of the ways between realism and romanticism and if he had been somewhat more of a man he might have been the master of a great school of english realism but as it was he remained content to use the materials of realism and produce the effect of romanticism  he saw that life itself infinitely outvalued anything that could be feigned about it but its richness seemed to corrupt him and he had not the clear ethical conscience which forced george eliot to be realistic when probably her artistic prepossessions were romantic  as yet however there was no reasoning of the matter and charles reade was writing books of tremendous adventure and exaggerated character which he prided himself on deriving from the facts of the world around him  he was intoxicated with the discovery he had made that the truth was beyond invention but he did not know what to do with the truth in art after he had found it in life and to this day the english mostly do not  we young people were easily taken with his glittering error and we read him with much the same fury that he wrote  never too late to mend love me little love me long christie johnstone peg woffington and then later hard cash the cloister and the hearth foul play put yourself in his placehow much they all meant once or seemed to mean  the first of them and the other poems and fictions i was reading meant more to me than the rumors of war that were then filling the air and that so soon became its awful actualities  to us who have our lives so largely in books the material world is always the fable and the ideal the fact  i walked with my feet on the ground but my head was in the clouds as light as any of them  i neither praise nor blame this fact but i feel bound to own it for that time and for every time in my life since the witchery of literature began with me  those two happy winters in columbus when i was finding opportunity and recognition were the heydey of life for me  there has been no time like them since though there have been smiling and prosperous times a plenty for then i was in the blossom of my youth and what i had not i could hope for without unreason for i had so much of that which i had most desired  those times passed and there came other times long years of abeyance and waiting and defeat which i thought would never end but they passed too  i got my appointment of consul to venice and i went home to wait for my passport and to spend the last days so full of civic trouble before i should set out for my post  if i hoped to serve my country there and sweep the confederate cruisers from the adriatic i am afraid my prime intent was to add to her literature and to my own credit  i intended while keeping a sleepless eye out for privateers to write poems concerning american life which should eclipse anything yet done in that kind and in the mean time i read voraciously and perpetually to make the days go swiftly which i should have been so glad to have linger  in this month i devoured all the waverley novels but i must have been devouring a great many others for charles reades christie johnstone is associated with the last moment of the last days  a few months ago i was at the old home and i read that book again after not looking at it for more than thirty years and i read it with amazement at its prevailing artistic vulgarity its prevailing aesthetic error shot here and there with gleams of light and of the truth that reade himself was always dimly groping for  the book is written throughout on the verge of realism with divinations and conjectures across its border and with lapses into the fools paradise of romanticism and an apparent content with its inanity and impossibility but then it was brilliantly new and surprising it seemed to be the last word that could be said for the truth in fiction and it had a spell that held us like an anesthetic above the ache of parting and the anxiety for the years that must pass with all their redoubled chances before our home circle could be made whole again  i read on and the rest listened till the wheels of the old stage made themselves heard in their approach through the absolute silence of the village street  then we shut the book and all went down to the gate together and parted under the pale sky of the october night  there was one of the home group whom i was not to see again the young brother who died in the blossom of his years before i returned from my far and strange sojourn  he was too young then to share our reading of the novel but when i ran up to his room to bid him goodby i found him awake and with aching hearts we bade each other goodby forever     xxviii  dante  i ran through an italian grammar on my way across the atlantic and from my knowledge of latin spanish and french i soon had a reading acquaintance with the language  i had really wanted to go to germany that i might carry forward my studies in german literature and i first applied for the consulate at munich  the powers at washington thought it quite the same thing to offer me rome but i found that the income of the roman consulate would not give me a living and i was forced to decline it  then the presidents private secretaries mr john nicolay and mr john hay who did not know me except as a young westerner who had written poems in the atlantic monthly asked me how i would like venice and promised that they would have the salary put up to a thousand a year under the new law to embarrass privateers  it was really put up to fifteen hundred and with this income assured me i went out to the city whose influence changed the whole course of my literary life  no privateers ever came though i once had notice from turin that the florida had been sighted off ancona and i had nearly four years of nearly uninterrupted leisure at venice which i meant to employ in reading all italian literature and writing a history of the republic the history of course i expected would be a long affair and i did not quite suppose that i could despatch the literature in any short time besides i had several considerable poems on hand that occupied me a good deal and worked at these as well as advanced myself in italian preparatory to the efforts before me  i had already a slight general notion of italian letters from leigh hunt and from other agreeable english italianates and i knew that i wanted to read not only the four great poets dante petrarch ariosto and tasso but that whole group of burlesque poets pulci berni and the rest who from what i knew of them i thought would be even more to my mind  as a matter of fact and in the process of time i did read somewhat of all these but rather in the minor than the major way and i soon went off from them to the study of the modern poets novelists and playwrights who interested me so much more  after my wonted fashion i read half a dozen of these authors together so that it would be hard to say which i began with but i had really a devotion to dante though not at that time or ever for the whole of dante  during my first year in venice i met an ingenious priest who had been a tutor in a patrician family and who was willing to lead my faltering steps through the inferno  this part of the divine comedy i read with a beginners carefulness and with a rapture in its beauties which i will whisper the reader do not appear in every line  again i say it is a great pity that criticism is not honest about the masterpieces of literature and does not confess that they are not every moment masterly that they are often dull and tough and dry as is certainly the case with dantes  some day perhaps we shall have this way of treating literature and then the lover of it will not feel obliged to browbeat himself into the belief that if he is not always enjoying himself it is his own fault  at any rate i will permit myself the luxury of frankly saying that while i had a deep sense of the majesty and grandeur of dantes design many points of its execution bored me and that i found the intermixture of small local fact and neighborhood history in the fabric of his lofty creation no part of its noblest effect  what is marvellous in it is its expression of dantes personality and i can never think that his personalities enhance its greatness as a work of art  i enjoyed them however and i enjoyed them the more as the innumerable perspectives of italian history began to open all about me  then indeed i understood the origins if i did not understand the aims of dante which there is still much dispute about among those who profess to know them clearly  what i finally perceived was that his poem came through him from the heart of italian life such as it was in his time and that whatever it teaches his poem expresses that life in all its splendor and squalor its beauty and deformity its love and its hate  criticism may torment this sense or that sense out of it but at the end of the ends the divine comedy will stand for the patriotism of medieval italy as far as its ethics is concerned and for a profound and lofty ideal of beauty as far as its aesthetics is concerned  this is vague enough and slight enough i must confess but i must confess also that i had not even a conception of so much when i first read the inferno  i went at it very simply and my enjoyment of it was that sort which finds its account in the fine passages the brilliant episodes the striking pictures  this was the effect with me of all the criticism which i had hitherto read and i am not sure yet that the criticism which tries to be of a larger scope and to see things whole is of any definite effect  as a matter of fact we see nothing whole neither life nor art  we are so made in soul and in sense that we can deal only with parts with points with degrees and the endeavor to compass any entirety must involve a discomfort and a danger very threatening to our intellectual integrity  or if this postulate is as untenable as all the others still i am very glad that i did not then lose any fact of the majesty and beauty and pathos of the great certain measures for the sake of that fourth dimension of the poem which is not yet made palpable or visible  i took my sad hearts fill of the sad story of paolo and francesca which i already knew in leigh hunts adorable dilution and most of the lines read themselves into my memory where they linger yet  i supped on the horrors of ugolinos fate with the strong gust of youth which finds every exercise of sympathy a pleasure  my good priest sat beside me in these rich moments knotting in his lap the calico handkerchief of the snufftaker and entering with tremulous eagerness into my joy in things that he had often before enjoyed  no doubt he had an inexhaustible pleasure in them apart from mine for i have found my pleasure in them perennial and have not failed to taste it as often as i have read or repeated any of the great passages of the poem to myself  this pleasure came often from some vital phrase or merely the inspired music of a phrase quite apart from its meaning  i did not get then and i have not got since a distinct conception of the journey through hell and as often as i have tried to understand the topography of the poem i have fatigued myself to no purpose but i do not think the essential meaning was lost upon me  i dare say my priest had his notion of the general shape and purport the gross material body of the thing but he did not trouble me with it while we sat tranced together in the presence of its soul  he seemed at times so lost in the beatific vision that he forgot my stumblings in the philological darkness till i appealed to him for help  then he would read aloud with that magnificent rhythm the italians have in reading their verse and the obscured meaning would seem to shine out of the mere music of the poem like the color the blind feel in sound  i do not know what has become of him but if he is like the rest of the strange group of my guides philosophers and friends in literaturethe printer the organbuilder the machinist the drugclerk and the bookbinderi am afraid he is dead  in fact i who was then i might be said to be dead too so little is my past self like my present self in anything but the increasing purpose which has kept me one in my love of literature  he was a gentle and kindly man with a life and a longing quite apart from his vocation which were never lived or fulfilled i did not see him after he ceased to read dante with me and in fact i was instructed by the suspicions of my italian friends to be careful how i consorted with a priest who might very well be an austrian spy i parted with him for no such picturesque reason for i never believed him other than the truest and faithfulest of friends but because i was then giving myself more entirely to work in which he could not help me  naturally enough this was a long poem in the terza rima of the divina commedia and dealing with a story of our civil war in a fashion so remote that no editor would print it  this was the first fruits and the last of my reading of dante in verse and it was not so like dante as i would have liked to make it but dante is not easy to imitate he is too unconscious and too single too bent upon saying the thing that is in him with whatever beauty inheres in it to put on the graces that others may catch     xxix  goldoni manzoni dazeglio  however this poem only shared the fate of nearly all the others that i wrote at this time they came back to me with unfailing regularity from all the magazine editors of the englishspeaking world i had no success with any of them till i sent mr lowell a paper on recent italian comedy for the north american review which he and professor norton had then begun to edit  i was in the mean time printing the material of venetian life and the italian journeys in a boston newspaper after its rejection by the magazines and my literary life almost without my willing it had taken the course of critical observance of books and men in their actuality  that is to say i was studying manners in the elder sense of the word wherever i could get at them in the frank life of the people about me and in such literature of italy as was then modern  in this pursuit i made a discovery that greatly interested me and that specialized my inquiries  i found that the italians had no novels which treated of their contemporary life that they had no modern fiction but the historical romance  i found that if i wished to know their life from their literature i must go to their drama which was even then endeavoring to give their stage a faithful picture of their civilization  there was even then in the new circumstance of a people just liberated from every variety of intellectual repression and political oppression a group of dramatic authors whose plays were not only delightful to see but delightful to read working in the good tradition of one of the greatest realists who has ever lived and producing a drama of vital strength and charm  one of them whom i by no means thought the best has given us a play known to all the world which i am almost ready to think with zola is the greatest play of modern times or if it is not so i should be puzzled to name the modern drama that surpasses la morte civile of paolo giacometti  i learned to know all the dramatists pretty well in the whole range of their work on the stage and in the closet and i learned to know still better and to love supremely the fine amiable genius whom as one of them said they did not so much imitate as learn from to imitate nature  this was carlo goldoni one of the first of the realists but antedating conscious realism so long as to have been born at venice early in the eighteenth century and to have come to his handtohand fight with the romanticism of his day almost before that century had reached its noon in the early sixties of our own century i was no more conscious of his realism than he was himself a hundred years before but i had eyes in my head and i saw that what he had seen in venice so long before was so true that it was the very life of venice in my own day and because i have loved the truth in art above all other things i fell instantly and lastingly in love with carlo goldoni  i was reading his memoirs and learning to know his sweet honest simple nature while i was learning to know his work and i wish that every one who reads his plays would read his life as well one must know him before one can fully know them  i believe in fact that his autobiography came into my hands first  but at any rate both are associated with the fervors and languors of that first summer in venice so that i cannot now take up a book of goldonis without a renewed sense of that sunlight and moonlight and of the sounds and silences of a city that is at once the stillest and shrillest in the world  perhaps because i never found his work of great ethical or aesthetical proportions but recognized that it pretended to be good only within its strict limitations i recur to it now without that painful feeling of a diminished grandeur in it which attends us so often when we go back to something that once greatly pleased us  it seemed to me at the time that i must have read all his comedies in venice but i kept reading new ones after i came home and still i can take a volume of his from the shelf and when thirty years are past find a play or two that i missed before their number is very great but perhaps those that i fancy i have not read i have really read once or more and forgotten  that might very easily be for there is seldom anything more poignant in any one of them than there is in the average course of things  the plays are light and amusing transcripts from life for the most part and where at times they deepen into powerful situations or express strong emotions they do so with persons so little different from the average of our acquaintance that we do not remember just who the persons are  there is no doubt but the kindly playwright had his conscience and meant to make people think as well as laugh  i know of none of his plays that is of wrong effect or that violates the instincts of purity or insults common sense with the romantic pretence that wrong will be right if you will only paint it rosecolor  he is at some obvious pains to punish vice and reward virtue but i do not mean that easy morality when i praise his i mean the more difficult sort that recognizes in each mans soul the arbiter not of his fate surely but surely of his peace  he never makes a fool of the spectator by feigning that passion is a reason or justification or that suffering of one kind can atone for wrong of another  that was left for the romanticists of our own century to discover even the romanticists whom goldoni drove from the stage were of that simpler eighteenthcentury sort who had not yet liberated the individual from society but held him accountable in the old way  as for goldoni himself he apparently never dreams of transgression he is of rather an explicit conventionality in most things and he deals with society as something finally settled  how artfully he deals with it how decently how wholesomely those who know venetian society of the eighteenth century historically will perceive when they recall the adequate impression he gives of it without offence in character or language or situation  this is the perpetual miracle of his comedy that it says so much to experience and worldly wisdom and so little to inexperience and worldly innocence  no doubt the serenest republic was very strict with the theatre and suffered it to hold the mirror up to nature only when nature was behaving well or at least behaving as if young people were present  yet the italians are rather plainspoken and they recognize facts which our company manners at least do not admit the existence of  i should say that goldoni was almost english almost american indeed in his observance of the proprieties and i like this in him though the proprieties are not virtues they are very good things and at least are better than the improprieties  this however i must own had not a great deal to do with my liking him so much and i should be puzzled to account for my passion as much in his case as in most others  if there was any reason for it perhaps it was that he had the power of taking me out of my life and putting me into the lives of others whom i felt to be human beings as much as myself  to make one live in others this is the highest effect of religion as well as of art and possibly it will be the highest bliss we shall ever know  i do not pretend that my translation was through my unselfishness it was distinctly through that selfishness which perceives that self is misery and i may as well confess here that i do not regard the artistic ecstasy as in any sort noble  it is not noble to love the beautiful or to live for it or by it and it may even not be refining i would not have any reader of mine looking forward to some aesthetic career suppose that this love is any merit in itself it may be the grossest egotism  if you cannot look beyond the end you aim at and seek the good which is not your own all your sacrifice is to yourself and not of yourself and you might as well be going into business  in itself and for itself it is no more honorable to win fame than to make money and the wish to do the one is no more elevating than the wish to do the other  but in the days i write of i had no conception of this and i am sure that my blindness to so plain a fact kept me even from seeking and knowing the highest beauty in the things i worshipped  i believe that if i had been sensible of it i should hays read much more of such humane italian poets and novelists as manzoni and dazeglio whom i perceived to be delightful without dreaming of them in the length and breadth of their goodness  now and then its extent flashed upon me but the glimpse was lost to my retroverted vision almost as soon as won  it is only in thinking back to there that i can realize how much they might always have meant to me  they were both living in my time in italy and they were two men whom i should now like very much to have seen if i could have done so without that futility which seems to attend every effort to pay ones duty to such men  the love of country in all the italian poets and romancers of the long period of the national resurrection ennobled their art in a measure which criticism has not yet taken account of  i conceived of its effect then but i conceived of it as a misfortune a fatality now i am by no means sure that it was so hereafter the creation of beauty as we call it for beautys sake may be considered something monstrous  there is forever a poignant meaning in life beyond what mere living involves and why should not there be this reference in art to the ends beyond art the situation the long patience the hope against hope dignified and beautified the nature of the italian writers of that day and evoked from them a quality which i was too little trained in their school to appreciate  but in a sort i did feel it i did know it in them all so far as i knew any of them and in the tragedies of manzoni and in the romances of dazeglio and yet more in the simple and modest records of dazeglios life published after his death i profited by it and unconsciously prepared myself for that point of view whence all the arts appear one with all the uses and there is nothing beautiful that is false  i am very glad of that experience of italian literature which i look back upon as altogether wholesome and sanative after my excesses of heine  no doubt it was all a minor affair as compared with equal knowledge of french literature and so far it was a loss of time  it is idle to dispute the general positions of criticism and there is no useful gainsaying its judgment that french literature is a major literature and italian a minor literature in this century but whether this verdict will stand for all time there may be a reasonable doubt criterions may change and hereafter people may look at the whole affair so differently that a literature which went to the making of a people will not be accounted a minor literature but will take its place with the great literary movements  i do not insist upon this possibility and i am far from defending myself for liking the comedies of goldoni better than the comedies of moliere upon purely aesthetic grounds where there is no question as to the artistic quality  perhaps it is because i came to molieres comedies later and with my taste formed for those of goldoni but again it is here a matter of affection i find goldoni for me more sympathetic and because he is more sympathetic i cannot do otherwise than find him more natural more true  i will allow that this is vulnerable and as i say i do not defend it  moliere has a place in literature infinitely loftier than goldonis and he has supplied types characters phrases to the currency of thought and goldoni has supplied none  it is therefore without reason which i can allege that i enjoy goldoni more  i am perfectly willing to be rated low for my preference and yet i think that if it had been goldonis luck to have had the great age of a mighty monarchy for his scene instead of the decline of an outworn republic his place in literature might have been different     xxx  pastor fido aminta romola yeast paul ferroll  i have always had a great love for the absolutely unreal the purely fanciful in all the arts as well as of the absolutely real i like the one on a far lower plane than the other but it delights me as a pantomime at a theatre does or a comic opera which has its being wholly outside the realm of the probabilities  when i once transport myself to this sphere i have no longer any care for them and if i could i would not exact of them an allegiance which has no concern with them  for this reason i have always vastly enjoyed the artificialities of pastoral poetry and in venice i read with a pleasure few serious poems have given me the pastor fido of guarini  i came later but not with fainter zest to the aminta of tasso without which perhaps the pastor fido would not have been and i revelled in the pretty impossibilities of both these charming effects of the liberated imagination  i do not the least condemn that sort of thing one does not live by sweets unless one is willing to spoil ones digestion but one may now and then indulge ones self without harm and a sugarplum or two after dinner may even be of advantage  what i object to is the romantic thing which asks to be accepted with all its fantasticality on the ground of reality that seems to me hopelessly bad  but i have been able to dwell in their charming outland or noland with the shepherds and shepherdesses and nymphs satyrs and fauns of tasso and guarini and i take the finest pleasure in their company their dresden china loves and sorrows their airy raptures their painless throes their polite anguish their tears not the least salt but flowing as sweet as the purling streams of their enamelled meadows  i wish there were more of that sort of writing i should like very much to read it  the greater part of my reading in venice when i began to find that i could not help writing about the place was in books relating to its life and history which i made use of rather than found pleasure in  my studies in italian literature were full of the most charming interest and if i had to read a good many books for conscience sake there were a good many others i read for their own sake  they were chiefly poetry and after the first essays in which i tasted the classic poets they were chiefly the books of the modern poets  for the present i went no farther in german literature and i recurred to it in later years only for deeper and fuller knowledge of heine my spanish was ignored as all first loves are when one has reached the age of twentysix  my english reading was almost wholly in the tauchnitz editions for otherwise english books were not easily come at then and there  george eliots romola was then new and i read it again and again with the sense of moral enlargement which the first fiction to conceive of the true nature of evil gave all of us who were young in that day  tito malema was not only a lesson he was a revelation and i trembled before him as in the presence of a warning and a message from the only veritable perdition  his life in which so much that was good was mixed with so much that was bad lighted up the whole domain of egotism with its glare and made one feel how near the best and the worst were to each other and how they sometimes touched without absolute division in texture and color  the book was undoubtedly a favorite of mine and i did not see then the artistic falterings in it which were afterwards evident to me  there were not romolas to read all the time though and i had to devolve upon inferior authors for my fiction the greater part of the time  of course i kept up with our mutual friend which dickens was then writing and with philip which was to be the last of thackeray  i was not yet sufficiently instructed to appreciate trollope and i did not read him at all  i got hold of kingsley and read yeast and i think some other novels of his with great relish and without sensibility to his charles readeish lapses from his art into the material of his art  but of all the minor fiction that i read at this time none impressed me so much as three books which had then already had their vogue and which i knew somewhat from reviews  they were paul ferroll why paul ferroll killed his wife and day after day  the first two were of course related to each other and they were all three full of unwholesome force  as to their aesthetic merit i will not say anything for i have not looked at either of the books for thirty years  i fancy however that their strength was rather of the tetanic than the titanic sort  they made your sympathies go with the hero who deliberately puts his wife to death for the lie she told to break off his marriage with the woman he had loved and who then marries this tender and gentle girl and lives in great happiness with her till her death  murder in the first degree is flattered by his fate up to the point of letting him die peacefully in boston after these dealings of his in england and altogether his story could not be commended to people with a morbid taste for bloodshed naturally enough the books were written by a perfectly good woman the wife of an english clergyman whose friends were greatly scandalized by them  as a sort of atonement she wrote day after day the story of a dismal and joyless orphan who dies to the sound of angelic music faint and farheard filling the whole chamber  a carefuller study of the phenomenon reveals the fact that the seraphic strains are produced by the steam escaping from the hotwater bottles at the feet of the invalid  as usual i am not able fully to account for my liking of these books and i am so far from wishing to justify it that i think i ought rather to excuse it  but since i was really greatly fascinated with them and read them with an evergrowing fascination the only honest thing to do is to own my subjection to them  it would be an interesting and important question for criticism to study that question why certain books at a certain time greatly dominate our fancy and others manifestly better have no influence with us  a curious proof of the subtlety of these paul ferroll books in the appeal they made to the imagination is the fact that i came to them fresh from romolo and full of horror for myself in tito yet i sympathized throughout with paul ferroll and was glad when he got away     xxxi  erckmannchatrian bjorstjerne bjornson  on my return to america my literary life immediately took such form that most of my reading was done for review  i wrote at first a good many of the lighter criticisms in the nation at new york and after i went to boston to become the assistant editor of the atlantic monthly i wrote the literary notices in that periodical for four or five years  it was only when i came into full charge of the magazine that i began to share these labors with others and i continued them in some measure as long as i had any relation to it  my reading for readings sake as i had hitherto done it was at an end and i read primarily for the sake of writing about the book in hand and secondarily for the pleasure it might give me  this was always considerable and sometimes so great that i forgot the critic in it and read on and on for pleasure  i was master to review this book or that as i chose and generally i reviewed only books i liked to read though sometimes i felt that i ought to do a book and did it from a sense of duty these perfunctory criticisms i do not think were very useful but i tried to make them honest  in a long sickness which i had shortly after i went to live in cambridge a friend brought me several of the stories of erckmann chatrian whom people were then reading much more than they are now i believe and i had a great joy in them which i have renewed since as often as i have read one of their books  they have much the same quality of simple and sincerely moralized realism that i found afterwards in the work of the early swiss realist jeremias gotthelf and very likely it was this that captivated my judgment  as for my affections battered and exhausted as they ought to have been in many literary passions they never went out with fresher enjoyment than they did to the charming story of lami fritz which when i merely name it breathes the spring sun and air about me and fills my senses with the beauty and sweetness of cherry blossoms  it is one of the loveliest and kindest books that ever was written and my heart belongs to it still to be sure it belongs to several hundreds of other books in equal entirety  it belongs to all the books of the great norwegian bjorstjerne bjornson whose arne and whose happy boy and whose fisher maiden i read in this same fortunate sickness  i have since read every other book of his that i could lay hands on sinnove solbakken and magnhild and captain manzanca and dust and in gods ways and sigurd and plays like the glove and the bankrupt  he has never as some authors have dwindled in my sense when i open his page there i find him as large and free and bold as ever  he is a great talent a clear conscience a beautiful art  he has my love not only because he is a poet of the most exquisite verity but because he is a lover of men with a faith in them such as can move mountains of ignorance and dulness and greed  he is next to tolstoy in his willingness to give himself for his kind if he would rather give himself in fighting than in suffering wrong i do not know that his selfsacrifice is less in degree  i confess however that i do not think of him as a patriot and a socialist when i read him he is then purely a poet whose gift holds me rapt above the world where i have left my troublesome and wearisome self for the time  i do not know of any novels that a young endeavorer in fiction could more profitably read than his for their large and simple method their trust of the readers intelligence their sympathy with life  with him the problems are all soluble by the enlightened and regenerate will there is no baffling fate but a helping god  in bjornson there is nothing of ibsens scornful despair nothing of his anarchistic contempt but his art is full of the warmth and color of a poetic soul with no touch of the icy cynicism which freezes you in the other  i have felt the cold fascination of ibsen too and i should be far from denying his mighty mastery but he has never possessed me with the delight that bjornson has  in those days i read not only all the new books but i made many forays into the past and came back now and then with rich spoil though i confess that for the most part i had my trouble for my pains and i wish now that i had given the time i spent on the english classics to contemporary literature which i have not the least hesitation in saying i like vastly better  in fact i believe that the preference for the literature of the past except in the case of the greatest masters is mainly the affectation of people who cannot otherwise distinguish themselves from the herd and who wish very much to do so  there is much to be learned from the minor novelists and poets of the past about peoples ways of thinking and feeling but not much that the masters do not give you in better quality and fuller measure and i should say read the old masters and let their schools go rather than neglect any possible master of your own time  above all i would not have any one read an old author merely that he might not be ignorant of him that is most beggarly and no good can come of it  when literature becomes a duty it ceases to be a passion and all the schoolmastering in the world solemnly addressed to the conscience cannot make the fact otherwise  it is well to read for the sake of knowing a certain ground if you are to make use of your knowledge in a certain way but it would be a mistake to suppose that this is a love of literature     xxxii  tourguenief auerbach  in those years at cambridge my most notable literary experience without doubt was the knowledge of tourgueniefs novels which began to be recognized in all their greatness about the middle seventies  i think they made their way with such of our public as were able to appreciate them before they were accepted in england but that does not matter  it is enough for the present purpose that smoke and lisa and on the eve and dimitri roudine and spring floods passed one after another through my hands and that i formed for their author one of the profoundest literary passions of my life  i now think that there is a finer and truer method than his but in its way tourgueniefs method is as far as art can go  that is to say his fiction is to the last degree dramatic  the persons are sparely described and briefly accounted for and then they are left to transact their affair whatever it is with the least possible comment or explanation from the author  the effect flows naturally from their characters and when they have done or said a thing you conjecture why as unerringly as you would if they were people whom you knew outside of a book  i had already conceived of the possibility of this from bjornson who practises the same method but i was still too sunken in the gross darkness of english fiction to rise to a full consciousness of its excellence  when i remembered the deliberate and impertinent moralizing of thackeray the clumsy exegesis of george eliot the knowing nods and winks of charles reade the stagecarpentering and limelighting of dickens even the fine and important analysis of hawthorne it was with a joyful astonishment that i realized the great art of tourguenief  here was a master who was apparently not trying to work out a plot who was not even trying to work out a character but was standing aside from the whole affair and letting the characters work the plot out  the method was revealed perfectly in smoke but each successive book of his that i read was a fresh proof of its truth a revelation of its transcendent superiority  i think now that i exaggerated its value somewhat but this was inevitable in the first surprise  the sane aesthetics of the first russian author i read however have seemed more and more an essential part of the sane ethics of all the russians i have read  it was not only that tourguenief had painted life truly but that he had painted it conscientiously  tourguenief was of that great race which has more than any other fully and freely uttered human nature without either false pride or false shame in its nakedness  his themes were oftenest those of the french novelist but how far he was from handling them in the french manner and with the french spirit  in his hands sin suffered no dramatic punishment it did not always show itself as unhappiness in the personal sense but it was always unrest and without the hope of peace  if the end did not appear the fact that it must be miserable always appeared life showed itself to me in different colors after i had once read tourguenief it became more serious more awful and with mystical responsibilities i had not known before  my gay american horizons were bathed in the vast melancholy of the slav patient agnostic trustful at the same time nature revealed herself to me through him with an intimacy she had not hitherto shown me  there are passages in this wonderful writer alive with a truth that seems drawn from the readers own knowledge who else but tourguenief and ones own most secret self ever felt all the rich sad meaning of the night air drawing in at the open window of the fires burning in the darkness on the distant fields i try in vain to give some notion of the subtle sympathy with nature which scarcely put itself into words with him  as for the people of his fiction though they were of orders and civilizations so remote from my experience they were of the eternal human types whose origin and potentialities every one may find in his own heart and i felt their verity in every touch  i cannot describe the satisfaction his work gave me i can only impart some sense of it perhaps by saying that it was like a happiness i had been waiting for all my life and now that it had come i was richly content forever  i do not mean to say that the art of tourguenief surpasses the art of bjornson i think bjornson is quite as fine and true  but the norwegian deals with simple and primitive circumstances for the most part and always with a small world and the russian has to do with human nature inside of its conventional shells and his scene is often as large as europe  even when it is as remote as norway it is still related to the great capitals by the history if not the actuality of the characters  most of tourgueniefs books i have read many times over all of them i have read more than twice  for a number of years i read them again and again without much caring for other fiction  it was only the other day that i read smoke through once more with no diminished sense of its truth but with somewhat less than my first satisfaction in its art  perhaps this was because i had reached the point through my acquaintance with tolstoy where i was impatient even of the artifice that hid itself  in smoke i was now aware of an artifice that kept out of sight but was still always present somewhere invisibly operating the story  i must not fail to own the great pleasure that i have had in some of the stories of auerbach  it is true that i have never cared greatly for on the heights which in its dealing with royalties seems too far aloof from the ordinary human life and which on the moral side finally fades out into a german mistiness  but i speak of it with the imperfect knowledge of one who was never able to read it quite through and i have really no right to speak of it  the book of his that pleased me most was edelweiss which though the story was somewhat too catastrophical seemed to me admirably good and true  i still think it very delicately done and with a deep insight but there is something in all auerbachs work which in the retrospect affects me as if it dealt with pigmies      xxxiii  certain preferences and experiences  i have always loved history whether in the annals of peoples or in the lives of persons and i have at all times read it  i am not sure but i rather prefer it to fiction though i am aware that in looking back over this record of my literary passions i must seem to have cared for very little besides fiction  i read at the time i have just been speaking of nearly all the new poetry as it came out and i constantly recurred to it in its mossier sources where it sprang from the green english ground or trickled from the antique urns of italy  i do not think that i have ever cared much for metaphysics or to read much in that way but from time to time i have done something of it  travels of course i have read as part of the great human story and autobiography has at times appeared to me the most delightful reading in the world i have a taste in it that rejects nothing though i have never enjoyed any autobiographies so much as those of such italians as have reasoned of themselves  i suppose i have not been a great reader of the drama and i do not know that i have ever greatly relished any plays but those of shakespeare and goldoni and two or three of beaumont and fletcher and one or so of marlows and all of ibsens and maeterlincks  the taste for the old english dramatists i believe i have never formed  criticism ever since i filled myself so full of it in my boyhood i have not cared for and often i have found it repulsive  i have a fondness for books of popular science perhaps because they too are part of the human story  i have read somewhat of the theology of the swedenborgian faith i was brought up in but i have not read other theological works and i do not apologize for not liking any  the bible itself was not much known to me at an age when most children have been obliged to read it several times over the gospels were indeed familiar and they have always been to me the supreme human story but the rest of the new testament i had not read when a man grown and only passages of the old testament like the story of the creation and the story of joseph and the poems of job and ecclesiastes with occasional psalms  i therefore came to the scriptures with a sense at once fresh and mature and i can never be too glad that i learned to see them under the vaster horizon and in the truer perspectives of experience  again as lights on the human story i have liked to read such books of medicine as have fallen in my way and i seldom take up a medical periodical without reading of all the cases it describes and in fact every article in it  but i did not mean to make even this slight departure from the main business of these papers which is to confide my literary passions to the reader he probably has had a great many of his own  i think i may class the ring and the book among them though i have never been otherwise a devotee of browning  but i was still newly home from italy or away from home when that poem appeared and whether or not it was because it took me so with the old enchantment of that land i gave my heart promptly to it  of course there are terrible longueurs in it and you do get tired of the same story told over and over from the different points of view and yet it is such a great story and unfolded with such a magnificent breadth and noble fulness that one who blames it lightly blames himself heavily  there are certain books of itcaponsacchis story pompilias story and count guidos storythat i think ought to rank with the greatest poetry ever written and that have a direct dramatic expression of the fact and character which is without rival  there is a noble and lofty pathos in the close of caponsacchis statement an artless and manly break from his selfcontrol throughout that seems to me the last possible effect in its kind and pompilias story holds all of womanhood in it the purity the passion the tenderness the helplessness  but if i begin to praise this or any of the things i have liked i do not know when i should stop  yes as i think it over the ring and the book appears to me one of the great few poems whose splendor can never suffer lasting eclipse however it may have presently fallen into abeyance  if it had impossibly come down to us from some elder time or had not been so perfectly modern in its recognition of feeling and motives ignored by the less conscious poetry of the past it might be ranked with the great epics  of other modern poets i have read some things of william morris like the life and death of jason the story of gudrun and the trial of guinevere with a pleasure little less than passionate and i have equally liked certain pieces of dante rossetti  i have had a high joy in some of the great minor poems of emerson where the goddess moves over concord meadows with a gait that is greek and her sandalled tread expresses a high scorn of the indiarubber boots that the american muse so often gets about in  the commemoration ode of lowell has also been a source from which i drank something of the divine ecstasy of the poets own exalted mood and i would set this level with the biglow papers high above all his other work and chief of the things this age of our country shall be remembered by  holmes i always loved and not for his wit alone which is so obvious to liking but for those rarer and richer strains of his in which he shows himself the lover of nature and the brother of men  the deep spiritual insight the celestial music and the brooding tenderness of whittier have always taken me more than his fierier appeals and his civic virtues though i do not underrate the value of these in his verse  my acquaintance with these modern poets and many i do not name because they are so many has been continuous with their work and my pleasure in it not inconstant if not equal  i have spoken before of longfellow as one of my first passions and i have never ceased to delight in him but some of the very newest and youngest of our poets have given me thrills of happiness for which life has become lastingly sweeter   long after i had thought never to read itin fact when i was nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vitai read miltons paradise lost and found in it a majestic beauty that justified to me the fame it wears and eclipsed the worth of those lesser poems which i had ignorantly accounted his worthiest  in fact it was one of the literary passions of the time i speak of and it shared my devotion for the novels of tourguenief and shall i own it the romances of cherbuliez  after all it is best to be honest and if it is not best it is at least easiest it involves the fewest embarrassing consequences and if i confess the spell that the revenge of joseph noirel cast upon me for a time perhaps i shall be able to whisper the reader behind my hand that i have never yet read the aeneid of virgil the georgics yes but the aeneid no  some time however i expect to read it and to like it immensely  that is often the case with things that i have held aloof from indefinitely  one fact of my experience which the reader may find interesting is that when i am writing steadily i have little relish for reading  i fancy that reading is not merely a pastime when it is apparently the merest pastime but that a certain measure of mindstuff is used up in it and that if you are using up all the mind stuff you have much or little in some other way you do not read because you have not the mindstuff for it  at any rate it is in this sort only that i can account for my failure to read a great deal during four years of the amplest quiet that i spent in the country at belmont whither we removed from cambridge i had promised myself that in this quiet now that i had given up reviewing and wrote little or nothing in the magazine but my stories i should again read purely for the pleasure of it as i had in the early days before the critical purpose had qualified it with a bitter alloy but i found that not being forced to read a number of books each month so that i might write about them i did not read at all comparatively speaking  to be sure i dawdled over a great many books that i had read before and a number of memoirs and biographies but i had no intense pleasure from reading in that time and have no passions to record of it it may have been a period when no new thing happened in literature deeply to stir ones interest i only state the fact concerning myself and suggest the most plausible theory i can think of  i wish also to note another incident which may or may not have its psychological value  an important event of these years was a long sickness which kept me helpless some seven or eight weeks when i was forced to read in order to pass the intolerable time  but in this misery i found that i could not read anything of a dramatic cast whether in the form of plays or of novels  the mere sight of the printed page broken up in dialogue was anguish  yet it was not the excitement of the fiction that i dreaded for i consumed great numbers of narratives of travel and was not in the least troubled by hairbreadth escapes or shipwrecks or perils from wild beasts or deadly serpents it was the dramatic effect contrived by the playwright or novelist and worked up to in the speech of his characters that i could not bear  i found a like impossible stress from the sunday newspaper which a mistaken friend sent in to me and which with its scareheadings and artfully wrought sensations had the effect of fiction as in fact it largely was  at the end of four years we went abroad again and travel took away the appetite for reading as completely as writing did  i recall nothing read in that year in europe which moved me and i think i read very little except the local histories of the tuscan cities which i afterwards wrote of     xxxiv  valdes galdos verga zola trollope hardy  in fact it was not till i returned and took up my life again in boston in the old atmosphere of work that i turned once more to books  even then i had to wait for the time when i undertook a critical department in one of the magazines before i felt the rise of the old enthusiasm for an author  that is to say i had to begin reading for business again before i began reading for pleasure  one of the first great pleasures which i had upon these terms was in the book of a contemporary spanish author this was the marta y maria of armando palacio valdes a novelist who delights me beyond words by his friendly and abundant humor his feeling for character and his subtle insight  i like every one of his books that i have read and i believe that i have read nearly every one that he has written  as i mention riverito maximina un idilio de un inferno la hermana de san sulpizio el cuarto poder espuma the mere names conjure up the scenes and events that have moved me to tears and laughter and filled me with a vivid sense of the life portrayed in them i think the marta y maria one of the most truthful and profound fictions i have read and maximina one of the most pathetic and la hermana de san sulpizio one of the most amusing  fortunately these books of valdess have nearly all been translated and the reader may test the matter in english though it necessarily halts somewhat behind the spanish  i do not know whether the spaniards themselves rank valdes with galdos or not and i have no wish to decide upon their relative merits  they are both present passions of mine and i may say of the dona perfecta of galdos that no book if i except those of the greatest russians has given me a keener and deeper impression it is infinitely pathetic and is full of humor which if more caustic than that of valdes is not less delicious  but i like all the books of galdos that i have read and though he seems to have worked more tardily out of his romanticism than valdes since be has worked finally into such realism as that of leon roch his greatness leaves nothing to be desired  i have read one of the books of emilia pardobazan called morrina which must rank her with the great realists of her country and age she too has that humor of her race which brings us nearer the spanish than any other nonanglosaxon people  a contemporary italian whom i like hardly less than these noble spaniards is giovanni verga who wrote i malavoglia or as we call it in english the house by the medlar tree a story of infinite beauty tenderness and truth  as i have said before i think with zola that giacometti the italian author of la morte civile has written almost the greatest play all round of modern times  but what shall i say of zola himself and my admiration of his epic greatness  about his material there is no disputing among people of our puritanic tradition  it is simply abhorrent but when you have once granted him his material for his own use it is idle and foolish to deny his power  every literary theory of mine was contrary to him when i took up lassommoir though unconsciously i had always been as much of a realist as i could but the book possessed me with the same fascination that i felt the other day in reading his largent  the critics know now that zola is not the realist he used to fancy himself and he is full of the best qualities of the romanticism he has hated so much but for what he is there is but one novelist of our time or of any that outmasters him and that is tolstoy  for my own part i think that the books of zola are not immoral but they are indecent through the facts that they nakedly represent they are infinitely more moral than the books of any other french novelist  this may not be saying a great deal but it is saying the truth and i do not mind owning that he has been one of my great literary passions almost as great as flaubert and greater than daudet or maupassant though i have profoundly appreciated the exquisite artistry of both these  no french writer however has moved me so much as the spanish for the french are wanting in the humor which endears these and is the quintessence of their charm  you cannot be at perfect ease with a friend who does not joke and i suppose this is what deprived me of a final satisfaction in the company of anthony trollope who jokes heavily or not at all and whom i should otherwise make bold to declare the greatest of english novelists as it is i must put before him jane austen whose books late in life have been a youthful rapture with me  even without much humor trollopes books have been a vast pleasure to me through their simple truthfulness perhaps if they were more humorous they would not be so true to the british life and character present in them in the whole length and breadth of its expansive commonplaceness  it is their serious fidelity which gives them a value unique in literature and which if it were carefully analyzed would afford a principle of the same quality in an author who was undoubtedly one of the finest of artists as well as the most philistine of men  i came rather late but i came with all the ardor of what seems my perennial literary youth to the love of thomas hardy whom i first knew in his story a pair of blue eyes  as usual after i had read this book and felt the new charm in it i wished to read the books of no other author and to read his books over and over  i love even the faults of hardy i will let him play me any trick he chooses and he is not above playing tricks when he seems to get tired of his story or perplexed with it if only he will go on making his peasants talk and his rather uncertain ladies get in and out of love and serve themselves of every chance that fortune offers them of having their own way  we shrink from the unmorality of the latin races but hardy has divined in the heart of our own race a lingering heathenism which if not greek has certainly been no more baptized than the neohellenism of the parisians  his heroines especially exemplify it and i should be safe in saying that his ethelbertas his eustacias his elfridas his bathshebas his fancies are wholly pagan  i should not dare to ask how much of their charm came from that fact and the author does not fail to show you how much harm so that it is not on my conscience  his people live very close to the heart of nature and no one unless it is tourguenief gives you a richer and sweeter sense of her unity with human nature  hardy is a great poet as well as a great humorist and if he were not a great artist also his humor would be enough to endear him to me     xxxv  tolstoy  i come now though not quite in the order of time to the noblest of all these enthusiasmsnamely my devotion for the writings of lyof tolstoy i should wish to speak of him with his own incomparable truth yet i do not know how to give a notion of his influence without the effect of exaggeration  as much as one merely human being can help another i believe that he has helped me he has not influenced me in aesthetics only but in ethics too so that i can never again see life in the way i saw it before i knew him tolstoy awakens in his reader the will to be a man not effectively not spectacularly but simply really  he leads you back to the only true ideal away from that false standard of the gentleman to the man who sought not to be distinguished from other men but identified with them to that presence in which the finest gentleman shows his alloy of vanity and the greatest genius shrinks to the measure of his miserable egotism  i learned from tolstoy to try character and motive by no other test and though i am perpetually false to that sublime ideal myself still the ideal remains with me to make me ashamed that i am not true to it  tolstoy gave me heart to hope that the world may yet be made over in the image of him who died for it when all caesars things shall be finally rendered unto caesar and men shall come into their own into the right to labor and the right to enjoy the fruits of their labor each one master of himself and servant to every other he taught me to see life not as a chase of a forever impossible personal happiness but as a field for endeavor towards the happiness of the whole human family and i can never lose this vision however i close my eyes and strive to see my own interest as the highest good  he gave me new criterions new principles which after all were those that are taught us in our earliest childhood before we have come to the evil wisdom of the world  as i read his different ethical books what to do my confession and my religion i recognized their truth with a rapture such as i have known in no other reading and i rendered them my allegiance heart and soul with whatever sickness of the one and despair of the other  they have it yet and i believe they will have it while i live  it is with inexpressible astonishment that i bear them attainted of pessimism as if the teaching of a man whose ideal was simple goodness must mean the prevalence of evil  the way he showed me seemed indeed impossible to my will but to my conscience it was and is the only possible way  if there is any point on which he has not convinced my reason it is that of our ability to walk this narrow way alone  even there he is logical but as zola subtly distinguishes in speaking of tolstoys essay on money he is not reasonable  solitude enfeebles and palsies and it is as comrades and brothers that men must save the world from itself rather than themselves from the world  it was so the earliest christians who had all things common understood the life of christ and i believe that the latest will understand it so  i have spoken first of the ethical works of tolstoy because they are of the first importance to me but i think that his aesthetical works are as perfect  to my thinking they transcend in truth which is the highest beauty all other works of fiction that have been written and i believe that they do this because they obey the law of the authors own life his conscience is one ethically and one aesthetically with his will to be true to himself he cannot be false to his knowledge of others  i thought the last word in literary art had been said to me by the novels of tourguenief but it seemed like the first merely when i began to acquaint myself with the simpler method of tolstoy  i came to it by accident and without any manner of preoccupation in the cossacks one of his early books which had been on my shelves unread for five or six years  i did not know even tolstoys name when i opened it and it was with a kind of amaze that i read it and felt word by word and line by line the truth of a new art in it  i do not know how it is that the great russians have the secret of simplicity  some say it is because they have not a long literary past and are not conventionalized by the usage of many generations of other writers but this will hardly account for the brotherly directness of their dealing with human nature the absence of experience elsewhere characterizes the artist with crudeness and simplicity is the last effect of knowledge  tolstoy is of course the first of them in this supreme grace  he has not only tourgueniefs transparency of style unclouded by any mist of the personality which we mistakenly value in style and which ought no more to be there than the artists personality should be in a portrait but he has a method which not only seems without artifice but is so  i can get at the manner of most writers and tell what it is but i should be baffled to tell what tolstoys manner is perhaps he has no manner  this appears to me true of his novels which with their vast variety of character and incident are alike in their single endeavor to get the persons living before you both in their action and in the peculiarly dramatic interpretation of their emotion and cogitation  there are plenty of novelists to tell you that their characters felt and thought so and so but you have to take it on trust tolstoy alone makes you know how and why it was so with them and not otherwise  if there is anything in him which can be copied or burlesqued it is this ability of his to show men inwardly as well as outwardly it is the only trait of his which i can put my hand on  after the cossacks i read anna karenina with a deepening sense of the authors unrivalled greatness  i thought that i saw through his eyes a human affair of that most sorrowful sort as it must appear to the infinite compassion the book is a sort of revelation of human nature in circumstances that have been so perpetually lied about that we have almost lost the faculty of perceiving the truth concerning an illicit love  when you have once read anna karenina you know how fatally miserable and essentially unhappy such a love must be  but the character of karenin himself is quite as important as the intrigue of anna and vronsky  it is wonderful how such a man cold philistine and even mean in certain ways towers into a sublimity unknown to me at least in fiction when he forgives and yet knows that he cannot forgive with dignity  there is something crucial and something triumphant not beyond the power but hitherto beyond the imagination of men in this effect which is not solicited not forced not in the least romantic but comes naturally almost inevitably from the make of man  the vast prospects the farreaching perspectives of war and peace made it as great a surprise for me in the historical novel as anna karenina had been in the study of contemporary life and its people and interests did not seem more remote since they are of a civilization always as strange and of a humanity always as known  i read some shorter stories of tolstoys before i came to this greatest work of his i read scenes of the siege of sebastopol which is so much of the same quality as war and peace and i read policoushka and most of his short stories with a sense of my unity with their people such as i had never felt with the people of other fiction  his didactic stories like all stories of the sort dwindle into allegories perhaps they do their work the better for this with the simple intelligences they address but i think that where tolstoy becomes impatient of his office of artist and prefers to be directly a teacher he robs himself of more than half his strength with those he can move only through the realization of themselves in others  the simple pathos and the apparent indirectness of such a tale as that of poticoushka the peasant conscript is of vastly more value to the world at large than all his parables and the death of ivan ilyitch the philistine worldling will turn the hearts of many more from the love of the world than such pale fables of the early christian life as work while ye have the light  a mans gifts are not given him for nothing and the man who has the great gift of dramatic fiction has no right to cast it away or to let it rust out in disuse  terrible as the kreutzer sonata was it had a moral effect dramatically which it lost altogether when the author descended to exegesis and applied to marriage the lesson of one evil marriage  in fine tolstoy is certainly not to be held up as infallible  he is very distinctly fallible but i think his life is not less instructive because in certain things it seems a failure  there was but one life ever lived upon the earth which was without failure and that was christs whose erring and stumbling follower tolstoy is  there is no other example no other ideal and the chief use of tolstoy is to enforce this fact in our age after nineteen centuries of hopeless endeavor to substitute ceremony for character and the creed for the life  i recognize the truth of this without pretending to have been changed in anything but my point of view of it  what i feel sure is that i can never look at life in the mean and sordid way that i did before i read tolstoy  artistically he has shown me a greatness that he can never teach me i am long past the age when i could wish to form myself upon another writer and i do not think i could now insensibly take on the likeness of another but his work has been a revelation and a delight to me such as i am sure i can never know again  i do not believe that in the whole course of my reading and not even in the early moment of my literary enthusiasms i have known such utter satisfaction in any writer and this supreme joy has come to me at a time of life when new friendships not to say new passions are rare and reluctant  it is as if the best wine at this high feast where i have sat so long had been kept for the last and i need not deny a miracle in it in order to attest my skill in judging vintages  in fact i prefer to believe that my life has been full of miracles and that the good has always come to me at the right time so that i could profit most by it  i believe if i had not turned the corner of my fiftieth year when i first knew tolstoy i should not have been able to know him as fully as i did  he has been to me that final consciousness which he speaks of so wisely in his essay on life i came in it to the knowledge of myself in ways i had not dreamt of before and began at least to discern my relations to the race without which we are each nothing  the supreme art in literature had its highest effect in making me set art forever below humanity and it is with the wish to offer the greatest homage to his heart and mind which any man can pay another that i close this record with the name of lyof tolstoy     etext editors

ease with a friend who does not joke you may do a great dealof work and not get on     end of this project gutenberg etext of my literary passions by william dean howells       criticism and fiction  by william dean howells    the question of a final criterion for the appreciation of art is one that perpetually recurs to those interested in any sort of aesthetic endeavor mr john addington symonds in a chapter of the renaissance in italy treating of the bolognese school of painting which once had so great cry and was vaunted the supreme exemplar of the grand style but which he now believes fallen into lasting contempt for its emptiness and soullessness seeks to determine whether there can be an enduring criterion or not and his conclusion is applicable to literature as to the other arts  our hope he says with regard to the unity of taste in the future then is that all sentimental or academical seekings after the ideal having been abandoned momentary theories founded upon idiosyncratic or temporary partialities exploded and nothing accepted but what is solid and positive the scientific spirit shall make men progressively more and more conscious of these bleibende verhaltnisse more and more capable of living in the whole also that in proportion as we gain a firmer hold upon our own place in the world we shall come to comprehend with more instinctive certitude what is simple natural and honest welcoming with gladness all artistic products that exhibit these qualities  the perception of the enlightened man will then be the task of a healthy person who has made himself acquainted with the laws of evolution in art and in society and is able to test the excellence of work in any stage from immaturity to decadence by discerning what there is of truth sincerity and natural vigor in it     i  that is to say as i understand that moods and tastes and fashions change people fancy now this and now that but what is unpretentious and what is true is always beautiful and good and nothing else is so  this is not saying that fantastic and monstrous and artificial things do not please everybody knows that they do please immensely for a time and then after the lapse of a much longer time they have the charm of the rococo  nothing is more curious than the charm that fashion has fashion in womens dress almost every fashion is somehow delightful else it would never have been the fashion but if any one will look through a collection of old fashion plates he must own that most fashions have been ugly  a few which could be readily instanced have been very pretty and even beautiful but it is doubtful if these have pleased the greatest number of people  the ugly delights as well as the beautiful and not merely because the ugly in fashion is associated with the young loveliness of the women who wear the ugly fashions and wins a grace from them not because the vast majority of mankind are tasteless but for some cause that is not perhaps ascertainable  it is quite as likely to return in the fashions of our clothes and houses and furniture and poetry and fiction and painting as the beautiful and it may be from an instinctive or a reasoned sense of this that some of the extreme naturalists have refused to make the old discrimination against it or to regard the ugly as any less worthy of celebration in art than the beautiful some of them in fact seem to regard it as rather more worthy if anything  possibly there is no absolutely ugly no absolutely beautiful or possibly the ugly contains always an element of the beautiful better adapted to the general appreciation than the more perfectly beautiful  this is a somewhat discouraging conjecture but i offer it for no more than it is worth and i do not pin my faith to the saying of one whom i heard denying the other day that a thing of beauty was a joy forever  he contended that keatss line should have read some things of beauty are sometimes joys forever and that any assertion beyond this was too hazardous     ii  i should indeed prefer another line of keatss if i were to profess any formulated creed and should feel much safer with his beauty is truth truth beauty than even with my friends reformation of the more quoted verse  it brings us back to the solid ground taken by mr symonds which is not essentially different from that taken in the great mr burkes essay on the sublime and the beautifula singularly modern book considering how long ago it was wrote as the great mr steele would have written the participle a little longer ago and full of a certain wellmannered and agreeable instruction  in some things it is of that droll little eighteenthcentury world when philosophy had got the neat little universe into the hollow of its hand and knew just what it was and what it was for but it is quite without arrogance  as for those called critics the author says they have generally sought the rule of the arts in the wrong place they have sought among poems pictures engravings statues and buildings but art can never give the rules that make an art  this is i believe the reason why artists in general and poets principally have been confined in so narrow a circle they have been rather imitators of one another than of nature  critics follow them and therefore can do little as guides  i can judge but poorly of anything while i measure it by no other standard than itself the true standard of the arts is in every mans power and an easy observation of the most common sometimes of the meanest things in nature will give the truest lights where the greatest sagacity and industry that slights such observation must leave us in the dark or what is worse amuse and mislead us by false lights  if this should happen to be true and it certainly commends itself to acceptanceit might portend an immediate danger to the vested interests of criticism only that it was written a hundred years ago and we shall probably have the sagacity and industry that slights the observation of nature long enough yet to allow most critics the time to learn some more useful trade than criticism as they pursue it  nevertheless i am in hopes that the communistic era in taste foreshadowed by burke is approaching and that it will occur within the lives of men now overawed by the foolish old superstition that literature and art are anything but the expression of life and are to be judged by any other test than that of their fidelity to it  the time is coming i hope when each new author each new artist will be considered not in his proportion to any other author or artist but in his relation to the human nature known to us all which it is his privilege his high duty to interpret  the true standard of the artist is in every mans power already as burke says michelangelos light of the piazza the glance of the common eye is and always was the best light on a statue goethes boys and blackbirds have in all ages been the real connoisseurs of berries but hitherto the mass of common men have been afraid to apply their own simplicity naturalness and honesty to the appreciation of the beautiful  they have always cast about for the instruction of some one who professed to know better and who browbeat wholesome commonsense into the selfdistrust that ends in sophistication  they have fallen generally to the worst of this bad species and have been amused and misled how pretty that quaint old use of amuse is by the false lights of critical vanity and selfrighteousness  they have been taught to compare what they see and what they read not with the things that they have observed and known but with the things that some other artist or writer has done  especially if they have themselves the artistic impulse in any direction they are taught to form themselves not upon life but upon the masters who became masters only by forming themselves upon life  the seeds of death are planted in them and they can produce only the stillborn the academic  they are not told to take their work into the public square and see if it seems true to the chance passer but to test it by the work of the very men who refused and decried any other test of their own work  the young writer who attempts to report the phrase and carriage of everyday life who tries to tell just how he has heard men talk and seen them look is made to feel guilty of something low and unworthy by people who would like to have him show how shakespeares men talked and looked or scotts or thackerays or balzacs or hawthornes or dickenss he is instructed to idealize his personages that is to take the lifelikeness out of them and put the booklikeness into them  he is approached in the spirit of the pedantry into which learning much or little always decays when it withdraws itself and stands apart from experience in an attitude of imagined superiority and which would say with the same confidence to the scientist i see that you are looking at a grasshopper there which you have found in the grass and i suppose you intend to describe it  now dont waste your time and sin against culture in that way  ive got a grasshopper here which has been evolved at considerable pains and expense out of the grasshopper in general in fact its a type  its made up of wire and cardboard very prettily painted in a conventional tint and its perfectly indestructible  it isnt very much like a real grasshopper but its a great deal nicer and its served to represent the notion of a grasshopper ever since man emerged from barbarism  you may say that its artificial  well it is artificial but then its ideal too and what you want to do is to cultivate the ideal  youll find the books full of my kind of grasshopper and scarcely a trace of yours in any of them  the thing that you are proposing to do is commonplace but if you say that it isnt commonplace for the very reason that it hasnt been done before youll have to admit that its photographic  as i said i hope the time is coming when not only the artist but the common average man who always has the standard of the arts in his power will have also the courage to apply it and will reject the ideal grasshopper wherever he finds it in science in literature in art because it is not simple natural and honest because it is not like a real grasshopper  but i will own that i think the time is yet far off and that the people who have been brought up on the ideal grasshopper the heroic grasshopper the impassioned grasshopper the selfdevoted adventureful good old romantic cardboard grasshopper must die out before the simple honest and natural grasshopper can have a fair field i am in no haste to compass the end of these good people whom i find in the mean time very amusing  it is delightful to meet one of them either in print or out of itsome sweet elderly lady or excellent gentleman whose youth was pastured on the literature of thirty or forty years ago and to witness the confidence with which they preach their favorite authors as all the law and the prophets  they have commonly read little or nothing since or if they have they have judged it by a standard taken from these authors and never dreamed of judging it by nature they are destitute of the documents in the case of the later writers they suppose that balzac was the beginning of realism and that zola is its wicked end they are quite ignorant but they are ready to talk you down if you differ from them with an assumption of knowledge sufficient for any occasion  the horror the resentment with which they receive any question of their literary saints is genuine you descend at once very far in the moral and social scale and anything short of offensive personality is too good for you it is expressed to you that you are one to be avoided and put down even a little lower than you have naturally fallen  these worthy persons are not to blame it is part of their intellectual mission to represent the petrifaction of taste and to preserve an image of a smaller and cruder and emptier world than we now live in a world which was feeling its way towards the simple the natural the honest but was a good deal amused and misled by lights now no longer mistakable for heavenly luminaries  they belong to a time just passing away when certain authors were considered authorities in certain kinds when they must be accepted entire and not questioned in any particular now we are beginning to see and to say that no author is an authority except in those moments when he held his ear close to natures lips and caught her very accent  these moments are not continuous with any authors in the past and they are rare with all  therefore i am not afraid to say now that the greatest classics are sometimes not at all great and that we can profit by them only when we hold them like our meanest contemporaries to a strict accounting and verify their work by the standard of the arts which we all have in our power the simple the natural and the honest  those good people must always have a hero an idol of some sort and it is droll to find balzac who suffered from their sort such bitter scorn and hate for his realism while he was alive now become a fetich in his turn to be shaken in the faces of those who will not blindly worship him  but it is no new thing in the history of literature whatever is established is sacred with those who do not think  at the beginning of the century when romance was making the same fight against effete classicism which realism is making today against effete romanticism the italian poet monti declared that the romantic was the cold grave of the beautiful just as the realistic is now supposed to be  the romantic of that day and the real of this are in certain degree the same romanticism then sought as realism seeks now to widen the bounds of sympathy to level every barrier against aesthetic freedom to escape from the paralysis of tradition  it exhausted itself in this impulse and it remained for realism to assert that fidelity to experience and probability of motive are essential conditions of a great imaginative literature  it is not a new theory but it has never before universally characterized literary endeavor  when realism becomes false to itself when it heaps up facts merely and maps life instead of picturing it realism will perish too  every true realist instinctively knows this and it is perhaps the reason why he is careful of every fact and feels himself bound to express or to indicate its meaning at the risk of overmoralizing  in life he finds nothing insignificant all tells for destiny and character nothing that god has made is contemptible  he cannot look upon human life and declare this thing or that thing unworthy of notice any more than the scientist can declare a fact of the material world beneath the dignity of his inquiry  he feels in every nerve the equality of things and the unity of men his soul is exalted not by vain shows and shadows and ideals but by realities in which alone the truth lives  in criticism it is his business to break the images of false gods and misshapen heroes to take away the poor silly toys that many grown people would still like to play with  he cannot keep terms with jack the giantkiller or pussinboots under any name or in any place even when they reappear as the convict vautrec or the marquis de montrivaut or the sworn thirteen noblemen  he must say to himself that balzac when he imagined these monsters was not balzac he was dumas he was not realistic he was romanticistic     iii  such a critic will not respect balzacs good work the less for contemning his bad work  he will easily account for the bad work historically and when he has recognized it will trouble himself no further with it  in his view no living man is a type but a character now noble now ignoble now grand now little complex full of vicissitude  he will not expect balzac to be always balzac and will be perhaps even more attracted to the study of him when he was trying to be balzac than when he had become so  in cesar birotteau for instance he will be interested to note how balzac stood at the beginning of the great things that have followed since in fiction  there is an interesting likeness between his work in this and nicolas gogols in dead souls which serves to illustrate the simultaneity of the literary movement in men of such widely separated civilizations and conditions  both represent their characters with the touch of exaggeration which typifies but in bringing his story to a close balzac employs a beneficence unknown to the russian and almost as universal and as apt as that which smiles upon the fortunes of the good in the vicar of wakefield  it is not enough to have rehabilitated birotteau pecuniarily and socially he must make him die triumphantly spectacularly of an opportune hemorrhage in the midst of the festivities which celebrate his restoration to his old home  before this happens human nature has been laid under contribution right and left for acts of generosity towards the righteous bankrupt even the king sends him six thousand francs  it is very pretty it is touching and brings the lump into the readers throat but it is too much and one perceives that balzac lived too soon to profit by balzac  the later men especially the russians have known how to forbear the excesses of analysis to withhold the weakly recurring descriptive and caressing epithets to let the characters suffice for themselves  all this does not mean that cesar birotteau is not a beautiful and pathetic story full of shrewdly considered knowledge of men and of a good art struggling to free itself from selfconsciousness  but it does mean that balzac when he wrote it was under the burden of the very traditions which he has helped fiction to throw off  he felt obliged to construct a mechanical plot to surcharge his characters to moralize openly and baldly he permitted himself to sympathize with certain of his people and to point out others for the abhorrence of his readers  this is not so bad in him as it would be in a novelist of our day  it is simply primitive and inevitable and he is not to be judged by it     iv  in the beginning of any art even the most gifted worker must be crude in his methods and we ought to keep this fact always in mind when we turn say from the purblind worshippers of scott to scott himself and recognize that he often wrote a style cumbrous and diffuse that he was tediously analytical where the modern novelist is dramatic and evolved his characters by means of longwinded explanation and commentary that except in the case of his lowerclass personages he made them talk as seldom man and never woman talked that he was tiresomely descriptive that on the simplest occasions he went about half a mile to express a thought that could be uttered in ten paces across lots and that he trusted his readers intuitions so little that he was apt to rub in his appeals to them  he was probably right the generation which he wrote for was duller than this slowerwitted aesthetically untrained and in maturity not so apprehensive of an artistic intention as the children of today  all this is not saying scott was not a great man he was a great man and a very great novelist as compared with the novelists who went before him  he can still amuse young people but they ought to be instructed how false and how mistaken he often is with his mediaeval ideals his blind jacobitism his intense devotion to aristocracy and royalty his acquiescence in the division of men into noble and ignoble patrician and plebeian sovereign and subject as if it were the law of god for all which indeed he is not to blame as he would be if he were one of our contemporaries  something of this is true of another master greater than scott in being less romantic and inferior in being more german namely the great goethe himself  he taught us in novels otherwise now antiquated and always full of german clumsiness that it was false to good artwhich is never anything but the reflection of lifeto pursue and round the career of the persons introduced whom he often allowed to appear and disappear in our knowledge as people in the actual world do  this is a lesson which the writers able to profit by it can never be too grateful for and it is equally a benefaction to readers but there is very little else in the conduct of the goethean novels which is in advance of their time this remains almost their sole contribution to the science of fiction  they are very primitive in certain characteristics and unite with their calm deep insight an amusing helplessness in dramatization wilhelm retired to his room and indulged in the following reflections is a mode of analysis which would not be practised nowadays and all that fancifulness of nomenclature in wilhelm meister is very drolly sentimental and feeble  the adventures with robbers seem as if dreamed out of books of chivalry and the tendency to allegorization affects one like an endeavor on the authors part to escape from the unrealities which he must have felt harassingly german as he was  mixed up with the shadows and illusions are honest wholesome everyday people who have the air of wandering homelessly about among them without definite direction and the mists are full of a luminosity which in spite of them we know for commonsense and poetry what is useful in any review of goethes methods is the recognition of the fact which it must bring that the greatest master cannot produce a masterpiece in a new kind  the novel was too recently invented in goethes day not to be even in his hands full of the faults of apprentice work     v  in fact a great master may sin against the modesty of nature in many ways and i have felt this painfully in reading balzacs romanceit is not worthy the name of novelle pere goriot which is full of a malarial restlessness wholly alien to healthful art  after that exquisitely careful and truthful setting of his story in the shabby boardinghouse he fills the scene with figures jerked about by the exaggerated passions and motives of the stage  we cannot have a cynic reasonably wicked disagreeable egoistic we must have a lurid villain of melodrama a disguised convict with a vast criminal organization at his command and                 so dyed double red  indeed and purpose that he lights up the faces of the horrified spectators with his glare  a father fond of unworthy children and leading a life of selfdenial for their sake as may probably and pathetically be is not enough there must be an imbecile trembling dotard willing to promote even the liaisons of his daughters to give them happiness and to teach the sublimity of the paternal instinct the hero cannot sufficiently be a selfish young fellow with alternating impulses of greed and generosity he must superfluously intend a career of iniquitous splendor and be swerved from it by nothing but the most cataclysmal interpositions  it can be said that without such personages the plot could not be transacted but so much the worse for the plot such a plot had no business to be and while actions so unnatural are imagined no mastery can save fiction from contempt with those who really think about it  to balzac it can be forgiven not only because in his better mood he gave us such biographies as eugenie grandet but because he wrote at a time when fiction was just beginning to verify the externals of life to portray faithfully the outside of men and things it was still held that in order to interest the reader the characters must be moved by the old romantic ideals we were to be taught that heroes and heroines existed all around us and that these abnormal beings needed only to be discovered in their several humble disguises and then we should see everyday people actuated by the fine frenzy of the creatures of the poets  how false that notion was few but the critics who are apt to be rather belated need now be told  some of these poor fellows however still contend that it ought to be done and that human feelings and motives as god made them and as men know them are not good enough for novelreaders  this is more explicable than would appear at first glance  the critics and in speaking of them one always modestly leaves ones self out of the count for some reasonwhen they are not elders ossified in tradition are apt to be young people and young people are necessarily conservative in their tastes and theories  they have the tastes and theories of their instructors who perhaps caught the truth of their day but whose routine life has been alien to any other truth  there is probably no chair of literature in this country from which the principles now shaping the literary expression of every civilized people are not denounced and confounded with certain objectionable french novels or which teaches young men anything of the universal impulse which has given us the work not only of zola but of tourguenief and tolstoy in russia of bjornson and ibsen in norway of valdes and galdos in spain of verga in italy  till these younger critics have learned to think as well as to write for themselves they will persist in heaving a sigh more and more perfunctory for the truth as it was in sir walter and as it was in dickens and in hawthorne  presently all will have been changed they will have seen the new truth in larger and larger degree and when it shall have become the old truth they will perhaps see it all     vi  in the mean time the average of criticism is not wholly bad with us to be sure the critic sometimes appears in the panoply of the savages whom we have supplanted on this continent and it is hard to believe that his use of the tomahawk and the scalpingknife is a form of conservative surgery  it is still his conception of his office that he should assail those who differ with him in matters of taste or opinion that he must be rude with those he does not like  it is too largely his superstition that because he likes a thing it is good and because he dislikes a thing it is bad the reverse is quite possibly the case but he is yet indefinitely far from knowing that in affairs of taste his personal preference enters very little  commonly he has no principles but only an assortment of prepossessions for and against and this otherwise very perfect character is sometimes uncandid to the verge of dishonesty  he seems not to mind misstating the position of any one he supposes himself to disagree with and then attacking him for what he never said or even implied he thinks this is droll and appears not to suspect that it is immoral  he is not tolerant he thinks it a virtue to be intolerant it is hard for him to understand that the same thing may be admirable at one time and deplorable at another and that it is really his business to classify and analyze the fruits of the human mind very much as the naturalist classifies the objects of his study rather than to praise or blame them that there is a measure of the same absurdity in his trampling on a poem a novel or an essay that does not please him as in the botanists grinding a plant underfoot because he does not find it pretty  he does not conceive that it is his business rather to identify the species and then explain how and where the specimen is imperfect and irregular  if he could once acquire this simple idea of his duty he would be much more agreeable company than he now is and a more useful member of society though considering the hard conditions under which he works his necessity of writing hurriedly from an imperfect examination of far more books on a greater variety of subjects than he can even hope to read the average american criticthe ordinary critic of commerce so to speakis even now very well indeed  collectively he is more than this for the joint effect of our criticism is the pretty thorough appreciation of any book submitted to it     vii  the misfortune rather than the fault of our individual critic is that he is the heir of the false theory and bad manners of the english school the theory of that school has apparently been that almost any person of glib and lively expression is competent to write of almost any branch of polite literature its manners are what we know  the american whom it has largely formed is by nature very glib and very lively and commonly his criticism viewed as imaginative work is more agreeable than that of the englishman but it is like the art of both countries apt to be amateurish  in some degree our authors have freed themselves from english models they have gained some notion of the more serious work of the continent but it is still the ambition of the american critic to write like the english critic to show his wit if not his learning to strive to eclipse the author under review rather than illustrate him he has not yet caught on to the fact that it is really no part of his business to display himself but that it is altogether his duty to place a book in such a light that the reader shall know its class its function its character  the vast goodnature of our people preserves us from the worst effects of this criticism without principles  our critic at his lowest is rarely malignant and when he is rude or untruthful it is mostly without truculence i suspect that he is often offensive without knowing that he is so  now and then he acts simply under instruction from higher authority and denounces because it is the tradition of his publication to do so  in other cases the critic is obliged to support his journals repute for severity or for wit or for morality though he may himself be entirely amiable dull and wicked this necessity more or less warps his verdicts  the worst is that he is personal perhaps because it is so easy and so natural to be personal and so instantly attractive  in this respect our criticism has not improved from the accession of numbers of ladies to its ranks though we still hope so much from women in our politics when they shall come to vote  they have come to write and with the effect to increase the amount of littledigging which rather superabounded in our literary criticism before  they know what they likethat pernicious maxim of those who do not know what they ought to like and they pass readily from censuring an authors performance to censuring him  they bring a stock of lively misapprehensions and prejudices to their work they would rather have heard about than known about a book and they take kindly to the public wish to be amused rather than edified  but neither have they so much harm in them they too are more ignorant than malevolent     viii  our criticism is disabled by the unwillingness of the critic to learn from an author and his readiness to mistrust him  a writer passes his whole life in fitting himself for a certain kind of performance the critic does not ask why or whether the performance is good or bad but if he does not like the kind he instructs the writer to go off and do some other sort of thingusually the sort that has been done already and done sufficiently  if he could once understand that a man who has written the book he dislikes probably knows infinitely more about its kind and his own fitness for doing it than any one else the critic might learn something and might help the reader to learn but by putting himself in a false position a position of superiority he is of no use he is not to suppose that an author has committed an offence against him by writing the kind of book he does not like he will be far more profitably employed on behalf of the reader in finding out whether they had better not both like it  let him conceive of an author as not in any wise on trial before him but as a reflection of this or that aspect of life and he will not be tempted to browbeat him or bully him  the critic need not be impolite even to the youngest and weakest author a little courtesy or a good deal a constant perception of the fact that a book is not a misdemeanor a decent selfrespect that must forbid the civilized man the savage pleasure of wounding are what i would ask for our criticism as something which will add sensibly to its present lustre     ix  i would have my fellowcritics consider what they are really in the world for  the critic must perceive if he will question himself more carefully that his office is mainly to ascertain facts and traits of literature not to invent or denounce them to discover principles not to establish them to report not to create  it is so much easier to say that you like this or dislike that than to tell why one thing is or where another thing comes from that many flourishing critics will have to go out of business altogether if the scientific method comes in for then the critic will have to know something besides his own mind  he will have to know something of the laws of that mind and of its generic history  the history of all literature shows that even with the youngest and weakest author criticism is quite powerless against his will to do his own work in his own way and if this is the case in the green wood how much more in the dry  it has been thought by the sentimentalist that criticism if it cannot cure can at least kill and keats was long alleged in proof of its efficacy in this sort  but criticism neither cured nor killed keats as we all now very well know  it wounded it cruelly hurt him no doubt and it is always in the power of the critic to give pain to the authorthe meanest critic to the greatest author for no one can help feeling a rudeness  but every literary movement has been violently opposed at the start and yet never stayed in the least or arrested by criticism every author has been condemned for his virtues but in no wise changed by it  in the beginning he reads the critics but presently perceiving that he alone makes or mars himself and that they have no instruction for him he mostly leaves off reading them though he is always glad of their kindness or grieved by their harshness when he chances upon it  this i believe is the general experience modified of course by exceptions  then are we critics of no use in the world  i should not like to think that though i am not quite ready to define our use  more than one sober thinker is inclining at present to suspect that aesthetically or specifically we are of no use and that we are only useful historically that we may register laws but not enact them  i am not quite prepared to admit that aesthetic criticism is useless though in view of its futility in any given instance it is hard to deny that it is so it certainly seems as useless against a book that strikes the popular fancy and prospers on in spite of condemnation by the best critics as it is against a book which does not generally please and which no critical favor can make acceptable  this is so common a phenomenon that i wonder it has never hitherto suggested to criticism that its point of view was altogether mistaken and that it was really necessary to judge books not as dead things but as living thingsthings which have an influence and a power irrespective of beauty and wisdom and merely as expressions of actuality in thought and feeling  perhaps criticism has a cumulative and final effect perhaps it does some good we do not know of it apparently does not affect the author directly but it may reach him through the reader  it may in some cases enlarge or diminish his audience for a while until he has thoroughly measured and tested his own powers  if criticism is to affect literature at all it must be through the writers who have newly left the startingpoint and are reasonably uncertain of the race not with those who have won it again and again in their own way     x  sometimes it has seemed to me that the crudest expression of any creative art is better than the finest comment upon it  i have sometimes suspected that more thinking more feeling certainly goes to the creation of a poor novel than to the production of a brilliant criticism and if any novel of our time fails to live a hundred years will any censure of it live  who can endure to read old reviews  one can hardly read them if they are in praise of ones own books  the author neglected or overlooked need not despair for that reason if he will reflect that criticism can neither make nor unmake authors that there have not been greater books since criticism became an art than there were before that in fact the greatest books seem to have come much earlier  that which criticism seems most certainly to have done is to have put a literary consciousness into books unfelt in the early masterpieces but unfelt now only in the books of men whose lives have been passed in activities who have been used to employing language as they would have employed any implement to effect an object who have regarded a thing to be said as in no wise different from a thing to be done  in this sort i have seen no modern book so unconscious as general grants personal memoirs  the authors one end and aim is to get the facts out in words he does not cast about for phrases but takes the word whatever it is that will best give his meaning as if it were a man or a force of men for the accomplishment of a feat of arms  there is not a moment wasted in preening and prettifying after the fashion of literary men there is no thought of style and so the style is good as it is in the book of chronicles as it is in the pilgrims progress with a peculiar almost plebeian plainness at times  there is no more attempt at dramatic effect than there is at ceremonious pose things happen in that tale of a mighty war as they happened in the mighty war itself without setting without artificial reliefs one after another as if they were all of one quality and degree  judgments are delivered with the same unimposing quiet no awe surrounds the tribunal except that which comes from the weight and justice of the opinions it is always an unaffected unpretentious man who is talking and throughout he prefers to wear the uniform of a private with nothing of the general about him but the shoulderstraps which he sometimes forgets     xi  canon fairfaxs opinions of literary criticism are very much to my liking perhaps because when i read them i found them so like my own already delivered in print  he tells the critics that they are in no sense the legislators of literature barely even its judges and police and he reminds them of mr ruskins saying that a bad critic is probably the most mischievous person in the world though a sense of their relative proportion to the whole of life would perhaps acquit the worst among them of this extreme of culpability  a bad critic is as bad a thing as can be but after all his mischief does not carry very far otherwise it would be mainly the conventional books and not the original books which would survive for the censor who imagines himself a law giver can give law only to the imitative and never to the creative mind criticism has condemned whatever was from time to time fresh and vital in literature it has always fought the new good thing in behalf of the old good thing it has invariably fostered and encouraged the tame the trite the negative  yet upon the whole it is the native the novel the positive that has survived in literature  whereas if bad criticism were the most mischievous thing in the world in the full implication of the words it must have been the tame the trite the negative that survived  bad criticism is mischievous enough however and i think that much if not most current criticism as practised among the english and americans is bad is falsely principled and is conditioned in evil  it is falsely principled because it is unprincipled or without principles and it is conditioned in evil because it is almost wholly anonymous  at the best its opinions are not conclusions from certain easily verifiable principles but are effects from the worship of certain models  they are in so far quite worthless for it is the very nature of things that the original mind cannot conform to models it has its norm within itself it can work only in its own way and by its selfgiven laws  criticism does not inquire whether a work is true to life but tacitly or explicitly compares it with models and tests it by them  if literary art travelled by any such road as criticism would have it go it would travel in a vicious circle and would arrive only at the point of departure  yet this is the course that criticism must always prescribe when it attempts to give laws  being itself artificial it cannot conceive of the original except as the abnormal  it must altogether reconceive its office before it can be of use to literature  it must reduce this to the business of observing recording and comparing to analyzing the material before it and then synthetizing its impressions  even then it is not too much to say that literature as an art could get on perfectly well without it  just as many good novels poems plays essays sketches would be written if there were no such thing as criticism in the literary world and no more bad ones  but it will be long before criticism ceases to imagine itself a controlling force to give itself airs of sovereignty and to issue decrees  as it exists it is mostly a mischief though not the greatest mischief but it may be greatly ameliorated in character and softened in manner by the total abolition of anonymity  i think it would be safe to say that in no other relation of life is so much brutality permitted by civilized society as in the criticism of literature and the arts  canon farrar is quite right in reproaching literary criticism with the uncandor of judging an author without reference to his aims with pursuing certain writers from spite and prejudice and mere habit with misrepresenting a book by quoting a phrase or passage apart from the context with magnifying misprints and careless expressions into important faults with abusing an author for his opinions with base and personal motives  every writer of experience knows that certain critical journals will condemn his work without regard to its quality even if it has never been his fortune to learn as one author did from a repentent reviewer that in a journal pretending to literary taste his books were given out for review with the caution remember that the clarion is opposed to mr blanks books  the final conclusion appears to be that the man or even the young lady who is given a gun and told to shoot at some passer from behind a hedge is placed in circumstances of temptation almost too strong for human nature     xii  as i have already intimated i doubt the more lasting effects of unjust criticism  it is no part of my belief that keatss fame was long delayed by it or wordsworths or brownings  something unwonted unexpected in the quality of each delayed his recognition each was not only a poet he was a revolution a new order of things to which the critical perceptions and habitudes had painfully to adjust themselves but i have no question of the gross and stupid injustice with which these great men were used and of the barbarization of the public mind by the sight of the wrong inflicted on them with impunity  this savage condition still persists in the toleration of anonymous criticism an abuse that ought to be as extinct as the torture of witnesses  it is hard enough to treat a fellowauthor with respect even when one has to address him name to name upon the same level in plain day swooping down upon him in the dark panoplied in the authority of a great journal it is impossible every now and then some idealist comes forward and declares that you should say nothing in criticism of a mans book which you would not say of it to his face  but i am afraid this is asking too much  i am afraid it would put an end to all criticism and that if it were practised literature would be left to purify itself  i have no doubt literature would do this but in such a state of things there would be no provision for the critics  we ought not to destroy critics we ought to reform them or rather transform them or turn them from the assumption of authority to a realization of their true function in the civilized state they are no worse at heart probably than many others and there are probably good husbands and tender fathers loving daughters and careful mothers among them  it is evident to any student of human nature that the critic who is obliged to sign his review will be more careful of an authors feelings than he would if he could intangibly and invisibly deal with him as the representative of a great journal  he will be loath to have his name connected with those perversions and misstatements of an authors meaning in which the critic now indulges without danger of being turned out of honest company  he will be in some degree forced to be fair and just with a book he dislikes he will not wish to misrepresent it when his sin can be traced directly to him in person he will not be willing to voice the prejudice of a journal which is opposed to the books of this or that author and the journal itself when it is no longer responsible for the behavior of its critic may find it interesting and profitable to give to an author his innings when he feels wronged by a reviewer and desires to right himself it may even be eager to offer him the opportunity  we shall then perhaps frequently witness the spectacle of authors turning upon their reviewers and improving their manners and morals by confronting them in public with the errors they may now commit with impunity  many an author smarts under injuries and indignities which he might resent to the advantage of literature and civilization if he were not afraid of being browbeaten by the journal whose nameless critic has outraged him  the public is now of opinion that it involves loss of dignity to creative talent to try to right itself if wronged but here we are without the requisite statistics  creative talent may come off with all the dignity it went in with and it may accomplish a very good work in demolishing criticism  in any other relation of life the man who thinks himself wronged tries to right himself violently if he is a mistaken man and lawfully if he is a wise man or a rich one which is practically the same thing  but the author dramatist painter sculptor whose book play picture statue has been unfairly dealt with as he believes must make no effort to right himself with the public he must bear his wrong in silence he is even expected to grin and bear it as if it were funny  every body understands that it is not funny to him not in the least funny but everybody says that he cannot make an effort to get the public to take his point of view without loss of dignity  this is very odd but it is the fact and i suppose that it comes from the feeling that the author dramatist painter sculptor has already said the best he can for his side in his book play picture statue  this is partly true and yet if he wishes to add something more to prove the critic wrong i do not see how his attempt to do so should involve loss of dignity  the public which is so jealous for his dignity does not otherwise use him as if he were a very great and invaluable creature if he fails it lets him starve like any one else  i should say that he lost dignity or not as he behaved in his effort to right himself with petulance or with principle  if he betrayed a wounded vanity if he impugned the motives and accused the lives of his critics i should certainly feel that he was losing dignity but if he temperately examined their theories and tried to show where they were mistaken i think he would not only gain dignity but would perform a very useful work     xiii  i would beseech the literary critics of our country to disabuse themselves of the mischievous notion that they are essential to the progress of literature in the way critics have imagined  canon farrar confesses that with the best will in the world to profit by the many criticisms of his books he has never profited in the least by any of them and this is almost the universal experience of authors  it is not always the fault of the critics  they sometimes deal honestly and fairly by a book and not so often they deal adequately  but in making a book if it is at all a good book the author has learned all that is knowable about it and every strong point and every weak point in it far more accurately than any one else can possibly learn them  he has learned to do better than well for the future but if his book is bad he cannot be taught anything about it from the outside  it will perish and if he has not the root of literature in him he will perish as an author with it but what is it that gives tendency in art then  what is it makes people like this at one time and that at another  above all what makes a better fashion change for a worse how can the ugly come to be preferred to the beautiful in other words how can an art decay  this question came up in my mind lately with regard to english fiction and its form or rather its formlessness  how for instance could people who had once known the simple verity the refined perfection of miss austere enjoy anything less refined and less perfect  with her example before them why should not english novelists have gone on writing simply honestly artistically ever after  one would think it must have been impossible for them to do otherwise if one did not remember say the lamentable behavior of the actors who support mr jefferson and their theatricality in the very presence of his beautiful naturalness  it is very difficult that simplicity and nothing is so hard as to be honest as the reader if he has ever happened to try it must know  the big bowwow i can do myself like anyone going said scott but he owned that the exquisite touch of miss austere was denied him and it seems certainly to have been denied in greater or less measure to all her successors  but though reading and writing come by nature as dogberry justly said a taste in them may be cultivated or once cultivated it may be preserved and why was it not so among those poor islanders  one does not ask such things in order to be at the pains of answering them ones self but with the hope that some one else will take the trouble to do so and i propose to be rather a silent partner in the enterprise which i shall leave mainly to senor armando palacio valdes  this delightful author will however only be able to answer my question indirectly from the essay on fiction with which he prefaces one of his novels the charming story of the sister of san sulpizio and i shall have some little labor in fitting his saws to my instances  it is an essay which i wish every one intending to read or even to write a novel might acquaint himself with for it contains some of the best and clearest things which have been said of the art of fiction in a time when nearly all who practise it have turned to talk about it  senor valdes is a realist but a realist according to his own conception of realism and he has some words of just censure for the french naturalists whom he finds unnecessarily and suspects of being sometimes even mercenarily nasty  he sees the wide difference that passes between this naturalism and the realism of the english and spanish and he goes somewhat further than i should go in condemning it  the french naturalism represents only a moment and an insignificant part of life       it is characterized by sadness and narrowness  the prototype of this literature is the madame bovary of flaubert  i am an admirer of this novelist and especially of this novel but often in thinking of it i have said how dreary would literature be if it were no more than this there is something antipathetic and gloomy and limited in it as there is in modern french life but this seems to me exactly the best possible reason for its being  i believe with senor valdes that no literature can live long without joy not because of its mistaken aesthetics however but because no civilization can live long without joy  the expression of french life will change when french life changes and french naturalism is better at its worst than french unnaturalism at its best  no one as senor valdes truly says can rise from the perusal of a naturalistic book       without a vivid desire to escape from the wretched world depicted in it and a purpose more or less vague of helping to better the lot and morally elevate the abject beings who figure in it  naturalistic art then is not immoral in itself for then it would not merit the name of art for though it is not the business of art to preach morality still i think that resting on a divine and spiritual principle like the idea of the beautiful it is perforce moral  i hold much more immoral other books which under a glamour of something spiritual and beautiful and sublime portray the vices in which we are allied to the beasts  such for example are the works of octave feuillet arsene houssaye georges ohnet and other contemporary novelists much in vogue among the higher classes of society  but what is this idea of the beautiful which art rests upon and so becomes moral the man of our time says senor valdes wishes to know everything and enjoy everything he turns the objective of a powerful equatorial towards the heavenly spaces where gravitates the infinitude of the stars just as he applies the microscope to the infinitude of the smallest insects for their laws are identical  his experience united with intuition has convinced him that in nature there is neither great nor small all is equal  all is equally grand all is equally just all is equally beautiful because all is equally divine  but beauty senor valdes explains exists in the human spirit and is the beautiful effect which it receives from the true meaning of things it does not matter what the things are and it is the function of the artist who feels this effect to impart it to others  i may add that there is no joy in art except this perception of the meaning of things and its communication when you have felt it and portrayed it in a poem a symphony a novel a statue a picture an edifice you have fulfilled the purpose for which you were born an artist  the reflection of exterior nature in the individual spirit senor valdes believes to be the fundamental of art  to say then that the artist must not copy but create is nonsense because he can in no wise copy and in no wise create  he who sets deliberately about modifying nature shows that he has not felt her beauty and therefore cannot make others feel it  the puerile desire which some artists without genius manifest to go about selecting in nature not what seems to them beautiful but what they think will seem beautiful to others and rejecting what may displease them ordinarily produces cold and insipid works  for instead of exploring the illimitable fields of reality they cling to the forms invented by other artists who have succeeded and they make statues of statues poems of poems novels of novels  it is entirely false that the great romantic symbolic or classic poets modified nature such as they have expressed her they felt her and in this view they are as much realists as ourselves  in like manner if in the realistic tide that now bears us on there are some spirits who feel nature in another way in the romantic way or the classic way they would not falsify her in expressing her so  only those falsify her who without feeling classic wise or romantic wise set about being classic or romantic wearisomely reproducing the models of former ages and equally those who without sharing the sentiment of realism which now prevails force themselves to be realists merely to follow the fashion  the pseudorealists in fact are the worse offenders to my thinking for they sin against the living whereas those who continue to celebrate the heroic adventures of pussinboots and the hairbreadth escapes of tom thumb under various aliases only cast disrespect upon the immortals who have passed beyond these noises     xiv  the principal cause our spaniard says of the decadence of contemporary literature is found to my thinking in the vice which has been very graphically called effectism or the itch of awaking at all cost in the reader vivid and violent emotions which shall do credit to the invention and originality of the writer  this vice has its roots in human nature itself and more particularly in that of the artist he has always some thing feminine in him which tempts him to coquet with the reader and display qualities that he thinks will astonish him as women laugh for no reason to show their teeth when they have them white and small and even or lift their dresses to show their feet when there is no mud in the street         what many writers nowadays wish is to produce an effect grand and immediate to play the part of geniuses for this they have learned that it is only necessary to write exaggerated works in any sort since the vulgar do not ask that they shall be quietly made to think and feel but that they shall be startled and among the vulgar of course i include the great part of those who write literary criticism and who constitute the worst vulgar since they teach what they do not know       there are many persons who suppose that the highest proof an artist can give of his fantasy is the invention of a complicated plot spiced with perils surprises and suspenses and that anything else is the sign of a poor and tepid imagination  and not only people who seem cultivated but are not so suppose this but there are sensible persons and even sagacious and intelligent critics who sometimes allow themselves to be hoodwinked by the dramatic mystery and the surprising and fantastic scenes of a novel  they own it is all false but they admire the imagination what they call the power of the author  very well all i have to say is that the power to dazzle with strange incidents to entertain with complicated plots and impossible characters now belongs to some hundreds of writers in europe while there are not much above a dozen who know how to interest with the ordinary events of life and by the portrayal of characters truly human if the former is a talent it must be owned that it is much commoner than the latter         if we are to rate novelists according to their fecundity or the riches of their invention we must put alexander dumas above cervantes  cervantes wrote a novel with the simplest plot without belying much or little the natural and logical course of events  this novel which was called don quixote is perhaps the greatest work of human wit  very well the same cervantes mischievously influenced afterwards by the ideas of the vulgar who were then what they are now and always will be attempted to please them by a work giving a lively proof of his inventive talent and wrote the persiles and sigismunda where the strange incidents the vivid complications the surprises the pathetic scenes succeed one another so rapidly and constantly that it really fatigues you         but in spite of this flood of invention imagine says seflor valdes the place that cervantes would now occupy in the heaven of art if he had never written don quixote but only persiles and sigismund  from the point of view of modern english criticism which likes to be melted and horrified and astonished and bloodcurdled and goose fleshed no less than to be chippered up in fiction senor valdes were indeed incorrigible  not only does he despise the novel of complicated plot and everywhere prefer don quixote to persiles and sigismunda but he has a lively contempt for another class of novels much in favor with the gentilities of all countries  he calls their writers novelists of the world and he says that more than any others they have the rage of effectism  they do not seek to produce effect by novelty and invention in plot     they seek it in character  for this end they begin by deliberately falsifying human feelings giving them a paradoxical appearance completely inadmissible         love that disguises itself as hate incomparable energy under the cloak of weakness virginal innocence under the aspect of malice and impudence wit masquerading as folly etc etc  by this means they hope to make an effect of which they are incapable through the direct frank and conscientious study of character  he mentions octave feuillet as the greatest offender in this sort among the french and bulwer among the english but dickens is full of it boffin in our mutual friend will suffice for all example and most drama is witness of the result of this effectism when allowed full play  but what then if he is not pleased with dumas or with the effectists who delight genteel people at all the theatres and in most of the romances what i ask will satisfy this extremely difficult spanish gentleman  he would pretend very little  give him simple lifelike character that is all he wants  for me the only condition of character is that it be human and that is enough  if i wished to know what was human i should study humanity  but senor valdes senor valdes  do not you know that this small condition of yours implies in its fulfilment hardly less than the gift of the whole earth you merely ask that the character portrayed in fiction be human and you suggest that the novelist should study humanity if he would know whether his personages are human  this appears to me the cruelest irony the most sarcastic affectation of humility  if you had asked that character in fiction be superhuman or subterhuman or preterhuman or intrahuman and had bidden the novelist go not to humanity but the humanities for the proof of his excellence it would have been all very easy  the books are full of those creations of every pattern of all ages of both sexes and it is so much handier to get at books than to get at men and when you have portrayed passion instead of feeling and used power instead of commonsense and shown yourself a genius instead of an artist the applause is so prompt and the glory so cheap that really anything else seems wickedly wasteful of ones time  one may not make ones reader enjoy or suffer nobly but one may give him the kind of pleasure that arises from conjuring or from a puppetshow or a modern stageplay and leave him if he is an old fool in the sort of stupor that comes from hitting the pipe or if he is a young fool half crazed with the spectacle of qualities and impulses like his own in an apotheosis of achievement and fruition far beyond any earthly experience  but apparently senor valdes would not think this any great artistic result  things that appear ugliest in reality to the spectator who is not an artist are transformed into beauty and poetry when the spirit of the artist possesses itself of them  we all take part every day in a thousand domestic scenes every day we see a thousand pictures in life that do not make any impression upon us or if they make any it is one of repugnance but let the novelist come and without betraying the truth but painting them as they appear to his vision he produces a most interesting work whose perusal enchants us  that which in life left us indifferent or repelled us in art delights us  why  simply because the artist has made us see the idea that resides in it  let not the novelists then endeavor to add anything to reality to turn it and twist it to restrict it  since nature has endowed them with this precious gift of discovering ideas in things their work will be beautiful if they paint these as they appear  but if the reality does not impress them in vain will they strive to make their work impress others     xv  which brings us again after this long way about to jane austen and her novels and that troublesome question about them  she was great and they were beautiful because she and they were honest and dealt with nature nearly a hundred years ago as realism deals with it today  realism is nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material and jane austen was the first and the last of the english novelists to treat material with entire truthfulness  because she did this she remains the most artistic of the english novelists and alone worthy to be matched with the great scandinavian and slavic and latin artists  it is not a question of intellect or not wholly that  the english have mind enough but they have not taste enough or rather their taste has been perverted by their false criticism which is based upon personal preference and not upon principle which instructs a man to think that what he likes is good instead of teaching him first to distinguish what is good before he likes it  the art of fiction as jane austen knew it declined from her through scott and bulwer and dickens and charlotte bronte and thackeray and even george eliot because the mania of romanticism had seized upon all europe and these great writers could not escape the taint of their time but it has shown few signs of recovery in england because english criticism in the presence of the continental masterpieces has continued provincial and special and personal and has expressed a love and a hate which had to do with the quality of the artist rather than the character of his work  it was inevitable that in their time the english romanticists should treat as senor valdes says the barbarous customs of the middle ages softening and distorting them as walter scott and his kind did that they should devote themselves to falsifying nature refining and subtilizing sentiment and modifying psychology after their own fancy like bulwer and dickens as well as like rousseau and madame de stael not to mention balzac the worst of all that sort at his worst  this was the natural course of the disease but it really seems as if it were their criticism that was to blame for the rest not indeed for the performance of this writer or that for criticism can never affect the actual doing of a thing but for the esteem in which this writer or that is held through the perpetuation of false ideals  the only observer of english middleclass life since jane austen worthy to be named with her was not george eliot who was first ethical and then artistic who transcended her in everything but the form and method most essential to art and there fell hopelessly below her it was anthony trollope who was most like her in simple honesty and instinctive truth as unphilosophized as the light of common day but he was so warped from a wholesome ideal as to wish at times to be like thackeray and to stand about in his scene talking it over with his hands in his pockets interrupting the action and spoiling the illusion in which alone the truth of art resides  mainly his instinct was too much for his ideal and with a low view of life in its civic relations and a thoroughly bourgeois soul he yet produced works whose beauty is surpassed only by the effect of a more poetic writer in the novels of thomas hardy  yet if a vote of english criticism even at this late day when all continental europe has the light of aesthetic truth could be taken the majority against these artists would be overwhelmingly in favor of a writer who had so little artistic sensibility that he never hesitated on any occasion great or small to make a foray among his characters and catch them up to show them to the reader and tell him how beautiful or ugly they were and cry out over their amazing properties  how few materials says emerson are yet used by our arts the mass of creatures and of qualities are still hid and expectant and to break new ground is still one of the uncommonest and most heroic of the virtues the artists are not alone to blame for the timidity that keeps them in the old furrows of the wornout fields most of those whom they live to please or live by pleasing prefer to have them remain there it wants rare virtue to appreciate what is new as well as to invent it and the easy things to understand are the conventional things  this is why the ordinary english novel with its hackneyed plot scenes and figures is more comfortable to the ordinary american than an american novel which deals at its worst with comparatively new interests and motives  to adjust ones self to the enjoyment of these costs an intellectual effort and an intellectual effort is what no ordinary person likes to make  it is only the extraordinary person who can say with emerson i ask not for the great the remote the romantic         i embrace the common i sit at the feet of the familiar and the low         man is surprised to find that things near are not less beautiful and wondrous than things remote         the perception of the worth of the vulgar is fruitful in discoveries         the foolish man wonders at the unusual but the wise man at the usual         today always looks mean to the thoughtless but today is a king in disguise        banks and tariffs the newspaper and caucus methodism and unitarianism are flat and dull to dull people but rest on the same foundations of wonder as the town of troy and the temple of delphos  perhaps we ought not to deny their town of troy and their temple of delphos to the dull people but if we ought and if we did they would still insist upon having them  an english novel full of titles and rank is apparently essential to the happiness of such people their weak and childish imagination is at home in its familiar environment they know what they are reading the fact that it is hash many times warmed over reassures them whereas a story of our own life honestly studied and faithfully represented troubles them with varied misgiving  they are not sure that it is literature they do not feel that it is good society its characters so like their own strike them as commonplace they say they do not wish to know such people  everything in england is appreciable to the literary sense while the sense of the literary worth of things in america is still faint and weak with most people with the vast majority who ask for the great the remote the romantic who cannot embrace the common cannot sit at the feet of the familiar and the low in the good company of emerson we are all or nearly all struggling to be distinguished from the mass and to be set apart in select circles and upper classes like the fine people we have read about  we are really a mixture of the plebeian ingredients of the whole world but that is not bad our vulgarity consists in trying to ignore the worth of the vulgar in believing that the superfine is better     xvii  another spanish novelist of our day whose books have given me great pleasure is so far from being of the same mind of senor valdes about fiction that he boldly declares himself in the preface to his pepita ximenez an advocate of art for arts sake i heartily agree with him that it is in very bad taste always impertinent and often pedantic to attempt to prove theses by writing stories and yet if it is true that the object of a novel should be to charm through a faithful representation of human actions and human passions and to create by this fidelity to nature a beautiful work and if the creation of the beautiful is solely the object of art it never was and never can be solely its effect as long as men are men and women are women  if ever the race is resolved into abstract qualities perhaps this may happen but till then the finest effect of the beautiful will be ethical and not aesthetic merely  morality penetrates all things it is the soul of all things  beauty may clothe it on whether it is false morality and an evil soul or whether it is true and a good soul  in the one case the beauty will corrupt and in the other it will edify and in either case it will infallibly and inevitably have an ethical effect now light now grave according as the thing is light or grave  we cannot escape from this we are shut up to it by the very conditions of our being  for the moment it is charming to have a story end happily but after one has lived a certain number of years and read a certain number of novels it is not the prosperous or adverse fortune of the characters that affects one but the good or bad faith of the novelist in dealing with them will he play us false or will he be true in the operation of this or that principle involved i cannot hold him to less account than this he must be true to what life has taught me is the truth and after that he may let any fate betide his people the novel ends well that ends faithfully the greater his power the greater his responsibility before the human conscience which is god in us  but men come and go and what they do in their limited physical lives is of comparatively little moment it is what they say that really survives to bless or to ban and it is the evil which wordsworth felt in goethe that must long sur vive him  there is a kind of thinga kind of metaphysical lie against righteousness and commonsense which is called the unmoral and is supposed to be different from the immoral and it is this which is supposed to cover many of the faults of goethe  his wilhelm meister for example is so far removed within the region of the ideal that its unprincipled its evil principled tenor in regard to women is pronounced unmorality and is therefore inferably harmless but no study of goethe is complete without some recognition of the qualities which caused wordsworth to hurl the book across the room with an indignant perception of its sensuality for the sins of his life goethe was perhaps sufficiently punished in his life by his final marriage with christiane for the sins of his literature many others must suffer  i do not despair however of the day when the poor honest herd of man kind shall give universal utterance to the universal instinct and shall hold selfish power in politics in art in religion for the devil that it is when neither its crazy pride nor its amusing vanity shall be flattered by the puissance of the geniuses who have forgotten their duty to the common weakness and have abused it to their own glory  in that day we shall shudder at many monsters of passion of selfindulgence of heartlessness whom we still more or less openly adore for their genius and shall account no man worshipful whom we do not feel and know to be good  the spectacle of strenuous achievement will then not dazzle or mislead it will not sanctify or palliate iniquity it will only render it the more hideous and pitiable  in fact the whole belief in genius seems to me rather a mischievous superstition and if not mischievous always still always a superstition from the account of those who talk about it genius appears to be the attribute of a sort of very potent and admirable prodigy which god has created out of the common for the astonishment and confusion of the rest of us poor human beings  but do they really believe it  do they mean anything more or less than the mastery which comes to any man according to his powers and diligence in any direction  if not why not have an end of the superstition which has caused our race to go on so long writing and reading of the difference between talent and genius  it is within the memory of middleaged men that the maelstrom existed in the belief of the geographers but we now get on perfectly well without it and why should we still suffer under the notion of genius which keeps so many poor little authorlings trembling in question whether they have it or have only talent  one of the greatest captains who ever lived general u s grant  dw a plain taciturn unaffected soulhas told the story of his wonderful life as unconsciously as if it were all an everyday affair not different from other lives except as a great exigency of the human race gave it importance  so far as he knew he had no natural aptitude for arms and certainly no love for the calling  but he went to west point because as he quaintly tells us his father rather thought he would go and he fought through one war with credit but without glory  the other war which was to claim his powers and his science found him engaged in the most prosaic of peaceful occupations be obeyed its call because he loved his country and not because he loved war  all the world knows the rest and all the world knows that greater military mastery has not been shown than his campaigns illustrated  he does not say this in his book or hint it in any way he gives you the facts and leaves them with you  but the personal memoirs of u s grant written as simply and straightforwardly as his battles were fought couched in the most unpretentious phrase with never a touch of grandiosity or attitudinizing familiar homely in style form a great piece of literature because great literature is nothing more nor less than the clear expression of minds that have some thing great in them whether religion or beauty or deep experience  probably grant would have said that he had no more vocation to literature than he had to war  he owns with something like contrition that he used to read a great many novels but we think he would have denied the soft impeachment of literary power nevertheless he shows it as he showed military power unexpectedly almost miraculously  all the conditions here then are favorable to supposing a case of genius  yet who would trifle with that great heir of fame that plain grand manly soul by speaking of genius and him together  who calls washington a genius  or franklin or bismarck or cavour or columbus or luther or darwin or lincoln  were these men secondrate in their way  or is genius that indefinable preternatural quality sacred to the musicians the painters the sculptors the actors the poets and above all the poets  or is it that the poets having most of the say in this world abuse it to shameless self flattery and would persuade the inarticulate classes that they are on peculiar terms of confidence with the deity     xviii  in general grants confession of novelreading there is a sort of inference that he had wasted his time or else the guilty conscience of the novelist in me imagines such an inference  but however this may be there is certainly no question concerning the intention of a correspondent who once wrote to me after reading some rather bragging claims i had made for fiction as a mental and moral means  i have very grave doubts he said as to the whole list of magnificent things that you seem to think novels have done for the race and can witness in myself many evil things which they have done for me  whatever in my mental makeup is wild and visionary whatever is untrue whatever is injurious i can trace to the perusal of some work of fiction  worse than that they beget such highstrung and supersensitive ideas of life that plain industry and plodding perseverance are despised and matter offact poverty or everyday commonplace distress meets with no sympathy if indeed noticed at all by one who has wept over the impossibly accumulated sufferings of some gaudy hero or heroine  i am not sure that i had the controversy with this correspondent that he seemed to suppose but novels are now so fully accepted by every one pretending to cultivated taste and they really form the whole intellectual life of such immense numbers of people without question of their influence good or bad upon the mind that it is refreshing to have them frankly denounced and to be invited to revise ones ideas and feelings in regard to them  a little honesty or a great deal of honesty in this quest will do the novel as we hope yet to have it and as we have already begun to have it no harm and for my own part i will confess that i believe fiction in the past to have been largely injurious as i believe the stageplay to be still almost wholly injurious through its falsehood its folly its wantonness and its aimlessness  it may be safely assumed that most of the novelreading which people fancy an intellectual pastime is the emptiest dissipation hardly more related to thought or the wholesome exercise of the mental faculties than opiumeating in either case the brain is drugged and left weaker and crazier for the debauch  if this may be called the negative result of the fiction habit the positive injury that most novels work is by no means so easily to be measured in the case of young men whose character they help so much to form or deform and the women of all ages whom they keep so much in ignorance of the world they misrepresent  grown men have little harm from them but in the other cases which are the vast majority they hurt because they are not true not because they are malevolent but because they are idle lies about human nature and the social fabric which it behooves us to know and to understand that we may deal justly with ourselves and with one another one need not go so far as our correspondent and trace to the fiction habit whatever is wild and visionary whatever is untrue whatever is injurious in ones life bad as the fiction habit is it is probably not responsible for the whole sum of evil in its victims and i believe that if the reader will use care in choosing from this fungusgrowth with which the fields of literature teem every day he may nourish himself as with the true mushroom at no risk from the poisonous species  the tests are very plain and simple and they are perfectly infallible if a novel flatters the passions and exalts them above the principles it is poisonous it may not kill but it will certainly injure and this test will alone exclude an entire class of fiction of which eminent examples will occur to all  then the whole spawn of socalled unmoral romances which imagine a world where the sins of sense are unvisited by the penalties following swift or slow but inexorably sure in the real world are deadly poison these do kill  the novels that merely tickle our prejudices and lull our judgment or that coddle our sensibilities or pamper our gross appetite for the marvellous are not so fatal but they are innutritious and clog the soul with unwholesome vapors of all kinds no doubt they too help to weaken the moral fibre and make their readers indifferent to plodding perseverance and plain industry and to matteroffact poverty and commonplace distress  without taking them too seriously it still must be owned that the gaudy hero and heroine are to blame for a great deal of harm in the world that heroine long taught by example if not precept that love or the passion or fancy she mistook for it was the chief interest of a life which is really concerned with a great many other things that it was lasting in the way she knew it that it was worthy of every sacrifice and was altogether a finer thing than prudence obedience reason that love alone was glorious and beautiful and these were mean and ugly in comparison with it  more lately she has begun to idolize and illustrate duty and she is hardly less mischievous in this new role opposing duty as she did love to prudence obedience and reason  the stock hero whom if we met him we could not fail to see was a most deplorable person has undoubtedly imposed himself upon the victims of the fiction habit as admirable  with him too love was and is the great affair whether in its old romantic phase of chivalrous achievement or manifold suffering for loves sake or its more recent development of the virile the bullying and the brutal or its still more recent agonies of selfsacrifice as idle and useless as the moral experiences of the insane asylums  with his vain posturings and his ridiculous splendor he is really a painted barbarian the prey of his passions and his delusions full of obsolete ideals and the motives and ethics of a savage which the guilty author of his being does his bestor his worst in spite of his own light and knowledge to foist upon the reader as something generous and noble  i am not merely bringing this charge against that sort of fiction which is beneath literature and outside of it the shoreless lakes of ditchwater whose miasms fill the air below the empyrean where the great ones sit but i am accusing the work of some of the most famous who have in this instance or in that sinned against the truth which can alone exalt and purify men  i do not say that they have constantly done so or even commonly done so but that they have done so at all marks them as of the past to be read with the due historical allowance for their epoch and their conditions  for i believe that while inferior writers will and must continue to imitate them in their foibles and their errors no one here after will be able to achieve greatness who is false to humanity either in its facts or its duties the light of civilization has already broken even upon the novel and no conscientious man can now set about painting an image of life without perpetual question of the verity of his work and without feeling bound to distinguish so clearly that no reader of his may be misled between what is right and what is wrong what is noble and what is base what is health and what is perdition in the actions and the characters he portrays  the fiction that aims merely to entertainthe fiction that is to serious fiction as the operabouffe the ballet and the pantomime are to the true dramaneed not feel the burden of this obligation so deeply but even such fiction will not be gay or trivial to any readers hurt and criticism should hold it to account if it passes from painting to teaching folly  i confess that i do not care to judge any work of the imagination without first of all applying this test to it  we must ask ourselves before we ask anything else is it truetrue to the motives the impulses the principles that shape the life of actual men and women  this truth which necessarily includes the highest morality and the highest artistry this truth given the book cannot be wicked and cannot be weak and without it all graces of style and feats of invention and cunning of construction are so many superfluities of naughtiness  it is well for the truth to have all these and shine in them but for falsehood they are merely meretricious the bedizenment of the wanton they atone for nothing they count for nothing  but in fact they come naturally of truth and grace it without solicitation they are added unto it  in the whole range of fiction i know of no true picture of lifethat is of human naturewhich is not also a masterpiece of literature full of divine and natural beauty  it may have no touch or tint of this special civilization or of that it had better have this local color well ascertained but the truth is deeper and finer than aspects and if the book is true to what men and women know of one anothers souls it will be true enough and it will be great and beautiful  it is the conception of literature as something apart from life superfinely aloof which makes it really unimportant to the great mass of mankind without a message or a meaning for them and it is the notion that a novel may be false in its portrayal of causes and effects that makes literary art contemptible even to those whom it amuses that forbids them to regard the novelist as a serious or rightminded person  if they do not in some moment of indignation cry out against all novels as my correspondent does they remain besotted in the fume of the delusions purveyed to them with no higher feeling for the author than such maudlin affection as the frequenter of an opiumjoint perhaps knows for the attendant who fills his pipe with the drug  or as in the case of another correspondent who writes that in his youth he read a great many novels but always regarded it as an amusement like horse racing and cardplaying for which he had no time when he entered upon the serious business of life it renders them merely contemptuous  his view of the matter may be commended to the brotherhood and sisterhood of novelists as full of wholesome if bitter suggestion and i urge them not to dismiss it with high literary scorn as that of some boeotian dull to the beauty of art  refuse it as we may it is still the feeling of the vast majority of people for whom life is earnest and who find only a distorted and misleading likeness of it in our books  we may fold ourselves in our scholars gowns and close the doors of our studies and affect to despise this rude voice but we cannot shut it out  it comes to us from wherever men are at work from wherever they are truly living and accuses us of unfaithfulness of triviality of mere stageplay and none of us can escape conviction except he prove himself worthy of his timea time in which the great masters have brought literature back to life and filled its ebbing veins with the red tides of reality  we cannot all equal them we need not copy them but we can all go to the sources of their inspiration and their power and to draw from these no one need go farno one need really go out of himself  fifty years ago carlyle in whom the truth was always alive but in whom it was then unperverted by suffering by celebrity and by despair wrote in his study of diderot were it not reasonable to prophesy that this exceeding great multitude of novelwriters and such like must in a new generation gradually do one of two things either retire into the nurseries and work for children minors and semifatuous persons of both sexes or else what were far better sweep their novelfabric into the dustcart and betake themselves with such faculty as they have to understand and record what is true of which surely there is and will forever be a whole infinitude unknown to us of infinite importance to us poetry it will more and more come to be understood is nothing but higher knowledge and the only genuine romance for grown persons reality  if after half a century fiction still mainly works for children minors and semifatuous persons of both sexes it is nevertheless one of the hopefulest signs of the worlds progress that it has begun to work for grown persons and if not exactly in the way that carlyle might have solely intended in urging its writers to compile memoirs instead of building the novelfabric still it has in the highest and widest sense already made reality its romance  i cannot judge it i do not even care for it except as it has done this and i can hardly conceive of a literary selfrespect in these days compatible with the old trade of makebelieve with the production of the kind of fiction which is too much honored by classification with cardplaying and horseracing  but let fiction cease to lie about life let it portray men and women as they are actuated by the motives and the passions in the measure we all know let it leave off painting dolls and working them by springs and wires let it show the different interests in their true proportions let it forbear to preach pride and revenge folly and insanity egotism and prejudice but frankly own these for what they are in whatever figures and occasions they appear let it not put on fine literary airs let it speak the dialect the language that most americans knowthe language of unaffected people everywhereand there can be no doubt of an unlimited future not only of delightfulness but of usefulness for it     xix  this is what i say in my severer moods but at other times i know that of course no one is going to hold all fiction to such strict account there is a great deal of it which may be very well left to amuse us if it can when we are sick or when we are silly and i am not inclined to despise it in the performance of this office  or if people find pleasure in having their blood curdled for the sake of having it uncurdled again at the end of the book i would not interfere with their amusement though i do not desire it  there is a certain demand in primitive natures for the kind of fiction that does this and the author of it is usually very proud of it  the kind of novels he likes and likes to write are intended to take his readers mind or what that reader would probably call his mind off himself they make one forget life and all its cares and duties they are not in the least like the novels which make you think of these and shame you into at least wishing to be a helpfuller and wholesomer creature than you are  no sordid details of verity here if you please no wretched being humbly and weakly struggling to do right and to be true suffering for his follies and his sins tasting joy only through the mortification of self and in the help of others nothing of all this but a great whirling splendor of peril and achievement a wild scene of heroic adventure and of emotional ground and lofty tumbling with a stage picture at the fall of the curtain and all the good characters in a row their left hands pressed upon their hearts and kissing their right hands to the audience in the old way that has always charmed and always will charm heaven bless it  in a world which loves the spectacular drama and the practically bloodless sports of the modern amphitheatre the author of this sort of fiction has his place and we must not seek to destroy him because he fancies it the first place  in fact it is a condition of his doing well the kind of work he does that he should think it important that he should believe in himself and i would not take away this faith of his even if i could  as i say he has his place  the world often likes to forget itself and he brings on his heroes his goblins his feats his hairbreadth escapes his imminent deadly breaches and the poor foolish childish old world renews the excitements of its nonage perhaps this is a work of beneficence and perhaps our brave conjurer in his cabalistic robe is a philanthropist in disguise  within the last four or five years there has been throughout the whole englishspeaking world what mr grant allen happily calls the recrudescence of taste in fiction  the effect is less noticeable in america than in england where effete philistinism conscious of the dry rot of its conventionality is casting about for cure in anything that is wild and strange and unlike itself  but the recrudescence has been evident enough here too and a writer in one of our periodicals has put into convenient shape some common errors concerning popularity as a test of merit in a book  he seems to think for instance that the love of the marvellous and impossible in fiction which is shown not only by the unthinking multitude clamoring about the book counters for fiction of that sort but by the literary elect also is proof of some principle in human nature which ought to be respected as well as tolerated  he seems to believe that the ebullition of this passion forms a sufficient answer to those who say that art should represent life and that the art which misrepresents life is feeble art and false art  but it appears to me that a little carefuller reasoning from a little closer inspection of the facts would not have brought him to these conclusions in the first place i doubt very much whether the literary elect have been fascinated in great numbers by the fiction in question but if i supposed them to have really fallen under that spell i should still be able to account for their fondness and that of the unthinking multitude upon the same grounds without honoring either very much  it is the habit of hasty casuists to regard civilization as inclusive of all the members of a civilized community but this is a palpable error  many persons in every civilized community live in a state of more or less evident savagery with respect to their habits their morals and their propensities and they are held in check only by the law  many more yet are savage in their tastes as they show by the decoration of their houses and persons and by their choice of books and pictures and these are left to the restraints of public opinion  in fact no man can be said to be thoroughly civilized or always civilized the most refined the most enlightened person has his moods his moments of barbarism in which the best or even the second best shall not please him  at these times the lettered and the unlettered are alike primitive and their gratifications are of the same simple sort the highly cultivated person may then like melodrama impossible fiction and the trapeze as sincerely and thoroughly as a boy of thirteen or a barbarian of any age  i do not blame him for these moods i find something instructive and interesting in them but if they lastingly established themselves in him i could not help deploring the state of that person  no one can really think that the literary elect who are said to have joined the unthinking multitude in clamoring about the book counters for the romances of nomans land take the same kind of pleasure in them as they do in a novel of tolstoy tourguenief george eliot thackeray balzac manzoni hawthorne mr henry james mr thomas hardy senor palacio valdes or even walter scott  they have joined the unthinking multitude perhaps because they are tired of thinking and expect to find relaxation in feelingfeeling crudely grossly merely  for once in a way there is no great harm in this perhaps no harm at all  it is perfectly natural let them have their innocent debauch  but let us distinguish for our own sake and guidance between the different kinds of things that please the same kind of people between the things that please them habitually and those that please them occasionally between the pleasures that edify them and those that amuse them  otherwise we shall be in danger of becoming permanently part of the unthinking multitude and of remaining puerile primitive savage  we shall be so in moods and at moments but let us not fancy that those are high moods or fortunate moments  if they are harmless that is the most that can be said for them  they are lapses from which we can perhaps go forward more vigorously but even this is not certain  my own philosophy of the matter however would not bring me to prohibition of such literary amusements as the writer quoted seems to find significant of a growing indifference to truth and sanity in fiction  once more i say these amusements have their place as the circus has and the burlesque and negro minstrelsy and the ballet and prestidigitation  no one of these is to be despised in its place but we had better understand that it is not the highest place and that it is hardly an intellectual delight  the lapse of all the literary elect in the world could not dignify unreality and their present mood if it exists is of no more weight against that beauty in literature which comes from truth alone and never can come from anything else than the permanent state of the unthinking multitude  yet even as regards the unthinking multitude i believe i am not able to take the attitude of the writer i have quoted  i am afraid that i respect them more than he would like to have me though i cannot always respect their taste any more than that of the literary elect i respect them for their good sense in most practical matters for their laborious honest lives for their kindness their goodwill for that aspiration towards something better than themselves which seems to stir however dumbly in every human breast not abandoned to literary pride or other forms of selfrighteousness  i find every man interesting whether he thinks or unthinks whether he is savage or civilized for this reason i cannot thank the novelist who teaches us not to know but to unknow our kind  yet i should by no means hold him to such strict account as emerson who felt the absence of the best motive even in the greatest of the masters when he said of shakespeare that after all he was only master of the revels  the judgment is so severe even with the praise which precedes it that one winces under it and if one is still young with the world gay before him and life full of joyous promise one is apt to ask defiantly well what is better than being such a master of the revels as shakespeare was  let each judge for himself  to the heart again of serious youth uncontaminate and exigent of ideal good it must always be a grief that the great masters seem so often to have been willing to amuse the leisure and vacancy of meaner men and leave their mission to the soul but partially fulfilled  this perhaps was what emerson had in mind and if he had it in mind of shakespeare who gave us with his histories and comedies and problems such a searching homily as macbeth one feels that he scarcely recognized the limitations of the dramatists art  few consciences at times seem so enlightened as that of this personally unknown person so withdrawn into his work and so lost to the intensest curiosity of aftertime at other times he seems merely elizabethan in his coarseness his courtliness his imperfect sympathy     xx  of the finer kinds of romance as distinguished from the novel i would even encourage the writing though it is one of the hard conditions of romance that its personages starting with a parti pris can rarely be characters with a living growth but are apt to be types limited to the expression of one principle simple elemental lacking the godgiven complexity of motive which we find in all the human beings we know  hawthorne the great master of the romance had the insight and the power to create it anew as a kind in fiction though i am not sure that the scarlet letter and the blithedale romance are not strictly speaking novels rather than romances  they do not play with some old superstition long outgrown and they do not invent a new superstition to play with but deal with things vital in every ones pulse  i am not saying that what may be called the fantastic romancethe romance that descends from frankenstein rather than the scarlet letterought not to be  on the contrary i should grieve to lose it as i should grieve to lose the pantomime or the comic opera or many other graceful things that amuse the passing hour and help us to live agreeably in a world where men actually sin suffer and die  but it belongs to the decorative arts and though it has a high place among them it cannot be ranked with the works of the imaginationthe works that represent and body forth human experience  its ingenuity can always afford a refined pleasure and it can often at some risk to itself convey a valuable truth  perhaps the whole region of historical romance might be reopened with advantage to readers and writers who cannot bear to be brought face to face with human nature but require the haze of distance or a far perspective in which all the disagreeable details shall be lost  there is no good reason why these harmless people should not be amused or their little preferences indulged  but here again i have my modest doubts some recent instances are so fatuous as far as the portrayal of character goes though i find them admirably contrived in some respects  when i have owned the excellence of the staging in every respect and the conscience with which the carpenter as the theatrical folks say has done his work i am at the end of my praises  the people affect me like persons of our generation made up for the parts well trained well costumed but actors and almost amateurs  they have the quality that makes the histrionics of amateurs endurable they are ladies and gentlemen the worst the wickedest of them is a lady or gentleman behind the scene  yet no doubt it is well that there should be a reversion to the earlier types of thinking and feeling to earlier ways of looking at human nature and i will not altogether refuse the pleasure offered me by the poetic romancer or the historical romancer because i find my pleasure chiefly in tolstoy and valdes and thomas hardy and tourguenief and balzac at his best     xxi  it used to be one of the disadvantages of the practice of romance in america which hawthorne more or less whimsically lamented that there were so few shadows and inequalities in our broad level of prosperity and it is one of the reflections suggested by dostoievskys novel the crime and the punishment that whoever struck a note so profoundly tragic in american fiction would do a false and mistaken thingas false and as mistaken in its way as dealing in american fiction with certain nudities which the latin peoples seem to find edifying  whatever their deserts very few american novelists have been led out to be shot or finally exiled to the rigors of a winter at duluth and in a land where journeymen carpenters and plumbers strike for four dollars a day the sum of hunger and cold is comparatively small and the wrong from class to class has been almost inappreciable though all this is changing for the worse  our novelists therefore concern themselves with the more smiling aspects of life which are the more american and seek the universal in the individual rather than the social interests  it is worth while even at the risk of being called commonplace to be true to our welltodo actualities the very passions themselves seem to be softened and modified by conditions which formerly at least could not be said to wrong any one to cramp endeavor or to cross lawful desire sin and suffering and shame there must always be in the world i suppose but i believe that in this new world of ours it is still mainly from one to another one and oftener still from one to ones self  we have death too in america and a great deal of disagreeable and painful disease which the multiplicity of our patent medicines does not seem to cure but this is tragedy that comes in the very nature of things and is not peculiarly american as the large cheerful average of health and success and happy life is  it will not do to boast but it is well to be true to the facts and to see that apart from these purely mortal troubles the race here has enjoyed conditions in which most of the ills that have darkened its annals might be averted by honest work and unselfish behavior  fine artists we have among us and rightminded as far as they go and we must not forget this at evil moments when it seems as if all the women had taken to writing hysterical improprieties and some of the men were trying to be at least as hysterical in despair of being as improper other traits are much more characteristic of our life and our fiction in most american novels vivid and graphic as the best of them are the people are segregated if not sequestered and the scene is sparsely populated  the effect may be in instinctive response to the vacancy of our social life and i shall not make haste to blame it  there are few places few occasions among us in which a novelist can get a large number of polite people together or at least keep them together  unless he carries a snapcamera his picture of them has no probability they affect one like the figures perfunctorily associated in such deadly old engravings as that of washington irving and his friends  perhaps it is for this reason that we excel in small pieces with three or four figures or in studies of rustic communities where there is propinquity if not society  our grasp of more urbane life is feeble most attempts to assemble it in our pictures are failures possibly because it is too transitory too intangible in its nature with us to be truthfully represented as really existent  i am not sure that the americans have not brought the short story nearer perfection in the allround sense that almost any other people and for reasons very simple and near at hand  it might be argued from the national hurry and impatience that it was a literary form peculiarly adapted to the american temperament but i suspect that its extraordinary development among us is owing much more to more tangible facts the success of american magazines which is nothing less than prodigious is only commensurate with their excellence  their sort of success is not only from the courage to decide which ought to please but from the knowledge of what does please and it is probable that aside from the pictures it is the short stories which please the readers of our best magazines  the serial novels they must have of course but rather more of course they must have short stories and by operation of the law of supply and demand the short stories abundant in quantity and excellent in quality are forthcoming because they are wanted  by another operation of the same law which political economists have more recently taken account of the demand follows the supply and short stories are sought for because there is a proven ability to furnish them and people read them willingly because they are usually very good  the art of writing them is now so disciplined and diffused with us that there is no lack either for the magazines or for the newspaper syndicates which deal in them almost to the exclusion of the serials  an interesting fact in regard to the different varieties of the short story among us is that the sketches and studies by the women seem faithfuller and more realistic than those of the men in proportion to their number  their tendency is more distinctly in that direction and there is a solidity an honest observation in the work of such women which often leaves little to be desired  i should upon the whole be disposed to rank american short stories only below those of such russian writers as i have read and i should praise rather than blame their free use of our different local parlances or dialects as people call them  i like this because i hope that our inherited english may be constantly freshened and revived from the native sources which our literary decentralization will help to keep open and i will own that as i turn over novels coming from philadelphia from new mexico from boston from tennessee from rural new england from new york every local flavor of diction gives me courage and pleasure  alphonse daudet in a conversation with h h boyesen said speaking of tourguenief what a luxury it must be to have a great big untrodden barbaric language to wade into  we poor fellows who work in the language of an old civilization we may sit and chisel our little verbal felicities only to find in the end that it is a borrowed jewel we are polishing  the crown jewels of our french tongue have passed through the hands of so many generations of monarchs that it seems like presumption on the part of any lateborn pretender to attempt to wear them  this grief is of course a little whimsical yet it has a certain measure of reason in it and the same regret has been more seriously expressed by the italian poet aleardi            muse of an aged people in the eve           of fading civilization i was born                 oh fortunate           my sisters who in the heroic dawn           of races sung  to them did destiny give           the virgin fire and chaste ingenuousness           of their lands speech and reverenced their hands           ran over potent strings  it will never do to allow that we are at such a desperate pass in english but something of this divine despair we may feel too in thinking of the spacious times of great elizabeth when the poets were trying the stops of the young language and thrilling with the surprises of their own music  we may comfort ourselves however unless we prefer a luxury of grief by remembering that no language is ever old on the lips of those who speak it no matter how decrepit it drops from the pen we have only to leave our studies editorial and other and go into the shops and fields to find the spacious times again and from the beginning realism before she had put on her capital letter had divined this nearathand truth along with the rest  lowell almost the greatest and finest realist who ever wrought in verse showed us that elizabeth was still queen where he heard yankee farmers talk  one need not invite slang into the company of its betters though perhaps slang has been dropping its s and becoming language ever since the world began and is certainly sometimes delightful and forcible beyond the reach of the dictionary  i would not have any one go about for new words but if one of them came aptly not to reject its help  for our novelists to try to write americanly from any motive would be a dismal error but being born americans i then use americanisms whenever these serve their turn and when their characters speak i should like to hear them speak true american with all the varying tennesseean philadelphian bostonian and new york accents  if we bother ourselves to write what the critics imagine to be english we shall be priggish and artificial and still more so if we make our americans talk english  there is also this serious disadvantage about english that if we wrote the best english in the world probably the english themselves would not know it or if they did certainly would not own it  it has always been supposed by grammarians and purists that a language can be kept as they find it but languages while they live are perpetually changing  god apparently meant them for the common people and the common people will use them freely as they use other gifts of god  on their lips our continental english will differ more and more from the insular english and i believe that this is not deplorable but desirable  in fine i would have our american novelists be as american as they unconsciously can  matthew arnold complained that he found no distinction in our life and i would gladly persuade all artists intending greatness in any kind among us that the recognition of the fact pointed out by mr arnold ought to be a source of inspiration to them and not discouragement  we have been now some hundred years building up a state on the affirmation of the essential equality of men in their rights and duties and whether we have been right or been wrong the gods have taken us at our word and have responded to us with a civilization in which there is no distinction perceptible to the eye that loves and values it  such beauty and such grandeur as we have is common beauty common grandeur or the beauty and grandeur in which the quality of solidarity so prevails that neither distinguishes itself to the disadvantage of anything else  it seems to me that these conditions invite the artist to the study and the appreciation of the common and to the portrayal in every art of those finer and higher aspects which unite rather than sever humanity if he would thrive in our new order of things  the talent that is robust enough to front the everyday world and catch the charm of its workworn careworn brave kindly face need not fear the encounter though it seems terrible to the sort nurtured in the superstition of the romantic the bizarre the heroic the distinguished as the things alone worthy of painting or carving or writing  the arts must become democratic and then we shall have the expression of america in art and the reproach which arnold was half right in making us shall have no justice in it any longer we shall be distinguished     xxii  in the mean time it has been said with a superficial justice that our fiction is narrow though in the same sense i suppose the present english fiction is as narrow as our own and most modern fiction is narrow in a certain sense  in italy the best men are writing novels as brief and restricted in range as ours in spain the novels are intense and deep and not spacious the french school with the exception of zola is narrow the norwegians are narrow the russians except tolstoy are narrow and the next greatest after him tourguenief is the narrowest great novelist as to mere dimensions that ever lived dealing nearly always with small groups isolated and analyzed in the most american fashion  in fact the charge of narrowness accuses the whole tendency of modern fiction as much as the american school  but i do not by any means allow that this narrowness is a defect while denying that it is a universal characteristic of our fiction it is rather for the present a virtue  indeed i should call the present american work north and south thorough rather than narrow  in one sense it is as broad as life for each man is a microcosm and the writer who is able to acquaint us intimately with half a dozen people or the conditions of a neighborhood or a class has done something which cannot in any bad sense be called narrow his breadth is vertical instead of lateral that is all and this depth is more desirable than horizontal expansion in a civilization like ours where the differences are not of classes but of types and not of types either so much as of characters  a new method was necessary in dealing with the new conditions and the new method is worldwide because the whole world is more or less americanized  tolstoy is exceptionally voluminous among modern writers even russian writers and it might be said that the forte of tolstoy himself is not in his breadth sidewise but in his breadth upward and downward  the death of ivan ilyitch leaves as vast an impression on the readers soul as any episode of war and peace which indeed can be recalled only in episodes and not as a whole  i think that our writers may be safely counselled to continue their work in the modern way because it is the best way yet known  if they make it true it will be large no matter what its superficies are and it would be the greatest mistake to try to make it big  a big book is necessarily a group of episodes more or less loosely connected by a thread of narrative and there seems no reason why this thread must always be supplied  each episode may be quite distinct or it may be one of a connected group the final effect will be from the truth of each episode not from the size of the group  the whole field of human experience as never so nearly covered by imaginative literature in any age as in this and american life especially is getting represented with unexampled fulness  it is true that no one writer no one book represents it for that is not possible our social and political decentralization forbids this and may forever forbid it  but a great number of very good writers are instinctively striving to make each part of the country and each phase of our civilization known to all the other parts and their work is not narrow in any feeble or vicious sense  the world was once very little and it is now very large  formerly all science could be grasped by a single mind but now the man who hopes to become great or useful in science must devote himself to a single department  it is so in everythingall arts all trades and the novelist is not superior to the universal rule against universality  he contributes his share to a thorough knowledge of groups of the human race under conditions which are full of inspiring novelty and interest  he works more fearlessly frankly and faithfully than the novelist ever worked before his work or much of it may be destined never to be reprinted from the monthly magazines but if he turns to his bookshelf and regards the array of the british or other classics he knows that they too are for the most part dead he knows that the planet itself is destined to freeze up and drop into the sun at last with all its surviving literature upon it  the question is merely one of time  he consoles himself therefore if he is wise and works on and we may all take some comfort from the thought that most things cannot be helped  especially a movement in literature like that which the world is now witnessing cannot be helped and we could no more turn back and be of the literary fashions of any age before this than we could turn back and be of its social economical or political conditions  if i were authorized to address any word directly to our novelists i should say do not trouble yourselves about standards or ideals but try to be faithful and natural remember that there is no greatness no beauty which does not come from truth to your own knowledge of things and keep on working even if your work is not long remembered  at least threefifths of the literature called classic in all languages no more lives than the poems and stories that perish monthly in our magazines  it is all printed and reprinted generation after generation century after century but it is not alive it is as dead as the people who wrote it and read it and to whom it meant something perhaps with whom it was a fashion a caprice a passing taste  a superstitious piety preserves it and pretends that it has aesthetic qualities which can delight or edify but nobody really enjoys it except as a reflection of the past moods and humors of the race or a revelation of the authors character otherwise it is trash and often very filthy trash which the present trash generally is not     xxiii  one of the great newspapers the other day invited the prominent american authors to speak their minds upon a point in the theory and practice of fiction which had already vexed some of them  it was the question of how much or how little the american novel ought to deal with certain facts of life which are not usually talked of before young people and especially young ladies  of course the question was not decided and i forget just how far the balance inclined in favor of a larger freedom in the matter but it certainly inclined that way one or two writers of the sex which is somehow supposed to have purity in its keeping as if purity were a thing that did not practically concern the other sex preoccupied with serious affairs gave it a rather vigorous tilt to that side  in view of this fact it would not be the part of prudence to make an effort to dress the balance and indeed i do not know that i was going to make any such effort  but there are some things to say around and about the subject which i should like to have some one else say and which i may myself possibly be safe in suggesting  one of the first of these is the fact generally lost sight of by those who censure the anglosaxon novel for its prudishness that it is really not such a prude after all and that if it is sometimes apparently anxious to avoid those experiences of life not spoken of before young people this may be an appearance only  sometimes a novel which has this shuffling air this effect of truckling to propriety might defend itself if it could speak for itself by saying that such experiences happened not to come within its scheme and that so far from maiming or mutilating itself in ignoring them it was all the more faithfully representative of the tone of modern life in dealing with love that was chaste and with passion so honest that it could be openly spoken of before the tenderest society bud at dinner  it might say that the guilty intrigue the betrayal the extreme flirtation even was the exceptional thing in life and unless the scheme of the story necessarily involved it that it would be bad art to lug it in and as bad taste as to introduce such topics in a mixed company  it could say very justly that the novel in our civilization now always addresses a mixed company and that the vast majority of the company are ladies and that very many if not most of these ladies are young girls  if the novel were written for men and for married women alone as in continental europe it might be altogether different  but the simple fact is that it is not written for them alone among us and it is a question of writing under cover of our universal acceptance things for young girls to read which you would be put outofdoors for saying to them or of frankly giving notice of your intention and so cutting yourself off from the pleasureand it is a very high and sweet one of appealing to these vivid responsive intelligences which are none the less brilliant and admirable because they are innocent  one day a novelist who liked after the manner of other men to repine at his hard fate complained to his friend a critic that he was tired of the restriction he had put upon himself in this regard for it is a mistake as can be readily shown to suppose that others impose it  see how free those french fellows are he rebelled  shall we always be shut up to our tradition of decency  do you think its much worse than being shut up to their tradition of indecency said his friend  then that novelist began to reflect and he remembered how sick the invariable motive of the french novel made him  he perceived finally that convention for convention ours was not only more tolerable but on the whole was truer to life not only to its complexion but also to its texture  no one will pretend that there is not vicious love beneath the surface of our society if he did the fetid explosions of the divorce trials would refute him but if he pretended that it was in any just sense characteristic of our society he could be still more easily refuted  yet it exists and it is unquestionably the material of tragedy the stuff from which intense effects are wrought  the question after owning this fact is whether these intense effects are not rather cheap effects  i incline to think they are and i will try to say why i think so if i may do so without offence  the material itself the mere mention of it has an instant fascination it arrests it detains till the last word is said and while there is anything to be hinted  this is what makes a love intrigue of some sort all but essential to the popularity of any fiction  without such an intrigue the intellectual equipment of the author must be of the highest and then he will succeed only with the highest class of readers  but any author who will deal with a guilty love intrigue holds all readers in his hand the highest with the lowest as long as he hints the slightest hope of the smallest potential naughtiness  he need not at all be a great author he may be a very shabby wretch if he has but the courage or the trick of that sort of thing  the critics will call him virile and passionate decent people will be ashamed to have been limed by him but the low average will only ask another chance of flocking into his net  if he happens to be an able writer his really fine and costly work will be unheeded and the lure to the appetite will be chiefly remembered  there may be other qualities which make reputations for other men but in his case they will count for nothing  he pays this penalty for his success in that kind and every one pays some such penalty who deals with some such material  but i do not mean to imply that his case covers the whole ground  so far as it goes though it ought to stop the mouths of those who complain that fiction is enslaved to propriety among us  it appears that of a certain kind of impropriety it is free to give us all it will and more but this is not what serious men and women writing fiction mean when they rebel against the limitations of their art in our civilization  they have no desire to deal with nakedness as painters and sculptors freely do in the worship of beauty or with certain facts of life as the stage does in the service of sensation  but they ask why when the conventions of the plastic and histrionic arts liberate their followers to the portrayal of almost any phase of the physical or of the emotional nature an american novelist may not write a story on the lines of anna karenina or madame bovary  they wish to touch one of the most serious and sorrowful problems of life in the spirit of tolstoy and flaubert and they ask why they may not  at one time they remind us the anglosaxon novelist did deal with such problemsde foe in his spirit richardson in his goldsmith in his  at what moment did our fiction lose this privilege  in what fatal hour did the young girl arise and seal the lips of fiction with a touch of her finger to some of the most vital interests of life  whether i wished to oppose them in their aspiration for greater freedom or whether i wished to encourage them i should begin to answer them by saying that the young girl has never done anything of the kind  the manners of the novel have been improving with those of its readers that is all  gentlemen no longer swear or fall drunk under the table or abduct young ladies and shut them up in lonely countryhouses or so habitually set about the ruin of their neighbors wives as they once did  generally people now call a spade an agricultural implement they have not grown decent without having also grown a little squeamish but they have grown comparatively decent there is no doubt about that  they require of a novelist whom they respect unquestionable proof of his seriousness if he proposes to deal with certain phases of life they require a sort of scientific decorum  he can no longer expect to be received on the ground of entertainment only he assumes a higher function something like that of a physician or a priest and they expect him to be bound by laws as sacred as those of such professions they hold him solemnly pledged not to betray them or abuse their confidence  if he will accept the conditions they give him their confidence and he may then treat to his greater honor and not at all to his disadvantage of such experiences such relations of men and women as george eliot treats in adam bede in daniel deronda in romola in almost all her books such as hawthorne treats in the scarlet letter such as dickens treats in david copperfield such as thackeray treats in pendennis and glances at in every one of his fictions such as most of the masters of english fiction have at same time treated more or less openly  it is quite false or quite mistaken to suppose that our novels have left untouched these most important realities of life  they have only not made them their stock in trade they have kept a true perspective in regard to them they have relegated them in their pictures of life to the space and place they occupy in life itself as we know it in england and america  they have kept a correct proportion knowing perfectly well that unless the novel is to be a map with everything scrupulously laid down in it a faithful record of life in far the greater extent could be made to the exclusion of guilty love and all its circumstances and consequences  i justify them in this view not only because i hate what is cheap and meretricious and hold in peculiar loathing the cant of the critics who require passion as something in itself admirable and desirable in a novel but because i prize fidelity in the historian of feeling and character  most of these critics who demand passion would seem to have no conception of any passion but one  yet there are several other passions the passion of grief the passion of avarice the passion of pity the passion of ambition the passion of hate the passion of envy the passion of devotion the passion of friendship and all these have a greater part in the drama of life than the passion of love and infinitely greater than the passion of guilty love  wittingly or unwittingly english fiction and american fiction have recognized this truth not fully not in the measure it merits but in greater degree than most other fiction     xxiv  who can deny that fiction would be incomparably stronger incomparably truer if once it could tear off the habit which enslaves it to the celebration chiefly of a single passion in one phase or another and could frankly dedicate itself to the service of all the passions all the interests all the facts  every novelist who has thought about his art knows that it would and i think that upon reflection he must doubt whether his sphere would be greatly enlarged if he were allowed to treat freely the darker aspects of the favorite passion  but as i have shown the privilege the right to do this is already perfectly recognized this is proved again by the fact that serious criticism recognizes as masterworks i will not push the question of supremacy the two great novels which above all others have moved the world by their study of guilty love  if by any chance if by some prodigious miracle any american should now arise to treat it on the level of anna karenina and madame bovary he would be absolutely sure of success and of fame and gratitude as great as those books have won for their authors  but what editor of what american magazine would print such a story  certainly i do not think any one would and here our novelist must again submit to conditions  if he wishes to publish such a story supposing him to have once written it he must publish it as a book  a book is something by itself responsible for its character which becomes quickly known and it does not necessarily penetrate to every member of the household  the father or the mother may say to the child i would rather you wouldnt read that book if the child cannot be trusted the book may be locked up  but with the magazine and its serial the affair is different  between the editor of a reputable english or american magazine and the families which receive it there is a tacit agreement that he will print nothing which a father may not read to his daughter or safely leave her to read herself  after all it is a matter of business and the insurgent novelist should consider the situation with coolness and commonsense  the editor did not create the situation but it exists and he could not even attempt to change it without many sorts of disaster  he respects it therefore with the good faith of an honest man  even when he is himself a novelist with ardor for his art and impatience of the limitations put upon it he interposes his veto as thackeray did in the case of trollope when a contributor approaches forbidden ground  it does not avail to say that the daily papers teem with facts far fouler and deadlier than any which fiction could imagine  that is true but it is true also that the sex which reads the most novels reads the fewest newspapers and besides the reporter does not command the novelists skill to fix impressions in a young girls mind or to suggest conjecture the magazine is a little despotic a little arbitrary but unquestionably its favor is essential to success and its conditions are not such narrow ones  you cannot deal with tolstoys and flauberts subjects in the absolute artistic freedom of tolstoy and flaubert since de foe that is unknown among us but if you deal with them in the manner of george eliot of thackeray of dickens of society you may deal with them even in the magazines  there is no other restriction upon you  all the horrors and miseries and tortures are open to you your pages may drop blood sometimes it may happen that the editor will even exact such strong material from you  but probably he will require nothing but the observance of the convention in question and if you do not yourself prefer bloodshed he will leave you free to use all sweet and peaceable means of interesting his readers  it is no narrow field he throws open to you with that little sign to keep off the grass up at one point only  its vastness is still almost unexplored and whole regions in it are unknown to the fictionist  dig anywhere and do but dig deep enough and you strike riches or if you are of the mind to range the gentler climes the softer temperatures the serener skies are all free to you and are so little visited that the chance of novelty is greater among them     xxv  while the americans have greatly excelled in the short story generally they have almost created a species of it in the thanksgiving story we have transplanted the christmas story from england while the thanksgiving story is native to our air but both are of anglosaxon growth  their difference is from a difference of environment and the christmas story when naturalized among us becomes almost identical in motive incident and treatment with the thanksgiving story  if i were to generalize a distinction between them i should say that the one dealt more with marvels and the other more with morals and yet the critic should beware of speaking too confidently on this point  it is certain however that the christmas season is meteorologically more favorable to the effective return of persons long supposed lost at sea or from a prodigal life or from a darkened mind  the longer darker and colder nights are better adapted to the apparition of ghosts and to all manner of signs and portents while they seem to present a wider field for the intervention of angels in behalf of orphans and outcasts  the dreams of elderly sleepers at this time are apt to be such as will effect a lasting change in them when they awake turning them from the hard cruel and grasping habits of a lifetime and reconciling them to their sons daughters and nephews who have thwarted them in marriage or softening them to their meek uncomplaining wives whose hearts they have trampled upon in their reckless pursuit of wealth and generally disposing them to a distribution of hampers among the sick and poor and to a friendly reception of gentlemen with charity subscription papers  ships readily drive upon rocks in the early twilight and offer exciting difficulties of salvage and the heavy snows gather quickly round the steps of wanderers who lie down to die in them preparatory to their discovery and rescue by immediate relatives  the midnight weather is also very suitable for encounter with murderers and burglars and the contrast of its freezing gloom with the light and cheer indoors promotes the gayeties which merge at all wellregulated countryhouses in love and marriage  in the region of pure character no moment could be so available for flinging off the mask of frivolity or imbecility or savagery which one has worn for ten or twenty long years say for the purpose of foiling some villain and surprising the reader and helping the author out with his plot  persons abroad in the alps or apennines or pyrenees or anywhere seeking shelter in the huts of shepherds or the dens of smugglers find no time like it for lying in a feigned slumber and listening to the whispered machinations of their suspicious looking entertainers and then suddenly starting up and fighting their way out or else springing from the real sleep into which they have sunk exhausted and finding it broad day and the good peasants whom they had so unjustly doubted waiting breakfast for them  we need not point out the superior advantages of the christmas season for anything one has a mind to do with the french revolution of the arctic explorations or the indian mutiny or the horrors of siberian exile there is no time so good for the use of this material and ghosts on shipboard are notoriously fond of christmas eve  in our own logging camps the man who has gone into the woods for the winter after quarrelling with his wife then hears her sad appealing voice and is moved to good resolutions as at no other period of the year and in the mining regions first in california and later in colorado the hardened reprobate dying in his boots smells his mothers doughnuts and breathes his last in a soliloquized vision of the old home and the little brother or sister or the old father coming to meet him from heaven while his rude companions listen round him and dry their eyes on the butts of their revolvers  it has to be very grim all that to be truly effective and here already we have a touch in the americanized christmas story of the moralistic quality of the american thanksgiving story  this was seldom written at first for the mere entertainment of the reader it was meant to entertain him of course but it was meant to edify him too and to improve him and some such intention is still present in it  i rather think that it deals more probably with character to this end than its english cousin the christmas story does  it is not so improbable that a man should leave off being a drunkard on thanksgiving as that he should leave off being a curmudgeon on christmas that he should conquer his appetite as that he should instantly change his nature by good resolutions  he would be very likely indeed to break his resolutions in either case but not so likely in the one as in the other  generically the thanksgiving story is cheerfuller in its drama and simpler in its persons than the christmas story  rarely has it dealt with the supernatural either the apparition of ghosts or the intervention of angels  the weather being so much milder at the close of november than it is a month later very little can be done with the elements though on the coast a northeasterly storm has been and can be very usefully employed  the thanksgiving story is more restricted in its range the scene is still mostly in new england and the characters are of new england extraction who come home from the west usually or new york for the event of the little drama whatever it may be  it may be the reconciliation of kinsfolk who have quarrelled or the union of lovers long estranged or husbands and wives who have had hard words and parted or mothers who had thought their sons dead in california and find themselves agreeably disappointed in their return or fathers who for old times sake receive back their erring and conveniently dying daughters the notes are not many which this simple music sounds but they have a sabbath tone mostly and win the listener to kindlier thoughts and better moods  the art is at its highest in some strong sketch of rose terry cookes or some perfectly satisfying study of miss jewetts or some graphic situation of miss wilkinss and then it is a very fine art but mostly it is poor and rude enough and makes openly shamelessly for the readers emotions as well as his morals  it is inclined to be rather descriptive  the turkey the pumpkin the cornfield figure throughout and the leafless woods are blue and cold against the evening sky behind the low hiproofed oldfashioned homestead  the parlance is usually the yankee dialect and its western modifications  the thanksgiving story is mostly confined in scene to the country it does not seem possible to do much with it in town and it is a serious question whether with its geographical and topical limitations it can hold its own against the christmas story and whether it would not be well for authors to consider a combination with its elder rival  the two feasts are so near together in point of time that they could be easily covered by the sentiment of even a brief narrative  under the agglutinated style of a thanksgivingchristmas story fiction appropriate to both could be produced and both could be employed naturally and probably in the transaction of its affairs and the development of its characters  the plot for such a story could easily be made to include a totalabstinence pledge and family reunion at thanksgiving and an apparition and spiritual regeneration over a bowl of punch at christmas     xxvi  it would be interesting to know the far beginnings of holiday literature and i commend the quest to the scientific spirit which now specializes research in every branch of history  in the mean time without being too confident of the facts i venture to suggest that it came in with the romantic movement about the beginning of this century when mountains ceased to be horrid and became picturesque when ruins of all sorts but particularly abbeys and castles became habitable to the most delicate constitutions when the despised gothick of addison dropped its k and arose the chivalrous and religious gothic of scott when ghosts were redeemed from the contempt into which they had fallen and resumed their place in polite society in fact the politer the society the welcomer the ghosts and whatever else was out of the common  in that day the annual flourished and this artificial flower was probably the first literary blossom on the christmas tree which has since borne so much tinsel foliage and painted fruit  but the annual was extremely oriental it was much preoccupied with haidees and gulnares and zuleikas with hindas and nourmahals owing to the distinction which byron and moore had given such ladies and when it began to concern itself with the actualities of british beauty the daughters of albion though inscribed with the names of real countesses and duchesses betrayed their descent from the wellknown eastern odalisques  it was possibly through an american that holiday literature became distinctively english in material and washington irving with his new world love of the past may have given the impulse to the literary worship of christmas which has since so widely established itself  a festival revived in popular interest by a newyorker to whom dutch associations with newyears had endeared the german ideal of christmas and whom the robust gayeties of the season in oldfashioned countryhouses had charmed would be one of those roundabout results which destiny likes and would at least be early english  if we cannot claim with all the patriotic confidence we should like to feel that it was irving who set christmas in that light in which dickens saw its aesthetic capabilities it is perhaps because all origins are obscure  for anything that we positively know to the contrary the druidic rites from which english christmas borrowed the inviting mistletoe if not the decorative holly may have been accompanied by the recitations of holiday triads  but it is certain that several plays of shakespeare were produced if not written for the celebration of the holidays and that then the black tide of puritanism which swept over mens souls blotted out all such observance of christmas with the festival itself  it came in again by a natural reaction with the returning stuarts and throughout the period of the restoration it enjoyed a perfunctory favor  there is mention of it often enough in the eighteenthcentury essayists in the spectators and idlers and tatlers but the world about the middle of the last century laments the neglect into which it had fallen  irving seems to have been the first to observe its surviving rites lovingly and dickens divined its immense advantage as a literary occasion  he made it in some sort entirely his for a time and there can be no question but it was he who again endeared it to the whole englishspeaking world and gave it a wider and deeper hold than it had ever had before upon the fancies and affections of our race  the might of that great talent no one can gainsay though in the light of the truer work which has since been done his literary principles seem almost as grotesque as his theories of political economy  in no one direction was his erring force more felt than in the creation of holiday literature as we have known it for the last halfcentury  creation of course is the wrong word it says too much but in default of a better word it may stand  he did not make something out of nothing the material was there before him the mood and even the need of his time contributed immensely to his success as the volition of the subject helps on the mesmerist but it is within bounds to say that he was the chief agency in the development of holiday literature as we have known it as he was the chief agency in universalizing the great christian holiday as we now have it  other agencies wrought with him and after him but it was he who rescued christmas from puritan distrust and humanized it and consecrated it to the hearts and homes of all  very rough magic as it now seems he used in working his miracle but there is no doubt about his working it  one opens his christmas stories in this later daythe carol the chimes the haunted man the cricket on the hearth and all the restand with a heart highsorrowful and cloyed asks himself for the preternatural virtue that they once had the pathos appears false and strained the humor largely horseplay the character theatrical the joviality pumped the psychology commonplace the sociology alone funny  it is a world of real clothes earth air water and the rest the people often speak the language of life but their motives are as disproportioned and improbable and their passions and purposes as overcharged as those of the worst of balzacs people yet all these monstrosities as they now appear seem to have once had symmetry and verity they moved the most cultivated intelligences of the time they touched true hearts they made everybody laugh and cry  this was perhaps because the imagination from having been fed mostly upon gross unrealities always responds readily to fantastic appeals there has been an amusing sort of awe of it as if it were the channel of inspired thought and were somehow sacred  the most preposterous inventions of its activity have been regarded in their time as the greatest feats of the human mind and in its receptive form it has been nursed into an imbecility to which the truth is repugnant and the fact that the beautiful resides nowhere else is inconceivable  it has been flattered out of all sufferance in its toyings with the mere elements of character and its attempts to present these in combinations foreign to experience are still praised by the poorer sort of critics as masterpieces of creative work  in the day of dickenss early christmas stories it was thought admirable for the author to take types of humanity which everybody knew and to add to them from his imagination till they were as strange as beasts and birds talking  now we begin to feel that human nature is quite enough and that the best an author can do is to show it as it is  but in those stories of his dickens said to his readers let us make believe soand so and the result was a joint juggle a childsplay in which the wholesome allegiance to life was lost  artistically therefore the scheme was false and artistically therefore it must perish  it did not perish however before it had propagated itself in a whole school of unrealities so ghastly that one can hardly recall without a shudder those sentimentalities at secondhand to which holiday literature was abandoned long after the original conjurer had wearied of his performance  under his own eye and of conscious purpose a circle of imitators grew up in the fabrication of christmas stories  they obviously formed themselves upon his sobered ideals they collaborated with him and it was often hard to know whether it was dickens or sala or collins who was writing  the christmas book had by that time lost its direct application to christmas  it dealt with shipwrecks a good deal and with perilous adventures of all kinds and with unmerited suffering and with ghosts and mysteries because human nature secure from storm and danger in a welllighted room before a cheerful fire likes to have these things imaged for it and its longpuerilized fancy will bear an endless repetition of them  the wizards who wrought their spells with them contented themselves with the lasting efficacy of these simple means and the apprenticewizards and journeymanwizards who have succeeded them practise the same arts at the old stand but the ethical intention which gave dignity to dickenss christmas stories of still earlier date has almost wholly disappeared  it was a quality which could not be worked so long as the phantoms and hairbreadth escapes  people always knew that character is not changed by a dream in a series of tableaux that a ghost cannot do much towards reforming an inordinately selfish person that a life cannot be turned white like a head of hair in a single night by the most allegorical apparition that want and sin and shame cannot be cured by kettles singing on the hob and gradually they ceased to make believe that there was virtue in these devices and appliances  yet the ethical intention was not fruitless crude as it now appears  it was well once a year if not oftener to remind men by parable of the old simple truths to teach them that forgiveness and charity and the endeavor for life better and purer than each has lived are the principles upon which alone the world holds together and gets forward it was well for the comfortable and the refined to be put in mind of the savagery and suffering all round them and to be taught as dickens was always teaching that certain feelings which grace human nature as tenderness for the sick and helpless selfsacrifice and generosity selfrespect and manliness and womanliness are the common heritage of the race the direct gift of heaven shared equally by the rich and poor it did not necessarily detract from the value of the lesson that with the imperfect art of the time he made his paupers and porters not only human but superhuman and too altogether virtuous and it remained true that home life may be lovely under the lowliest roof although he liked to paint it without a shadow on its beauty there  it is still a fact that the sick are very often saintly although he put no peevishness into their patience with their ills  his ethical intention told for manhood and fraternity and tolerance and when this intention disappeared from the better holiday literature that literature was sensibly the poorer for the loss     xxvii  but if the humanitarian impulse has mostly disappeared from christmas fiction i think it has never so generally characterized all fiction one may refuse to recognize this impulse one may deny that it is in any greater degree shaping life than ever before but no one who has the current of literature under his eye can fail to note it there  people are thinking and feeling generously if not living justly in our time it is a day of anxiety to be saved from the curse that is on selfishness of eager question how others shall be helped of bold denial that the conditions in which we would fain have rested are sacred or immutable especially in america where the race has gained a height never reached before the eminence enables more men than ever before to see how even here vast masses of men are sunk in misery that must grow every day more hopeless or embroiled in a struggle for mere life that must end in enslaving and imbruting them  art indeed is beginning to find out that if it does not make friends with need it must perish  it perceives that to take itself from the many and leave them no joy in their work and to give itself to the few whom it can bring no joy in their idleness is an error that kills  the men and women who do the hard work of the world have learned that they have a right to pleasure in their toil and that when justice is done them they will have it  in all ages poetry has affirmed something of this sort but it remained for ours to perceive it and express it somehow in every form of literature  but this is only one phase of the devotion of the best literature of our time to the service of humanity  no book written with a low or cynical motive could succeed now no matter how brilliantly written and the work done in the past to the glorification of mere passion and power to the deification of self appears monstrous and hideous  the romantic spirit worshipped genius worshipped heroism but at its best in such a man as victor hugo this spirit recognized the supreme claim of the lowest humanity  its error was to idealize the victims of society to paint them impossibly virtuous and beautiful but truth which has succeeded to the highest mission of romance paints these victims as they are and bids the world consider them not because they are beautiful and virtuous but because they are ugly and vicious cruel filthy and only not altogether loathsome because the divine can never wholly die out of the human  the truth does not find these victims among the poor alone among the hungry the houseless the ragged but it also finds them among the rich cursed with the aimlessness the satiety the despair of wealth wasting their lives in a fools paradise of shows and semblances with nothing real but the misery that comes of insincerity and selfishness  i do not think the fiction of our own time even always equal to this work or perhaps more than seldom so  but as i once expressed to the longreverberating discontent of two continents fiction is now a finer art than it has been hitherto and more nearly meets the requirements of the infallible standard  i have hopes of real usefulness in it because it is at last building on the only sure foundation but i am by no means certain that it will be the ultimate literary form or will remain as important as we believe it is destined to become  on the contrary it is quite imaginable that when the great mass of readers now sunk in the foolish joys of mere fable shall be lifted to an interest in the meaning of things through the faithful portrayal of life in fiction then fiction the most faithful may be superseded by a still more faithful form of contemporaneous history  i willingly leave the precise character of this form to the more robust imagination of readers whose minds have been nurtured upon romantic novels and who really have an imagination worth speaking of and confine myself as usual to the hither side of the regions of conjecture  the art which in the mean time disdains the office of teacher is one of the last refuges of the aristocratic spirit which is disappearing from politics and society and is now seeking to shelter itself in aesthetics the pride of caste is becoming the pride of taste but as before it is averse to the mass of men it consents to know them only in some conventionalized and artificial guise  it seeks to withdraw itself to stand aloof to be distinguished and not to be identified  democracy in literature is the reverse of all this  it wishes to know and to tell the truth confident that consolation and delight are there it does not care to paint the marvellous and impossible for the vulgar many or to sentimentalize and falsify the actual for the vulgar few  men are more like than unlike one another let us make them know one another better that they may be all humbled and strengthened
