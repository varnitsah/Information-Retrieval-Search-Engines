33504305	odd craft  by ww jacobs    dixons return  talking about eddication said the nightwatchman thoughtfully the finest eddication you can give a lad is to send im to sea  school is all right up to a certain pint but arter that comes the sea  ive been there myself and i know wot im talking about  all that i am i owe to aving been to sea  illustration talking about eddication said the nightwatchman  theres a saying that boys will be boys  thats all right till they go to sea and then they ave to be men and good men too  they get knocked about a bit o course but thats all part o the eddication and when they get bigger they pass the eddication theyve received on to other boys smaller than wot they are  arter id been at sea a year i spent all my fust time ashore going round and looking for boys wot ad knocked me about afore i sailed and there was only one out o the whole lot that i wished i adnt found  most people o course go to sea as boys or else not at all but i mind one chap as was pretty near thirty years old when e started  its a good many years ago now and he was landlord of a publicouse as used to stand in wapping called the blue lion  his mother wot had ad the pub afore im ad brought im up very quiet and genteel and when she died e went and married a fine handsome young woman who ad got her eye on the pub without thinking much about im  i got to know about it through knowing the servant that lived there  a nice quiet gal she was and there wasnt much went on that she didnt hear  ive known er to cry for hours with the earache pore gal  not caring much for er usband and being spoiled by im into the bargain mrs dixon soon began to lead im a terrible life  she was always throwing his meekness and mildness up into is face and arter they ad been married two or three years he was no more like the landlord o that publicouse than im like a lord  not so much  she used to get into such terrible tempers there was no doing anything with er and for the sake o peace and quietness he gave way to er till e got into the habit of it and couldnt break imself of it  they adnt been married long afore she ad her cousin charlie burge come in as barman and a month or two arter that is brother bob who ad been spending a lot o time looking for work instead o doing it came too  they was so comfortable there that their fathera ousepainter by tradecame round to see whether he couldnt paint the blue lion up a bit and make em look smart so that theyd get more trade  he was one o these ere fustclass ousepainters that can go to sleep on a ladder holding a brush in one hand and a pot o paint in the other and by the time he ad finished painting the ouse it was ready to be done all over agin  i dare say that george dixonthat was is namewouldnt ha minded so much if is wife ad only been civil but instead o that she used to make fun of im and order im about and byandby the others began to try the same thing  as i said afore dixon was a very quiet man and if there was ever anybody to be put outside charlie or bob used to do it they tried to put me outside once the two of em but they ony did it at last by telling me that somebody ad gone off and left a pot o beer standing on the pavement  they was both of em fairly strong young chaps with a lot of bounce in em and she used to say to her usband wot fine young fellers they was and wot a pity it was he wasnt like em  talk like this used to upset george dixon awful  having been brought up careful by is mother and keeping a very quiet respectable ousei used it myselfhe certnly was soft and i remember im telling me once that he didnt believe in fighting and that instead of hitting people you ought to try and persuade them  he was uncommon fond of is wife but at last one day arter she ad made a laughingstock of im in the bar he up and spoke sharp to her  wot ses mrs dixon ardly able to believe her ears  remember who youre speaking to thats wot i said ses dixon  ow dare you talk to me like that  screams is wife turning red with rage  wot dye mean by it  because you seem to forget who is master ere ses dixon in a trembling voice  master she ses firing up  ill soon show you whos master  go out o my bar i wont ave you in it  dye ear  go out of it  dixon turned away and began to serve a customer  dye hear wot i say ses mrs dixon stamping er foot  go out o my bar  here charlie  hullo ses er cousin who ad been standing looking on and grinning  take the master and put im into the parlour ses mrs dixon and dont let im come out till hes begged my pardon  go on ses charlie brushing up is shirtsleeves in you go  you ear wot she said  he caught old of george dixon who ad just turned to the back o the bar to give a customer change out of arf a crown and ran im kicking and struggling into the parlour  george gave im a silly little punch in the chest and got such a bang on the ead back that at fust he thought it was knocked off  when e came to is senses agin the door leading to the bar was shut and is wifes uncle who ad been asleep in the easychair was finding fault with im for waking im up  why cant you be quiet and peaceable  he ses shaking his ead at him ive been ard at work all the morning thinking wot colour to paint the backdoor and this is the second time ive been woke up since dinner youre old enough to know better  go and sleep somewhere else then ses dixon  i dont want you ere at all or your boys neither  go and give somebody else a treat ive ad enough of the whole pack of you  illustration go and sleep somewhere else then ses dixon  he sat down and put is feet in the fender and old burge as soon as he ad got is senses back went into the bar and complained to is niece and she came into the parlour like a thunderstorm  youll beg my uncles pardon as well as mine afore you come out o that room she said to her usband mind that  george dixon didnt say a word the shame of it was amost more than e could stand  then e got up to go out o the parlour and charlie pushed im back agin  three times he tried and then e stood up and looked at is wife  ive been a good usband to you he ses but theres no satisfying you  you ought to ha married somebody that would ha knocked you about and then youd ha been happy  im too fond of a quiet life to suit you  are you going to beg my pardon and my uncles pardon ses is wife stamping er foot  no ses dixon i am not  im surprised at you asking it  well you dont come out o this room till you do ses is wife  that wont hurt me ses dixon  i couldnt look anybody in the face arter being pushed out o my own bar  they kept im there all the rest o the day and as e was still obstinate when bedtime came mrs dixon who wasnt to be beat brought down some bedclothes and ad a bed made up for im on the sofa  some men would ha ad the police in for less than that but george dixon ad got a great deal o pride and e couldnt bear the shame of it  instead o that e acted like a fourteenyearold boy and ran away to sea  they found im gone when they came down in the morning and the sidedoor on the latch  he ad left a letter for is wife on the table telling er wot he ad done  short and sweet it was and wound up with telling er to be careful that her uncle and cousins didnt eat er out of house and ome  she got another letter two days arterward saying that he ad shipped as ordinary seaman on an american barque called the seabird bound for california and that e expected to be away a year or thereabouts  itll do im good ses old burge when mrs dixon read the letter to em  its a ard life is the sea and hell appreciate his ome when e comes back to it agin  he dont know when es well off  its as comfortable a ome as a man could wish to ave  it was surprising wot a little difference george dixons being away made to the blue lion nobody seemed to miss im much and things went on just the same as afore he went  mrs dixon was all right with most people and er relations ad a very good time of it old burge began to put on flesh at such a rate that the sight of a ladder made im ill amost and charlie and bob went about as if the place belonged to em  they eard nothing for eight months and then a letter came for mrs dixon from her usband in which he said that e had left the seabird after aving had a time which made im shiver to think of  he said that the men was the roughest of the rough and the officers was worse and that he ad hardly ad a day without a blow from one or the other since hed been aboard  hed been knocked down with a handspike by the second mate and had ad a week in his bunk with a kick given im by the boatswain  he said e was now on the rochester castle bound for sydney and he oped for better times  that was all they eard for some months and then they got another letter saying that the men on the rochester castle was if anything worse than those on the seabird and that hed begun to think that running away to sea was diffrent to wot hed expected and that he supposed ed done it too late in life  he sent is love to is wife and asked er as a favour to send uncle burge and is boys away as e didnt want to find them there when e came home because they was the cause of all his sufferings  he dont know is best friends ses old burge  es got a nasty sperrit i dont like to see  ill ave a word with im when e does come home ses bob  i spose he thinks imself safe writing letters thousands o miles away  the last letter they ad came from auckland and said that he ad shipped on the monarch bound for the albert docks and he oped soon to be at ome and managing the blue lion same as in the old happy days afore he was fool enough to go to sea  that was the very last letter and some time arterward the monarch was in the missing list and byandby it became known that she ad gone down with all hands not long arter leaving new zealand  the only difference it made at the blue lion was that mrs dixon ad two of er dresses dyed black and the others wore black neckties for a fortnight and spoke of dixon as pore george and said it was a funny world but they supposed everything was for the best  it must ha been pretty near four years since george dixon ad run off to sea when charlie who was sitting in the bar one arternoon reading the paper things being dull saw a mans head peep through the door for a minute and then disappear  amost direckly arterward it looked in at another door and then disappeared agin  when it looked in at the third door charlie ad put down is paper and was ready for it  who are you looking for he ses rather sharp  wot dye want  are you aving a game of peepbo or wot  the man coughed and smiled and then e pushed the door open gently and came in and stood there fingering is beard as though e didnt know wot to say  ive come back charlie he ses at last  wot george  ses charlie starting  why i didnt know you in that beard  we all thought you was dead years ago  i was pretty nearly charlie ses dixon shaking his ead  ah ive ad a terrible time since i left once  you dont seem to ha made your fortune ses charlie looking down at is clothes  id ha been ashamed to come ome like that if it ad been me  im wore out ses dixon leaning agin the bar  ive got no pride left its all been knocked out of me  hows julia  shes all right ses charlie  here ju  hsh ses dixon reaching over the bar and laying his and on his arm dont let er know too sudden break it to er gently  fiddlesticks  ses charlie throwing his and off and calling here julia  hes come back  mrs dixon came running downstairs and into the bar  good gracious she ses staring at her usband  whoeverd ha thought o seeing you agin  where ave you sprung from  aint you glad to see me julia  ses george dixon  yes i spose so if youve come back to behave yourself ses mrs dixon  what ave you got to say for yourself for running away and then writing them letters telling me to get rid of my relations  thats a long time ago julia ses dixon raising the flap in the counter and going into the bar  ive gone through a great deal o suffering since then  ive been knocked about till i adnt got any feeling left in me ive been shipwrecked and ive ad to fight for my life with savages  nobody asked you to run away ses his wife edging away as he went to put his arm round er waist  youd better go upstairs and put on some decent clothes  illustration youd better go upstairs and put on some decent clothes  dixon looked at er for a moment and then he ung his ead  ive been thinking o you and of seeing you agin every day since i went away julia he ses  youd be the same to me if you was dressed in rags  he went upstairs without another word and old burge who was coming down came down five of em at once owing to dixon speaking to im afore he knew who e was  the old man was still grumbling when dixon came down agin and said he believed hed done it apurpose  you run away from a good ome he ses and the best wife in wapping and you come back and frighten people arf out o their lives  i never see such a feller in all my born days  i was so glad to get ome agin i didnt think ses dixon  i hope youre not urt  he started telling them all about his ardships while they were at tea but none of em seemed to care much about hearing em  bob said that the sea was all right for men and that other people were sure not to like it  and you brought it all on yourself ses charlie  youve only got yourself to thank for it  i ad thought o picking a bone with you over those letters you wrote  lets ope es come back more sensible than wot e was when e went away ses old burge with is mouth full o toast  by the time hed been back a couple o days george dixon could see that is going away adnt done any good at all  nobody seemed to take any notice of im or wot he said and at last arter a word or two with charlie about the rough way he spoke to some o the customers charlie came in to mrs dixon and said that he was at is old tricks of interfering and he would not ave it  well hed better keep out o the bar altogether ses mrs dixon theres no need for im to go there we managed all right while e was away  do you mean im not to go into my own bar ses dixon stammering  yes i do ses mrs dixon  you kept out of it for four years to please yourself and now you can keep out of it to please me  ive put you out o the bar before ses charlie and if you come messing about with me any more ill do it agin  so now you know  he walked back into the bar whistling and george dixon arter sitting still for a long time thinking got up and went into the bar and hed ardly got his foot inside afore charlie caught old of im by the shoulder and shoved im back into the parlour agin  i told you wot it would be ses mrs dixon looking up from er sewing youve only got your interfering ways to thank for it  this is a fine state of affairs in my own ouse ses dixon ardly able to speak  youve got no proper feeling for your husband julia else you wouldnt allow it  why i was happier at sea than wot i am ere  well youd better go

easy on that  ill go and look for another ship then ses dixon taking up is cap im not wanted here  praps you wouldnt mind aving some clothes packed into a chest for me so as i can go away decent  he looked round at is wife as though e expected shed ask im not to go but she took no notice and he opened the door softly and went out while old burge who ad come into the room and eard what he was saying trotted off upstairs to pack is chest for im  in two hours e was back agin and more cheerful than he ad been since he ad come ome  bob was in the bar and the others were just sitting down to tea and a big chest nicely corded stood on the floor in the corner of the room  thats right he ses looking at it thats just wot i wanted  its as full as it can be ses old burge  i done it for you
