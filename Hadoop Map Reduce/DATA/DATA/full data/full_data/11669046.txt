11669046	the complete works  of  john ruskin  volume xxiv                                      our fathers have told us  stormcloud of the nineteenth century  hortus inclusus                                        hortus inclusus  messages from the wood to the garden   sent in happy days to the sister ladies of the thwaite coniston     dedicated  with grateful thanks to my dear friends  professor ruskin  and  albert fleming                                    s b                                        preface   the ladies to whom these letters were written have been throughout their brightly tranquil lives at once sources and loadstones of all good to the village in which they had their home and to all loving people who cared for the village and its vale and secluded lake and whatever remained in them or around of the former peace beauty and pride of english shepherd land  sources they have been of good like one of its mountain springs ever to be found at need they did not travel they did not go up to london in its season they did not receive idle visitors to jar or waste their leisure in the waning year the poor and the sick could find them always or rather they watched for and prevented all poverty and pain that care or tenderness could relieve or heal loadstones they were as steadily bringing the light of gentle and wise souls about them as the crest of their guardian mountain gives pause to the morning clouds in themselves they were types of perfect womanhood in its constant happiness queens alike of their own hearts and of a paradise in which they knew the names and sympathized with the spirits of every living creature that god had made to play therein or to blossom in its sunshine or shade  they had lost their dearlyloved younger sister margaret before i knew them mary and susie alike in benevolence serenity and practical judgment were yet widely different nay almost contrary in tone and impulse of intellect both of them capable of understanding whatever women should know the elder was yet chiefly interested in the course of immediate english business policy and progressive science while susie lived an aerial and enchanted life possessing all the highest joys of imagination while she yielded to none of its deceits sicknesses or errors she saw and felt and believed all good as it had ever been and was to be in the reality and eternity of its goodness with the acceptance and the hope of a child the least things were treasures to her and her moments fuller of joy than some peoples days  what she had been to me in the days and years when other friendship has been failing and others loving mere folly the reader will enough see from these letters written certainly for her only but from which she has permitted my master of the rural industries at loughrigg albert fleming to choose what he thinks among the tendrils of clinging thought and mossy cups for dew in the garden of herbs where love is may be trusted to the memorial sympathy of the readers of frondes agrestes                                                              j r      brantwood       june 1887     introduction   often during those visits to the thwaite which have grown to be the bestspent hours of my later years i have urged my dear friend miss beever to open to the larger world the pleasant paths of this her garden inclosed the inner circle of her friends knew that she had a goodly store of mr ruskins letters extending over many years she for her part had long desired to share with others the pleasure these letters had given her but she shrank from the fatigue of selecting and arranging them it was therefore with no small feeling of satisfaction that i drove home from the thwaite one day in february last with a parcel containing nearly two thousand of these treasured letters i was gladdened also by generous permission both from brantwood and the thwaite to choose what i liked best for publication the letters themselves are the fruit of the most beautiful friendship i have ever been permitted to witness a friendship so unique in some aspects of it so sacred in all that i may only give it the praise of silence i count myself happy to have been allowed to throw open to all wise and quiet souls the portals of this armidas garden where there are no spells save those woven by love and no magic save that of grace and kindliness here my pleasant share in this little book would have ended but mr ruskin has desired me to add a few words giving my own description of susie and speaking of my relationship to them both to him i owe the guidance of my lifeall its best impulses all its worthiest efforts to her some of its happiest hours and the blessings alike of incentive and reproof in reading over mr ruskins preface i note that either by grace of purpose or happy chance he has left me one point untouched in our dear friends character her letters inserted here give some evidence of it but i should like to place on record how her intense delight in sweet and simple things has blossomed into a kind of mental frolic and dainty wit so that even now in the calm autumn of her days her friends are not only lessoned by her ripened wisdom but cheered and recreated by her quaint and sprightly humor  in the royal order of gardens as bacon puts it there was always a quiet restingplace called the pleasaunce there the daisies grew unchecked and the grass was ever the greenest such a pleasaunce do these letters seem to me here and there indeed there are shadows on the grass but no shadow ever falls between the two dear friends who walk together hand in hand along its pleasant paths so may they walk in peace till they stand at the gate of another garden where            co fiori eterni eterno il frutto dura                                                    a f neaum crag   loughrigg     ambleside     preface to the third edition   since these letters were published fourteen years ago both mr ruskin and miss beever have passed to the country he longed to find where the flowers do not fade in this new edition some of the earlier letters have been withdrawn and others of possibly wider interest are inserted in their place i have also added a reproduction of mr ruskins last letter to miss beever it was written about the 20th october 1893 and was read to her on her deathbed he was then himself in broken health and it took him three weary hours to write this little note of eight lines i believe this to be the last complete letter that ever came from his pen miss beever sent it to me with the wish that some day i might use it and i now fulfill that wish by inserting it here as the pathetic close to a correspondence in which there was so much of a gay and playful nature commending it to the memorial sympathy claimed by him for his earlier letters the word phoca is a signature often used by him in writing to his old friend  i have been asked to add illustrations to this edition and some fresh explanatory notes and dates will also be found                                                    a f  neaum crag    ambleside          1902     hortus inclusus                                                                   brantwood 16th march 1874  my dearest susie  in a state of great defeat and torment this morninghaving much to do with the weather andnot living on milk i have been greatly helped byone of my own books1 it is the best i ever wrotethe last which i took thorough loving pains withand the first which i did with full knowledge of sorrow  will you please read in itfirstfrom 65 at the bottom of page 792 as far as and not farther than 67 in page 81 that is what helped me this morning  then if you want to know precisely the state i am in read the account of the myth of tantalus beginning at 20p 24 and going on to 25page 31  it is a hard task to set you my dear little susie but when you get old you will be glad to have done it and another day you must look at page 94 and then you must return me my book for its my noted copy and im using it  the life of tantalus doesnt often admit of crying but i had a real crywith quite wet tears yesterday morning over whatto me is the prettiest bit in all shakespeare                               pray be content           mother i am going to the marketplace           chide me no more3   and almost next to it comes to me always i mean in my own fancy virgilia yes certain theres a letter for you i saw it4             ever your loving          j r  footnote 1 the queen of the air see page 70  footnote 2 cf contemporary

got today your lovely letter of the 6th but i never knew my susie could be such a naughty little girl before to burn her pretty story5 instead of sending it to me it would have come to me so exactly in the right place here where st francis made the grasshopper cicada at least sing to him upon his hand and preached to the birds and made the wolf go its rounds every day as regularly as any franciscan friar to ask for a little contribution to its modest dinner the bee and narcissus would have delighted to talk in this enchanted air  yes that is really very pretty of dr john brown to inscribe your books so and its so like him how these kind people understand things and that bit of his about the child is wholly lovely i am so glad you copied it  i often think of you and of coniston and brantwood you will see in the may fors reflections upon the temptations to the life of a franciscan  there are two monks here one the sacristan who has charge of the entire church and is responsible for its treasures the other exercising what authority is left to the convent among the people of the town they are both so good and innocent and sweet one cant pity them enough for this time in italy is just like the reformation in scotland with only the difference that the reform movement is carried on here simply for the sake of what money can be got by church confiscation and these two brothers are living by indulgence as the abbot in the monastery of st marys in the regent morays time  the people of the village however are all true to their faith it is only the governing body which is moderninfidel and radical the population is quite charminga word of kindness makes them as bright as if you brought them news of a friend all the same it does not do to offend them monsieur cavalcasella who is expecting the government order to take the tabernacle from the sanctuary of st francis cannot it is said go out at night with safety he decamped the day before i came having some notion i fancy that i would make his life a burden to him if he didnt by day as much as it was in peril by night i promise myself a month of very happy time here happy for me i mean when i return in may  the sacristan gives me my coffee for lunch in his own little cell looking out on the olive woods then he tells me stories of conversions and miracles and then perhaps we go into the sacristy and have a reverent little poke out of relics fancy a great carved cupboard in a vaulted chamber full of most precious things the box which the holy virgins veil used to be kept in to begin with and leave to rummage in it at will things that are only shown twice in the year or so with fumigation all the congregation on their knees and the sacristan and i having a great heap of them on the table at once like a dinner service i really looked with great respect at st franciss old camelhair dress  i am obliged to go to rome tomorrow however and to naples on saturday my witch of sicily6 expects me this day week and shes going to take me such lovely drives and talks of excursions which i see by the map are thirty miles away i wonder if she thinks me so horribly old that its quite proper it will be very nice if she does but not flattering i know her mother cant go with her i suppose her maid will if she wants any other chaperon i wont go  shes really very beautiful i believe to some peoples tastes i shall be horribly disappointed if she isnt in her own dark style and she writes next to susie the loveliest letters i ever get  now susie mind youre to be a very good child while im away and never to burn any more stories and above all youre to write me just what comes into your head and ever to believe me your loving                                                    j r  footnote 5 the bee and narcissus  footnote 6 miss amy yule see præterita vol iii chap vii                                                                                  naples 2d may 1874  i heard of your great sorrow7 from joan six days ago and have not been able to write since nothing silences me so much as sorrow and for this of yours i have no comfort i write only that you may know that i am thinking of you and would help you if i could and i write today because your lovely letters and your lovely old age have been forced into my thoughts often by dreadful contrast during these days in italy you who are so purely and brightly happy in all natural and simple things seem now to belong to another and a younger world and your letters have been to me like the pure air of yewdale crags breathed among the pontine marshes but you must not think i am ungrateful for them when i cant answer you can have no idea how impossible it is for me to do all the work necessary even for memory of the things i came here to see how much escapes me how much is done in a broken and weary way i am the only author on art who does the work of illustration with his own hand the only one thereforeand i am not insolent in saying thiswho has learned his business thoroughly but after a days drawing i assure you one cannot sit down to write unless it be the merest nonsense to please joanie believe it or not there is no one of my friends whom i write so scrupulously to as to you you may be vexed at this but indeed i cant but try to write carefully in answer to all your kind words and so sometimes i cant at all i must tell you however today what i saw in the pompeian frescoesthe great characteristic of falling rome in her furious desire of pleasure and brutal incapability of it the walls of pompeii are covered with paintings meant only to give pleasure but nothing they represent is beautiful or delightful and yesterday among other calumniated and caricatured birds i saw one of my susies pets a peacock and he had only eleven eyes in his tail fancy the feverish wretchedness of the humanity which in mere pursuit of pleasure or power had reduced itself to see no more than eleven eyes in a peacocks tail what were the cyclops to this  i hope to get to rome this evening and to be there settled for some time and to have quieter hours for my letters  footnote 7 the death of miss margaret beever                                                                                  rome hÔtel de russie 8th may 74  i have your sweet letter about ulysses the leaves and the robins i have been feeling so wearily on this journey the want of whatwhen i had it i usedhow often to feel a burdenthe claim of my mother for at least a word every day happy poor mother with two linesand isometimesnayoftenthinking it hard to have to stay five minutes from what i wanted to doto write them  i am despising now in like senseless way the privilege of being able to write to you and of knowing that it will please you to heareven that i cant tell you anything which i cannot this morningbut only it is a little peace and rest to me to write to my susie                                                                                  rome 23d may 1874  a number of business letters and the increasing instinct for work here as time shortens have kept me too long from even writing a mere mammanote to you though not without thought of you daily  i have your last most lovely line about your sisterand giving me that most touching fact about poor dr john brown which i am grieved and yet thankful to know that i may better still reverence his unfailing kindness and quick sympathy i have a quite wonderful letter from him about you but i will not tell you what he says only it is so very very true and so very very pretty you cant think  i have written to my bookseller to find for you and send a complete edition of modern painters if findable if not i will make my assistant send you down my own fourth and fifth volumes which you can keep till i come for them in the autumn  there is nothing now in the year but autumn and winter i really begin to think there is some terrible change of climate coming upon the world for its sin like another deluge it will have its rainbow i suppose after its mannerpromising not to darken the world again and then not to drown                                                                                  rome 24th may 1874 whitsunday  i have today to make the day whiter for me your lovely letter of the 15th8 telling me your age i am so glad it is no more you are only thirteen years older than i and much more able to be my sister than mamma and i hope you will have many years of youth yet i think i must tell you in return for this letter what dr john brown said or part of it at least he said you had the playfulness of a lamb without its selfishness i think that perfect as far as it goes of course my susies wise and grave gifts must be told of afterwards there is no one i know or have known so well able as you are to be in a degree what my mother was to me in this chief way as well as many other ways the puzzlement i have had to force that sentence into grammar that i have had the same certainty of giving you pleasure by a few words and by any little account of what i am doing but then you know i have just got out of the way of doing as i am bid and unless you can scold me back into that you cant give me the sense of support  tell me more about yourself first and how those years came to be lost i am not sure that they were though i am very far from holding the empty theory of compensation but much of the slighter pleasure you lost then is evidently still open to you fresh all the more from having been for a time withdrawn  the roman peasants are very gay today with roses in their hair legitimately and honorably decorated and looking lovely oh me if they had a few susies to take human care of them what a glorious people they would be  footnote 8 see page 99                                       the lost church in the campagna                                 rome 2d june 1874  ah if you were but among the marbles here though there are none finer than that you so strangely discerned in my study but they are as a white company innumerable ghost after ghost and how you would rejoice in them and in a thousand things besides to which i am dead from having seen too much or worked too painfullyor worst of all lost the hope which gives all life  last sunday i was in a lost church found againa church of the second or third century dug in a green hill of the campagna built undergroundits secret entrance like a sandmartins nest such the temple of the lord as the king solomon of that time had to build it not the mountains of the lords house shall be established above the hills but the cave of the lords house as the foxs hole beneath them  and here now lighted by the sun for the first time for they are still digging the earth from the steps are the marbles of those early christian days the first efforts of their new hope to show itself in enduring record the new hope of a good shepherdthere they carved him with a spring flowing at his feet and round him the cattle of the campagna in which they had dug their church the very selfsame goats which this morning have been trotting past my window through the most populous streets of rome innocently following their shepherd tinkling their bells and shaking their long spiral horns and white beards the very same dewlapped cattle which were that sunday morning feeding on the hillside above carved on the tombmarbles sixteen hundred years ago  how you would have liked to see it susie  and now today i am going to work in an eleventh century church of quite proud and victorious christianity with its grand bishops and saints lording it over italy the bishops throne all marble and mosaic of precious colors and of gold high under the vaulted roof at the end behind the altar and line upon line of pillars of massive porphyry and marble gathered out of the ruins of the temples of the great race who had persecuted them till they had said to the hills cover us like the wicked and then their proud time came and their enthronement on the seven hills and now what is to be their fate once moreof pope and cardinal and dome peters or pauls by name onlymy house no more a house of prayer but a den of thieves  i cant write any more this morning oh me if one could only write and draw all one wanted and have our susies and be young again oneself and they as if there were two susies or could be            ever my one susies very loving                                               j ruskin                                       regrets                                 assisi june 9th 1874  yes i am a little oppressed just now with overwork nor is this avoidable i am obliged to leave all my drawings unfinished as the last days come and the point possible of approximate completion fatally contracts every hour to a more ludicrous and warped mockery of the hope in which one began it is impossible not to work against time and that is killing it is not labor itself but competitive anxious disappointed labor that dries ones soul out  but dont be frightened about me you sweet susie i know when i must stop forgive and pity me only because sometimes nay often my letter or word to susie must be sacrificed to the last effort on ones drawing  the letter to ones susie should be a rest do you think it is always more or less comforting but not rest it means further employment of the already extremely strained sensational power what one really wants i believe the only true restorative is the natural one the actual presence of ones helpmeet the far worse than absence of mine reverses rest and what is more destroys ones power of receiving from others or giving  how much love of mine have others lost because that poor sick child would not have the part of love that belonged to her  i am very anxious about your eyes too for any favor dont write more extracts just now the books are yours forever and a dayno loan enjoy any bits that you find enjoyable but dont copy just now  i left rome yesterday and am on my way home but alas might as well be on my way home from cochin china for any chance i have of speedily arriving meantime your letters will reach me here with speed and will be a great comfort to me if they dont fatigue you                                       frondes agrestes                                 perugia 12th june 1874  i am more and more pleased at the thought of this gathering of yours and soon expect to tell you what the bookseller says  meantime i want you to think of the form the collection should take with reference to my proposed republication i mean to take the botany the geology the turner defense and the general art criticism of modern painters as four separate books cutting out nearly all the preaching and a good deal of the sentiment now what you find pleasant and helpful to you of general maxim or reflection must be of some value and i think therefore that your selection will just do for me what no other reader could have done least of all i myself keep together that is to say what may be right and true of those youthful thoughts i should like you to add anything that specially pleases you of whatever kind but to keep the notion of your book being the didactic one as opposed to the other picturesque and scientific volumes will i think help you in choosing between passages when one or other is to be rejected                                       how he fell among thieves                                 assisi 17th june 1874  i have been having a bad time lately and have no heart to write to you very difficult and melancholy work deciphering what remains of a great painter9 among stains of ruin and blotches of repair of five hundred years gathering it makes me sadder than idleness which is saying much  i was greatly flattered and petted by a saying in one of your last letters about the difficulty i had in unpacking my mind that is true one of my chief troubles at present is with the quantity of things i want to say at once but you dont know how i find things i laid by carefully in it all moldy and motheaten when i take them out and what a lot of mending and airing they need and what a wearisome and bothering business it is compared to the early packingone used to be so proud to get things into the corners neatly  i have been failing in my drawings too and im in a horrible inn kept by a garibaldian bandit and the various sorts of disgusting dishes sent up to look like a dinner and to be charged for are a daily increasing horror and amazement to me they succeed in getting everything bad no exertion no invention could produce such badness i believe anywhere else the hills are covered for leagues with olive trees and the oils bad there are no such lovely cattle elsewhere in the world and the butters bad half the country people are shepherds but theres no mutton half the old women walk about with a pig tied to their waists but theres no pork the vine grows wild anywhere and the wine would make my teeth drop out of my head if i took a glass of it there are no strawberries no oranges no melons the cherries are as hard as their stones the beans only good for horses or jack and the beanstalk and this is the size of the biggest asparagus  illustration handdrawn sketch of asparagus stalk  i live here in a narrow street ten feet wide only winding up a hill and it was full this morning of sheep as close as they could pack at least a thousand as far as the eye could reachtinkle tinkle bleat bleat for a quarter of an hour  footnote 9 cimabue                                       in paradise                                 assisi sacristans cell                                        25th june 1874  this letter is all upside down and this first page written last for i didnt like something i had written about myself last night when i was tired and have torn it off  that star you saw beat like a heart must have been a dog star a planet would not have twinkled far mightier he than any planet burning with his own planetary host doubtless round him and on some speckiest of the specks of them evangelical persons thinking our sun was made for them  ah susie i do not pass unthought of the many sorrows of which you kindly tell me to show mefor that is in your hearthow others have suffered also  but susie you expect to see your margaret again and you will be happy with her in heaven i wanted my rosie here in heaven i mean to go and talk to pythagoras and socrates and valerius publicola i shant care a bit for rosie there she neednt think it what will gray eyes and red cheeks be good for there  these pious sentiments are all written in my sacristans cell  this extract book10 of yours will be most precious in its help to me provided it is kept within somewhat narrow limits as soon as it is done i mean to have it published in a strong and pretty but cheap form and it must not be too bulky consider therefore not only what you like but how far and with whom each bit is likely to find consent and service you will have to choose perhaps after a little while among what you have already chosen i mean to leave it wholly in your hands it is to be susies choice of my writings  dont get into a flurry of responsibility but dont at once write down all you have a mind to i know youll find a good deal for you are exactly in sympathy with me in all things  footnote 10 frondes agrestes                                                                   assisi 9th july 1874  your lovely letters are always a comfort to me and not least when you tell me you are sad you would be far less in sympathy with me if you were not and in the everything right humor of some even of some really good and kind persons whose own matters are to their mind and who understand by providence the power which particularly takes care of them this favoritism which goes so sweetly and pleasantly down with so many pious people is the chief of all stumblingblocks to me i must pray for everybody or nobody and cant get into any conceptions of relation between heaven and me if not also between heaven and earth and why heaven should allow hairs in pens i cant think  i take great care of myself be quite sure of that susie the worst of it is here in assisi everybody else wants me to take care of them  catharine brought me up as a great treat yesterday at dinner ham dressed with as much garlic as could be stewed into it and a plate of raw figs telling me i was to eat them together  the sun is changing the entire mountains of assisi into a hot bottle with no flannel round it but i cant get a ripe plum peach or cherry all the milk turns sour and one has to eat ones meat at its toughest or the thunder gets into it next day                                       foam of tiber                                 perugia 17th july 1874  i am made anxious by your sweet letter of the 6th saying you have been ill and are not much better  the letter is all like yours but i suppose however ill you were you would always write prettily so thats little comfort  about the narcissus please i want them for my fishpond stream rather than for the beehouse one the fishpond stream is very doleful and wants to dance with daffodils if they would come and teach it how happy we are in our native streams a thunderstorm swelled the tiber yesterday and it rolled over its mill weirs in heaps literally of tossed water the size of haycocks but black brown like coffee with the grounds in it mixed with a very little yellow milk in some lights the foam flew like cast handfuls of heavy gravel the chief flowers here are only broom and bindweed and i begin to weary for my heather and for my susie but oh dear the ways are long and the days few                                                                   lucca 29th july 1874  im not going to be devoured when i come by anybody unless you like to i shall come to your window with the birds to be fed myself  and please at present always complain to me whenever you like it is the over boisterous cheerfulness of common people that hurts me your sadness is a help to me  you shall have whatever name you like for your book provided you continue to like it after thinking over it long enough you will not like gleanings because you know one only gleans refusedropped earsthat other people dont care for you go into the garden and gather with choice the flowers you like best that is not gleaning                                                                   lucca 10th august 1874  i have been grieved not to write to you but the number of things that vex me are so great just now that unless by false effort i could write you nothing nice it is very dreadful to live in italy and more dreadful to see ones england and ones english friends all but a field or two and a stream or two and a one susie and one dr brown fast becoming like italy and the italians  i have too much sympathy with your sorrow to write to you of it what i have not sympathy with is your hope and how cruel it is to say this but i am driven more and more to think there is to be no more good for a time but a reign of terror of men and the elements alike and yet it is so like what is foretold before the coming of the son of man that perhaps in the extremest evil of it i may some day read the sign that our redemption draws nigh  now susie invent a nice cluster of titles for the book and send them to me to choose from to hôtel de larno florence i must get that out before the day of judgment if i can im so glad of your sweet flatteries in this note received today                                                                   florence 25th august 1874  i have not been able to write to you or any one lately whom i dont want to tease except dr brown whom i write to for counsel my time is passed in a fierce steady struggle to save all i can every day as a fireman from a smoldering ruin of history or aspect today for instance ive been just in time to ascertain the form of the cross of the emperor representing the power of the state in the greatest political fresco of old timesfourteenth century by next year it may be next month it will have dropped from the wall with the vibration of the railway outside and be touched up with new gilding for the mob  i am keeping well but am in a terrible spell literally spell enchanted maze that i cant get out of of work  i was a little scandalized at the idea of your calling the book wordpainting my dearest susie it is the chief provocation of my life to be called a wordpainter instead of a thinker i hope you havent filled your book with descriptions i thought it was the thoughts you were looking for  posie would be pretty if you ask joanie she will tell you perhaps too pretty for me and i cant think a bit tonight for instead of robins singing i hear only blaspheming gamesters on the other side of the narrow street                                                                   florence 1st september 1874  dont be in despair about your book i am sure it will be lovely ill see to it the moment i get home but ive got into an entirely unexpected piece of business here the interpretation of a large chapel11 full of misunderstood or not at all understood frescoes and im terribly afraid of breaking down so much drawing has to be done at the same time it has stranded botany and everything  i was kept awake half of last night by drunken blackguards howling on the bridge of the holy trinity in the pure halfmoonlight this is the kind of discord i have to bear corresponding to your uncongenial company but alas susie you ought at ten years old to have more firmness and to resolve that you wont be bored i think i shall try to enforce it on you as a very solemn duty not to lie to people as the vulgar public do if they bore you say so and theyll go away that is the right state of things  how am i to know that i dont bore you when i come when youre so civil to people you hate  footnote 11 spanish chapel in s maria novella

is especially good for little girls of eleven who cant climb to know thisall the best views of hills are at the bottom of them i know one or two places indeed where there is a grand peeping over precipices one or two where the mountain seclusion and strength are worth climbing to see but all the entirely beautiful things i could show you susie only for the very highest sublime of them sometimes asking you to endure half an hour of chaise à porteurs but mostly from a postchaise or smoothest of turnpike roads  but susie do you know im greatly horrified at the penwipers of peacocks feathers i always use my lefthand coattail indeed and if only i were a peacock and a pet of yours how youd scold me  sun just coming out over sea at sestri which is sighing in towards the window

handwork i had to write quite an unexpected number of letters but poor joanie will think herself neglected now for i have been stopped among the alps by a state of their glaciers entirely unexampled and shall be a week after my latest possible day in getting home it is eleven years since i was here and very sad to me to return yet delightful with a moonlight paleness of the past precious of its kind  i shall be at home with joan in ten days now god willing i have much to tell you which will give you pleasure and pain but i dont know how much it will beto tell youfor a little while yet so i dont begin                                                                   oxford 26th october 1874  home at last with your lovely most lovely letter in my breast pocket  i am so very grateful to you for not writing on black paper  oh dear susie why should we ever wear black for the guests of god                                       wharfe in flood                                 bolton abbey                                 24th january 1875  the black rain much as i growled at it has let me see wharfe in flood and i would have borne many days in prison to see that  no one need go to the alps to see wild water seldom unless in the rhine or rhone themselves at their rapids have i seen anything much grander an alpine stream besides nearly always has its bed full of loose stones and becomes a series of humps and dumps of water wherever it is shallow while the wharfe swept round its curves of shore like a black damascus saber coiled into eddies of steel at the strid it had risen eight feet vertical since yesterday sheeting the flat rocks with foam from side to side while the treacherous midchannel was filled with a succession of boiling domes of water charged through and through with churning white and rolling out into the broader stream each like a vast sea wave bursting on a beach  there is something in the soft and comparatively unbroken slopes of these yorkshire shales which must give the water a peculiar sweeping power for i have seen tay and tummel and ness and many a big stream besides savage enough but i dont remember anything so grim as this  i came home to quiet tea and a black kitten called sweep who lapped half my cream jugful and yet i had plenty sitting on my shoulderand life of sir walter scott i was reading his great scottish history tour when he was twentythree and got his materials for everything nearly but especially for waverley though not used till long afterwards  do you recollect gibbie gellatly i was thinking over that question of yours what did i think13 but my dear susie you might as well ask gibbie gellatly what he thought what does it matter what any of us think we are but simpletons the best of us and i am a very inconsistent and wayward simpleton i know how to roast eggs in the ashes perhapsbut for the next world why dont you ask your squirrel what he thinks too the great pointthe one for all of usis not to take false words in our mouths and to crack our nuts innocently through winter and rough weather  i shall post this tomorrow as i pass through skipton or any postworthy place on my way to wakefield write to warwick oh me what places england had when she was herself now rail stations mostly but i never can make out how warwick castle got built by that dull bit of river  footnote 13 of the things that shall be hereafterj r                                       frondes                                 wakefield 25th january 1875  heres our book in form at last and it seems to me just a nice size and on the whole very taking ive put a touch or two more to the preface and im sadly afraid theres a naughty note somewhere i hope you wont find it and that you will like the order the things are put in  such ill roads as we came over today i never thought to see in england                                                                   castleton 26th january 1875  here i have your long dear letter i am very thankful i can be so much to you of all the people i have yet known you are the only one i can find complete sympathy in you are so nice and young without the hardness of youth and may be the best of sisters to me i am not so sure about letting you be an elder one i am not going to be lectured when im naughty  ive been so busy at wasps all day coming along having got a nice book about them it tells me too of a delightful german doctor who kept tame hornetsa whole nest in his study they knew him perfectly and would let him do anything with them even pull bits off their nest to look in at it  wasps too my author says are really much more amiable than bees and never get angry without cause all the same they have a tiresome way of inspecting one too closely sometimes i think  im immensely struck with the peak cavern but it was in twilight  im going to stay here all tomorrow the place is so entirely unspoiled ive not seen such a primitive village rock or stream this twenty years langdale is as sophisticated as pall mall in comparison                                       wasp stings                                 bolton bridge saturday  i never was more thankful than for your sweet note being stopped here by bad weather again the worst of posting is that one has to think of ones servant outside and so lose a day  it was bitter wind and snow this morning too bad to send any human creature to sit idle in black enough still and i more than usual because it is just that point of distinction from brutes which i truly say is our only one14 of which i have now so little hold  the bee fors15 will be got quickly into proof but i must add a good deal to it i cant get into good humor for natural history in this weather  ive got a good book on wasps which says they are our chief protectors against flies in cumberland the wet cold spring is so bad for the wasps that i partly think this may be so and the terrible plague of flies in august might perhaps be checked by our teaching our little agneses to keep wasps nests instead of bees  yes that is a pretty bit of mine about hamlet and i think i must surely be a little pathetic sometimes in a doggish way  youre so dreadfully faithful said arthur severn to me fretting over the way i was being illtreated the other day by r  oh dear i wish i were at brantwood again now and could send you my wasp book it is pathetic and yet so dreadfulthe wasp bringing in the caterpillar for its young wasp stinging each enough to paralyze but not to kill and so laying them up in the cupboard  i wonder how the clergymens wives will feel after the next fors or two ive done a bit today which i think will go in with a shiver do you recollect the curious thrill there isthe cold tingle of the pang of a nice deep wasp sting  well im not in a fit temper to write to susie today clearly  footnote 14 ive forgotten what it was and dont feel now as if i had got hold of any onej r  footnote 15 see fors clavigera letter li                                       bolton strid   i stopped here to see the strid againnot seen these many years it is curious that life is embittered to me now by its former pleasantness while you have of these same places painful recollections but you could enjoy them now with your whole heart  instead of the drive with the poor overlabored one horse through the long wet day here when i was a youth my father and mother brought me16 and let me sketch in the abbey and ramble in the woods as i chose only demanding promise that i should not go near the strid pleasant drives with on the whole well paid and pleased drivers never with overburdened cattle cheerful dinner or tea waiting for me always on my return from solitary rambles everything right and good for me except only that they never put me through any trials to harden me or give me decision of character or make me feel how much they did for me  but that error was a fearful one and cost them and me heaven only knows how much and now i walk to strid and abbey and everywhere with the ghosts of the past days haunting me and other darker spirits of sorrow and remorse and wonder black spirits among the gray all like a mist between me and the green woods and i feel like a caterpillarstung just enough foul weather and mist enough of quite a real kind besides an hours sunshine today broken up speedily and now veiled utterly  footnote

brother i have been working on the book today very hard after much interruption it is twothirds done now so glad people are on tiptoe  paddocks are frogs not toads in that grace17 and why should not people smile do you think that god does not like smiling graces he only dislikes frowns but you know when once habitual the child would be told on a cold day to say cold as paddocks and everybody would know what was coming finally the deep undermeaning that as the cold hand is lifted so also the cold heart and yet accepted makes it one of the prettiest little hymns i know  i cannot tell you how very apposite to my work these two feathers are i am just going to dwell on the exquisite result of the division into successive leaves by which nature obtains the glittering look to set off her color and you just send me two feathers which have it more in perfection than any i ever saw and i think are more vivid in color  how those boys must tease you but you will be rewarded in the world

despondency coming on the top or under the bottom of already farfallen fatigue leaves me helpless today my tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth oh dear the one pleasant thing ive to say is that it will make me know the blessings of brantwood and dearness of the thwaite twenty fold more when i get back                                                                   venice 10th september 76  i am a sad long way from the pretty garden steps of the thwaite now yet in a way at home here alsohaving perhaps more feeling of old days at venice than at any other place in the world having done so much work there and i hope to get my new stones of venice into almost as nice a form as frondes im going to keep all that i think susie would like and then to put in some little bits to my own liking and some other little bits for the pleasure of teasing and i think the book will come out quite fresh  i am settled here for a month at leastand shall be very thankful for susie notes when they cross the alps to me in these lovely days  love to maryi wish i could have sent both some of the dark blue small veronica i found on the simplon                                                                   venice 12th september 1876  i must just say how thankful it makes me to hear of this true gentleness of english gentlewomen in the midst of the vice and cruelty in which i am forced to live here where oppression on one side and license on the other rage as two warwolves in continual havoc  it is very characteristic of fallen venice as of modern europe that here in the principal rooms of one of the chief palaces in the very headmost sweep of the grand canal there is not a room for a servant fit to keep a cat or a dog in as susie would keep cat or dog at least                                                                   venice 18th september 1876  i never knew such a fight as the good and wicked fairies are having over my poor body and spirit just now the good fairies have got down the st ursula for me and given her to me all to myself and sent me fine weather and nice gondoliers and a good cook and a pleasant waiter and the bad fairies keep putting everything upside down and putting black in my box when i want white and making me forget all i want and find all i dont and making the hinges come off my boards and the leaves out of my books and driving me as wild as wild can be but im getting something done in spite of them only i never can get my letters written                                                                   venice september 29th  i have woeful letters telling me you also were woeful in saying goodbye my darling susie what is the use of your being so good and dear if you cant enjoy thinking of heaven and what fine goings on we shall all have there  all the same even when im at my very piousest it puts me out if my drawings go wrong im going to draw st ursulas blue slippers today and if i cant do them nicely shall be in great despair ive just

note and have desired joan to send you one just written to her in which i have given some account of myself that may partly interest partly win your pardon for apparent neglect coming here after practically an interval of twentyfour yearsfor i have not seriously looked at anything during the two hurried visits with joan18my old unfinished work and the possibilities of its better completion rise grievously and beguilingly before me and i have been stretching my hands to the shadow of old designs and striving to fulfill shortcomings always painful to me but now for the moment intolerable  i am also approaching the close of the sixth year of fors and have plans for the sabbatical year of it which make my thoughts active and troubled i am drawing much and have got a study of st ursula which will give you pleasure but the pain of being separate from my friends and of knowing they miss me i wonder if you will think you are making me too vain susie such vanity is a very painful one for i know that you look out of the window on sundays now wistfully for joans handkerchief this pain seems always at my heart with the other which is its own  i am thankful always you like st ursula one quite fixed plan for the last year of fors is that there shall be absolutely no abuse or controversy in it but things which will either give pleasure or help and some clear statements of principle in language as temperate as hitherto violent to show for one thing that the violence was not for want of selfcommand  im going to have a good fling at the bishops in next fors to finish with and then for januaryonly i mustnt be too good susie or something would happen to me so i shall say naughty things still but in the mildest way  i am very grateful to you for that comparison about my mind being as crisp as a lettuce i am so thankful you can feel that still i was beginning to doubt myself  footnote 18 may 1870 and june 1872                                        st marks doves                                 venice 2d december 1876  i have been very dismal lately i hope the next captain of st georges company will be a merrier one and happier in being of use i am inherently selfish and dont enjoy being of use and here ive no susies nor kathleens nor diddies and im only doing lots of good and im very miserable ive been going late to bed too i picked myself up last night and went to bed at nine and feel cheerful enough to ask susie how she does and send her love from st marks doves theyre really tiresome now among ones feet in st marks place and i dont know what it will come to in old times when there were not so many idlers about the doves were used to brisk walkers and moved away a foot or two in front of one but now everybody lounges or stands talking about the government and the doves wont stir till one just touches them and i who walk fast19 am always expecting to tread on them and its a nuisance  if i only had time i would fain make friends with the seagulls who would be quite like angels if they would only stop on ones balcony if there were the least bit of truth in darwinism venice would have had her own born seagulls by this time building their nests at her thresholds  footnote 19 see fors clavigera letter lxxxii                                                                   venice 11th december 1876  my mouths watering so for that thwaite currant

to me this christmas but if i were to tell susie of them i am sure she would be frightened out of her bright little wits and think i was going to be a roman catholic im writing such a catholic history of venice and chiseling all the protestantism off the old stones as they do here the grass off steps  all the pigeons of st marks place send you their love st ursula adds hers to the eleven thousand

and true as my susie should be sad i am sad bitterly enough and often but only with sense of fault and folly and lost opportunity such as you have never fallen into or lost it is very cruel of fate i think to make us sad who would fain see everybody cheerful and cruel of fate too to make so many cheerful who make others wretched the little history of venice is well on and will be clear and interesting i thinkmore than most histories of anything and the stories of saints and nice people will be plenty  such moonlight as there is tonight but nothing to what it is at coniston it makes the

undergraduates than usual that i took pains to reinforce and press them home and people say i have never given so useful a course yet but it has taken all my time and strength and i have not been able even to tell susie a word about it until now in one of my lectures i made my text your pretty peacock and the design23 of him but did not venture to say what really must be true that his voice is an example of the devil sowed tares and of the angels letting both grow together my grateful compliments to the peacock and little but warm loves to all your little birds and best of little loves to the squirrels only you must send them in dreamwords i suppose up to their nests  footnote 22 an oxford lecture nineteenth century january 1878  footnote 23 decorative art of his plumagej r                                                                  herne hill                      sunday 16th december 1877  it is a long while since ive felt so good for nothing as i do this morning my very wristbands curl up in a dogseared and disconsolate manner my little room is all a heap of disorder ive got a hoarseness and wheezing and sneezing and coughing and choking i cant speak and i cant think im miserable in bed and useless out of it and it seems to me as if i could never venture to open a window or go out of a door any more i have the dimmest sort of diabolical pleasure in thinking how miserable i shall make susie by telling her all this but in other respects i seem entirely devoid of all moral sentiments i have arrived at this state of things first by catching cold and since by trying to amuse myself for three days i tried to read pickwick but found that vulgar24 and besides i know it all by heart i sent from town for some chivalric romances but found them immeasurably stupid i made baxter read me the daily telegraph and found that the home secretary had been making an absurd speech about art without any consciousness that such a person as i had ever existed i read a lot of games of chess out of mr stauntons handbook and couldnt understand any of them i analyzed the dock companys bill of charges on a box from venice and sent them an examination paper on it i think that did amuse me a little but the account doesnt £1 8s 6d for bringing a box two feet square from the tower wharf to here but the worst of all is that the doctor keeps me shut up here and i cant get my business done and now there isnt the least chance of my getting down to brantwood for christmas nor as far as i can see for a fortnight after it theres perhaps a little of the diabolical enjoyment again in that estimate but really the days do go more like dew shaken off branches than real sunrisings and settings but ill send you word every day now for a little while how things are going on  footnote 24 may i ask you to correct a false impression which any of your readers who still care to know my opinions would receive from the reference to dickens in your kind notice of my letters to miss beeveri have not the letters here and forget what i said about my pickwicks not amusing me when i was ill but it always does to this hour when i am well though i have known it by heart pretty nearly all since it came out and i love dickens with every bit of my heart and sympathize in everything he thought or tried to do except in his effort to make more money by readings which killed him letter to daily telegraph sandgate january 4 1888                                                                   corpus christi college oxford                                     26th december 1877  i dont know really whether i ought to be at brantwood or here on christmas yesterday i had two lovely services in my own cathedral you know the cathedral of oxford is the chapel of christ church college and i have my own high seat in the chancel as an honorary student besides being bred there and so one is ever so proud and ever so pious all at once which is ever so nice you know and my own dean thats the dean of christs church who is as big as any bishop read the services and the psalms and anthems were lovely and then i dined with henry acland and his family where i am an adopted sonall the more wanted yesterday because the favorite son herbert died this year in ceylonthe first death out of seven sons so they were glad to have me then ive all my turners here and shall really enjoy myself a little today i think but i do wish i could be at brantwood too  oh dear ive scribbled this dreadfully can you really read my scribble susie love you may always read however scribbled                                                                   oxford 27th december 1877  by the way what a shame it is that we keep that word jealous in the second commandment as if it meant that god was jealous of images it means burning zealous or full of life visiting etc ie necessarily when leaving the father leaving the child necessarily when giving the father life giving life to the child and to thousands of the race of them that love me  it is very comic the way people have of being so particular about the second and fourth commandments and breaking all the rest with the greatest comfort for me i try to keep all the rest rather carefully and let the second and fourth take care of themselves  cold quite gone now its your turn susie ive got a love letter in chinese and cant read it                                                                   windsor castle                                    2d january 1878  im horribly sulky this morning for i expected to have a room with a view if the room was ever so little and ive got a great big one looking into the castle yard and i feel exactly as if i was in a big modern county jail with beautiful turrets of modern gothic  i came to see prince leopold who has been a prisoner to his sofa lately but i trust he is better he is very bright and gentle under severe and almost continual pain my dear little susie about that rheumatism of yours if it wasnt for that how happy we both ought to be living in thwaites and woods instead of nasty castles well about that shakespeare guide i cannot cannot at all fancy what it is in and out among the stars it sounds like a plan for stringing the stars i am so very glad you told me of it  unwritten books in my brain yes but also in how many other brains of quiet people books unthought of in the book and volume which will be read some day in heaven aloud when saw we thee yes and when read we ourselves  my dear susie if i were to think really lost what you for instance have new found in your own powers of receiving and giving pleasure the beautiful faculties you have scarcely venturing even to show the consciousness of them when it awakes in you what a woeful conception i should have of gods not caring for us he will gather all the wheat into his garner                                                                   ingleton 17th january 1878  its a charming post here and brings me my letters the first thing in the morning and i took care to tell nobody where i was going except people i wanted to hear from what a little busy bee of a susie youve been to get all those extracts ready by this time ive got nothing done all the while ive been away but a few mathematical figures and the less i do the less i find i can do it and yesterday for the first time these twenty years at least i hadnt so much as a plan in my head all day but i had a lot to look at in the moorland flowers and quiet little ancient yorkshire farmhouses not to speak of ingleborough who was i think a little depressed because he knew you were only going to send your remembrances and not your love to him the clouds gathered on his brow occasionally in a fretful manner but towards evening he resumed his peace of mind and sends you his remembrances and his blessing i believe he saves both you and me from a great deal of east wind  well ive got a plan in my head this morning for the new extracts shall we call them lapides or marmora portici and put a little preface to them about the pavement of st marks porch and its symbolism of what the education of a good mans early days must be to him i think i can write something a little true and trustworthy about it                                                                             26th november  i have entirely resigned all hope of ever thanking you rightly for bread sweet odors roses and pearls and must just allow myself to be fed scented rosegarlanded and bepearled as if i were a poor little pet dog or pet pig but my cold is better and i am getting on with this botany but it is really too important a work to be pushed for a week or a fortnight and mary and you will be pleased at last i am sure  i have only today got my four families clarissa lychnis scintilla and mica perfectly and simply defined25 see how nicely they come        a clarissa changed from dianthus which is bad greek and all       my pretty flowers have names of girls petal jagged at the       outside        b lychnis petal divided in two at the outside and the       fringe retired to the top of the limb        c scintilla changed from stellaria because i want stella for       the house leeks petal formed by the two lobes of lychnis       without the retired fringe        d mica single lobed petal  when once these four families are well understood in typical examples how easy it will be to attach either subordinate groups or specialities of habitat as in america to some kinds of them the entire order for their purity and wildness are to be named from artemis artemides instead of caryophyllaceæ and next them come the vestals mints lavenders etc and then the cytheride viola veronica giulietta the last changed from polygala  that third herb robert one is just the drawing that nobody but me never mind grammar could have made nobody because it means ever so much careful watching of the ways of the leaf and a lot of work in cramp perspective besides it is not quite right yet but it is nice  footnote 25 proserpina                                    it is so nice to be able to find anything that is in the least new to you and interesting my rocks are quite proud of rooting that little saxifrage  im scarcely able to look at one flower because of the two on each side in my garden just now i want to have bees eyes there are so many lovely things  i must tell you interrupting my botanical work this morning something that has just chanced to me  i am arranging the caryophylls which i mass broadly into clarissa the true jaggedleaved and clovescented ones lychnis those whose leaves are essentially in two lobes arenaria which i leave untouched and mica a new name of my own for the pearlworts of which the french name is to be miette and the representative type now sagina procumbens is to be in        latinmica amica       frenchmiette lamie       englishpet pearlwort  then the next to this is to be        latinmica millegrana       frenchmiette aux mille perles       englishthousand pearls  now this on the whole i consider the prettiest of the group and so look for a plate of it which i can copy hunting all through my botanical books i find the best of all is baxters oxford one and determine at once to engrave that when turning the page of his text i find the specimen of this curious and interesting little plant from which the accompanying drawing was made was communicated to me by miss susan beever to the kindness of this young lady and that of her sister miss mary beever i am indebted for the four plants figured in this number  i have copied lest you should have trouble in looking for the book but now you darling susie please tell me whether i may not separate these lovely pearlworts wholly from the spergulasby the pearlworts having only two leaves like real pinks at the joints and the spergulas a cluster and tell me how the spergulas scatter their seeds i cant find any account of it                                    i would fain have come to see that st bruno lily but if i dont come to see susie and you be sure i am able to come to see nothing at present i am very deeply involved in the classification of the minerals in the sheffield museum important as the first practical arrangement ever yet attempted for popular teaching and this with my other work makes me fit for nothing in the afternoon but woodchopping but i will call today on dr browns friends  i hope you will not be too much shocked with the audacities of the new number26 of proserpina or with its ignorances i am going during my woodchopping really to ascertain in my own way what simple persons ought to know about tree growth and give it clearly in the next number i meant to do the whole book very differently but can only now give the fragmentary pieces as they chance to come or it would never be done at all  you must know before anybody else how the exogens are to be completely divided i keep the four great useful groups mallow geranium mint and wallflower under the head of domestic orders that their sweet service and companionship with us may be understood then the waterlily and the heath both four foils are to be studied in their solitudes i shall throw all that are not four foils out of the ericaceæ then finally there are to be seven orders of the dark proserpine headed by the draconids snapdragons and including the anemones hellebores ivies and forgetmenots  what plants i cannot get ranged under these 1242725 in all orders i shall give broken notices of as i have time leaving my pupils to arrange them as they like i cant do it all  the whole household was out after breakfast today to the top of the moor to plant cranberries and we squeezed and splashed and spluttered in the boggiest places the lovely sunshine had left till we found places squashy and squeezy enough to please the most particular and coolest of cranberry minds and then each of us choosing a little special bed of bog the tufts were deeply put in with every manner of tacit benediction such as might befit a bog and a berry and many an expressed thanksgiving to susie and to the kind sender of the luxuriant plants i have never had gift from you dear susie more truly interesting and gladdening to me and many a day i shall climb the moor to see the fate of the plants and look across to the thwaite ive been out most of the forenoon and am too sleepy to shape letters but will try and get a word of thanks to the far finder of the dainty things tomorrow  what loveliness everywhere in a duckling sort of state just now  footnote 26 part 5                                                                             brantwood  i hope you did not get a chill in the garden the weather is a little wrong again but i am thankful for last nights sunset  you know our english bible is only of james 1st timestalk is a saxon word and gets into english i fancy as early as the plantagenetsbut i have not hunted it downim just in the same mess with pith but im finding out a great deal about the thing though not the word for next deucalion in chopping my wood  you know funckia wont last long i am certain i shall have strength enough to carry my system of nomenclature at least as far as to exclude peoples individual names  i wont even have a susiastaythats christianyes i will have a susia but not a beeveria though                                       to miss beever                                 20th january 1879  you will not doubt the extreme sorrow with which i have heard of all that was ordered to be of terrible in your peaceful and happy household without for an instant supposing but on the contrary utterly refusing to admit that such calamities27 may be used to point a moral all useful morality having every point that god meant it to have perfectly sharp and bright without any burnishing of ours still less to adorn a tale the tales of modern days depending far too much upon scythian decoration with deaths heads i yet if i had been mr chapman would have pointed out that all concealments even of trivial matters on the part of young servants from kind mistresses are dangerous no less than unkind and ungenerous and that a great deal of preaching respecting the evil nature of man and the anger of god might be spared if children and servants were only taught as a religious principle to tell their mothers and mistresses when they go out exactly where they are going and what they are going to do i think both you and miss susan ought to use every possible means of changing or at least checking the current of such thoughts in your minds and i am in hopes that you may have a little pleasure in examining the plates in the volume of sibthorpes f græca which i send today in comparison with those of f danica the vulgarity and lifelessness of sibthorpes plates are the more striking because in mere execution they are the more elaborate of the two the chief point in the f danica being the lovely artistic skill the drawings for sibthorpe by a young german were as exquisite as the danes but the english engraver and colorist spoiled all  i will send you if you like them the other volumes in succession i find immense interest in comparing the greek and danish forms or conditions of the same english flower  i send the second volume in which the rufias are lovely and scarcely come under my above condemnation the first is nearly all of grass  footnote 27 one of our younger servants had gone on to the frozen lake the ice gave way and she was drowneds b                                                                   brantwood 4th february 1879  you know im getting my oxford minerals gradually to brantwood and whenever a box comes i think whether there are any that i dont want myself which might yet have leave to live on susies table and today ive found a very soft purple agate that looks as if it were nearly melted away with pity for birds and flies which is like susie and another piece of hard wooden agate with only a little ragged sky of blue here and there which is like me and a group of crystals with grass of epidote inside which is like what my own little cascade has been all the winter by the garden side and so ive had them all packed up and i hope you will let them live at the thwaite  then here are some more bits if you will be a child heres a green piece long of the stone they cut those green weedy brooches out of and a nice mousecolored natural agate and a great black and white one stained with sulphuric acid black but very fine always and interesting in its lines  oh dear the cold but its worth any cold to have that delicious robin dialogue please write some more of it you hear all they say im sure  i cannot tell you how delighted i am with your lovely gift to joanie the perfection of the stone its exquisite color and superb weight and flawless clearness and the delicate cutting which makes the light flash from it like a wave of the lake make it altogether the most perfect mineralogical and heraldic jewel that joanie could be bedecked with and it is as if susie had given her a piece of coniston water itself  and the setting is delicious and positively must not be altered i shall come on sunday to thank you myself for it meantime im working hard at the psalter which i am almost sure susie will like                                                                             brantwood  i am so very glad you like sir philip so much  ive sent for and hope to get him for you he was shot before he had done half his psalterhis sister finished it but very meanly in comparison you can tell the two hands on the harp at a mile off  the photographplease saylike all photos whatsoever is only nature dirtied and undistancedif that is all one wants in treesthey might be dead all the year round                                                                   25th may 1879  this is a most wonderful stone that dr kendall has foundat least to me i have never seen anything quite like it the arborescent forms of the central thread of iron being hardly ever assumed by an ore of so much metallic luster i think it would be very desirable to cut it so as to get a perfectly smooth surface to show the arborescent forms if dr kendall would like to have it done i can easily send it up to london with my own next parcel  i want very much to know exactly where it was found might i come and ask about it on dr kendalls next visit to you i could be there waiting for him any day  what lovely pictures you would have made in the old butterfly times of opal and felspar what lost creatures we all are we nice ones the alps and clouds that i could have done if i had been shown how                                                                   27th june 1879  everybodys gone and i have all the new potatoes and all the asparagus and all the oranges and everything and my susie too all to myself  i wrote in my diary this morning that really on the whole i never felt better in my life mouth eyes head feet and fingers all fairly in trim older than they were yes but if the head and heart grow wiser they wont want feet or fingers some day  and ill come to be cheered and scolded myself the moment ive got things a little to rights here i think imps get into the shelves and drawers if theyre kept long locked and must be caught like mice the boys have been very good and left everything untouched but the imps and to hear people say there arent any how happy you and i should always be if it werent for them  how gay you were and how you cheered me up after the dark lake  please say john inglesant is harder than real history and of no mortal use i couldnt read four pages of it clever of course                                                                   herne hill 14th august 1880  ive just finished my scott paper28 but it has retouchings and notings yet to do i couldnt write a word before havent so much as a syllable to diddie and only a move at chess to macdonald for you know to keep a chess player waiting for a move is like keeping st lawrence unturned  footnote 28 fiction fair and foul no 3                                                                   21st august 1880  im leaving today for dover and a line from you tomorrow or monday would find me certainly at poste restante abbeville  i have not been working at all but enjoying myself only that takes up time all the same at crystal palace concerts and jugglings and at zoological gardens where i had a snake seven feet long to play with only i hadnt much time to make friends and it rather wanted to get away all the time and i gave the hippopotamus whole buns and he was delighted and saw the cormorant catch fish thrown to him six yards off never missed one you would have thought the fish ran along a wire up to him and down his throat and i saw the penguin swim under water and the sea lions sit up four of them on four wooden chairs and catch fish also but they missed sometimes and had to flop off their chairs into the water and then flop out again and flop up again  and i lunched with cardinal manning and he gave me such a plum pie i never tasted a protestant pie to touch it                                    now youre just wrong about my darling cardinal see what it is to be jealous he gave me lovely soup roast beef hare and currant jelly puff pastry like papal pretensionsyou had but to breathe on it and it was nowhereraisins and almonds and those lovely preserved cherries like kisses kept in amber and told me delicious stories all through lunch there  and we really do see the sun here and last night the sky was all a spangle and delicate glitter of stars the glare of them and spikiness softened off by a young darling of a moon                                                                   amiens 29th august 1880  you have been made happy doubtless with us by the news from herne hill ive only a telegram yet though but write at once to congratulate you on your little goddaughter  also to say that i am very well and sadly longing for brantwood but that i am glad to see some vestige of beloved things here once more  we have glorious weather and i am getting perfect rest most of the daymere saunter in the sunny air taking all the good i can of it tomorrow we get dv to beauvais where perhaps i may find a letter from susie in any case you may write to hôtel meurice paris  the oleanders are coming out and geraniums in all cottage windows and golden corn like etruscan jewelry over all the fields                                                                   beauvais 3d september 1880  we are having the most perfect weather i ever saw in france much less anywhere else and im taking a thorough rest writing scarcely anything and sauntering about old town streets all day  i made a little sketch of the lake from above the waterhead which goes everywhere with me and it is so curious when the wind blows the leaf open when i am sketching here at beauvais where all is so differently delightful as if we were on the other side of the world  i think i shall be able to write some passages about architecture yet which susie will like i hear of countless qualities being discovered in the new little susie and all things will be happy for me if you send me a line to hôtel meurice saying you are happy too                                                                   paris 4th september 1880  i have all your letters and rejoice in them though it is a little sadder for you looking at empty brantwood than for me to fancy the bright full thwaite and then its a great shame that ive everything to amuse me and lovely louvres and shops and cathedrals and coquettes and pictures and plays and prettinesses of every color and quality and youve only your old old hills and quiet lake very thankful i shall be to get back to them though  we have finished our paris this afternoon and hope to leave for chartres on monday                                                                   hÔtel de meurice paris                                 4th september 1880  is it such pain to you when people say what they ought not to say about me but when do they say what they ought to say about anything nearly everything i have ever done or said is as much above the present level of public understanding as the old man is above the waterhead  we have had the most marvelous weather thus far and have seen paris better than ever ive seen it yetand today at the louvre we saw the casette of st louis the coffre of anne of austria the porphyry vase made into an eagle of an old abbé segur or some such name all these you can see also you know in those lovely photographs of miss rigbyes if you can only make out in this vile writing of mine what i mean  but it is so hot i can scarcely sit up or hold the pen but tumble back into the chair every half minute and unbutton another button of waistcoat and gasp a little and nod a little and wink a little and sprinkle some eau de cologne a little and try a little to write a little and forget what i had to say and where i was and whether its susie or joan im writing to and then i see some letters ive never opened that came by this mornings post and think id better open them perhaps and here i find in one of them a delightful account of the quarrel that goes on in this weather between the nicest elephant in the zoo and his keeper because he wont come out of his bath i saw them at it myself when i was in london and saw the elephant take up a stone and throw it hard against a door which the keeper was behindbut my friend writes i must believe from what i saw that the elephant knew he would injure the man with the stones for he threw them hard to the side of him and then stood his ground when however he threw water and wetted the man he plunged into the bath to avoid the whip not fearing punishment when he merely showed what he could do and did not  the throwing the stone hard at the door when the keeper was on the other side of it must have been great fun for him  i am so sorry to have crushed this inclosed scrawl it has been carried about in my pocket to be finished and i see theres no room for the least bit of love at the bottom so heres a leaf full from the bois de boulogne which is very lovely and we drive about by night or day as if all the sky were only the roof of a sapphire palace set with warm stars                                                                   chartres 8th september 1880                                hôtel du grande monarque  i suppose im the grand monarque i dont know of any other going just now but i dont feel quite the right thing without a wig anyhow im having everything my own way just nowweather dinner news from joanie and news from susie only i dont like her to be so very very sad though it is nice to be missed so tenderly but i do hope you will like to think of my getting some joy in old ways again and once more exploring old streets and finding forgotten churches  the sunshine is life and health to me and i am gaining knowledge faster than ever i could when i was young  this is just to say where i am and that you might know where to write  the cathedral here is the grandest in france and i stay a week at least                                                                   chartres 13th september 1880  i must be back in england by the 1st october and by the 10th shall be myself ready to start for brantwood but may perhaps stay if joanie is not ready till she can come too anyway i trust very earnestly to be safe in the shelter of my own woodside by the end of october i wonder what you will say of my account of the five lovers of nature29 and seclusion in the last nineteenth century  i am a little ashamed to find that in spite of my sublimely savage temperament i take a good deal more pleasure in paris than of old and am even going back there on friday for three more days  we find the people here very amiable and the french old character unchanged the perfect cleanliness and unruffledness of white cap is always a marvel and the market groups exquisite but our enjoyment of the fair is subdued by pity for a dutiful dog who turns a large wheel by walking up it inside the whole afternoon producing awful sounds out of a huge grinding organ of which his wheel and he are the unfortunate instruments him we love his wheel we hate and in general all french musical instruments i have become quite sure of one thing on this journey that the french of today have no sense of harmony but only of more or less lively tune and even for a time will be content with any kind of clash or din produced in time  the cathedral service is however still impressive  footnote 29 rousseau shelley byron turner and john ruskin                                                                   paris 18th september 1880  what a very sad little letter and how very naughty of my little susie to be sad because there are still six weeks to the end of october how thankful should we both be to have six weeks still before us of the blessed bright autumn days with their quiet mildnesses in the midst of northern winds and that these six weeks are of the year 1880instead of 81 or 82and that we both can read and think and see flowers and skies and be happy in making each other happy what a naughty little susie to want to throw any of her six weeks away  ive just sealed in its envelope for post the most important fors i have yet written addressed to the trades unions30 and their committees are to have as many copies as they like free for distribution free dainty packets of dynamite i suspect i shall get into hot water with some people for it also ive been afraid myself to set it all down for once but down it is and out it shall come and theres a nice new bit of article for the nineteenth century besides anyhow i keep you in reading susiedo you know its a very bad compliment to me that you find time pass so slowly  i wonder why you gave me that little lecture about being a city on a hill i dont want to be anything of the sort and im going tonight to see the fille du tambourmajor at the folies dramatiques  footnote 30 fors vol viii letter 5                                                                   brantwood 16th february 1881  ive much to tell you today31 of answer to those prayers you prayed for me but you must be told it by our good angels for your eyes must not be worn god willing you shall see men as trees walking in the garden of god on this pretty coniston earth of ours dont be afraid and please be happy for i cant be if you are not love to

rheumatic creak in my neck which makes me physically stiff and morally supple and unprincipled so ive put two pounds sixteen in my own till where it just fills up some lowering of the tide lately by german bands and the like and ive put ten pounds aside for sheffield museum now in instant mendicity and ive put ten pounds aside till you and i can have a talk and you be made reasonable after being scolded and scratched after which on your promise to keep to our old bargain and enjoy spending your little frondes income ill be your lovingest again and for the two pounds ten and the ten i am really most heartily grateful meaning as they do so much that is delightful for both of us in the good done by this work of yours  i send you spenser perhaps you had better begin with the hymn to beauty page 39 and then go on to the tears but youll see how you like it its better than longfellow see line 52            the house of blessed gods which men call skye  now im going to look out dr

brantwood 12th july 1881  how delightful that you have that nice mrs howard to hear you say the ode to beauty and how nice that you can learn it and enjoy saying it34 i do not know it myself i only know that it should be known and said and heard and loved  i am often near you in thought but cant get over the lake somehow theres always somebody to be looked after here now ive to rout the gardeners out of the greenhouse or i should never have a strawberry or a pink but only nasty gloxinias and glaring fuchsias and ive been giving lessons to dozens of people and writing charming sermons in the bible of amiens but i get so sleepy in the afternoon i cant pull myself over it  i was looking at your notes on birds yesterday how sweet they are but i cant forgive that young blackbird for getting wild again35  footnote 34 i learnt the whole of it by heart and could then say it without a break i have always loved it and in return it has helped me through many a long and sleepless nights b  footnote 35 pages 101 et seqq                                                         last day of 1881 and the last letter                                  i write on it with new pen  ive lunched on your oysters and am feasting eyes and mind on your birds  what birds  woodcock yes i suppose and never before noticed the sheath of his bill going over the front of the lower mandible that he may dig comfortably but the others the glory of velvet and silk and cloud and light and black and tan and gold and golden sand and dark tresses and purple shadows and moors and mists and night and starlight and woods and wilds and dells and deeps and every mystery of heaven and its finger work is in those little birds backs and wings i am so grateful all love and joy to you and wings to fly with and birds hearts to comfort and mine be to you in the coming year                                                                   easter day 1882  i have had a happy easter morning entirely bright in its sun and clear in sky and with renewed strength enough to begin again the piece of st benedicts life where i broke off to lose these four weeks in londonweeks not wholly lost neither for i have learned more and more of what i should have known without lessoning but i have learnt it from these repeated dreams and fantasies that we walk in a vain shadow and disquiet ourselves in vain so i am for the present everybody says quite good and give as little trouble as possible but people will take it you know sometimes even when i dont give it and theres a great fuss about me yet but you must not be anxious any more susie for really there is no more occasion at one time than another all the doctors say i neednt be ill unless i like and i dont mean to like any more and as far as chances of ordinary danger i think one runs more risks in a single railway journey than in the sicknesses of a whole year                                                                   herne hill 8th june 1882  you write as well as ever and the eyes must surely be better and it was a joyful amazement to me to hear that mary was able to read and could enjoy my childs botany you always have things before other people will you please send me some rosemary and lavender as soon as any are out i am busy on the labiatæ and a good deal bothered also st benedict whom i shall get done with long before ive made out the nettles he rolled in  im sure i ought to roll myself in nettles burdocks and blackthorn for here in london i cant really think now of anything but flirting and im only much the worse for it afterwards  and im generally wicked and weary like the people who ought to be put to rest but youd miss me and so would joanie so i suppose i shall be let stay a little while longer                                                                   sallanches savoy 13th september 1882  i saw mont blanc again today unseen since 1877 and was very thankful it is a sight that always redeems me to what i am capable of at my poor little best and to what loves and memories are most precious to me so i write to you one of the few true loves left the snow has fallen fresh on the hills and it makes me feel that i must soon be seeking shelter at brantwood and the thwaite                                                                   genoa sunday 24th september 1882  i got your delightful note yesterday at turin and it made me wish to run back through the tunnel directly instead of coming on here but i had a wonderful day the alps clear all the morning all round italytwo hundred miles of them and then in the afternoon blue waves of the gulf of genoa breaking like blue clouds thunderclouds under groves of olive and palm but i wished they were my sparkling waves of coniston instead when i read your letter again  what a gay susie receiving all the world like a queen susan how odd one has never heard of a queen susan only you are so naughty and you never do tell me of any of those nice girls when theyre coming but only when theyre gone and i never shall get glimpse of them as long as i live  but you know you really represent the entire ruskin school of the lake country and i think these levées of yours must be very amusing and enchanting but its very dear and good of you to let the people come and enjoy themselves and how really well and strong you must be to be able for it  i am very glad to hear of those sweet shy girls poor things36 i suppose the sister they are now anxious about is the one that would live by herself on the other side of the lake and study emerson and aspire to buddhism  im trying to put my own poor little fragmentary ism into a rather more connected form of imagery ive never quite set myself up enough to impress some people and ive written so much that i cant quite make out what i am myself nor what it all comes to  footnote 36 florence alice and may bennett florence is gone alice and may still sometimes at coniston dg march 1887j r  one

and glad i am to have your lovely note and to know that the bewick gave you pleasure and that you are so entirely well now as to enjoy anything requiring so much energy and attention to this degree for indeed i can scarcely now take pleasure myself in things that give me the least trouble to look at but i know that the pretty book and its chosen woodcuts ought to be sent to you first of all my friends i have not yet thought of sending it to any one else and i am quite put in heart after a very despondent yesterday passed inanely in thinking of what i couldnt do by feeling what you can and hoping to share the happy christmas time with you and susie in future years will you please tell my dear susie im going to bring over a drawing to show so thankful that i am still able to draw after these strange and terrible illnesses this afternoon i am in hopes it may clear but dark or bright im coming about half past three and am ever your and her most affectionate and faithful servant

the sweet evening light susiesque lightwith great happiness and admiration as i went home and i came indeed upon what i conceived to bediscovered in the course of recent excavationstwo deeply interesting thrones of the ancient abbots of furness typifying their humility in that the seats thereof were only level with the ground between two clusters of the earth contemplating cyclamen and their severity of penance in the points of stone prepared for the mortification of their backs but truly susies seat of repose and meditation i was unable as yet to discern but propose to myself

have been thrown a week out in all my plans by having to write two new lectures instead of those the university was frightened at the scientists slink out of my way now as if i was a mad dog for i let them have it hot and heavy whenever ive a chance at them  but as i said im a week late and though i start for the north this day week i cant get home till this day fortnight at soonest but i hope not later than tomorrow fortnight very thankful i shall be to find myself again at the little room door  fancy mary gladstone forgiving me even that second naughtiness37 shes going to let me come to see

will be found in arrows of the chace vol ii and a final attack is made in an interview in the pall mall gazette 21st april 1884 the subject is summarized in an article in the daily news of 4th july

at both beginnings instead of both ends every day beginning two worldsthe old one to be lived over again the new to learn our golden letters in not that i mean to write books in that world i hope to be set to do something there and what lovely receptions you will have in your little heavenly thwaite and celestial teas and you wont spoil the cream with hot water will you any more  the whole

comfortably as a tit it will stand nicely on your table without upsetting and is so comfortable to hold and altogether im pleased to have got it for you                                                                   brantwood 1st march 1886  yes i knew you would like that silver shrine and it is an extremely rare and perfect specimen but you need not be afraid in handling it if the little bit of spar does come off it or out of it no matter  but of course nobody else should touch it till you give them leave and show them how  i am sorry for poor miss brown and for your not having known the doctor he should have come here when i told him i believe he would have been alive yet and i never should have been ill                                     i believe you know more latin than i do and can certainly make more delightful use of it  your mornings ministry to the birds must be remembered for you by the angels who paint their feathers they will all one day be birds of paradise and say when the adverse angel accuses you of being naughty to some people but we were hungry and she gave us corn and took care that nobody else ate it  i am indeed thankful you are better but you must please tell me what the thing was i said which gave you so much pain do you recollect also what the little bit in proserpina was that said so much to you were you not thinking of fors                                     i am very thankful for all your dear letters alwaysgreatly delighted above all with the squirrel one and chaucer didnt he love squirrels39 and dont i wish i was a squirrel in susies pear trees instead of a hobbling disconsolate old man with no teeth to bite much less crack anything and particularly forbidden to eat nuts  footnote 39            and many squireles that sett

are a little better came this morning with the exquisite feathers one darker and lovelier than any i have seen but please i still want one not in the least flattened all these have lost just the least bit of their shelllike bending you can so easily devise a little padding to keep two strong cards or bits of wood separate for one or two to lie happily in i dont mind giving you this tease for the throat will be better the less you remember it but for all of us a dark sky is assuredly a poisonous and depressing power which neither surgery nor medicine can resist the difference to me between nature as she is now and as she was ten years ago is as great as between lapland and italy and the total loss of comfort in morning and evening sky the most difficult to resist of all spiritual hostility                                                                             22d may 1886  of course the little pyramid in crystal is a present with that enjoyment of pinkerton40 you will have quite a new indoors interest whatever the rain may say  how very lucky you asked me what basalt was how much has come out of it written in falling asleep ive been out all the morning and am so sleepy  but ive written a nice little bit of præterita before i went out trying to describe the rhone at geneva i think susie will like it if nobody else  that not enjoying the beauty of things goes ever so much deeper than mere blindness it is a form of antagonism and is essentially satanic a most strange form of demonology in otherwise good people or shall we say in good people you know we are not good at all are we now  i dont think youve got any green in your mica ive sent you a bit inclosed with some jealous spots in  footnote 40 pinkerton on petralogy                                                                             26th november 1886  do you know how to make sugar candy in my present abject state the only way of amusing myself i can hit on is setting the girls of the school to garden and cook by way of beginning in cooking i offered to pay for any quantity of wasted sugar if they could produce me a crystal or two of sugar candy on the way to twelfth cakes you know and sugar animals one of francescas friends made her a lifesize easter lamb in sugar the first try this morning was brought me in a state of sticky jelly  and after sending me a recipe for candy would you please ask harry to look at the school garden im going to get the boys to keep that in order but if harry would look at it and order some mine gravel down for the walks and with mr brocklebanks authority to whom i have spoken already direct any of the boys who are willing to form a corps of little gardeners and under harrys orders make the best that can be made of that neglected bit of earth i think you and i should enjoy hearing of it  i told a cambridge man yesterday that he had been clever enough to put into a shilling pamphlet all the mistakes of his generation                                                                             27th november 1886  for once i have a birthday stone for you a little worth your having and a little gladsome to me in the giving it is blue like the air that you were born into and always live in it is as deep as gentians and has their gleams of green in it and it is precious all through within and without as susie herself is many and many

mornings notewhatever you remember about birdsgoing back to very childhoodand just chatting on about all you have seen of them and done for them  you will make a little book as delightfulnay much more

half asleepand saw what i thought was a red breasted woodpecker as big as a pigeon presently it came down on the lawn and i made up my mind it was only a robin about the size of a small partridge  can it have been a crossbill                                                                             brantwood  ive had this cold five days now and its worse than ever and yet i feel quite well in

shooting and everybody thinks it perfectly right  it is a great joy to me that you find so much in the stones of venicei hope that book is worth the time it took me to write it every year of youth

heard with extreme sorrow yesterday of your mischance and with the greater that i felt the discomfort and alarm of it would be increased to youin their depressing power by a sense of unkindness to you

of the last thirty years of life all trying to give what they cannot giveof pleasure or receive whatfrom me they can no more receivethe younger ones especially thinking they can amuse me by telling me of their happy timeswhich i am so mean as to envy and am doubly distressed by the sense of my meanness in doing so  and my only resource is the quiet of my own work to whichthese last daysi have nearly given myself altogether yet i had read your letter as far as the place where you said you wanted one and then began to think what i should sayand read no further43 that dayand now here is this harm that had befallen youwhich i trust nevertheless is of no real consequence and this one thing i must say once for all that whatever may be my feelings to youyou must never more let yourself imagine for an instant they can come of any manner of offense that thought is real injustice to me i have never and never can have any other feeling towards you than that of the deepest gratitude respect and affectiontoo sorrowfully inexpressible and ineffectualbut never changing i will drive walk or row over to see you on new years dayif i am fairly wellbe the weather what it will i hope the bearer will bring me back a comforting report as to the effects of your accident and that you will never let yourself again be discomforted by mistrust of me for i am and shall ever be        your faithful and loving servant                                           john ruskin  footnote 43 dante inferno v 144                                     i never heard the likemy writing good and just now if you only saw the wretched notes on the back of lecture leaves  but i am so very glad you think it endurable and it is so nice to be able to give you a moments pleasure by such a thing im better today but still extremely languid i believe that there is often something in the spring which weakens one by its very tenderness the violets in the wood send one home sorrowful that one isnt worthy to see them or else that one isnt one of them  it is mere midsummer dream in the wood today  you could not possibly have sent me a more delightful present than this lychnis it is the kind of flower that gives me pleasure and health and memory and hope and everything that alpine meadows and air can im getting better generally too the sun did take one by surprise at first  how blessedly happy joanie and the children were yesterday at the thwaite im coming to be happy myself there tomorrow dv  here are the two bits of study i did in malham cove the small couples of leaves are different portraits of the first shoots of the two geraniums i dont find in any botany an account of their little round side leaves or of the definite central one above the branching of them  heres your lovely note just come i am very thankful that the venice gives you so much pleasure  i have at least one certainty which few authors could hold so surely that no one was ever harmed by a book of mine they may have been offended but have never been discouraged or discomforted still less corrupted  theres a saucy speech for susies friend you wont like me any more if i begin to talk like that                                     a sapphire is the same stone as a ruby both are the pure earth of clay crystallized no one knows why one is red and the other blue  a diamond is pure coal crystallized  an opal pure flintin a state of fixed jelly  im in a great passion with the horrid people who write letters to tease my good little susie i wont have it she shall have some more stones tomorrow  i must have a walk today and cant give account of them but ive looked them out its so very nice that you like stones if my father when i was a little boy would only have given me stones for bread how i should have thanked him  what infinite power and treasure you have in being able thus to enjoy the least things yet having at the same time all the fastidiousness of taste and imagination which lays hold of what is greatest in the least and best in all things  never hurt your eyes by writing keep them wholly for admiration and wonder i hope to write little more myself of books and to join with you in joy over crystals and flowers in the way we used to do when we were both more children than we are                                       to miss beever   i am ashamed not to have sent you a word of expression of my real and very deep feelings of regard and respect for you and of my not fervent in the usual phrase which means only hasty and ebullient but serenely warm hope that you may keep your present power of benevolent happiness to length of many days to come but i hope you will sometimes take the simpler view of the little agate box than that of birthday token and that you will wonder sometimes at its labyrinth of mineral vegetable i assure you there is nothing in all my collection of agates in its way quite so perfect as the little fiery forests of dotty trees in the corner of the piece which forms the bottom i ought to have set it in silver but was always afraid to trust it to a lapidary  what you say of the greek want of violets is also very interesting to me for it is one of my little pet discoveries that homer means the blue iris by the word translated violet                                                                             thursday morning  im ever so much better and the jackdaw has come but why wasnt i there to meet his pathetic desire for art knowledge to think of that poor birds genius and love of scarlet ribbons shut up in a cage what it might have come to  if ever my st georges schools come to any perfection they shall have every one a jackdaw to give the children their first lessons in arithmetic im sure he could do it perfectly now jack take two from four and show them how many are left now jack if you take the teaspoon out of this saucer and put it into that and then if you take two teaspoons out of two saucers and put them into this and then if you take one teaspoon out of this and put it into that how many spoons are there in this and how many in thatand so on  oh susie when we do get old you and i wont we have nice schools for the birds first and then for the children  that photograph is indeed like a visit how thankful i am that it is still my hope to get the real visit some day  i was yesterday and am always certainly at present very unwell and a mere trouble to my joanies and susies and all who care for me but im painting another bit of moss which i think susie will enjoy and hope for better times  did you see the white cloud that stayed quiet for three hours this morning over the old mans summit it was one of the few remains of the heaven one used to see the heaven one had a father in not a raging enemy  i send you rogers italy that is no more i do think youll have pleasure in it                                     ive been made so miserable by a paper of sir j lubbocks on flowers and insects that i must come and whine to you he says and really as if he knew it that insects chiefly bees entirely originate flowers that all scent color pretty form is owing to bees that flowers which insects dont take care of have no scent color nor honey  it seems to me that it is likelier that the flowers which have no scent color nor honey dont get any attention from the bees  but the man really knows so much about it and has tried so many pretty experiments that he makes me miserable  so im afraid youre miserable too write to tell me about it all  it is very lovely of you to send me so sweet a note when i have not been near you since the tenth century but it is all i can do to get my men and my moor looked after they have both the instinct of doing what i dont want the moment my backs turned and then there has not been light enough to know a hawk from a handsaw or a crow from a ptarmigan or a moor from a meadow but how much better your eyes must be when you can write such lovely notes  i dont understand how the strange cat came to love you so quickly after one dinner and a rest by the fire i should have thought an illtreated and outcast animal would have regarded everything as a trap for a month at leastdined in tremors warmed itself with its back to the fire watching the door and jumped up the chimney if you stepped on the rug  if you only knew the good your peacocks feathers have done me and if you could only see the clever drawing im making of one from the blue breast you know what lovely little fern or equisetum stalks of sapphire the filaments are they beat me so but theyre coming nice                                     that is so intensely true what you say about turners work being like natures in its slowness and tenderness i always think of him as a great natural force in a human frame  so nice all you say of the ethics and im a monster of ingratitude as bad as the dragon of wantley dont like dr browns friends book at all its neither scotch nor english nor fish nor flesh and its tiresome  im in the worst humor ive been in this month which is saying much and have been writing the wickedest fors i ever wrote which is saying more you will be so angry                                     im so very glad you will mark the bits you like but are there not a good many here and there that you dont likei mean that sound hard or ironical please dont mind them theyre partly because i never count on readers who will really care for the prettiest things and it gets me into a bad habit of expressing contempt which is not indeed any natural part of my mind  it pleases me especially that you have read the queen of the air as far as i know myself of my books it is the most useful and careful piece i have done but that againdid it not shock you to have a heathen goddess so much believed in ive believed in english ones long ago if you can really forgive me for the queen of the air there are all sorts of things i shall come begging you to read some day                                                                             21st july  im always looking at the thwaite and thinking how nice it is that you are there i think its a little nice too that im within sight of you for if i hadnt broken i dont know how many not exactly promises but nearly to be back at oxford by this time i might have been dragged from oxford to london from london to france from france who knows where but im here and settled to produce as soon as possible the following works        1 new number of loves meinie on the stormy petrel       2 new ditto of proserpina on sap pith and bark       3 new ditto of deucalion on clouds       4 new fors on new varieties of young ladies       5 two new numbers of our fathers on brunehaut and          bertha her niece and st augustine and st benedict       6 index and epilogue to four oxford lectures       7 report and account of st georges guild  and ive had to turn everything out of every shelf in the house for mildew and moths  and i want to paint a little bank of strawberry leaves  and ive to get a years dead sticks out of the wood and see to the new oat field on the moor and prepare lectures for october  im so idle i look at the hills out of bed and at the pictures off the sofa let us both be useless beings let us be butterflies grasshoppers lambs larks anything for an easy life im quite horrified to see now that these two have come back what a lot of books ive written and how cruel ive been to myself and everybody else who ever has to read them im too sleepy to finish this note                                                                             13th june  i do not know when i have received or how i could receive so great an encouragement in all my work as i do in hearing that you after all your long love and watchfulness of flowers have yet gained pleasure and insight from proserpina as to leaf structure the examples you send me are indeed admirable can you tell me the exact name of the plant that i may quote it  yes and the weather also is a great blessing to meso lovely this morning                                     im getting steadily better and breathing the sunshine a little again in soul and lips but i always feel so naughty after having had morning prayers and that the whole house is a sort of little bethel that ive no business in  im reading history of early saints too for my amiens book and feel that i ought to be scratched or starved or boiled or something unpleasant and i dont know if im a saint or a sinner in the least in mediæval language how did saints feel themselves i wonder about their saintship                                     it is such a joy to hear that you enjoy anything of mine and a double joy to have your sympathy in my love of those italians how i wish there were more like you what a happy world it would be if a quarter of the people in it cared a quarter as much as you and i do for what is good and true  that nativity is the deepest of all it is by the master of botticelli you know and whatever is most sweet and tender in botticelli he owes to lippi  but do you know i quite forget about cordelia and where i said it please keep it till i come i hope to be across to see you tomorrow  theyve been doing photographs of me again and im an orangoutang as usual and am in despair i thought with my beard i was beginning to be just the least bit nice to look at i would give up half my books for a new profile  what a lovely day since twelve oclock i never saw the lake shore more heavenly  i am very thankful that you like this st marks so much and do not feel as if i had lost power of mind i think the illness has told on me more in laziness than foolishness i feel as if there was as much in me as ever but it is too much trouble to say it and i find myself reconciled to staying in bed of a morning to a quite woeful extent i have not been affected so much by melancholy being very thankful to be still alive and to be able to give pleasure to some people  you have greatly helped me by this dear little note and the breads all right brown again and im ready for asparagus of any stoutness there are you content but my new asparagus is quite visible this year though how much would be wanted for a dish i dont venture to count but must be congratulated on its definitely stalky appearance  i was over the water this morning on school committee how bad i have been to let those poor children be tormented as they are all this time im going to try and stop all the spelling and counting and catechising and teach them onlyto watch and pray  the oranges make me think im in a castle in spain                                     your letters always warm me a little not with laughing but with the soft glow of life for i live mostly with la mort dans lame it is curious that the french whom one thinks of as slight and frivolous have this true and deep expression for the forms of sorrow that kill as opposed to those that discipline and strengthen and your words and thoughts just soften and warm like west wind  it is nice being able to please you with what im writing and that you can tell people im not so horrid  heres the fors you saw the proof of but this isnt quite right yet  the willy44 quotations are very delightful do you know that naughty cowley at all theres all kind of honey and strawberries in him  it is bitter cold here these last days i dont stir out but must this afternoon ive to go out to dinner and work at the arundel society and if you only knew what was in my thoughts you would be so sorry for me that i cant tell you  footnote 44 shakespeare                                                                        corpus christi college oxford  what a sad little letter written in that returned darkness how can you ever be sad looking forward to eternal life with all whom you love and god over all  it is only so far as i lose hold of that hope that anything is ever a trial to me but i cant think how im to get on in a world with no venice in it  you were quite right in thinking i would have nothing to do with lawyers not one of them shall ever have so much as a crooked sixpence of mine to save him from being hanged or to save the lakes from being filled up but i really hope there may be feeling enough in parliament to do a right thing without being deafened with lawyers slang  i have never thanked you for the snowdrops they bloomed here beautifully for four days then i had to leave them to go and lecture in london it was nice to see them but my whole mind is set on finding whether there is a country where the flowers do not fade else there is no spring for me people liked the lecture and so many more wanted to come than could get in that i had to promise to give another                                     heres your little note first of all and if you only knew how my wristbands are plaguing me youd be very sorry theyre too much starched and would come down like mittens and now ive turned them up theyre just like two horrid china cups upside down inside my coat and im afraid to write for fear of breaking them and ive a weeks work on the table to be done before one oclock on pain of uproar from my friends execution from my enemies reproach from my lovers triumph from my haters despair of joanie andwhat from susie ive had such a bad night too woke at halfpast three and have done a days work since thencomposing my lecture for march and thinking whats to become of a godson of mine whose  well never mind i neednt give you the trouble poor little susie of thinking too                                     im going to oxford today dv really quite well and rather merry i went to the circus with my new pet and saw lovely riding and ball play and my pet said the only drawback to it all was that she couldnt sit on both sides of me and then i went home to tea with her and gave mamma who is evangelical a beautiful lecture on the piety of dramatic entertainments which made her laugh whether she would or no and then i had my christmas dinner in advance with joanie and arfie and stacy marks and his wife and two pretty daughters and i had six kissestwo for christmas two for new years day and two for twelfth nightand everybody was in the best humor with everybody else and now my room is ankle deep in unanswered letters mostly on business and im going to shovel them up and tie them in a parcel labeled needing particular attention and then that will be put into a cupboard in oxford and i shall feel that everythings been done in a businesslike way  that badgers beautiful i dont think theres any need for such beasts as that to turn christians                                     i am indeed most thankful you are well again though i never looked on that deafness very seriously but if you like hearing watches tick and boots creak and plates clatter so be it to you for many and many a year to come i think i should so like to be deaf mostly not expected to answer anybody in society never startled by a bang never tortured by a railroad whistle never hearing the nasty cicadas in italy nor a child cry nor an owl nothing but a nice whisper into my ear by a pretty girl ah well im very glad i can chatter to you with my weak voice to my hearts content and you must come and see me soon now all that you say of proserpina is joyful to me what a susie you are drawing like that and im sure you know latin better than i do                                     i am better but not right yet there is no fear of sore throat i think but some of prolonged tooth worry it is more stomachic than coldic i believe and those tea cakes are too crisply seductive what can it be that subtle treachery that lurks in tea cakes and is wholly absent in the rude honesty of toast  the metaphysical effect of tea cake last night was that i had a perilous and weary journey in a desert in which i had to dodge hostile tribes round the corners of pyramids  a very sad letter from joanie tells me she was going to scotland last night at which i am not only very sorry but very cross  a chirping cricket on the hearth advises me to keep my heart up                                     your happy letters with the sympathetic misery of complaint of dark days have cheered me as much as anything could do  the sight of one of my poor companions of st george who has sent me not a widows but a parlormaids an old schoolmistress all her living and whom i found last night dying slowly and quietly in a damp room just the size of your study which her landlord wont mend the roof of by the light of a single tallow candledying i say slowly of consumption not yet near the end but contemplating it with sorrow mixed partly with fear lest she should not have done all she could for her children  the sight of all this and my own shameful comforts three wax candles and blazing fire and dry roof and susie and joanie for friends  oh me susie what is to become of me in the next world who have in this life all my good things                                     what a sweet careful tender letter this is i reinclose it at once for fear of mischief though ive scarcely read for indeed my eyes are weary but i see what gentle mind it means  yes you will love and rejoice in your chaucer more and more fancy ive never time now to look at himobliged to read even my homer and shakespeare at a scramble half missing the sensethe business of life disturbs one so                                                                             herne hill  illustration plan of ruskins room  heres your letter first thing in the morning while im sipping my coffee in the midst of such confusion as ive not often achieved at my best the little room which i think is as nearly as possible the size of your study but with a lower roof has to begin witha my bed b my basin stand c my table d my chest of drawers thus arranged in relation to e the window which has still its dark bars to prevent the little boy getting out f the fireplace g the golden or mineralogical cupboard and h the grand entrance the two dots with a back represent my chair which is properly solid and not uneasy three others of lighter disposition find place somewhere about these with the chimneypiece and drawers head are covered or rather heaped with all they can carry and the morning is just looking in astonished to see what is expected of it and smilingyes i may fairly say it is smiling for it is cloudless for its part above the smoke of the horizon lineat sarahs hope and mine of ever getting that room into order by twelve oclock the chimneypiece with its bottles spoons lozenge boxes matches candlesticks and letters jammed behind them does appear to me entirely hopeless and this the more because sarah45 when i tell her to take a bottle away that has a mixture in it which i dont like looks me full in the face and says she wont because i may want it i submit because it is so nice to get sarah to look one full in the face she really is the prettiest round faced and round eyed girl i ever saw and its a great shame she should be a housemaid only i wish she would take those bottles away she says im looking better today and i think im feeling a little bit moreno i mean a little bit less demoniacal but i still can do that jackdaw beautifully  footnote 45 our herne hill parlormaid for four years one of quite the brightest and handsomest types of english beauty i ever saw either in life or fancied in paintingj r                                     i am quite sure you would have felt like albert dürer had you gone on painting wrens  the way nature and heaven waste the gifts and souls they give and make passes all wonder you might have done anything you chose only you were too modest  no i never will call you my dear lady certainly if it comes to that something too dreadful will follow                                     i am most interested in your criticism of queen mary i have not read it but the choice of subject is entirely morbid and wrong and i am sure all you say must be true the form of decline which always comes on mental power of tennysons passionately sensual character is always of seeing ugly things a kind of delirium tremens turner had it fatally in his last years  i am so glad you enjoy writing to me more than any one else the book you sent me of dr john browns on books has been of extreme utility to me and contains matter of the deepest interest did you read it yourself if not i must lend it to you  i am so glad also to know of your happiness in chaucer dont hurry in reading i will get you an edition for your own that you may mark it in peace                                     i send you two books neither i fear very amusing but on my word i think books are always dull when one really most wants them no other people dont feel it as you and i do nor do the dogs and ponies but oughtnt we to be thankful that we do feel it the thing i fancy we are both wanting in is a right power of enjoying the past what sunshine there has been even in this sad year i have seen beauty enough in one afternoon not a fortnight ago to last me for a year if i could rejoice in memory  i have a painter friend mr goodwin coming to keep me company and im a little content in this worst of rainy days in hopes there may be now some clearing for him  our little kittens pass the days of their youth up against the wall at the back of the house where the heat of the oven comes through what an existence and yet with all my indoor advantages                             i am your sorrowful and repining                                                             j r                                     i am entirely grateful for your letter and for all the sweet feelings expressed in it and am entirely reverent of the sorrow which you feel at my speaking thus if only all were like you but the chief sins and evils of the day are caused by the pharisees exactly as in the time of christ and they make broad their phylacteries in the same way the bible superstitiously read becoming the authority for every error and heresy and cruelty to make its readers understand that the god of their own day is as living and as able to speak to them directly as ever in the days of isaiah and st john and that he would now send messages to his seven churches if the churches would hear needs stronger words than any i have yet dared to use against the idolatry of the historical record of his messages long ago perverted by mens forgetfulness and confused by mischance and misapprehension and if instead of the latin form scripture we put always writing instead of written or write in one place and scripture as if it meant our english bible in another it would make such a difference to our natural and easy understanding the range of texts  the peacocks feathers are marvelous i am very glad to see them i never had any of their downy ones before my compliments to the bird upon them please  i found a strawberry growing just to please itself as red as a ruby high up on yewdale crag yesterday in a little corner of rock all its own so i left it to enjoy itself it seemed as happy as a lamb and no more meant to be eaten  yes those are all sweetest bits from chaucer the pine new to me your own copy is being bound and all the richardbut you must not copy out the richard bits for i like all my richard alike from beginning to end yes my seed pearl bit is pretty i admit it was like the thing the cascades here im afraid come down more like seed oatmeal                                     i believe in my hasty answer to your first kind letter i never noticed what you said about aristophanes if you will indeed send me some notes of the passages that interest you in the birds it will not only be very pleasant to me but quite seriously useful for the birds have always been to me so mysterious in that comedy that i have never got the good of it which i know is to be had the careful study of it put off from day to day was likely enough to fall into the great region of my despair unless you had chanced thus to remind me of it  please if another chance of good to me come in your way in another brown spottypurple peacocks feather will you yet send it to me and i will be always your most grateful and faithful                                                              j r                                                                             herne hill  what translation of aristophanes is that i must get it ive lost i cant tell you how much knowledge and power through false pride in refusing to read translations though i couldnt read the original without more trouble and time than i could spare nevertheless you must not think this english gives you a true idea of the original the english is much more english in its temper than its words aristophanes is far more dry severe and concentrated his words are fewer and have fuller flavor this english is to him what currant jelly is to currants but its immensely useful to me  yes that is very sweet about the kissing i have done it to rocks often seldom to flowers not being sure that they would like it  i recollect giving a very reverent little kiss to a young sapling that was behaving beautifully in an awkward chink between two great big ones that were illtreating it poor me im old enough i hope to write grammar my own way my own little self meantime never by any chance got a kiss when i wanted itand the better i behaved the less chance i had it seemed                                     i never thought the large packet was from you it was thrown aside with the rest till evening and only opened then by chance i was greatly grieved to find what i had thus left unacknowledged the drawings are entirely beautiful and wonderful but like all the good work done in those bygone days donovans own book being of inestimable excellence in this kind they affect me with profound melancholy in the thought of the loss to the entire body of the nation of all this perfect artistic capacity and sweet will for want of acknowledgment system and direction i must write a careful passage on this matter in my new elements of drawing your drawings have been sent me not by you but by my mistress fors for a text it is no wonder when you can draw like this that you care so much for all lovely nature but i shall be ashamed to show you my peacocks feather ive sent it however                                     it is very sweet of you to give me your book but i accept it at once most thankfully it is the best type i can show of the perfect work of an english lady in her own simple peace of enjoyment and natural gift of truth in her sight and in her mind and many pretty things are in my mind and heart about it if my hands were not too cold to shape words for them the book shall be kept with my bewicks it is in nowise inferior to them in fineness of work the finished proof of next proserpina will i think be sent me by saturdays post much more is done but this number was hindered by the revisal of the dean of christ church which puts me at rest about mistakes in my greek                                     it is a great joy to me that you like the wordsworth bits there are worse coming but ive been put into a dreadful passion by two of my cleverest girl pupils going off pious its exactly like a nice pear getting sleepy and im pretty nearly in the worst temper i can be in for w w but what are these blessed feathers everything thats best of grass and clouds and chrysoprase what incomparable little creature wears such things or lets fall the fringe of flame is carlyles not mine but we feel so much alike that you may often mistake one for the other now                                     you cannot in the least tell what a help you are to me in caring so much for my things and seeing what i try to do in them you are quite one of a thousand for sympathy with everybody and one of the ten times ten thousand for special sympathy with my own feelings and tries yes that second column is rather nicely touched though i say it for hands and eyes of sixtytwo but when once the wind stops i hope to do a bit of primrosey ground that will be richer                                     here not i but a thing with a dozen of colds in its head am  i caught one cold on wednesday last another on thursday two on friday four on saturday and one at every station between this and ingleborough on monday i never was in such ignoble misery of cold ive no cough to speak of nor anything worse than usual in the way of sneezing but my hands are cold my pulse nowhere my nose tickles and wrings me my ears singlike kettles my mouth has no taste my heart no hope of ever being good for anything any more i never passed such a wretched morning by my own fireside in all my days and ive quite a fiendish pleasure in telling you all this and thinking how miserable youll be too oh me if i ever get to feel like myself again wont i take care of myself                                     the feathers nearly made me fly away from all my psalters and exoduses to you and my dear peacocks i wonder when solomon got his ivory and apes and peacocks whether he ever had time to look at them he couldnt always be ordering children to be chopped in two alas i suppose his wisdom in england of today would have been taxed to find out which mother lied in saying which child wasnt hers  ive been writing to miss r again and miss ls quite right to stay at home she thinks i have an eagles eye well what else should i have in day time together with my cats eye in the dark but you may tell her i should be very sorry if my eyes were no better than eagles doth the eagle know what is in the pit46 i do  footnote 46 blake                                     i hope you will be comforted in any feeling of languor or depression in yourself by hearing that i also am wholly lack lustrous depressed oppressed compressed and downpressed by a quite countless pressgang of despondencies humilities remorses shamefacednesses all overnesses all undernesses sicknesses dullnesses darknesses sulkinesses and everything that rhymes to lessness and distress and that im sure you and i are at present the mere targets of the darts of the  etc etc and matties waiting and mustnt be loaded with more sorrow but i cant tell you how sorry i am to break my promise today but it would not be safe for me to come                                     im a little better but cant laugh much yet and wont cry if i can help it yet it always makes me nearly cry to hear of those poor working men trying to express themselves and nobody ever teaching them nor anybody in all england knowing that painting is an art and sculpture also and that an untaught man can no more carve or paint than play the fiddle all efforts of the kind mean simply that we have neither master nor scholars in any rank or any place and i also what have i done for coniston schools yet i dont deserve an oyster shell far less an oyster                                                                             kirby lonsdale                                           thursday evening  you wont get this note tomorrow im afraid but after that i think they will be regular till i reach oxford it is very nice to know that there is some one who does care for a letter as if she were ones sister you would be glad to see the clouds break for me and i had indeed a very lovely morning drive and still lovelier evening and full moonrise here over the lune  i suppose it is kirkbylunes dale for the church i find is a very important norman relic by the way i should tell you that the colored plates in the stones of venice do great injustice to my drawings the patches are worn on the stones my drawings were not good but the plates are total failures the only one even of the engravings which is rightly done is the last i think in appendix inlaid dove and raven ill show you the drawing for that when i come back and perhaps for the san michele if i recollect to fetch it from oxford and ill fetch you the second volume which has really good plates that blue beginning i forgot to say is of the straits of messina and it is really very like the color of the sea  that is intensely curious about the parasitical plant of borneo butvery dreadful                                     you are like timon of athens and im like one of his parasites the oranges are delicious the brown bread dainty what the melon is going to be i have no imagination to tell but oh me i had such a lovely letter from dr john sent me from joan this morning and ive lost it it said is susie as good as her letters if so she must be better what freshness of enjoyment in everything she says  alas not in everything she feels in this weather i fear was ever anything so awful                                     do you know susie everything that has happened to me and the leaf i sent you this morning may show you it has had some hurting in it is little in comparison to the crushing and depressing effect on me of what i learn day by day as i work on of the cruelty and ghastliness of the nature i used to think so divine but i get out of it by remembering this is but a crumb of dust we call the world and a moment of eternity which we call time cant answer the great question tonight                                     i can only thank you for telling me and say praised be god for giving him back to us  worldly people say thank god when they get what they want as if it amused god to plague them and was a vast piece of selfdenial on his part to give them what they liked but i who am a simple person thank god when he hurts me because i dont think he likes it any more than i do but i cant praise him becausei dont understand whyi can only praise whats pretty and pleasant like getting back our doctor                                                                             26th november  and tomorrow im not to be there and ive no present for you and i am so sorry for both of us but oh my dear little susie the good people all say this wretched makeshift of a world is coming to an end next year and you and i and everybody who likes birds and roses are to have new birthdays and presents of such sugar plums crystals of candied cloud and manna in sticks with no ends all the way to the sun and white stones and new names in them and heaven knows what besides  it sounds all too good to be true but the good people are positive of it and sos the great pyramid and the book of daniel and the bible of amiens you cant possibly believe in any more promises of mine i know but if i do come to see you this day week dont think its a ghost and believe at least that we all love you and rejoice in your birthday wherever we are  im so thankful youre better  reading my old diary i came on a sentence of yours last year about the clouds being all trimmed with swansdown so pretty i copied it out of a letter the thoughts of you always trim me with swansdown                                     i never got your note written yesterday meant at least to do it even after post time but was too stupid and am infinitely so today also only i must pray you to tell sarah we all had elder wine to finish our evening with and i mulled it myself and poured it out in the saucepan into the expectants glasses and everybody asked for more and i slept like a dormouse but as i said i am so stupid this morning that well theres no that able to say how stupid i am unless the fly that wouldnt keep out of the candle last night and he had some notion of bliss to be found in candles and ive no notion of anything                                     the blue sky is so wonderful today and the woods after the rain so delicious for walking in that i must still delay any school talk one day more meantime ive sent you a book which is in a nice large print and may in some parts interest you i got it that i might be able to see scotts material for peveril and it seems to me that he might have made more of the real attack on latham house than of the fictitious one on front de boeufs castle had he been so minded but perhaps he felt himself hampered by too much known fact                                     but you gave my present before47 a month ago and ive been presenting myself with all sorts of things ever since and now its not half gone im very thankful for this however just now for st george who is cramped in his career and ill accept it if you like for him meantime ive sent it to the bank and hold him your debtor ive had the most delicious gift besides i ever had in my lifethe patriarch of venices blessing written with his own hand with his portrait  ill bring you this to see tomorrow and a fresh turner  footnote 47 frondes money                                     the weather has grievously depressed me this last week and i have not been fit to speak to anybody i had much interruption in the early part of it though from a pleasant visitor and i have not been able to look rightly at your pretty little book nevertheless im quite sure your strength is in private letter writing and that a curious kind of shyness prevents your doing yourself justice in print you might also surely have found a more pregnant motto about birds nests  am not i cross but these gray skies are mere poison to my thoughts and i have been writing such letters that i dont think many of my friends are likely to speak to me again                                       susies letters                                     the following letters and the little notes on birds are inserted here by the express wish of mr ruskin i had it in my mind to pay susie some extremely fine compliments about these letters and notes and to compare her method of observation with thoreaus and above all to tell some very pretty stories showing her st francislike sympathy with and gentle power over all living creatures but susie says that she is already far too prominent and we hope that the readers of hortus will see for themselves how she reverences and cherishes all noble life with a special tenderness i think for furred and feathered creatures to all outcast and hungry things the thwaite is a veritable bethlehem or house of bread and to her their sweet madonna nourrice no less than to her teacher the sparrows and linnets that crowd its thresholds are in a very particular sense sons of god                                                              a f                                                                             april 14th 1874  i sent off such a long letter to you yesterday my dear friend did you think of your own quotation from homer when you told me that field of yours was full of violets but where are the four fountains of white waterthrough a meadow full of violets and parsley how delicious calypsos fire of finely chopped cedar how shall i thank you for allowing me susie the little to distill your writings such a joy and comfort to mefor i shall need much very soon now i do so thank and love you for it i am sure i may say so to you i rejoice again and again that i have such a friend may i never love him less never prove unworthy of his friendship how i wanted my letter and now it has come and i have told our dr john of your safe progress so far i trust you will be kept safe from everything that might injure you in any way  the snow has melted away and this is a really sweet april day and ought to be enjoyedif only susie could but both she and her dear friend must strive with their grief when i was a girli was oncei used to delight in popes homer i do believe i rather enjoyed the killing and slaying specially the splitting down the chine but when i tried to read it again not very long ago i got tired of this kind of thing if you had only translated homer then i should have had a feast when a schoolgirl going each day with my bag of books into manchester i used to like don quixote and sir charles grandison with my milk porridge i must send you only this short letter today i can see your violet field from this window how sweetly the little limpid stream would tinkle today and how the primroses are sitting listening to it and the little birds sipping it i have come to the conclusion that bees go more by sight than by scent as i stand by my peacock with his gloriously gorgeous tail all spread out a bee comes right at it very vulgar but expressive and i have an alpine primula on this window stone brightly in flower and a bee came and alighted but went away again at once not finding the expected honey i wonder what you do the livelong day for i know you and idleness are not acquaintances i am so sorry your favorite places are spoiled but dear brantwood will grow prettier and prettier under your care                                                                             april 9th  i have just been pleased by seeing a blackbird enjoying with schoolboy appetite portions of a moistened crust of bread which i threw out for him and his fellowcreatures how he dug with his orange billeven more orange than usual perhaps at this season of the year at length the robins have built a nest in the ivy in our yarda very secure and sheltered place and a very convenient distance from the crumb market like the old woman he sings with a merry devotion and she thinks there never was such music as she sits upon her eggs he comes again and again with every little dainty that his limited income allows and she thinks it all the sweeter because he brings it to her now and then she leaves her nest to stretch her wings and to shake off the dust of care and to prevent her pretty ankles being cramped but she knows her duty too well to remain absent long from her precious eggs  now another little note from dr john and he actually begins my dear susieand ends let me hear from you soon ever yours affectionately also he says it is very kind in you to let me get at once close to you the rest of his short letter like you he was busy is nearly all about you so of course it is interesting to me and he hopes you are already getting good from the change and i indulge the same hope                                                                             10th april  brantwood looked so very nice this morning decorated by the coming into leaf of the larches i wish you could have seen them in the distance as i did the early sunshine had glanced upon them lighting up one side and leaving the other in softest shade and the tender green contrasted with the deep browns and grays stood out in a wonderful way and the trees looked like spirits of the wood which you might think would melt away like the white lady of avenel  dear sweet april still looks coldly upon usthe month you love so dearly little white lambs are in the fields now and so much that is sweet is coming but there is a shadow over this house now and also my dear kind friend is far away the horsechestnuts have thrown away the winter coverings of their buds and given them to that dear economical mother earth who makes such good use of everything and works up old materials again in a wonderful way and is delightfully unlike most economiststhe very soul of generous liberality now some of your own words so powerful as they areyou are speaking of the alp and of the great builderof your own transientness as of the grass upon its sides and in this very sadness a sense of strange companionship with past generations in seeing what they saw they have ceased to look upon it you will soon cease to look also and the granite wall will be for others etc etc  my dear friend was there ever any one so pathetic as you and you have the power of bringing things before one both to the eye and to the mind you do indeed paint with your pen now i have a photograph of younot a very satisfactory one but still i am glad to have it rather than none it was done at newcastleontyne were you in search of something of bewicks  i have just given the squirrel his little loaf so you see i am a lady48 he has bounded away with it full of joy and gladness i wish that this were my case and yours for whatever we may wish for that we have not we have a variety and abundance of loaves i have asked dr j brown whether he would like photographs of your house and the picturesque breakwater i do so wish that you and he and i did not suffer so much but could be at least moderately happy i am sure you would be glad if you knew even in this time of sorrow when all seems stale flat unprofitable the pleasure and interest i have had in reading your vol 3 modern painters i study your character in your writings and i find so much to elevate to love to admirea sort of education for my poor old selfand oh such beauty of thought and word  even yet my birds want so much bread i do believe the worms are sealed up in the dry earth and they have many little mouths to fill just nowand there is one old blackbird whose devotion to his wife and children is lovely i should like him never to die he is one of my heroes and now a dog which calls upon me sometimes at the window and i point kitchenwards and the creature knows what i mean and goes and gets a good meal so if i can only make a dog happy as you do only you take yours to live with you and i cannot do that it is a pleasant thing i do so like to make things happier and i should like to put bunches of hay in the fields for the poor horses for there is very scant supply of grass and too many for the supply  footnote 48 see fors clavigera letter xlv and sesame and lilies                                                                             1st may  i cannot longer refrain from writing to you my dear kind friend so often are you in my thoughts dearest joanie has told you i doubt not and i know how sorry you are and how truly you are feeling for your poor susie so knowing that i will say no more about my sorrow there is no need for words i am wishing oh so much to know how you are quite safe and well i hope and able to have much real enjoyment in the many beautiful things by which you are surrounded may you lay up a great stock of good health and receive much good in many ways and then return to those who so much miss you and by whom you are so greatly beloved  coniston would go into your heart if you could see it nowso very lovely the oak trees so early nearly in leaf already your beloved blue hyacinths will soon be out and the cuckoo has come but it is long since susie has been out she only stands at an open window but she must try next week to go into the garden and she is finding a real pleasure in making extracts from your writings for you often wondering will he let that remain and hoping that he will  do you ever send home orders about your brantwood i have been wishing so much that your gardener might be told to mix quantities of old mortar and soil together and to fill many crevices in your new walls with it then the breezes will bring fern seeds and plant them or rather sow them in such fashion as no human being can do when time and the showers brought by the west wind have mellowed it a little the tiny beginnings of mosses will be there the sooner this can be done the better do not think susie presumptuous  we have hot sun and a very cool air which i do not at all like  i hope your visit to palermo and your lady have been all that you could wish please do write to me it would do me so much good and so greatly refresh me  this poor little letter is scarcely worth sending only it says that i am your loving susie                                                                             14th may  my dearest friendyour letter yesterday did me so much good and though i answered it at once yet here i am again a kind woman from the other side has sent me the loveliest group of drooping and very tender ferns soft as of some velvet belonging to the fairies and of the most exquisite green and primroses and a slender stalked white flower and so arranged that they continually remind me of that enchanting group of yours in vol 3 which you said i might cut out what would you have thought of me if i had oh that you would and could sketch this groupor even that your eye could rest upon it now you will laugh if i ask you whether harpies49 ever increase in number or whether they are only the old original they quite torment me when i open the window and blow chaff at me i suppose at this moment dearest joanie is steaming away to liverpool one always wants to know now whether people accomplish a journey safely when the blackbirds come for soaked bread they generally eat a nice little lot themselves before carrying any away from the window for their little ones but bobbie our little english robin has just been twice took none for himself but carries beakload after beakload for his speckled infants how curious the universal love of bread is so many things like and eat iteven flies and snails  you know you inserted a letter from jersey about fish50 a lady there tells me that formerly you might have a bucket of oysters for sixpence and that now you can scarcely get anything but such coarse kinds of fish as are not liked and she has a sister a sad invalid to whom fish would be a very pleasant and wholesome change this is really a sad state of things and here the railways seem very likely to carry away our butter and it is now such a price quite exhorbitant why did i put an h in is it to prove the truth of what you say that ladies do not spell well a letter which i once wrote when a girl was a wonderful specimen of bad spelling  footnote 49 see queen of the air  footnote 50 see fors clavigera letter xxx                                                                             15th may  i have found such lovely passages in vol 1 this morning that i am delighted and have begun to copy one of them you do float in such beautiful things sometimes that you make me feel i dont know how  how i thank you for ever having written them for though late in the day they were written for me and have at length reached me  you are so candid about your age that i shall tell you mine i am astonished to find myself sixtyeightvery near the psalmists threescore and ten much illness and much sorrow and then i woke up to find myself old and as if i had lost a great part of my life let us hope it was not all lost  i think you can understand me when i say that i have a great fund of love and no one to spend it upon because there are not any to whom i could give it fully and i love my pets so dearly but i dare not and cannot enjoy it fully becausethey die or get injured and then my misery is intense i feel as if i could tell you much because your sympathy is so refined and so tender and true cannot i be a sort of second mother to you i am sure the first one was often praying for blessings for you and in this at least i resemble her  am i tiresome writing all this it just came and you said i was to write what did we have had some nice rain but followed not by warmth but a cruel east wind                                       about wrens   this year i have seen wrens nests in three different kinds of placesone built in the angle of a doorway one under a bank and a third near the top of a raspberry bush this last was so large that when our gardener first saw it he thought it was a swarm of bees it seems a pleasure to this active bird to build he will begin to build several nests sometimes before he completes one for jenny wren to lay her eggs and make her nursery think how busy both he and jenny are when the sixteen young ones come out of their shellslittle helpless gaping things wanting feeding in their turns the livelong summer day what hundreds and thousands of small insects they devour they catch flies with goodsized wings i have seen a parent wren with its beak so full that the wings stood out at each side like the whiskers of a cat  once in america in the month of june a mower hung up his coat under a shed near a barn two or three days passed before he had occasion to put it on again thrusting his arm up the sleeve he found it completely filled with something and on pulling out the mass he found it to be the nest of a wren completely finished and lined with feathers what a pity that all the labor of the little pair had been in vain  great was the distress of the birds who vehemently and angrily scolded him for destroying their house happily it was an empty one without either eggs or young birds                                       history of a blackbird   we had had one of those summer storms which so injure the beautiful flowers and the young leaves of the trees a blackbirds nest with young ones in it was blown out of the ivy on the wall and the little ones with the exception of one were killed the poor little bird did not escape without a wound upon his head and when he was brought to me it did not seem very likely that i should ever be able to rear him but i could not refuse to take in the little helpless stranger so i put him into a covered basket for a while  i soon found that i had undertaken what was no easy task for he required feeding so early in a morning that i was obliged to take him and his bread crumbs into my bedroom and jump up to feed him as soon as he began to chirp which he did in very good time  then in the daytime i did not dare to have him in the sittingroom with me because my sleek favorites the cats would soon have devoured him so i carried him up into an attic and as he required feeding very often in the day you may imagine that i had quite enough of exercise in running up and down stairs  but i was not going to neglect the helpless thing after once undertaking to nurse him and i had the pleasure of seeing him thrive well upon his diet of drybread crumbs and a little scrap of raw meat occasionally this last delicacy you know was a sort of imitation of worms  very soon my birdie knew my step and though he never exactly said so i am sure he thought it had musick int for as soon as i touched the handle of the door he set up a shriek of joy  the bird that we nurse is the bird that we love and i soon loved dick and the love was not all on one side for my bonnie bird would sit upon my finger uttering complacent little chirps and when i sang to him in a low voice he would gently peck my hair  as he grew on and wanted to use his limbs i put him into a large wicker bonnetbasket having taken out the lining it made him a large cheerful airy cage of course i had a perch put across it and he had plenty of white sand and a pan of water sometimes i set his bath on the floor of the room and he delighted in bathing until he looked halfdrowned then what shaking of his feathers what preening and arranging there was and how happy and clean and comfortable he looked when his toilet was completed  you may be sure that i took him some of the first ripe currants and strawberries for blackbirds like fruit and so do boys when he was fledged i let him out in the room and so he could exercise his wings it is a curious fact that if i went up to him with my bonnet on he did not know me at all but was in a state of great alarm  blackbirds are wild birds and do not bear being kept in a cage not even so well as some other birds do and as this bird grew up he was not so tame and was rather restless i knew that though i loved him so much i ought not to keep him shut up against his will he was carried down into the garden while the raspberries were ripe and allowed to fly away and i have never seen him since do you wonder that my eyes filled with tears when he left
