1863 nanny po as the civilized african calls this lofty and beautiful island had become a charnelhouse a dark and dismal tomb of europeans the yellow fever of the last year which wiped out in two months onethird of the white colonymore exactly 78 out of 250had not reappeared but the conditions for its reappearance were highly favourable the earth was all water the vegetation all slime the air half steam and the difference between wet and dry bulbs almost nil thoroughly dispirited for the first time i was meditating how to escape when h m steamship torch steamed into clarence cove and commander smith hospitably offered me a passage down south to hear was to accept two days afterwards july 29 1863 i bade a temporary adios to the enemy  the bitterness of death remained behind as we passed out of the baneful bights wind and wave were dead against us yet i greatly enjoyed the gradual emerging of the sun through his shroud of smokes the increasing consciousness that a moon and stars really exist the soft blue haze of the sky and the coolness of 73° f at 6 am in the captains cabin i had also time to enjoy these charms the torch was not provided with despatch boilers she was profoundly wormeaten and a yard of copper occasionally clapped on did not prevent her making some four feet of water a day so we rolled leisurely along the wellknown gaboon shore and faintly sighted from afar capes lopez and st catherine and the fringing ranges of mayumbaland a blue line of heights based upon gently rising banks ruddy and white probably of shaly clay the seventh day august 5 placed us off the wellknown red hills of loangoland  the country looks high and bold after the desperate flatness of the bights and we note with pleasure that we have left behind us the impervious luxuriance of vegetation which crowns the lowlands covers the sides of the rises and caps their summits during the rains after october the grass now showing yellow stubble upon the ruddy rusty plain becomes a cane fence ten to twelve feet tall but instead of matted felted jungle knitted together by creepers of cable size we have scattered clumps of dark lofty and broadtopped trees a nearer view shows great cliffs weatherworked into ravines and basins ribs and ridges towers and pinnacles above them is a joyful open land apparently disposed in two successive dorsa or steps with bright green tiers and terraces between and these are pitted with the craterlike sinks locally called holes so frequent in the gaboon country southwards the beauty of eternal verdure will end and the land will become drier and therefore better fitted for europeans the nearer it approaches mossamedes bay south of little fish again a barren tract of white sand will show the last tree an inhospitable region waterless and bulwarked by a raging sea  loango is a pool harbour like the ancient portus lemanus hythe a spit of shingle whose bay northeast and southwest forms an inner lagoon bounded landwards by conspicuous and weathertarnished red cliffs this lingula rests upon a base of terra firma whose westernmost projection is indian point from the latter runs northwards the infamous indian bar compared by old sailors with a lengthened bill of portland a reef some three miles long which the waves assault with prodigious fury a terror to slavers especially in our autumn when the squalls and storms begin the light sandy soil of the mainland rests upon compact clay and malaria rises only where the little drains which should feed the lagoon evaporate in swamps here and there are clumps of tall cocoas a capot pullom or wild cottontree and a neat village upon prairie land where stone is rare as on the pampas southwards the dry tract falls into low and wooded ground  the natural basin entered by the northeast is upwards of a mile in length and the narrow evershifting mouth is garnished with rocks the sea breaking right across gunboats have floated over during the rains but at dead low water in the dry season we would not risk the gig guided by a hut upon the beach fronting french factory and under lee of the breakers off indian bar i landed near a treemotte in a covelet smoothed by a succession of sandpits the land sharks flocked down to drag the boat over the breakwater of shingle they appeared small and effeminate after the burly negroes of the bights and their black but not comely persons were clad in red and white raiment it is a tribe of bumboat men speaking a few words of english french and portuguese and dealing in mats and pumpkins parrots and poultry cages and fetish dolls called idols  half a mile of good sandy path led to the english factory built upon a hill giving a charming view to the southeast and some three miles inland from the centre of the bay we were shown looboo wood a thick motte conspicuously crowning a ridge and forming a firstrate landmark its shades once sheltered the nyáre locally called buffalo the gorilla and perhaps the more monstrous impungu mpongo eastward of the factory appears chomfuku the village of jim potter with a treeclad sink compared by old voyagers with the large chalkpit on portsdown hill and still much affected by picnickers at loanghili or loanguilli south of looboo wood and upon the right bank of a streamlet which trickles to the sea is the cemetery where the kings are buried in gunboxes  the maloango for mwani lord of loango the great despot who ruled as far as the congo river who used to eat in one house drink in another and put to death man or beast that saw him feeding is a thing of the past yet five miles to the eastward here held to be a days march king monoyambi governs big loango town whose modern native name i was told is mangamwár he shows his power chiefly by forbidding strangers to enter the interior  the factory messrs hatton and cookson was a poor affair of bamboos and mats with partitionwalls of the same material and made pestilent by swamps to landward little work was then doing in palm oil and the copper mines of the interior had ceased to send supplies we borrowed hammocks to cross the swamps and we found french factory a contrast not very satisfactory to our insular pride m charles de gourlet of the maison régis was living not in a native hut lacking all the necessaries of civilized man but in a doublestoried stone house with barracoons hospital public room orchestra and so forth intended for the emigrants instead of water the employés had excellent cognac and vermouth and a succulent cuisine replaced the poor britishers two barrels of flour and biscuit no wonder that in our halfstarved fellow countrymen we saw little of the national failing a love of extravagant adventure the frenchmen shoot or at least go out shooting twice a week they walk to picnics learn something of the language and see something of the country they had heard a native tradition of mr gorillas big brother but they could give no details  i will conclude this chapter with a notice of what has taken place on the loango coast a decade after my departure although africa has changed but little europe has and we can hardly envy the german nation its eminence and unexpected triumphs in war when we see the energy and persistency with which they are applying themselves to the arts of peaceespecially of exploration and nowhere have they been more active than in this part of the world where their old rivals the english are apparently contented to sit at home in ease working their factories and counting out their money  to begin with the beginning the year 1872 found the berlin geographical society intent upon planting a lance in africa and upon extending and connecting the discoveries of livingstone du chaillu schweinfurth and other travellers delegates from the various associations of germany met in congress and organized april 19 1873 the germanic afrikanische gesellschaft expresident dr adolf bastian a wellknown traveller in siam cambodia china and the indian archipelago and who moreover had visited ambassi or salvador do congo the old missionary capital in 1857 was at once sent out as pioneer and vanguard to prospect the coast for a suitable station and a point de départ into the interiora scientific step dictated by trained and organized common sense the choice of leader fell upon dr gussfeldt herr von hattorf being his second in command and with them were associated dr falkenstein as zoologist and dr soyaux as botanist a geologist dr lenz of hamburg was sent to connect the ogobe and okanda rivers with the loango coast unless he found a likely northeastern route in this case the society would take measures to supply him with the necessary equipment  the expedition began unfortunately by the loss of outfit and instruments in the nigritia wrecked off sierra leone it persevered however and presently met dr bastian and professor von gorschen at cabinda the former had collected much information about the coast he had learned from slaves that the old kingdoms of loango mahango and angay are bounded eastwards or inland by mayombe a belt of forest the threshold of the unknown interior it begins the upslope to the great ghat ridge which visible after a days journey separates the coast from the central basin a fortnight or three weeks march leads to an open country a land of metalliferous hills where the people barter their goods against gunpowder and weapons brought by traders from the east these orientals are now heard of almost all along the west african coast and doubtless in several places the report will prove true the prospector had also visited in search of a depôt futila in cabindaland the tschiluango chiloango or cacongo river a fine navigable stream where the people float down their palm oil landana chinsonso chinxoxo pronounced chinshosho chicambo loango and the quillu kwillu stream the latter breaking through the coast range disemboguing near loango bay and reported to be connected with the great congo he found the old despotism of loango to be insignificant reduced in fact to the strip of coast between the quillu and the luemalukallo rivers the slave trade once a monopoly of kings princes and chiefs is now no more legitimate commerce has levelled ranks and the real power is in the hands of the wealthiest merchants  from the abbé durand librarian of the paris geographical society we learn 1 that loango is in the province of cacongo 2 that cacongo is considered a province of loango 3 that cacongo forms a kingdom of itself with a capital ringwele the name of the late king was dom joão capitão mempolo and though he had died some years ago he was not buried for the usual reasons in early 1874 meanwhile his nephew and successor mwátá bona was acting regent until the obsequies shall take place  the station finally chosen by the german explorers was chinxoxo or as herr kiepert uncompromisingly writes it tschinschonkscho it is within easy distance of the chiloango or luiza loango river and its port landana in cabindaland has become a thoroughly europeanized settlement with five trading stations up stream an empty dutch factory was repaired and the house containing a parlour three small bed rooms and the usual offices was ready for habitation by the second week in october  on october 26th dr güssfeldt after shaking off the seasoning fever at ponta negra proceeded to make a trial trip and a route survey with compass and chronometer up the important quillu river as usual it has a bar within the last few years the right bank has been carried away by the floods and some of the old factories are under water the average breadth is 400 paces which diminishes to 25 at the rocky gates near kama chitoma manyamatal and gotu at 29 direct miles from the mouth lies chimbak a trading station where dr güssfeldt rested and recruited strength for a month thence he went leisurely up stream to the bumina rapids and found the easterly rhumb of the river bending to the ne and the nne its channel did not exceed 50 yards in width and precipitous rockwalls rose on either hand at bumina as at gotu the quillu breaks through the parallel lines of ghats whose trend is from nw to se in fact these katarakten are the yellalas of the congo a march of four hours brought him to the mayombe country circ s lat 4° which must not be confounded with the mayumba or northernmost possession of the congo kingdom the latter word properly means king of yumba as maloango is mwaniloango the mayombe chief proved friendly and assisted dr güssfeldt to hire bearers november 7 for yangela where his excursion ended the boundaryline is marked by a large gate like the two openings in the wooden wall denoting the loango frontier between the quillu and luema rivers the character of the country changed to the normal parklike aspect of africa above the ghats the dense forests waxed thin picturesque views presented themselves reminding the wayfarer of switzerland and bare domeshaped mountains formed the background at nsunsi about 2100 feet above sealevel the eye ranged over the yangela country as far as the land of the batetye whose grassy plains are traversed by ranges trending to the wsw and apparently culminating to the south at the tondo village the skull of a gorilla was remarked the upper quillu after its great bend proved to be 350 to 400 paces broad and the traveller ascertained that instead of being connected with the great artery it rises in a lake nearly due north of nsundi sundi near the country of the babongo and the babum dr güssfeldt returned to the coast on december 2 and prepared for the great march into the interior  dr falkenstein the medicus and zoologist in november 1873 reported favourably of chinxoxo the station is situated on a hilly ridge commanding a view of the sea it looks imposing enough but it would produce more effect if we could hoist the german flag as the other establishments here do those of their respective nations german ships would then take home news of the progress of our undertaking and the natives would see at a distance this token of the enterprising spirit of the german nation and come to us with provisions and other natural products he adds in fernando po an island which i would recommend as a sanatorium for wealthy hypochondriacs we found an extraordinary abundance of fruit cocoanuts bananas mangoes delicious oranges and pineapplesthe ivory trade on the gaboon is very flourishing a german firm which i visited exports £10000 worth per annum the value of total exports being £26000 the tusks are very large one weighed about 80 lbs and some have ranged to 120 lbs the other articles exported are gum and ebony which are brought by the natives especially the fans and mpangwes sic from the interior the slave trade is said still to be carried on by europeans though it is not known where the slaves go to  of course to são thomé and princes island in the immediate vicinity of our station the chief trade is in palm oil and ground nuts rings chains crosses watches c are readily taken by the savages in exchange for native goods and i obtained a valuable fetish for a chain and a cross worth a silbergroschen  after three months spent upon the coast and much suffering from fever the energetic dr bastian was welcomed home on december 13 1873 his present bookfn1 makes only one instalment of the work the other being the correspondenzblätter der afrikanischen gesellschaft briefly everything has been done to lay the foundation for success and to advertise the undertaking finally not satisfied with these steps the german society for the exploration of equatorial africa organized in september 1874 a second expedition captain alexander von homeyer a wellknown ornithologist will lead it viâ s paulo de loanda and cassange kasanji to the mysterious lands of the mwata ya nvo and thus supplement the labours of portuguese travellers this fine undertaking set out early in 1875                                chapter ii                      to são paulo de loanda    at loango by invitation of commander hoskins rn i transferred myself on board hm steamship zebra one of the nymphs of the british navy and began the 240 miles southwards there was no wind except a slant at sunset and the current often carried us as far backwards as the sails drove us onwards the philosophic landlubber often wonders at the eternal restlessness of his naval brotherman who ever sighs for a strong wind to make the port and who in port is ever anxious to get out of it i amused myself in the intervals of study with watching the huge gulls which are skinned and found good food at fernando po and in collecting the papernautilus the ocythoë cranchii was often found inside the shell and the sea was streaked as with cotton flecks by lines of eggs several inches long a mass of mucus with fine membraneous structure adhering to the rocks and coagulating in spirits or salt water the drumfish was not heard except when we were at anchor its sound somewhat suggests a distant frog concert and i soon learned to enjoy what m dufosse has learnedly named ichthyopsophosis the song of the fish passing cabinda 57 miles from loanda but barely in sight we fell in with hm steamship espoir commander douglas who had just made his second capture of a slaveschooner carrying some 500 head of congos in these advanced days the representative man walks up to you as you come on board touches his cap or his wool and expresses his best thanks in west coast english when you offer him a dram he compares it with the trade article which only ting he no burn the characteristic sights are the captured moleques or negrokins who habited in sacks to the knees choose an mc to beat time whilst they sing in chorus extending the right arm and foully abusing their late masters who skulk about the forecastle  ten days sped by before we sighted the beginning of the end cape spilemberta and dande point two bluffs in distinct serrations the aspect of the land was pleasant a vista of tall cliffs white or red rising walllike from a purple sea jagged with sharp black reef and diabolito and bearing on the summit a plateau well grown with grass and tree we then opened a deep bight which has the honour of being entitled the longest indentation from cape lopez to great fish bay some 17° or a thousand miles of coast a gap in the cliff line and darker vegetation showed the zenza river generally called bengo from the district icolo e bengo which it traverses here was once a busy settlement much frequented by shipping which thus escaped harbour dues the mosquitohaunted stream clear in the dries and as usual muddy during the rains supports wild duck and carried some ten miles in dongos or flatbottomed boats supplies the capital of angola with drinking water and dysentery  as we glide towards the anchorage two features attract my attention the morro or hillridge on the mainland and the narrow strip which forms the harbour the escarpment sweeping from a meridian to a parallel juts westward in the bluff cape lagostas lobsters a manycoloured face in places not unlike the white cliffs of dover it then trends from northeast to southwest bending at last in a picturesque bow with a shallow sag the material is the tauá or bloodred marl of the brazil banded with white and brown green chocolate and yellow huge heaps of rotten earth washed down by the rains cumber the base of the ruined seawall north of the town in front is a pellucid sea with the usual trimmings while behind roll the upland stubbles of autumn here mottled black with fire there scattered with the wild ficus and the cashew a traveller from the opposite hemisphere  the ilha de loanda which gave its name to the city according to mr w winwood reade savage africa chapter xxv is derived from a native word meaning bald i believe it to be the angolan luánda or tribute forming the best harbour of the south african coast it is made by the missionaries of the seventeenth century to extend some ten leagues long james barbots plan ad 1700 shows seven leagues by one in breadth disposed from northeast to southwest and in the latter direction fitting into the mar aparcelado or shoaly sea a curious hookshaped bight with a southern entrance the barra de curinba corimba but the influences which formed the island or rather islands for there are two have increased the growth reducing the harbour to three and a half miles by two in breadth and they are still contracting it even in the early nineteenth century large ships floated off the custom house and it is dry land where boats once rode dr livingstone first expedition chapter xx believes the causa causans to be the sand swept over the southern part of the island douville more justly concludes that it is the gift of the cuanza river whose mud and ooze silt and débris are swept north by the great atlantic current others suppose that it results from the meeting of the cuanza and the bengo streams but the latter outfall would be carried up coast the people add the washings of the morro and the sand and dust of the seashore south of the city  this excellent natural breakwater perfectly shelters the shipping from the calemas or perilous breakers on the seaward side and the surface is dotted with huts and groves gardens and palm orchards at the ponta do norte once stood a fort appropriately called na sa flór de rosa it has wholly disappeared but lately when digging near the sea heaps of building stone were found barbot here shows a tollhouse to collect the customs and at the southern extremity a starshaped fort fernand  this island was the earliest of portuguese conquests on this part of the coast the conquistador paulo dias de novaes a grandson of bartholomeo dias was sent a second time in ad 1575 to treat with the king of dongo who caused trouble to trade accompanied by 700 portuguese he reached the cuanza river coasted north and entered by the barra de corimba then accessible to caravels he landed without opposition amongst a population already christianized and after occupying for a few months the island which then belonged to congo he founded during the next year the villa de são paulo de loanda on the mainland  the importance of the island arose from its being the great money bank of the natives who here collected the zimbo buzio cowrie or cypræa moneta ample details concerning this industry are given by the old writers the shell was considered superior to the impure or braziles brought from the opposite bahia de todos os santos though much coarser than the small indian and not better than the large blue zanzibar m du chaillu second expedition chap iv owns to having been puzzled whence to derive the four sacred cowries they are unknown on the fernand vaz and i believe them to have come across the continent from eastern africa there are indeed few things which have travelled so far and have lasted so long as cowriesthey have been found even amongst anglosaxon remains  the modern muxiloandas hold aloof from the shorefolk who return the compliment in kind they dress comparatively well and they spend considerable sums in their halfheathen lembamentos marriages and mutambé funerals  as might be expected after three centuries of occupation the portuguese both in east and west africa have naturalized a multitude of native words supplying them with a lusitanian termination the practice is very useful to the traveller and the despair of the lexicographer during the matumbé the relations wake the toasted swaddled and aromatized corpse with a singular vigour of drink and general debauchery  i arrived with curiosity at the capital of angola the first portuguese colony visited by me in west africa the site is pleasing and picturesque contrasting favourably with all our english settlements and with the french gaboon for the first time after leaving teneriffe i saw something like a city the escarpment and the seabordering shelf allowing a double town like athenæ or thebæ a cidade alta and a cidade baixa are favourites with the lusitanians from lisbon to the china seas and african são paulo is reflected in the brazilian bahia so greece affected the acropolis and rome everywhere sought to build a capitol the two lines follow the shore from northeast to southwest and they form a graceful amphitheatre by bending westward at the jutting headland morro de são miguel of old de são paulo three hundred years of possession have built forts and batteries churches and chapels public buildings and large private houseswhite or yellow withample green verandahseach an ugly cube but massing well together the general decline of trade since 1825 and especially the loss of the lucrative slave export leave many large tenements unfinished or uninhabited while the aspect is as if a bombardment had lately  026 taken place africa shows herself in heaps of filthy hovels wattle and daub and dingy thatch in umbrellatrees ficus acacias and calabashes palms and cottontrees all wilted stunted and dusty as at cairo we are in the latitude of east african kilwa and of brazilian pernambuco but this is a leeland and the suffering is from drought yet curious to say the flora as will appear is here richer than in the well watered eastern regions  steaming onwards at one mile off shore we turned from south east to southwest and presently rounded the northeast point of loanda island where a moored boat and a lantern showed the way we passed the first fort são pedro do morro da cassandama which reminded me of the aguada at the mouth of goa harbour the two bastions and their batteries date from ad 1700 and have been useful in administering a strongish hintin ad 1826 they fired into captain owen the next work is the little fourgun work na sa da conceição we anchored in five fathoms about 1200 yards off shore in company with some fifteen craft large and small including a neat despatch cruizer built after the nimrod model fort são francisco called do penedo because founded upon and let into a rock with the doubletiered batteries à la vauban carefully whitewashed and subtended by any amount of dead ground commands the anchorage and the northern road where strings of carregadores like driverants fetch and carry provisions to town a narrow causeway connects with the gate where blacks on guard lounge in fantastic uniform and below the works are the coalsheds here the first turf was lately turned by an english commodorethis tramway was intended to connect with the water edge and eventually to reach the cuanza at calumbo so portugal began the rail system in west africa  the city was preparing for her ecclesiastical festival and i went ashore at once to see her at her best the landingplace is poor and mean and the dusty and sandy walk is garnished with a single row of that funereal shrub the milky euphorbia the first sensation came from the pillars of an unfinished house            care colonne che fate quà            non sappiamo in verità  the ponta de isabel showed the passeio or promenade with two brick ruins its five hundred fruittrees of various descriptions have gone the way of the camphor the teashrub and the incensetree said to have been introduced by the jesuits the five pleasant walks of which the central one has nine terraces with a pyramid at each extremity and leads to the casa de recreio or pleasurehouse of the governorgeneral erected in 1817 by governor viceadmiral luiz da motta feio have insensibly faded away the land is a waste poor grazing ground for cattle landed from the south coast whilst negrokins scream and splash in the adjoining sea  beyond the government gardens appears the old ermida chapel na sa da nazareth which english writers have dubbed after madeiran fashion the convent the frontage is mean as that of colonial ecclesiastical buildings in general and even the epauletted façades of old são paulo do not deserve a description here according to local tradition was buried the head of the intrepid and arrogant king of congo dom antonio whose 100000 warriors were defeated at ambuilla jan ist 1666 by captain luiz lopes de sequeira the good soldier who lost his life by a portuguese hand at the battle of matamba sept 4th 1681 a picture in dutch tiles azulejos was placed on the right side of the altar to commemorate the feat  after the ermida are more ruined houses and ragged plantations upon the narrow shelf between the seacliff and the sea they lead to the hot and unhealthy low town skirting the harbour a single street with small offsets a sandy strip spotted with cocoanuts represents the praia do bungo bungo beach perhaps corrupted from bunghi a praça or square it debouches upon the quitanda pequena a succursale marketplace where on working days cloth and beads dried peppers and watered rum are sold then come a single large building containing the trem or arsenal the cavalry barracks the central postoffice and the alfandega or customhouse which has a poor platform but no pier the stables lodge some halfadozen horses used by mounted orderliesthey thrive and to judge from their high spirits the climate suits them in captain owens time ad 1826 there was a respectable corps of cavalry  passing the acting cathedral for the see of angola and congo which deserves no notice you reach the quitanda grande where business is brisker there is a sufficiency of beef and mutton the latter being thintailed and not fivequartered fish is wisely preferred to meat by the white man affirming that it is much easier digested and a kind of herring and the sparus known upon the brazilian coast as the tainha the west african vela and the french mulet at times superabound all the tropical fruits flourish especially the orange the exotic vegetables are large and sightly but tasteless and insipid especially peas and radishes the indigenous as tomatoes are excellent but the list is small gardens are rare where the soil is so thin and the indispensable irrigation costs money the people still choke for want of water which must be bought there is only one good well sunk in the upper town about 1840 when the conde de bomfim was minister of marine and the coloniesit is a preserve for government officials living in the native style is cheap but cooks are hardly procurable and a decent table is more expensive than in an english country town a single store m schutz supplies europe articles of course at fancy prices and here a travelling outfit may be bought it has been remarked that loanda has no shop that sells food for the mind this is applicable not only to all east and west africa but to places far more progressive a kind of cafebillard supplies a lounge and tepid beer the attendants in portuguese houses are slaves the few english prefer cabindas a rude form of the rude kruboy and the lowest pay of the lowest labourer is 5d per diem  the calçada nova a fine old paved rampto speak gibraltar englishconnects basse ville and hauteville the latter was once a scatter of huge if not magnificent buildings now in ruins we shall pass through it en route to calumbo here are the remains of the three chief convents the jesuit the carmelite and the third order of st francis the citadel de são miguel lately blown up has been restored the extensive works of dressed freestone carefully whitewashed stand out conspicuously from the dark bush dotting the escarpment top here also is the alto das cruzes the great cemetery and the view from the sheer and farjutting headland is admirable a stroll over this cool and comparatively healthy escarpment ended by leaving a card at the paço do governo  lopes de lima vol iii part ii gives são paulo in 1846 a total of 5065 whites mulattoes and blacks distributed into 1176 hearths the census of 185051 raised the number to 12000 including 7000 negroes of whom 5000 were serviles in 1863 the figure was understood to have diminished rather than to have increased old authors divided the population into five orders the first was of ecclesiastics the second contained those who were settled for command or trade and the third were convicts especially new christians of jewish blood who were prevented from attending the sacred functions for a scandalous reason then ranked the pomberos or pombeiros mostly mulattoes free men and buyers of slaves their morals seem to have been abominable last and least were the natives that is the chattels amongst the latter the men changed wives for a time alleging in case of reproof that they are not able to eat always of the same dish and the women were rarely allowed by their mistresses to marrywith the usual results the missionaries are very severe upon the higher ranks of colonists father carli ad 1666 found the whites the most deceitful and the wickedest of menan effect caused by the penal settlement father merolla ad 1682 declares that the

decadence of angola and benguela to three reasons rare marriages amongst the higher orders poverty amongst the lower and the immorality and incontinence of both lopes de lima p 149 loc cit traces the decline and fall of christianity in the eighteenth century to the want of priests to the corruption of the regular clergy carmelites and franciscans for whom west africa like syria and palestine was made a kind of convict station and to the inhuman slaveexport as opposed to domestic slavery all has now changed for the better society in angola is not a whit inferior to that of any english colony in west africa and as a convict establishment loanda is a great success  the theoretical garrison is one regiment of the line a squadron of cavalry and two companies of artillery with threepounders the real force is of some 800 men mostly convicts no difference is made between white and black nor is the corps force which was once very cruelly used severely treated as the légion etrangère of algeria most of the men have been found guilty of capital crimes yet they are allowed to carry arms and they are intrusted with charge of the forts violence is almost unheard of amongst them if an english sailor be stabbed it is generally by the free mulattoes and blacks who hate the uniform for destroying their pet trade of manselling it is true that these convicts have hopes of pardon but i prefer to attribute their remarkable gentleness and good behaviour to the effects of the first fever which to quote from the latin grammar            emollit mores nec sinit esse feros  the negroes of loanda struck me as unusually illfavoured short stumpy and very dark or tinged with unclean yellow lepers and hideous cripples thrust their sores and stumps in the face of charity there was no local colouring compared with the carregadores or coolies from the northeast whose thrummop heads and single monkey skins for figleaves spoke of the wold and the wild the bodydress of both sexes is the tángá pagne or waistcloth unless the men can afford trousers and ragged shirts and the women a veo preto or dingy black sheet ungracefully worn like the graceful sárí of hindostan over the bright foulard which confines the wool it is mighty ridiculous to observe says the old missionary that the women contrary to the custom of all other nations buy and sell and do all things which the men ought to do whilst their husbands stay at home and spin or weave cotton or busy themselves in such other effeminate actions this is not wholly true in 63 the munenganaor machilaman is active in offering his light cane palanquin and he chaffs the mean white who is compelled to walk bitterly as did the sedanchairmen of bath before the days of beau nash of course the quitandeira or marketwoman holds her own the rest of the street population seems to consist of negro infantry and black portuguese pigs gaunt and long legged the favourite passetemps is to lie prone in sun or shade chattering and smoking the cachimbo a heavy clay pipe with peculiar stemto sleep supine say the arabs is the position of saints on the dexter side of kings on the sinister of learned men and on the belly of devils                                chapter iii      the festivala trip to calumboportuguese hospitality    my first step after reaching s paolo de loanda was to call upon mr commissioner vredenburg who had lately taken up the undesirable appointment and who moreover had brought a pretty french wife from pará i had warned him that he was risking her life and that of her child he bravely made the attempt and nearly lost them both i have reason to be grateful to him and to mr viceconsul e h hewett for hospitality during my stay at the angolan capital there is a place called an hotel but it is in the seven dials of the african city andnothing more need be said  fortunately for me as for herself loanda had got rid of mr vredenburgs predecessor who soon followed the lamented richard brand first british consul appointed in 1844 the real whole hearted englishman was after that modern type of which la grundy so highly approves an honest man who does not hold to the british idea that getting on in the world is natures first law would be sorely puzzled by such a career  the day after my arrival was the festival which gives to são paulo de loanda its ecclesiastical name da assumpção the ceremonies of the day were duly set forth in the boletim official do governo geral da provincia de angola a military salute and peals of bells aroused us at dawn followed a review of the troops white and black and a devout procession flags flying and bands playing paced through the chief streets to the cathedral a visit of ceremony in uniform to the governor general captain josé baptista de andrade a historic name in angola led to an invitation for the evening a pleasant soirée of both sexes the reception was cordial whatever be the grievances of statesmen and historians lawyers and slave mongers portuguese officers are always most friendly to their english brethren the large and airy rooms were hung with portraits of the several dignitaries and there was an old world look about government house like the paço at pangim goa fifty years ago colonial society was almost entirely masculine if you ever met a white woman it was in a wellcurtained manchila surrounded by mucambas or mucacamas negro waiting maids as the old missioner tells us when they go abroad which is seldom they are carried in a covered net with attendance of captives all this is changed except as regards leaving the house which is never done during the day constitutionals are not wanted in the tropics and the negroes everywhere make the streets unfit except for any but the very strongestminded of the weaker sex the evenings at government house are passed with music and dancing and petits jeux innocents for the juniors whilst the seniors talk and play voltarete till midnight i well remember one charming face but i fear to talk about itten years in africa cannot pass without the saddest changes  with an eye to future exploration i was anxious to see something of the style of travel in angola and to prospect the proposed line of railway intended to checkmate the bar of the river cuanza the cassange kasanjí war on the eastern frontier had just ended honourably to portuguese arms but it proved costly the rich traffic of the interior had fallen off and the well known feira was sending down its fairings to independent kinsembo moreover in order to raise funds for the rail the local government talked of granting the land to an english company for growing the highly prized gossypium arboreum  sr joão soares caldeira ce kindly asked me to join his party which started early on august 19 all rode the tipoia a mere maca or hammock sadly heating to the back but handier than the manchila the bearers wore loose waistbelts with a dozen small sheeps bells on the crupper intended to proclaim our importance and supposed to frighten away wild beasts these gentry often require the stimulus of ndokwe go on but seldom the sedative of malemba gently or quinga stop the boi cavallo the riding bull not ox of the interior which costs about £4 is never used in these fashionable localities i failed to remark the line of trenches supposed to defend the landside but i did remark the maiangas said to be indigo vats made by the jesuits after a hot depression we ascended a rough zigzag and halting we enjoyed a charming view of st paul the domed morro concealing the squalid lower town was crowned with once lordly buildingscathedral palace treasury and fort the colours of the groundswell were red and white with here and there a dot of green and the blue sea rose in its loveliness beyond the hill horizon for a whole league we were in the region of arimos or outside farms where villages villas and plantations threaded by hot and sandy lanes with hedges of green euphorbia showed the former prosperity of the country beyond it the land forms as in yoruba lines of crescents bulging west or seaward quartz and pebbles showing here and there an old true coast  after a five hours ride we reached cavúa the halfway house where breakfast had been sent on the habitations are wretched thatches crowded with pigs and mosquitoes clearings had all ended and the red land formed broken waves of poor soil almost nude of vegetation at this midwinter of the tropics except thickets of milk plant and forests of quadrangular cactus the latter are quaint as the dragontree some twenty feet tall and mostly sunscorched to touchwood the baobab adansonia is apparently of two kinds the imbundeiro hung with long stringed calabashes which forms swarmingplaces for bees and the aliconda nkondo whose gourd is almost sessile and whose bark supplies fibre for cloth and ropes the haskúl or bigaloe of somaliland was not absent and amongst other wild fruits i saw scattered over the ground the husks of a strychnine like the east african species deer hares and partridges are spoken of in these solitudes but they must be uncommonly hard to find at such a season  about three hours after leaving cavúa were spent upon this high dry and healthy desert when suddenly we sighted the long reaches of the cuanza river sharply contrasting like the nile with the tawny yellow grounds about its valley a steep descent over waterrolled pebbles showed the old bank the other side far and blue gave a goodly breadth of five miles then we plunged into the green selvage of the modern stream following muddy paths where the inundation had extended last june here tobacco orchilla and indigo in the higher and sugarcane rice and ricinus on the lower lands flourish to perfection the angolan orchilla was first sent to lisbon by sr f r batalha it is a moss like the tillandsia of the southern united states and i afterwards recognized it in the island of annobom passing pembe and other outlying hamlets after nine hours of burning sun we entered calumbo town and were hospitably lodged by the portuguese commandant we had followed the highway as a line for the intended railway had not yet been marked out and the distance measured 33393 metres  2075 english miles  calumbo is now a poor place with a few dilapidated stone houses in a mass of wattle and daub huts surrounded by large arimos the whole districto da barra do calumbo contains only 444 hearths a little stone pier which loanda wants projects into the stream the lime was formerly procured from shells but in 1761 calcareous stone was found near the dande stream the sightliest part is the vegetation glorious ceibas bombax used for dugouts baobabs tamarinds which supply cooling fruit and distilled waters limes and bitter oranges the most remarkable growth is the kaju or cashew nut an old traveller quaintly describes it as like st johns apple with a chestnut at the end of it m valdez six years of a travellers life vol ii 267 calls it a strange kind of fruit though it was very familiar to his cousins in the brazil of which it is an aborigine here it is not made into wine as at goa kajubrandy is unknown and the gum almost equal to that of the acacia is utterly neglected a dense and shady avenue of these trees ten paces apart leads from the river to the parish church of s josé mentioned by carli in 1666 an inscription informs us that it was rebuilt in 1850 but the patron is stored away in a lumberroom and the bats have taken the place of the priest portugal has perhaps gone too far in abolishing these church establishments but it is a reaction which will lead to the golden mean  the site of calumbo is well chosen commanding a fine view and raised above the damps of the cold cuanza whose stagnant lagoon the lagôa do muge on the other side is divided from the main branch by a low islet with palms and some cultivation at the base of church hill are huts of the mubiri or blacksmiths who gipsylike wander away when a tax is feared they are not despised but they are considered a separate caste i was shown a little north of the town a place where the dutch true to their national instincts began a canal to supply loanda with sweet and wholesome drinking material and water communication others place it with more probability near the confluence of the cuanza and the lucala the first great northern fork where massangano was built by the conquistadores this leat was left incomplete the terminus being three miles from st pauls the governorgeneral josé de oliveira barbosa attempted to restore it but was prevented by considerations of cost  calumbo must be a gruesome place to all except its natives whilst loanda has improved in climate since captain owens day 1826 this has become deadly as rome in 1873 the raw mists in early morning and the hot suns combined with the miasmas of the retreating waters sometimes produce a carneirado bilious remittent which carries off half the inhabitants dysenteries are everywhere dangerous between the guinea coast and mossamedes the cause being vile water all the people looked very sickly many wore milongos fetish medicines in red stripes and not a few had whitewashed faces in token of mourning i observed that my portuguese companions took quinine as a precaution formerly a few foreign merchants were settled here but they found the hot seasons fatal and no wonder with 130° f in the shade the trade from the upper river especially from the presidio das pedras negras de pungo andongofn2 consists of hides cattle tame and wild cefos saltpetre washed from earth in sieves mucocote or gum anime copal said by lopes de lima to be found in all the forests of pungo andongo wax white and yellow oil of the dendêm elaïs guineënsis and mandobim here called ginguba arachis mats maniocflour and sometimes an ivory  calumbo was built as early as 1577 by the conquistador porcador and first capitão mór paulo dias ii a gallant soldier who died in 1589 at massangano the presidium which he had founded between 158083 and who was buried in the church of na sa da vittoria he is said also to have built the church of santa cruz equidistant from loanda and the sea the settlement soon had a wealthy trade with the fortified stations of the interior and large government stores filled with merchandize in 1820 a number of schooners pinnaces and small crafts plied up and down to muchimo massangano cambembe and other inland settlements now we find out only a few canoes the cuanza at sleepers bay has one of the worst shifting bars on the whole coast at this distance five leagues from the mouth its width is one hundred fathoms and the depth varies from eight to nine it breeds good fish the manatus is common people talk of freshwater sharks and the jacare crocodile is fatal to many a pig even in the village it is navigable for schooners they say six days or 150 miles to the large presidio de cambembe where andrew battel 15891600 visited a perpendicular waterfall which made such a noise as to be heard thirty miles distance this and another waterfall higher up are laid down in the map of dr livingstones admirable first journey above cambembe the river bed is broken by archipelagoes and the shoals render it fit only for boats the cuanza head has been explored only lately although a royal order to that effect was issued on march 14 1800  after receiving and returning the visits of the principal whites all habited in frocks and continuations of the blackest and heaviest broadcloth we feasted with the excellent commandant who was hospitality itself the mosquitoes soon roused us from any attempt at sleep and we passed the night after a fashion which sometimes leads to red eyes and hot coppers in the morning i left early for my companions had business at calumbo as they were no longer present to control the bearers a race soft as putty and i was not used to manage them the gang became unbearable the soldier sent to keep them in order did his best with his supplejack and the consequence was that all bolted into the bush at cavúa two men were forcibly enlisted but i preferred walking in when at home in the red house mr hewetts the hammock men came complaining of my deserting them and begging bakhshish  it was another lesson to methe gaboon had lately administered onethat however well you may know the negro generally each tribe requires a specific study this however would not take long and with a little knowledge of the language there would be no difficulty in following the footsteps of joaquim rodrigues graça letters would be required to the several commandants the season of setting out should be in early cacimbo april and the up march would take six months with about four to return but unless active measures are adopted only the seaboard will remain to the portuguese this is an exploration which i had kept dark for myself but captain von homeyer has gained the day and nothing remains for me but to give the gallant officer god speed after a short but exceedingly pleasant visit i left the capital of angola with regret all seemed anxious to further my views of travel the authorities gave me the very best advice and offered me introductions to all the district commandants sr moses abecasis and sr francisco a flores sir henry huntleys host obliged me with recommendations to the most influential agents at porto da lenha on the congo river mr essex of st helena placed me in the hands of his compatriot mr scott and captain hoskins rn ended his kindness with ordering for me a passage on board hm steamship griffon an old acquaintance in the gaboon river briefly i quitted são paulo with the best wishes for one and all who had befriended me                                chapter iv      the cruise along shorethe granite pillar of kinsembo    on august 22nd we left loanda and attacked the 180 miles separating it from the congo mouth steaming along shore we enjoyed the vanishing perspective of the escarpment disappearing in the misty distance the rivers bengo dande and onze are denoted by densely wooded fissures breaking the natural seawall and as usual in west africa these lines are the favourite sites for settlements the onze or the lifune of mazula baywhich the hydrographic chart republished march 18 1869 changes into river mazulo and makes the mouth of the river onzois chosen by bowdich and writers of his day as the northern boundary of angola greatly to the disgust of the portuguese whose pretensions extend much farther north volumes of daily smoke and  048 nightly flame suggest the fires of st john lighted by the goatherds of tenerife they greatly excite the gallant griffons who everywhere see slaversignals and the system is old upon this coast as the days of hanno and herodotus at this season they are an infallible sign that the dries are ending the women burn the capim tall grass for future forage and to manure the land for manioc maize and beans the men seek present bushbeef as the flames blow inland they keep to seaward knowing that game will instinctively and infallibly break cover in that direction and they have learned the wrinkle of the prairie traveller to make a little zoar in case of accidental conflagration  at 2 pm on the 24th we were abreast of ambriz an important settlement where a tall red and white cliff with a background of broken blue hill showed a distinct barra or river mouth not to be confounded with the english bar the north point of the rio dos ambres of the green or raw copal is low and mangrovegrown throwing into high relief its sister formation ambriz head or strongtide corner which stands up gaunt and bluff  a little to the southeast lies the fort flying the argent and azure flag and garrisoned by some 200 men five large whitewashed houses and the usual bunch of brown huts compose the settlement this nest of slavers was temporarily occupied in may 15 1855 the governorgeneral senor coelho de amaral reinforced by 1000 soldiers from home and levying 2500 empacasseirosfn3 embarked from loanda in the dorn fernando frigate landed here once more burnt the barracoons and built the fort in 1856 a force was sent under colonel francisco salles ferreira to reopen a communication with the bembe mines of copper and malachite that energetic officer marched on são salvador the old capital of congo and crowned dom pedro v whose predecessor died the year before he there fell a victim to fever and his second in command major andrade was nearly cut off on his return shortly afterwards the natives blockaded but were driven from bembe and they attempted in vain to carry ambriz  the farfamed copper mines were granted to the portuguese in the sixteenth century by the king of congo they were the property of his feudatory the black marquess of pemba bembe barbot mentions their being mistaken for gold and feels himself bound to warn his readers that the metal was brought from sondy not from abyssinia or the empire of prester john they lost all their mystery about ad 1855 when they were undertaken by an english company messrs john taylor  co of london after agreement with the concessionists messrs francisco a flores and pinto perez of loanda between ambriz and bembe on the lunguila lufula river and 770 feet above sealevel the angolan government built four presidios matuta quidilla quileala and quimalenco but the garrison was not strong enough to keep the country quiet and the climate proved deadly to white men the 24 sappers and 60 linesmen extracted nearly 4000 lbs of gangue per diem when the english manager and his assistant with four of the ten miners died and the plant was destroyed by fire i was assured that this line ambrizbembe was an easy adit to the interior and so far the information is confirmed by the late livingstonecongo expedition under lieutenant grandy  in 1863 the coast was still in confusion the portuguese claimed too much seaboard according to the british the british government ignored the just claims of portugal and the political bickerings were duly embittered by a demoralized race of english traders who perpetually applied for cruisers complaining that the troops interfered with their trade even in the seventeenth century the portuguese had asserted their rights to the reino do congo extending between the great stream of that name and the ambriz also called the loge and doce river in the older maps for instance lopes de limathe loge is an independent stream placed north of the ambriz river in fact it represents the rue or lue river of kinsembo which is unknown to our charts within the doce and the cuanza lies the reino de angola of which they say the congo was a dependency and south of the cuanza begins the reino de benguela the governmentgeneral of loanda thus contained four provincescongo now reduced to ambriz angola benguela and mossamedes the english government has now agreed to recognize the left or southern bank of the ambriz as the northern frontier of angola and of portuguese rule  passing the river mouth we were alongside of independent lands and new to us boobies pelecanus sula gulls petrels and men ofwar birds p aquila flew about the ship according to the experts they were bound for fetid marshes which outlie the loge river before nightfall we were off the lue or rue river of kinsembo which disputes with landána not landanofn4 the palm of bad landing at this season boats are  052 sometimes kept waiting fourteen days and the barreiras cliffs are everywhere at unbounded war with the waters i determined to land and to inspect the remarkable lofty granite pillar which was dimly visible from our deck but we rowed in vain along the tall and rusty seawalls no whaler could attack the huge rollers that raised their monstrous backs plunged over with a furious roar and bespread the beach with a swirl of foam at last seeing a fine surfboat artistically raised at stern and bow and manned by cabindas the kruboys of the coast made fast to a ship belonging to messrs tobin of liverpool we boarded it and obtained a passage  the negroes showed their usual art paddling westward they rounded the high red and white south point where a projecting reef broke the rollers we waited for some twenty minutes for a lull at the auspicious moment every throat was strained by a screaming shout and the black backs bent doughtily to their work we were raised like infants in the nurses arms the good craft was flung forward with the seething mass and as she touched shore we sprang out whilst our conveyance was beached by a crowd of stragglers the dreaded bar is as usual double in the heaviest weather boats make for a solitary palmtree at the bottom of the sandy bay some of the dugouts are in pairs like the brazilian ajoujo the sides are lashed together or fastened by thwarts and both are made to bend a little too much inwards  it was dark when we climbed up the stiff jacobs ladder along the landward side of the white kinsembo bluff there are three ramps the outermost is fit only for unshod feet the central is better for those who can squeeze through the rocky crevices and the furthest is tolerably easy but it can be reached only by canoeing across the stream mr hunter of messrs tobins house received us in the usual factory of the south coast a ground floor of wickerwork windowless and thatched after native fashion the chief agent who shall be nameless was drunk arid disorderly it is astonishing that men of business can trust their money to such irresponsible beings he had come out to blackland a teetotaller and presently his condition became a living lecture upon geographical morality  the night gave us a fine study of the kinsembo mosquito a large brown dipter celebrated even upon this coast a barrel of water will act as nursery at times the plagues are said to extinguish a lantern and to lie an inch deep at the bottom i would back them against a mans life after two nights of full exposure the brazilian marimbondo is not worse at 7 am on the next day we descended the easiest of the ramps which are common upon this coast and were paddled over the kinsembo river eleven miles off it issues from masses of high ground and at this season it spreads out like the ambriz in broad stagnant sheets bordered with reeds and grass supplying fish and crabs wild ducks and mosquitoes presently when the cacimbo ends in stormy rains and horrid rollers its increased volume and impetus will burst the sandstrip which confines it and the washedaway material will recruit the terrible bar  leaving the ferry wre mounted the tipoias which englishmen call hammocks after the caribs of jamaica and i found a strange contrast between the men of kinsembo and of são paulo the former are admirable bearers like their brethren of ambrizette famed as the cream of the coast four of them carried us at the rate of at least six miles an hour apparently they cannot go slowly and they are untireable as black ants like the bahian cadeiramen they use shoulderpads and forked sticks to act as levers when shifting the bamboopole has ivory pegs to prevent the hammockclews slipping and the sensation is somewhat that of being tossed in a blanket  quitting the creeperbound sand we crossed a black and fetid mire and struck inland to a higher and drier level the vegetation was that of the calumbo road but not so utterly sunburnt there were dwarf fields of manioc and thur cajanus indicus and the large wild cotton shrubs showed balls of shortish fibre as we passed a euphorbiahedged settlement kizúlí yá mú seabeach village a troop of women and girls noisy as those of ugogo charged us at full gallop a few silver bits caused prodigious excitement in the liberal display of charms agitated by hard exercise the men were far less intrusive they are said not to be jealous of european rivals but madly so amongst themselves even on suspicion of injury the husband may kill his wife and her lover  at kilwanika the next hamlet there was a king and it would not have been decent to pass the palace unvisited outside the huts stood a bamboogirt compound which we visited whilst hm was making his toilette and where contrary to congo usage the women entered with us twentytwo boys aged nine or ten showed by faces whitened with ashes that they had undergone circumcision a ceremony which lasts three months we shall find these jinkimba in a far wilder state up the congo the rival house is the casa das tinta where nubile girls are decorated by the nganga or medicineman with a greasy crimsonpurple pigment and preparatory to entering the holy state of matrimony receive an exhaustive lecture upon its physical phases father merolla tells us that the congoese girls are locked up in pairs for two or three months out of the sight of man bathing several times a day and applying taculla the moistened dust of a red wood without this casket of water or of fire as they call it barrenness would be their lot after betrothal the bride was painted red by the manwitch for one month to declare her engagement and the mask was washed off before nuptials hence the paint house was a very abomination to the good fathers amongst the timni tribe near sierra leone the semo or initiation for girls begins with a great dance called colungee kolangí and the bride is instructed formally in such circumstances as most immediately concern women  after halting for half an hour ringed by a fence of blacks we were summoned to the presence where we found a small boy backed by a semicircle of elders and adorned with an old livery coat made for a fullgrown jeames with immense dignity and without deigning to look at us he extended a small black paw like a chimpanzees and received in return a promise of rumthe sole cause of our detention and as we departed through the euphorbia avenue we were followed by the fastest trotters the flora temples and the ethan allens of the village  beyond kilwanika the land became rougher and drier whilst the swamps between the groundwaves were deeper and stickier the higher ridges bearing natural stonehenges of african not english proportions at last we dismounted ascended a rise the most northerly of these aravat hills and stood at the base of the lumba the pillar of kmsembo is composed of two huge blocks not basaltic but of coarsegrained reddish granite the base measures twenty and the shaft forty feet high with a little trimming it might be converted into a superior pompeys pillar we shall see many of these monoliths in different parts of the congo country  the heat of the day was passed in the shade of the lumba enjoying the seabreeze and the novel view it was debated whether we should return viâ masera a wellknown slaving village whose barracoons were still standing but the bearers dissuaded us declaring that they might be seized as dash unless the white men paid heavy comey like those who shipped black cargoes they cannot shake off this old practice of claiming transit money so we returned without a halt covering some twelve of the roughest miles in two hours and a quarter  the morning of the 26th showed an ugly sight from the tall kinsembo cliff as far as the eye could reach long greenblack lines fronted and feathered with frosted foam hurried up to the war with loud merciless roars and dashed themselves in white destruction against the reefs and rockwalls we did not escape till the next day  kinsembo does not appear upon the old maps and our earliest hydrographic charts place it six miles wrongfn5 the station was created in 185761 by the mistaken policy of loanda which determined to increase the customs three per cent and talked of exacting duties at ambriz not according to invoice prices but upon the value which imported goods represented amongst the natives it was at once spread abroad that the object was to drive the wax and ivory trade to são paulo and to leave ambriz open to slavers the irrepressible briton transferred himself to kinsembo and agreed to pay the king £9 in kind after country fashion for every ship in 1857 the building of the new factories was opposed by the portuguese and was supported by english naval officers till the two governments came to an arrangement in february 1860 the kinsembo people seized an english factory and foully murdered a congo prince and portuguese subject d nicoláo de agua rosada employed in the treasury department ambriz thereupon the governorgeneral sent up two vessels with thirty guns and troops crossed the loge river now a casus belli and on march 3rd burned down the inland town of kinsembo on the return march the column debouched upon the foreign factories about one mile in front of the point captain brerit us navy and commander a g fitzroy rn had drawn up 120 of their men by way of guard leave was asked by the portuguese to refresh their troops and to house six or seven wounded men the foreign agents headed by a disreputable mm now dead protested and after receiving this unsoldierlike refusal the portuguese harassed by the enemy continued their return march to ambriz the natives of this country have an insane hate for their former conquerors and can hardly explain why probably the cruelties of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries not peculiar to the lusitanians have rankled in the national memory a stray portuguese would infallibly be put to death and it will i fear be long before m valdez sees spontaneous declarations of vassalage on the part of the king of molembo malemba and others  in 1860 the trade of kinsembo amounted to some £50000 divided amongst four houses two english one american and one rotterdam pencoff and kerdyk the cassange war greatly benefited the new station by diverting coffee and other produce of the interior from loanda there are apochryphal tales of giant tusks brought from a five months journey say 500 miles inland i was shown two species of copal gum anime of which the best is said to come from the mosul country up the ambriz river one bore the gooseskin of zanzibar and i was assured that it does not viscidize in the potashwash the other was smooth as if it had freshly fallen from the tree it was impossible to obtain any information no one had been up country to see the diggings and yet all declared that the interior was open that it would be easy to strike the coango quango before it joins the congo river and that 150 miles which we may perhaps reduce by a third would lodge the traveller in the unknown lands of hnga  bidding kindly adieu to mr hunter and wishing him speedy deliverance from his dreadful companion we resumed our travel over the now tranquil main always to starboard remained the narrow seawall a length without breadth which we had seen after the lowlands of cape lopez coloured rosy rustyred or white and sometimes backed by a second sierra of low blue rises which suggests the sanatorium forty miles showed us the tall trees of point palmas on the northern side of the conza river on the south of the gaplike mouth lies the ambrizette settlement with large factories portuguese and american gleaming against the dark verdure and with conza hill for a background the cabeça de cobra or margate head led to makula alias mangal or mangue grande lately a clump of trees and a point now the site of english american and dutch factories here the hydrographic charts of 1827 and 1863 greatly vary and one has countermarched the coastline some 75 miles beginning with the congo river it lays down mangue pegueno where grande should be cobra and mangue grande for pequeno close to ambrizette then hard ahead rose cape engano whose deceit is a rufous tint which causes many to mistake it

fourscore miles within the sea before his proud waves yield their full homage and receive that salt temper in token of subjection such is the haughty spirit of that stream overrunning the low countries as it passeth and swollen with conceit of daily conquests and daily supplies which in armies of showers are by the clouds sent to his succour runnes now in a furious rage thinking even to

the amazonas tinges the sea along the guiana coast 200 miles and the effect of the ganges extends to about twenty leagues at this season of course we saw none of the floating islands which during the rains sail out sixty to seventy leagues from land tuckeys expedition informs us that the hon captain irby hms amelia when anchored twelve miles from the south point in fifteen fathoms observed on the ocean large floating islands covered with trees and bushes which had been torn from the banks by the violent current the journal of captain scobell hms thais remarks in crossing this stream i met several floating islands or broken masses from the banks of that noble river we shall find them higher up the bed only forming as the inundation begins i doubt however that at any time they equal the meadows which stud the mouth of the rio formoso benin river  historic point padrao the mouta seca or dry bush of the modern portuguese showed no signs of hospitality the fierce rollers of the spumous sea broke and recoiled foaming upon the sandy beach which they veiled with a haze of waterdust almost concealing the smoke that curled from the mangrovehedged king antonios town then steaming to the northeast we ran five miles to turtle cove formerly turtle corner a shallow bay whose nearest point is twitty twa bush the baptismal effort of some english trader and now appeared the full gape of the congo mouth yawning seven seamiles wide the further shore trending to the northwest in a low blue line where moanda and vista small shippingports for slaves were hardly visible in the hazy air as we passed the projecting tooth of shark point a sandspit garnished with mangroves and dotted with palmyras the landsquali flocked from their dirtybrown thatches to the beach where flew the symbolic red flag unlike most other settlements which are so buried in almost impenetrable bush that the traveller may pass by within a few yards without other sign but the human voice this den of thieves and wreckers justly named in more ways than one flaunts itself in the face of day  the congo disclaims a bore but it has a very distinct bar the angle pointing up stream and the legs beginning about bananal bank n and alligator river s here the great depth above and below 145 and 112 fathoms shallows to 69 despite the fiveknot current we were courteously received into the embraces of the river hm steamship griffon wanted no commanding seabreeze she found none of the difficulties which kept poor tuckeys brute of a transport drifting and driving for nearly a week before he could anchor off fuma or sherwoods creek the medusa of modern charts  and which made shark point with its threemile current a more redoubtable promontory than that of good hope was to early navigators we stood boldly ene towards the high blue clump known as bulambemba and with the dirty yellow breakers of mwáná mazia bank far to port we turned north to french point and anchored in a safe bottom of seven fathoms  here we at once saw the origin of the popular opinion that the congo has no delta on both sides the old river valley 32 miles broad is marked out by grassy hills rolling about 200 feet high trending from ene to wsw and forming on the right bank an acute angle with the ghats but whilst the northern line approaches within five or six miles the southern bank which diverges about the place where king plonlys town appears in charts sweeps away some seventeen miles down coast and leaves a wide tract of mangrove swamps these according to the portuguese traders who have their own plans of the river extend some seventy miles south to ambrizette slavers keep all such details very close and doubtless for good reasonsshortcuts greatly facilitate shipping negroes the lesser congo delta is bounded north by the banana or malela stream whose lower fork is pirates creek and south by the mangroveclad drains which subtend the main line the base measures 1215 miles at the highest station boma i shall have something to say about the greater delta the left bank of the embouchure projects further seaward making it look under hung representing in charts a lower jaw and the projection of shark point the teeth en profile  my first care was to collect news at the factories french point is a long low spit which supports two establishments where the chart september 1859 gives emigration depot it is the old banana point and probably the older palmeirinha point of james barbot who places it in the territory of goy ngoy now cabinda this part has greatly changed since 1859 either the banana river requires removing two miles to the north or french point must be placed an equal distance south the principal establishment m régis of marseilles is built in his best style a twostoried and brilliantly chunamd house containing a shop and store on the groundfloor defended by a three pounder behind it a square compound with high walls guards the offices and the other requisites of a bar racoon it is fronted by a little village where laptots senegal moslems and menatarms live with their families and slaves in the rear stands the far more modest and conscientious establishment of messrs pencoff and kerdyk their plank bungalow is full of work whilst the other lies idle so virtue here is not as in books its own reward  m victor parrot the young swiss agent of m régis hospitably asked us to take up our quarters with him and promised to start us up stream without delay his employer fixes the tariff of every article and no discretion is left to the subordinates we called upon m elkman of the dutch factory his is a wellknown name on the river and though familiar with the people he has more than once run some personal risk by assisting our cruizers to make captures he advised us to lose no time in setting out before the impending rains i wanted however a slight preparation for travel and determined to see something of the adjoining villages especially the site of the historic padrão  whilst crossing the stream we easily understood how the river was supposed to be in a perpetual state of inundation the great breadth and the shallows near either jaw prevent the rainfloods being perceptible unless instruments are used and hydrometry still in an imperfect state was little to be depended upon in the days when european ideas concerning the congo river were formed twenty miles up stream the highwater mark becomes strongly marked and further on as will be seen it shows even better  if barbots map have any claim to correctness the southern shore has changed greatly since ad 1700 a straight line from cape padrão to chapel point now shark point was more than double the breadth of the embouchure it is vain to seek for the island of calabes mentioned by andrew battel who was sent to a place called zaire on the river congo to trade for elephants teeth wheat and palm oil it may be a mistake for cavallos noticed in the next chapter but the town on it must have been small and has left they say no traces after a scramble through the surf we were received at shark point where at this season the current is nearer five than three knots by mr tom peter mafuka or chief trader amongst these musurungus he bore his highly respectable name upon the frontal band of his berretta alias corôa an openworked affair very like the oldfashioned jellybag night cap this headgear of office made of pineapple fibre tuckey says grasscosts ten shillings it is worn by the kinglets who now distribute it to all the lieges whose fortunes exceed some fifty dollars  most of the squaline villagers appeared to be women the men being engaged in making money elsewhere besides illicit trade which has now become very dangerous a little is done in the licit line grotesquely carved sticks calabashes rudely ornamented with ships and human figures the neat beadwork grassstrings used by the women to depress the bosom and cashimbos or pipes mostly made about boma all were rebaptized in 1853 but they show no sign of christianity save crosses and they are the only prostitutes on the river  following tom peter and followed by a noisy tail we walked to the west end of shark point to see if aught remained of the padrão the first memorial column planted in 1485 by the explorer diogo cam knight of the kings household dom joão ii o principe perfeito who says de barros asia decad i lib iii chap 3 to immortalize the memory of his captains directed them to plant these pillars in all remarkable places the padrões which before the reign of d joão were only wooden crosses assumed the shape of columns twice the height of a man estado with the scutcheon bearing the royal arms at the sides they were to be inscribed in latin and portuguese to which james barbot adds arabic with the name of the monarch who sent the expedition the date of discovery and the captain who made it on the summit was to be raised a stone cross cramped in with lead according to others the inscription mentioned only the date the king and the captain the padrão of the congo was especially called from the lord of guineas favourite saint de são jorgesit faustum as carli shows the patron of congo and angola was santiago who was seen bodily assisting at a battle in which dom affonso son of giovi emmanuel first christian king of congo prevailed against a mighty host of idolaters headed by his pagan brother panso aquitimo in 1786 sir home popham found a marble cross on a rock near angra dos ilheos or pequena south latitude 26° 37 with the arms of portugal almost effaced till lately the jasper pillar at cabo negro bore the national arms doubtless much latitude was allowed in the make and material of these padrões that which i saw near cananea in the brazil is of saccharine marble four palms high by two broad it bears a scutcheon charged with a cross and surmounted by another  there is some doubt concerning the date of this mission de barros i iii 3 says ad 1484 lopes de limn iv i 5 gives the reason why ad 1485 is generally adopted and he believes that the cruise of the previous year did not lead to the congo river the explorer proceeding to inspect the coast south of cape st catherine south latitude 2° 30 which he had discovered in 1473 set out from são jorge da mina now elmina he was accompanied by martin von behaim of nürnberg nat circ ad 1436 ob ad 1506 a pupil of the mathematician john müller regiomontanus and for whom the discovery of the new world has been claimed  after doubling his last years terminus diogo cam chanced upon a vast embouchure and surprised by the beauty of the scenery and the volume of the stream he erected his stone padrão the first of its kind finding the people unintelligible to the interpreters he sent four of his men with a present of hawks bells cascaveis and blue glass beads to the nearest king and as they did not soon return he sailed back to portugal with an equal number of natives as hostages promising to return after fifteen moons one of them caçuta zacuten of barbot proved to be a fidalgo of sonho and though the procedure was contrary to orders it found favour with the perfect prince from these men the portuguese learned that the land belonged to a great monarch named the mwanicongo or lord of congo and thus they gave the river a name unknown to the riverine peoples  diogo cam on his second visit sent presents to the ruler with the hostages who had learned as much portuguese and christianity as the time allowed recovered his own men and passed on to angola benguela and cabo negro adding to his discoveries 200 leagues of coast when homeward bound he met the mwanisonho and visited the mwanicongo who lived at ambasse congo são salvador distant 50 leagues  the ruler of the great and wonderful river zaire touched by his words sent with him sundry youths and the fidalgo caçuta who was baptized into dom joao to receive instruction and to offer a present of ivory and of palm cloth which was remarkably strong and bright a request for a supply of mechanics and missionaries brought out the first mission of dominicans they sailed in december 1490 under gonçalo de sousa they were followed by others and in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the country was fairly over run by the propaganda a future page will enter into more details and show the results of their labours  the original padrão was destroyed by the dutch in 1645 an act of barbarism which is justly called vandalica façanha father merolla says 1682 the hollanders out of envy broke the fine marble cross to pieces nevertheless so much remained of it when i was there as to discover plainly the portuguese arms on the ruins of the basis with an inscription under them in gothic characters though not easy to be read in 1859 a new one was placed in turtle cove a few yards southwest of shark point but the record was swept away by an unusually high tide and no further attempt has been made  we were then led down a sandy narrow line in the bush striking southeast and after a few yards we stood before two pieces of marble in a sandy hollow the tropical climate more adverse than that of london had bleached and marked them till they looked like pitted chalk the larger stump about two feet high was bandaged as if after amputation with cloths of many colours and the other fragment lay at its feet tom peter in a fearful linguafranca negroangloportuguese told us that his people still venerated the place as part of a religious building it is probably the remnant thus alluded to by lopes de lima iii 16 behind this point padrão is another monument of the piety of our monarchs and of the holy objects which guided them to the conquest of guinea a capuchin convent intended to convert the negroes of sonho it has long been deserted and is still so even in ad 1814 d garcia v the king of congo complained in a letter to our sovereign of the want of missionaries possibly the ruined convent is the church which we shall presently visit striking eastward we soon came to a pool in the bush sufficiently curious and out of place to make the natives hold it fetish they declare that it is full of fish but it kills all men who enter itall men would not include white men possibly it is an old piscina according to the abbé proyart the missionaries taught the art of pisciculture near the village of kilonga where they formed their first establishment the place is marked saltpond in barbot who tells us that the condiment was made there and carried inland  a short walk to a tall tree backing the village showed us amongst twentyfive european graves five tombs or cenotaphs of english naval officers amongst whom two fell victims to mangroveoysters and the rest to the deadly calenture of the lower congo we entered the foul mass of huts                      domus non ullo robore fulta           sed sterili junco cannâque intecta palustri  it was too early for the daily debauch of palm wine and the interiors reeked with the odours of nocturnal palm oil the older travellers were certainly not blasés they seemed to find pleasure and beauty wherever they looked ca da mosto 1455 visiting the senegal detected in this graveolent substance fit only for wheelaxles a threefold property that of smelling like violets of tasting like oil of olives and tinging victuals like saffron with a colour still finer even mungo park preferred the rancid tallowlike shea butter to the best product of the cow we chatted with the shark point wreckers and found that they thought like arthegal            for equal right in equal things doth stand  moreover here as in the shetlands of the early nineteenth century when the keel touches bottom the seaman loses his rights and she belongs to the shore  tom peter offered to show us other relics of the past if we would give him two days a little party was soon made up mr j c bigley the master and mr richards the excellent gunner of the griffon were my companions we set out in a southbyeasterly direction to the bottom of sonho or diogos bay which barbot calls bay of pampus rock thence we entered alligator river a broad lagoon the raphael creek of maxwells map not named in the hydrographic chart of 1859 leading south with many a bend it is black water and thick fetid mud garnished with scrubby mangrove where kruboys come to cut fuel and catch fever here the dew seemed to fall in cold drops after nine miles we reached a shallow fork one tine of which according to our informants comes from the congo grande or são salvador distant a weeks march leaving the whaler in charge of a kruman we landed and walked about half a mile over loose sand bound by pineapple root to the banza sonho or as we call it king antonios town not to be mistaken for that placed in the charts behind point padron our object being unknown there was fearful excitement in the thatched huts scattered under the palm grove till tom peter introduced us and cleared for us a decent hut the buildings if they can be so called are poor and ragged copies of those which we shall see upon the uplands presently we were visited by the king named after that saint of whom the evil one was parlous afraid this descendant of the counts of sonho in his dirty nightcap and long coat of stained red cloth was a curious contrast to the former splendour of the counts habit with cap of stitched silk which could be worn only by him and his nobles fine linen shirt flowered silk cloak and yellow stockings of the same material when king affonso iii gave audience to the missioners ad 1646 the negro grandee had on a vest of cloth set with precious stones and in his hat a crown of diamonds besides other stones of great value he sat on a chair under a canopy of rich crimson velvet with gilt nails after the manner of europe and under his feet was a great carpet with two stools of the same colour and silk laced with gold after the usual palaver we gave the black earl a cloth and bottle of rum for leave to pass on but no one would accompany us that evening all pretending that they wanted time to fit up the hammocks at night a body of armed bushmen marched down to inspect us  the demands for porterage were so exorbitant next morning that we set out on foot under the guidance of tom peter we passed southwards over large tracts of bush and gramineous plants with patches of small plantations manioc and thur and settlements girt by calabashtrees cocoas palmyra and oil palms the people poured out threatened impotent vengeance on those who brought the white men to make their country that is to seize and settle in it the only animals were fowls and pigs small strong cages acting as hogstyes showed that leopards were dangerous in 1816 lieutenant hawkey found signs of these animals together with elephant wild boar and antelope now there is no sport below the cataracts and possibly very little except in the water above them thence we debouched upon rolling land loose and sandy waves sometimes divided by swamps it is the lower end of the high yellow band seen from the south of the river the true coast of alluvial soil scattered here and there with quartz and pebbles then the bush opened out and showed to the north east stretches of grassy land where the wild figtree drooped its branches laden with thick fleshy leafage to the ground these are the black dots which are seen from afar studding the tawny desertlike surface flowers were abundant despite the lateness of the season and the sterility of the soil was evidenced by cactus and euphorbia  after a walk of six miles tom peter pompously announced that we had reached the church we saw only an oblong furrow and a little wormeaten wood near three or four of the most miserable magalia but a bell hung to a dwarf gallows was dated 1700 and inscribed si deus cum nobis qis sic contra nos the aspect of this article did not fail to excite mr richards concupiscence i looked into the empty huts and in the largest found a lot of old church gear the virgin our lady of pinda saints and crucifixes a tanklike affair of iron that acted as font and tattered bundles of old musicscores in black and red ink in captain tuckeys day some of the sonho men could read the latin litany there was a priest ordained by the capuchins of loanda a barefooted and barefaced black apostle with a wife and five handmaids and a multitude of converts loaded with crucifixes and satchels of relics our home march was enlivened by glimpses of the magnificent river seen through the perennial tropical foliage and it did not suggest trite reflections upon the meanness of mans highest aspirations in presence of eternal nature  we had been treading upon no vulgar spot we are now in the earldom of sonho bounded north by the congo river and south by the ambriz westward by the atlantic and eastward by the duchy of bamba it was one of the great divisions of the congo kingdom and absolute except only its being tributary to the lord paramount the titles of portugal were adopted by the congoese according to father cavazzi after ad 1571 when the king constituted himself a vassal of the portuguese crown here was the pinda whose port and fort played an important part in local history built by the sonhese army at the mouth of the river zaire it commanded both the stream and sea it was plundered in 1600 by four french pirates according to carli 166667 the count of sonho the fifth dignitary of the empire resided in the town of sonho a league from the river zaire pinda was for a time the headquarters of the portuguese mission subject only to that of são salvador it consisted of an apartment two stories high which caused trouble being contrary to country custom  at the french factory i found the employés well up in the travels of the unfortunate adventurer douville voyage au congo et dans lintérieur de lafrique equinoxiale fait dans les années 1828 1829 et 1830 par j b douville secrétaire de la société de géographic de paris pour lannée 1832 etmembre de plusieurs sociétés savantes françoises et étrangères ouvrage auquel la société de géographic a décerné le prix dans sa séance du 30 mars 1832 3 tomes 8vo paris 1832 dr gardner in his brazilian travels gives an account of douvilles murder the consequence of receiving too high fees for medical attendance on the banks of the são francisco so life like are his descriptions of the country and its scenery that no one in the factory would believe him to have been an impostor and the frenchmen evidently held my objections to be founded on nationality the besetting sins of the three volumes are inordinate vanity and inconséquence but these should not obscure our vision as to their solid and remarkable merits compare the picturesque account of são paulo with those of the latest english travellers and the anthropology of the people their religion their ceremonies their magic their dress and costume their trade their manufactures their maladies including eartheating their cannibalism the condition of their women and the necessity of civilizing them by education before converting them all subjects of the highest interest with that of mungo park for instance arid we have a fair measure of the french travellers value the native words inserted into the text are for the most part given with unusual correctness and the carping criticism which would correct them sadly requires correction itself thus the word which he writes mouloundu in his text and mulundu in his vocabulary is not singular as he supposes but the plural of loondu a mountain p 200 of the review firstly douville has warned the reader that the former is the spelling best adapted to french the latter to portuguese secondly mulundu in angolan is singular the plural being milundua handful the persians say is a specimen of the heap the excess of female births in low and unhealthy places 1 309 and as the normal result of polygamy 3 243 is a highly interesting subject still awaiting investigation i do not mean that douville was the first to observe this phenomenon which forced itself upon the notice of physiologists in ancient times foster cooks third voyage remarks that wherever men and animals have many females the feminine births preponderate over the masculine a fact there explained by the organic molecule of buffon pigafetta the circumnavigator gives the king of tidor eighteen daughters to eight sons  the french traveller does not pretend to be a mineralogist but he does his best to lay open the metallic riches of the country he gives careful observations of temperature in water as well as air he divines the different proportions of oxygen in the atmosphere and he even applies himself to investigating the comparative heat of the negros blood an inquiry still far from being exhausted the most remarkable part is certainly the medical and here the author was simply in advance of his age instead of the lancet the drastic cathartics and the calomel with which our naval surgeons slew their patients he employed emetics and tonics to an extent that would have charmed my late friend dr dickson the chromothermalist and he preceded dr hutchinson in the use of quinine wine indeed the peculiar aptitude for medicine shown in these pages led to the travellers adopting the destructive art of healing as a profession and caused his unhappy end the curious mixture of utter imposture and of genius for observation which a traveller can detect in douville renders him worthy of a monograph

has the advantage over ours of employing these men  086 who are clean intelligent and brave whilst we are reduced to the unprogressive kruman who is moreover a model coward a poltroon on principle  at 5 pm our huge canvas drove us rapidly over the shoals and shallows of this imperfectly known sea the ethiopic directory justly grumbles it is a subject of regret that navigators who have had occasion to enter the congo and to remain there some time have not furnished us with more information about the tides this will be a work of labour and endurance detached observations are of very little use we at once remarked the complication caused by the upper surface or freshwater current of 3 to 4 knots an hour meeting the under or oceanic inflow there is a short cut up pirates creek but we avoided it for the usual reason fear of finding it very long passing a low point to port subtended north and south by the bananal river and pirates creek after some six knots we were abreast of bulambemba the boulem beembo of tuckeys vocabulary it is interpreted answer hence our echo point but others render it hold your tongue the former is correct and the thick high screen of trees explains the native and english names old writers call it fathomless point which it is not now a bank the southeastern projection of the great mwáná mázia shoal has formed a few feet below the surface but the term will apply at the distance of a mile further south this acute angle shows a glorious clump the tall trees white mangroves rising a hundred feet and red mangroves based upon pyramidal cages of roots and beyond it the immediate shore is covered with a dense tropical vegetation a tangle of bush palms and pandanus matted with creepers and undergrowth and rhyzophoras of many varieties delighting in brackish water we passed on the right the ponta de jacaré point of the crocodile fronting point senegal on the other side the natives call the former ngándu li jigándu and farcical tales are told about it in the lower settlements europeans will not go abroad by night without a lantern during my trip i sighted only one startled crocodile that floated loglike a mile off and captain baak of the dutch house had not seen one during a whole year at banana point  we anchored for the night off the south side of the zungá chyá ngombe in portuguese ilha do boi bullock the rhinoceros island of our early charts it emerges from the waters of the right bank a mere ponton plumed with dark mangroves and streaked with sparlike white trunks this is probably the island of horses where the portuguese flying from the victorious hollanders were lodged and fed by the courteous count of sonho perhaps it is battels isle calabes the place is backed by the monpanga or mombang the lookout islands of the chart which has greatly changed since the beginning of the century the dark mass of mangroves is now apparently part of the northern shore almost due south of the ilha do boi is the zungá chyá kampenzi whence our word chimpanzee in the hydrographic chart it is miswritten zoonga campendi and in tuckeys map which contradicts his text zoonga casaquoisa his zoonga kampenzey also named halcyon island appears to be the drapers island or the monkey island of mr maxwell the latter in modern charts is more to the northeast that is above porto da lenha than the former the simiads have been killed out captain tuckey going up the river saw upwards of twenty which but for their tails might have been mistaken for negroes merolla says that wild men and women gorillas have been captured in sonho and he carefully distinguishes them from baboons one of them was presented to a friar of his order who bestowed it on the portuguese governor of loanda chimpanzee island may be the zariacacongo of father merolla who makes cacongo great congo a large and independent kingdom lying in the middle between congo and loango he describes zariacacongo none of the smallest and situate in the midst of the river zaire it abounded in all sorts of provisions was well peopled consisted of a plain raised eight fathoms above water and was divided from the kingdom of congo by a river over which there was a bridge  after a pleasant breezy night upon the brown waters on september 1st we hove anchor betimes and made for scotchmans head a conspicuous mangrove bluff forming a fine landmark on the left bank the charts have lately shifted it some two miles west of its old position six or seven miles beyond it rise the blue uplands of the earldom of sonho on our right in midstream lay a crocodile bank a newly fixed grass islet a few square feet of green and gold which the floods will presently cover or carry away to the left above the easternmost mombang and the network of islands behind it opens the gape of the malela river a short cut to french point found useful when a dangerous tide rip is caused by the strong seabreeze meeting the violent current of the thalweg above it lies a curious formation like concentric rings of trees inclosing grass it is visible only from the northeast several slave factories now appear on either shore singlestoried huts of wood and thatch in holes cut out of the densest bush an impenetrable forest whose sloppy soil and miry puddles seem never to dry the tenements serve as videttes and outposts enabling cargoes to ship without the difficulties of passing palm point and thus to make a straight run down stream there are three on the north bank viz m rágis aîné now deserted sr lima viana and sr antonio fernandez and three on the left side sr alessandro ferreira sr guilherme and sr fonseca those on the southern or left bank facilitate overland transit to mangue ambrizette and other dépôts at present it is tiempo seco dull time and the gérants keep their hands in by buying groundnuts and palm oil the slave trade however makes 500 not 50 per cent and the agents are naturally fond of it their mere salaries being only some 150 francs a month  landing at the factory of sr fernandez we were received by his agent sr silva in a little bungalow of bamboo and matting paved with tamped earth and old white ostreoid shells a kind of mya relished by the natives but not eaten by europeans to these doubtless mr w winwood reacle refers savage africa chap xxxvii the traders say that in congo there are great heaps of oystershells but no oysters these shells the negroes also burn for lime i did not hear of any of these ostreiras which if they exist must reflect the sambaquis of the opposite brazilian shore the house was guarded by three wooden figures clouterly carved and powdered with ochre or red wood two of them representing warriors in studded coatings of spike nails with a lookingglass fixed in the stomach raised their hands as if to stab each other these figures are sometimes found large as life according to the agents the spikes are driven in before the wars begin and every one promises the hopedfor death of an enemy behind them the house was guarded by a sentinel with drawn sword the unfortunate tenant who looked a martyr to ague sat in palaver with a petty island king and at times the tap of a wardrum roused my experienced ear the monarch habited in a shabby cloth coat occupied a settee with a minister on either side he was a fat senior of light complexion with a vicious expression upon features which were not those of the tobacconist nigger nor had he the effeminate aspect of the congoese  i looked curiously at these specimens of the musulungu or musurungu a wilder race than that of shark point the english of course call them missolonghi because lord byron died there here the people say le for re and rua for lua confounding both liquids which may also be found in the kibundo tongue in loango according to the abbé

stunning concert of songs and instruments kept up during the day to prevent his escaping by night the more sensible traders at boma pay them black mail by employing them as boats crews upon our angloindian principle of the paggi and the ramosi  merolla calls these men musilongo or sonhese the word appears to me opprobrious as if each tribe termed itself mushicongo congo people and its neighbours musulungus barbot writes as a frenchman moutsie the portuguese muxi mushi mushilongo would perhaps mean loangopeople but my ear could not detect any approach to loango in musulungu the first syllable mu in fiote or congoese would be a contraction of muntu plural wántú they inhabit the islands own a part of the north bank and extend southwards to ambriz eastward they are bounded by the fiote or congospeaking peoples to whom their tongue is intelligible they have no tattoo but they pierce the nose septum and extract the two central and upper incisors the muxi congoes or lower

to change sometimes the upper at other times the lower teeth are operated upon the fashionable mutilation is frequently seen in eastern africa and perhaps it is nothing but a fashion they are the kallistoi and megistoi of the congoese bodies taller and darker fiercer and braver than their neighbours nor will they cease to be river pirates till the illicit trade dies  after taking leave of sr silva we resumed our way the thermometer f showing at 145 pm 95° in the air when the sun was obscured and the mirage played the usual fantastic tricks the mangrove which tuckeys introduction prolongs to fifty miles from the mouth now disappears in fact it does not extend much above bullock island nineteen direct miles on the chart from shark point and as usual it enables us to measure the extreme limit where the salttide ascends the palhabote went gallantly                 the water round her bows           dancing as round a drinking cup  small trembling waves poppled and frothed in midstream where the fresh water met wind and tide and by the boiling of the surface we saw that there was still a strong undercurrent flowing against the upper layer a little beyond the factory we were shown on the northern bank mariquita nook where the slaver of that name commanded by a captain bowen had shipped some 520 men she was captured by hm steamship zebra commander hoskins after being reported by a chief whom her captain had kicked to a trader at the river mouth and by him to the cruizer slavers used to show their sense by starting on sundays when the squadron kept a careless lookout but their inevitable danger was the general drunk of the officers and crew to celebrate the event and this libation often caused delays which led to seizure it was an admirable site a bit of golden sand fronting the cleared bush commanding an unbroken sweep of vision to the embouchure and masked by forest from porto da lenha it is easily known by its two tall trees and that nearest the sea when viewed from the east appears surmounted by what resemble the kangaroos head they are cones of regular shape covered to the topmost twig with the lightest green flagellaria the bush now becomes beautiful rolling in bulging masses of verdure to the very edge of the clear brown stream as in the rivers of guinea the llianas form fibrous chains varying in size from a packthread to a cable now straight then twisted investing the trees with an endless variety of folds and embraces and connecting neighbours by graceful arches like the sag of an acrobats rope here and there a grotesque calabash contrasted with the graceful palms towering in air for warmth and light or bending over water like prince of waless feathers the unvarying green was enlivened by yewlike trees with scarlet flowers the burning bush of sierra leone setting off the white boles of the cottontrees and the whole was edged by the yellow green of the quaint pandanus hung with heavy fruit  a little beyond mariquita nook the right bank becomes a net work of creeks obscure channels tortuous slimy with mud banked with the snakelike branches of trees and much resembling the lower course of the benin or any other north equatorial african river the forest is also full of large villages invisible like the streams till entered a single tree apparently growing out of the great streambed showed shallow water as we passed the ponte de tres palmeiras the three oil palms are still there but the easternmost is decaying at 2 pm we were in sight of the chief slaving settlement on the congo the whydah of the

and dropped down stream as soon as loaded from french point it is distant 40000 measured metres  21 statute miles and 1615 yards our charts show 2050 nautical miles  32500 metres in round numbers the river opposite the projection narrows to a gate barely a mile and a half broad whilst the valley stretches some five miles and the blue hills inhabited by the musulungus are clearly visible the flood rises four or five feet and drinking water must be brought from up stream the site of the settlement is on the right or northern bank behind the projection a slip of morass backed by swamps and thick growths chiefly bombax palm and acacia lignum vitae the mammeeapple and the corktree palmyra pandanus and groves of papyrus low and deeply flooded during the rains the place would be fatal without the seabreeze as it is the air is exceedingly unwholesome there is no quay the canoe must act gondola the wharf is a mere platform with steps and in places the filthy drains are not dry even at this season the length of the station is about one mile and of no depth except what is taken up by the neat and expensive gardens eastward or up stream it thins out and the foundations give considerable trouble the inhabitants are condemned to do beavers work to protect the bank with strong piles and to heap up earth for a base whilst despite all their toil the water often finds its way in the sixteen houses look well they are substantial bungalows built country fashion with timber and matting they have large and shady verandahs and a series of inner rooms each house has a well kept pottage plot inferior however to those up stream  the tenure of ground here as at borna is by yearly rent to the two kings nengongo and nenzalo each of whom claims a half like the chiefs of porto novo the despot of dahome the rulers of many nigerian tribes and even the fernandian bube these potentates may not look at the sea nor at the river their power is therefore deputed to linguisters or

only a hundred reis  fourpence and thoroughly demoralizes the black world  we landed at once sent our letters to m monteiro who hospitably offered his house and passed the day quickly enough in a round of visits despite the general politeness and attention to us we found a gloom overhanging the place as at whydah its glories have departed nor shall they ever return the jollity the recklessness the gold ounces thrown in handfuls upon the montetable are things of the past several houses are said to be insolvent and the dearth of cloth is causing actual misery palm and groundnut oil enable the

both as far from sober as might be the cooper who was sitting moony with drink rose to receive us and to weigh out the beads which i required under the excitement he had recourse to a ginbottle and a total collapse came on before half the work was done why should south latitude 6° the parallel of zanzibar be so fatal to the briton  at 220 pm on september 2 we left porto da lenha and passed mashels creek on whose right bank is the village of makatalla the charts call it foomou and transfer it to the left here we enter upon the riverine archipelago the great stream before one now divides into three parallel branches separated by long narrow islands and islets banks and shallows the northernmost channel in our maps maxwell river is known to europeans and natives as noangwa mamballa or the central line is called by the moderns nshibúl and the southern is dubbed by the hydrographer rio konio a truly terrible mistake for sonho as a rule the noangwa though infested during the rains by cruel mosquitoes is preferred for the ascent and the central for dropping down stream the maximum breadth of the congo bed more than half island is here five miles and i was forcibly reminded of it when winding through the dalmatian archipelago  the river still maintained its alluvial aspect as we passed along the right bank the surface was a stubble strewn with the usual trees the portly bombax the calabash now naked and of wintry aspect and the dark evergreen palmyra in dots and streaks upon the redyellow field fronted by an edging of grass whose king cyperus papyrus is crowned with tall heads waving like little palms this egyptian bush extends from the congo mouth to banza nokki our landingplace it grows thickest about porto da lenha and it thins out above and below i afterwards observed it in the sweet water marshes of syria and the brazils we passed sundry settlementsloango pequeno loango grande and othersand many canoes were seen plying up and down on the left or to the south was nothing but dense reedy vegetation upon the low islands which here are of larger dimensions than the northern line as evening drew near the grasshoppers and the tree frogs chirped a louder song and the parrots whistled as they winged their rapid flight high overhead presently we passed out of the lower archipelago and sighted the first high land closing upon the stream rolling hills which vanished in blue perspective and which bore streaks of fire during the dark hours our cabinda patron grounded us twice and even the high night breeze hardly enabled us to overcome the sixknot current off the narrow whose right side is called ponta da diabo devils point is not so named in the chart the place is marked strong tide no 1 opposite chombae island which the natives term zungá chyá bundika hence probably the name of the village bemandika boma ndika at this satanic headland where the banks form a gate three miles broad a man hailed us from the bank none understood him but all made up their minds that he threatened to visit us during the night  a light breeze early next morning fortunately freshened as we approached strong tide no 2 we ran north of the second archipelago above the gate south of us lay the low islands of the chart with plantations of beans and tobacco the peasants stood to stare like icelanders leaning on oblongbladed paddles six feet long or upon alpenstocks capped with bayonets the scarecrows were grass figures with pots for heads and wooden rattles suspended to bent poles on the right bank a block of hills narrows the stream and its selvage of light green grasses will contribute to the floating islands higher up blocks and boulders of all sizes rise from the vegetation and prolong themselves into the shallower waters there are two distinct bluffs the westernmost marked by a treeclump at its feet and between them lies a baylet where a dozen palms denote the once dreaded village bemandika the second block 400 to 500 feet high

lieutenant hawkeys tracing of the rude figures which distinguish a not unusual feature tuckey p 97 calls fingals shield taddy dya mwangoo and professor smith taddi moenga p 303 the only defect in lieutenant hawkeys sketch is that of exaggerating the bluff a mere mamelon one of many lumps upon a continued level both rocks are of the oldest granite much weatherworn and mixed and banded with mica

beyond this point where boma is first sighted lies the large marauding village of twáná here also a man shouted to us from the bank muliele muliele for the portuguese mulher one of the interminable corruptions of the tonguea polite offer as politely declined the next feature is the rio jo jacaré a narrow sedgy stream on the right bank which winding northward through rolling lines of hills bends westward and joins they say the rio lukullu lukallo of cabinda bay men have descended i am told three leagues but no one has seen the junction consequently there may be a portage between the drains if not this is the apex of the greater congo delta a false formation whose base between cabinda bay s lat 5° 25 and ambrizette s lat 7° 16 measures 1° 51 equal to 111 direct geographical miles whilst its depth inland would be sixty                                chapter vii                 bomaour outfit for the interior    we now reach boma the furthest portuguese factory about thirty usually reckoned thirtyeight nautical miles from porta da lenha and a total of 5250 from french point  the upper dépôt of the congo lies upon the north bank accidenté ground poor stony and sandy soil with rounded grassclad hills the southern is less broken there are long slopes and waves of land which trend in graceful lines charmingly diversified to the uplands where the old capital são salvador is situated and upon the undulating blue ridges distance behind distance appear markings by natures hand which the strangers eye can hardly distinguish from villa or village the view explains how the old expedition felt every day more in love with this beautiful country the sealike river wants nothing but cattle on its banks to justify the description             appunto una scena pastorale a cui

direction on the congo course the foul weather is mostly from the sirocco where the african interior is a mass of swamps at the mouth tornadoes come down the line of stream from the northeast and i heard traditions of the seatornado which blows in shore instead of offshore as usual about the close of the last century one or other of these islands was proposed as a dépôt and settlement which a few simple works would convert into a small gibraltar the easternmost buka the booka embomma of the charts and maps will presently be described in this direction the zaire assumes the semblance of a mountain lake whilst down stream the broad bosom of the nshibúl branch forms almost a seahorizon with dots showing where tall scattered palms spring from the watery surface we cannot but admire the nightly effects of the wintry bushfires during the day livid volumed smoke forms cumuli that conceal their enemy the sun and discharge a rain of blacks ten times the size of londoners in the darkened air we see storms of fire fiercely whirling over the undulating ranges here sweeping on like torrents there delaying whilst the sheets meet at the apex and a giant beard of flame greek                   flouts the moon the land must be splendidly grassed after the rains  the boma factories are like those of porto da lenha but humbler in size and more resembling the wickerwork native houses the river which up stream will show a flood mark of twelve feet here seldom rises above five and further down three and four consequently piles are not required and the swiftness of the current keeps off the jacaré formerly there were fourteen establishments which licit trade in palm oil and groundnuts instead of men women and children have reduced to ten the air is sensibly drier and healthier than at the lower settlement and apparently there is nothing against the place but deadly ennui and monotony  we landed at once and presented our letters to sr antonio vicente pereira who at once made us at home he had seen goa as well as macáo so we found several subjects in common the factory enjoyed every comfort the poultry yard throve far better than at porto da lenha we saw fowls and pigeons manilla ducks and ducklings and a fine peacock from portugal which seemed to enjoy the change the fish is not so good as that caught further down and the natives have a habit of narcotizing it the silurus electricus is exceptionally plentiful the farmyard contained tame deer and a housedog fierce as a tethered mastiff goats were brought whenever wanted and the blackfaced thintailed sheep gave excellent mutton beef was impossible the portuguese like the natives care little for milk and of the herd which strangers had attempted to domesticate remained only a bull and a cow in very poor conditionthe deaths were attributed to poisonous grass but i vehemently suspect tsetse a daily quitanda or market held under the huge calabashes on a hill behind the house supplied what was wanted  upon market hill executions also take place the criminal being shot through the heart m pereiras garden produces all that porta da lenha can grow with less trouble and of a superior kind watermelons

six weeks to two months september and october the staple of commerce is now the nguba or groundnut plural jinguba which merolla calls incumba with sometimes a little milho maize and calavance beans of fruits we find trellised grapes pines and guavas which as at fernando po are a weed the agrumi limes oranges and citrons are remarkably fine and hold as of old a high place in the simple medicines of the country a cup of limeleaf tea drunk warm in the morning is the favourite emetic and cathartic even in plinys day we find malus assyria quam alii vocant medicam mediam venenis medetur xii 7 on the gold coast and in the gaboon region colic and dysentery are cured by a calabash full of lime juice laced with red pepper the peculiarity of european vegetables throughout maritime congo and angola is the absence of all flavour combined with the finest appearance it seems as though something in the earth or atmosphere were wanting to their full development similarly though in the upper regions the

chisalla    boma at the head of the congo delta the great dépôt between the interior and the coast owes its existence wholly to                      the cruel trade            which spoils unhappy afric of her sons  father merolla 1682 who visited it from angoij our cabinda speaks of it as a pretty large island tributary to the manicongo extremely populous well supplied with provisions and outlaid by islets belonging to the count of sonho tuckeys embomma was an inland banza or town and the site of the factories was called market point the expedition map and the hydrographic chart term it loombee the latter being properly the name of a large quitanda market lying two miles to the northwest early in the present century it is described as a village of a hundred huts opposite which trading vessels anchored under charge of the fuka or kings merchant no market was held there lest in case of dispute the royal person might suffer although the main features of our maps are still correct there have been great changes in the riverbed between porto da lenha and boma especially about the latter place which should be transferred from its present site to lumbi the broad chisalla creek which mr maxwell calls logan between the northern bank and the island booka embomma is now an arm only 200 feet wide in fact all the bank about boma like the lower delta urgently calls for resurveying  this part of the river belongs to the rei dos reis nessalla under whom are some ten chief officers called kings who buy and sell indeed africa knows no other the title is prostituted throughout the west coast but it is nowhere so degraded as in the congo regions the whites abuse it to flatter the vanity of the astute negro who accepts it with a view to resultsa king dash must of course be greater than that of a subject every fellow with one black coat becomes a preese prince and if he has two he styles himself a king without permission of the king of kings we could obtain neither interpreter canoe nor crew a visit to banza chisalal was therefore necessary and as it would have been vain to ask anything emptyhanded i took with me a fine spangled cloak a piece of chintz and a case of ships rum the whole worth £9  at 630 am on september 5th we set out up stream in a fine canoe wallsided and rather crank but allowing the comfort of chairs she was of mayumba make superior to anything built on the river and the six men that drove her stood up to pole and paddle above boma the hills which are the outlines of the west african ghats form a graceful semicircle separated from the water by a flat terrace garnished with little villages and tree islets on the north bank are many of the craterlike sinks which dot the coast from the gaboon to loango we hugged the right side to avoid the rapid swirl there was no backwater at the points and hard work was required to prevent our being swept against the boulders of gneiss schiste and puddingstone edging the shores and stretching into the stream here the fish is excellent as at porto cla lenha and we found the people catching it in large spoonshaped basins i enquired about the peixe mulher woman fish the french sirène which old missioners describe as an african mermaid not exactly as she appeared to the lovely lord of colonsay and which barbot figures with two strutting breasts he makes the flesh taste like pork and tells us that the small bones of the hand were good for gravel whilst bracelets made of the left rib were worn near the heart to stop bleeding this manatus like the elephant and the hippopotamus has long disappeared before the gun  after some three quarters of an hour we reached the entrance of chisalla creek which is the northernmost branch of the main stream on the left north was a plain showing traces of a large village and we sighted our first grassislanda compact mass of fibrous earthwashed roots and reedy vegetation inhabited by serpents and ardeine birds to the right or southward rises the tall island of boma rocky and wooded which a narrow channel separates from its eastern neighbour chisalla islet the latter is the royal pere la chaise the graves being kept carefully concealed white men who have visited the ground to shoot antelope have had reason to regret the step here also lie three officers of the congo expedition messrs galwey tudor and cranchforgotten as gamboa and reitz at mombasah  the banks of the winding creek were beautified with the malaguetta pepper the ipomsea the hibiscus and a yellow flower growing upon an aquatic plant like a magnified watercress animal life became somewhat less rare we saw sandpipers hawks white and black fisheagles and longlegged waterhens here supposed to give excellent sport an embryo rapid formed by a gneissband connecting the north bank with the islet delayed us and the rocks on the right showed potholes dug by the poling staves during the rains canoes from boma avoid this place and seek fuel down stream after a total of two hours and a quarter we reached banza chisalla it is a small country in african parlance a succursal of boma proper the banza on the hills beyond the reedy grassy plain the site is charminga flat palmorchard backed by an amphitheatre of highrolling ground and the majestic stream approaches it through a gate whose right staple is the tall chisalla and whose left is a rocky islet with outlying needles  we ascended the riverbank greeted by the usual accidents of an african reception the men shouted the women rushed screaming under cover and the children stood howling at the horrible sight a few paces placed us at the palace a heap of huts surrounded by an old reedfence the audienceroom was a trifle larger than usual with low shady eaves a halfflying roof and a pair of doorways for the dangerous but indispensable draught a veteran sofa and a few rickety chairs composed the furniture and the throne was known by its boarded seat which would have been useful in taking a lampbath  presently entered the rei dos reis nessalla the old man whose appearance argued prosperity was en grande tenue the state costume of tuckeys not of merollas day the crown was the usual berretta nightcap of open work the sceptre a drummajors staff the robes a parochial beadles coat of scarlet cloth edged with tinsel gold lace his neck was adorned with hair circlets of elephants tails strung with coral and beads the effect to compare black with white was that of beau brummells farfamed waterfall tie and the head seemed supported as if on a narrowrimmed charger the only other ornament was a broad silver ring welded round the ankle and drawing attention to a foot which all things considered was small and well shaped  some of the chiefs had copper rings of home manufacture with neatly cut raised figures the king held in his right hand an article which at first puzzled usa foots length of split reed with the bulbous root attached he may not like his vassals point with the finger and without pointing an african can hardly give an order moreover the sangálávú or malaguetta pepper amomum granum paradisi fresh or old is not only a toothstick but a fetish of superior power when carried on journeys professor smith writes sangala woo and tells us that it was always kept fresh in the house to be rolled in the hands when invoking the fetish during wartime moreover it was chewed to be spat at the enemy possibly he confuses it with the use as a toothstick the article which asia and africa prefer to the unclean hogs bristle brush of europe  on the left of the throne sat the nchinu or second king attired in a footmans livery of olivecoloured cloth whiteworn at the seams and gleaming with plated buttons upon which was the exowners cresta cubit arm  the stranger in africa marvels why men who as dahome shows can affect a tasteful simplicity will make themselves such guys when looking at these caricatures he is tempted to read literally learned montesquieu it is hardly to be believed that god who is a wise being should place a soul especially a good soul in such a black ugly body and to consider the few exceptions as mere sporting plants but the negro combines with inordinate love of finery the true savage tastean imitative natureand where he cannot copy the asiatic he must ape the european only in the former pursuit he rises above in the latter he sinks below his own proper standard similarly as a convert he is ennobled by el islam in rare cases which may be counted upon the fingers he is civilized by christianity but as a rule the latter benefits him so far only as it abolishes the barbarous and murderous rites of paganism  but there is also a sound mundane reason which causes the african king to pose in these castoff borrowed plumes contrast with his threequarter nude subjects gives him a name the name commands respect respect increases dash and dash means dollars for his brain dense and dead enough to resist education is ever alive and alert to his own interest whilst the concentration of its small powers prevails against those who in all other points are notably his superiors the whole of negro africa teaches this lesson the ethiopians says father merolla are not so dull and stupid as is commonly imagined but rather more subtle and cunning than ordinary and he adds an instance of farsighted treachery which would not have been despicable even in a hindoo  a desultory palaver came up the soul of the meeting not being present m pissot explained my wish to take walk and make book carefully insisting upon the fact that i came to spend not to gain money the grizzled seniors face before crumpled like a wet cloak ill laid up expanded at these last words and with a grunt which plainly meant by m by he rose and retired to drink a call of nature which the decencies of barbarous dignity require to be answered in private he returned accompanied by his nephew manbuku prata pronounced pelata the silver chief officer as we might say golden ball the title is vulgarly written mambuco the abbé proyart prefers manboukou or prince who is below the makaia in dignity the native name of this third personage was gidifuku it was a gorgeous dignitary from the poll of his nightcap protruded a dozen bristles of elephants tail hair to which a terminal coral gave the graceful curve of a pintados crest and along his ears like the flaps of a travelling casquette hung two dingy little mirrors of talc from cacongo set in clumsy frames of ruddled wood masses of coral encircled his neck and the fulldress naval uniform of a french officer with epaulettes of stupendous size exposed a zebrad guernsey of equivocal purity a long black staff studded with broadheaded brass beads served to clear the room of the lieges who returned as fast as they were turned outthe baton was evidently not intended to be used seriously  but the manbuku prata is not a mere punch in a puppet show his face expresses more intelligence and resolution than usual and his portuguese is not the vile article of the common trader he means business when other chiefs send their sons that is their slaves to fight he leads them in personvenite non ite the french emigration libre put 30000 dollars into his pocket and he still hopes against hope to ship many a cargo for the banana factory he has some 300 armed serviles at chinímí and lámbá two villages perched like condors nests upon hills commanding the rivers northern bank and despite the present dearth of business he still owns some 100000 francs in cloth and beads rum and gunpowder  as the silver minister took his seat upon the ground before the king all removed their caps with a simultaneous grunt and performed the sákilá or battapalmas this handclapping must be repeated whenever the simplest action is begun or ended by king or chief monteiro and gamitto pp 101 et seg refer to the practice everywhere on the line of country which they visited there it seems to be even a more ceremonious affair than in the congo the claps were successively less till they were hardly audible after a pause five or six were given and the last two or three were in hurried time the while without pronouncing a word the palaver now opened steadily with a drink a bottle of trade fizz was produced for the white man and rum for his black congeners then the compliment of healths went all round after this we fell to work at business by dint of abundant wrangling and with an immense display of suspicion natural under the circumstances it was arranged that the king should forward me in a couple of his own canoes to banza nokki the end of river navigation as we were told and falsely told in my turn i was to pay goods valued about £6 at least three times the usual tariff they consisted of fourteen red caps as many sashes and fiftytwo fathoms of cloth for the crew ten peças de lei or chiloes for each interpreter and two pieces for the canoes i should have given four fathoms for each man and the same for each boat the final scene was most gratifying to the african mind i solemnly invested old nessala with the grand cloak which covered his other finery grinning in the ecstasy of vanity he allowed his subjects to turn him round and round as one would a lay figure yet with profound respect and lastly he retired to charm his wives  this part of the negotiations ended with presenting some satin stripe and rum to the nchinu and manbuku prata and with shaking handsa dangerous operation the people are cleanly they wash when rising and before as well as after every meal they are always bathing yet from prince to pauper from baby to grey beard they are affected with a psora known by its portuguese name sarnas the congo fiddle appears first between the articulations of the fingers and bleaches the hands and wrists as if it were leprosy yet i did not see a single case of true lepra arabum or its modifications the huge barbadoes leg elephantiasis and the sarcoma scrotale and sarcocele of zanzibar and east africa from the extremities the gale extends over the body especially the shins and the people who appear in the perpetual practice of scalpturigo attribute it to the immoderate use of palm wine i observed however that europeans in the river who avoid the liquor are hardly ever free from this foul bloodpoison and a jar of sulphur mixture is a common article upon the table hydrocele is not unfrequent but hardly so general as in the eastern island one manner of white man a half caste from macáo was suffering with serpigo and boasted of it  all predicted to me a similar fate from the botch of congo but happily i escaped indeed throughout the west african coast travellers risk crawcraw a foul form of the disease seen on board the african steamers krumen touching the rails of the companion ladders have communicated it to passengers and these to their wives and families  the town was neat and clean as the people the houses were built upon raised platforms and in the little fenced fields the cajanus indicus vetch was conspicuous in hindostani it is called thur or dollplant by the eastern arab turiyan in kisawahili mbarazi in angola voando merollas ouuanda and in the brazil guandufn9 the people had lost their fear and brought their exomphalous little children who resembled salmon fry in the matter of umbilical vesicles to be patted by the white man a process which caused violent screams and in some cases nearly induced convulsions the mothers seemed to enjoy the horror displayed by their hopefuls there is little beauty amongst the women and settled europeans prefer cabinda girls the latter have perhaps the most wiry and wiglike hair on the whole west african coast where all hair is more or less wiry and wig like cloth was less abundant in the village than a smear of red the bosom even after marriage was unveiled and the rule of fashion was shown by binding it tightly down the rich wore armlets and leglets of staircase rods brass and copper like the metal gaiters and gauntlets of the gaboon river the only remarkable object was the quesango a wooden effigy of a man placed in the middle of the settlement battel mentions it amongst the gagas or guides and barbot terms it likoku mokisi three faint hurrahs a feeble african echo of england like the hoch of vienna and the discharge of a four pounder were our parting honours  we returned viâ the gateway between the two islets on the south eastern flank of chisalla is a dwarf precipice called mbondo la zumba and according to the interpreters it is the lovers leap of tuckey but its office must not be confounded with that attributed to the sinisterlooking scaur of leucadia here the erring wives of the kings of boma and their paramours found a bosphorus the commander of the first congo expedition applies the name to a hanging rock on the northern shore about eighteen miles higher up stream a portentous current soon swept us past père la chaise and shortly after noon we were comfortably at breakfast with sr pereira  during the last night we had been kept awake by the drumming and fifing singing and shouting weeping and howling pulling at accordions and striking the monotonous shingungo merolla names this cymbal longa and describes it justly as two iron bells joined by an arched bar i found it upon the tanganyika lake and suffered severely from its monotonous horrors monteiro and gamitto p 232 give an illustration of what is known in the cazembes country as gomati the mchua or gonggong of ashanti has a wooden handle connecting the cones our palhabote had brought up the chief mashels bier and today we have the satisfaction of seeing it landed a kind of palanquin covered with crimson cloth and tinsel gold like a bombay tabút it had three horns or prominences two capped with empty black bottles and the central bearing the deceaseds helmet it was a fancy article which might have fitted him of gath with a terrific plume and the spoils of three horses in the sanguine hues of war although eight feet long by five broad the coffin was said to be quite full the immense respect which the congoese bear to their rulers dead as well as alive prevented my verifying the accounts of the slave dealers i knew that the chief who had died at kinsembo had been dried on a bamboo scaffolding over a slow fire and lay in state for some weeks in flannel stockings and a bale of baize but these regions abound in local variations of custom some declared as we find in proyart that the corpse had been mummified by the rude process of smoking others that it had been exposed for some days to the open air the relatives sitting round to keep off the flies till preliminarily bandaged according to barbot iii 23 the people of fetu on the gold coast and the men of benin used to toast the corpse on a wooden gridiron and the vei tribe like the congoese still fumigate their dead bodies till they become like dried hams this rude form of the egyptian rite is known to east as well as to west africa kimera late king of uganda was placed upon a board covering the mouth of a huge earthern pot heated from below  instances are known of bodies in the congo region remaining a year or two above ground till the requisite quantity of fine stuffs has been procuredthe larger the roll the greater the dignity and sometimes the hut must be pulled down before it can be removed here as on the gold coast we find the jewish practice recorded by josephus of converting the tomb into a treasury in the case of mashel some £600 in gold and silver besides cloth beads and ornaments shared they say his fate the missionaries vainly fought against these customs which are evidently of sentimental origin            now bring the last sad gifts with these                the last lament be said            let all that pleased and still may please                be buried with the dead  the bier was borne by slaves as the head men would not even look at it at times the carriers circled round as if to deprecate the idea that they were hurrying it to its bourne the grave was a pit fifteen to twenty feet deep cut like a well covered with stones to keep out wild beasts and planted round with the cylindrical euphorbia by way of immortelles  i could not find out if the congoese still practise the vivi sepulture so common on the western coastthe infernal sacrifices of mans flesh to the memory of relatives and ancestors as the old missioners energetically expressed themselves according to battel the giaghi corpse was seated as if alive in a vault in this infernal and noisome dungeon were placed two wives with their arms broken and thus there was no danger of the zumbi or ghost killing men by reapparition when the king of old calabar died a huge hole was dug with an off chamber for two sofas one of which supported the dressed and ornamented corpse personal attendants such as the umbrella sword and snuffbox bearers holding the insignia of their offices together with sundry virgins were either slaughtered or thrown in alive a rude in pace quantities of food and trade goods especially coppers were heaped up after which the pit was filled and the ground was levelled the less wealthy sort of gentlemen here are placed in smaller graves near the villages and the slaves are still buried with the burial of an ass cast forth into the bush  yet by way of showing themselves kind to the dead the congoese are commonly very cruel to the living lately a chief called from his wealth chico de ouro golden frank died somewhat suddenly the nganga or medicine man who on such occasions here as elsewhere has the jus vitæ et necis was called in he charged one of the sons with parricide by witchcraft and the youth was at once pierced by the bayonets of his brothers golden frank was peculiar in his ways he used to entertain the factors at dinner imitating them from soup to cheese his only objections were to tea and to drinking toasts out of anything but the pet skull of an enemy it was afterwards placed upon his grave  boma is no longer the emporium of the congo empire if it ever did deserve that title like porto da lenha it is kept up by the hopes of seeing better days which are not doomed to dawn even at the time of my visit some 400 to 500 negroes were under guard in a deserted factory and whilst we were visiting nessalla they were marched down to bathe when i returned from the cataracts the barracoon contained only fifty or sixty the rest having been shunted off to some unguarded point at a days notice a thousand and within a week 3000 head could be procured from the adjoining settlements where the chattels are kept at work as in tuckeys day those exported are either captives in war or condemned criminals during the free emigration as much as 80 have been paid per man a large sum for congoes whilst a cargo of 500 minas guinea negroes loses at most 20 per cent these less hardy gangs seldom escape without at least double the deaths by dysentery or some other epidemic now they are freely offered for 10 to 20 but there are no buyers the highest bid of which i heard was 100 for a househelp  the slavetraders in the congo look upon their employment as did the contrabandist in the golden days of smuggling the free sailor whom marryatt depicts a lawbreaker yet not less a very pleasant companionable fellow the unhappy differences between the late british commissioner for loanda and the judge of the mixed court sr josé julio rodriguez who followed his enemy to the grave on april 12 1863 rendered são paulo anything but a pleasant place to an english resident but the rancour had not extended to the congo and so far from showing chagrin the agents declared that without the coffin squadron negroes would have been a mere drug in the market the only déplaisir is that which i had already found in a gaboon factory the excessive prevalence of petty pilfering the moleques or houseboys steal like magpies even what is utterly useless to them these young clerks of st nicholas will scream and writhe and confess and beg pardon under the lash and repeat the offence within the hour as they are born serviles we cannot explain the habit by homers            jove fixed it certain that whatever day            makes man a slave takes half his worth away  one of our watches was found in the pocket of a noble interpreter who unabashed declared that he placed it there for fear of its being injured and the traders are constantly compelled to call in the fetishman for the protection of their stores against the prigging chiefs yet in tuckeys time there was only one thief at boma a boy who stole a knife confessed and restored it during a months residence amongst the pagans of the interior where the houses swarmed with serviles and where my outfit which was never locked up must have represented a platechest in england not the smallest article was found missing nor could anything be touched except by collusion with the head man                                chapter ix                    up the congo to banza nokki  for a wonder the canoes came in time and despite their mat sails we could not complain of them there were twelve paddlers two for the stem and two for the stern of each craft under a couple of interpreters jotakwassi and nchamachamvu who were habited in european frockcoats of broadcloth and in native terminations mostly buff our excellent host bade us a kindly adieu with many auguries of successduring the last night the frogs had made a noise in the house briefly we set out on september 6th  in the fortyfive miles between boma where we enter the true trough of the congo and the landingplace of banza nokki below the cataracts there are halfadozen reaches the shortest of three the longest of fifteen miles they are not straight as upon the chart the windings of the bed exclude direct vision and the succession of points and bays suggest like parts of the rhine a series of mountaintarns the banks show the highwater level in a low shelf a ribbon of green backed by high rolling hills rounded and stony with grass dry at this season the formation is primitive and the material of the lower bed has been held to prove the probability that the mountains of pernambuco rio de janeiro and other adjacent parts of south america were primevally connected with the opposite chains that traverse the plains of congo and loango in parts the rocks fall bluff into the river and here the current rushes past like a millrace without a shadow of backwater the heights are intersected by gullies and ravines of which i counted sixtynine on the right and fiftyfour on the left bank many of them are well wooded and others are fronted by plains of the reeds and flags which manufacture floating islands cast loose like those of the niger about the end of july by the malka rains about a dozen contained running water captain tuckey did not see one that would turn a mill in august and september but in november and december all these fiumaras will discharge torrents  the breadth of the entroughed bed varies from 700 yards to two miles where it most dispreads itself the current increases from the normal three to five knots in rare places the surface loses the glassiness of the lower section and at once shows the boiling and swirling which will be noticed near the cataracts the shores are often foul but the midway is mostly clear and where sunken rocks are they are shown by whirlpools the flow of the tide or rather the damming up of the lower waters between porto da lenha and the mouth causes a daily rise which we found to measure about a foot thus it assists in forming a treble current the rapid downflow in the thalweg being subtended by a strong backwater on either side carrying a considerable portion in a retrograde direction and showing a sensible reflux this will continue as far as the rapids in the amazonas the tides are felt a hundred leagues from the mouth and whilst the stream moves seawards the level of the water rises proving an evident undercurrent mr bates has detected the influence of oceanic tides at a point on the tapajos 530 miles distant from its mouth such is the amazing flatness of the countrys profile here we find the reverse  the riverine trough acts as windconductor to a strong and even violent seabreeze on the lower section it begins as a ground currentif the bull be alloweda thin horizontal stratum near the water it gradually curves and slides upwards as it meets the mountain flanks forming an inverted arch and extending some 2000 to 3000 feet above the summits at this season it is a late riser often appearing about 3 pm and sometimes its strength is not exhausted before midnight the brown water grasssheeted at the sides conceals the bright yellow sand of the bed when placed in a tumbler it looks clear and colourless and the taste is perfectly sweetbrackishness does not extend far above porto da lenha yet at boma the residents prefer a spring near the factories and attribute dysentery to the use of riverwater according to mr george maxwell the supply of the lower bed has the quality of rotting cables and the same peculiarity was attributed to the tanganyika  of late years no ship has ventured above boma and boats have ascended with some difficulty owing to the buffing stream yet there is no reason why the waters should not be navigated as proposed in 1816 by small steamers of good power and the strong seabreeze would greatly facilitate the passage in older and more enterprising days merchantschooners were run high up the zaire the master of a vessel stated to tuckey that he had been several voyages up to the distance of 140 miles from the mouth without finding any difficulty  our course passed by banza chisalla where as we had paid double there was a vain attempt to make us pay treble travelling up the southeastern reach we passed a triangular insulated rock off the southern bank and then the diabolitos outlying point kilu opposite banza vinda on the other side a second reach winding to the northeast showed on the right makula annan river and a little further mungamungwa woodhouslee between them is the terminus of the são salvador road on the northern bank where the hills now become rounded mountains 1500 feet above the stream perches chinimi the village of manbuku prata who expects canoes here to await his orders and who was sorely offended because i passed down without landing the next feature of the chart matádi memcandi is a rocky point not an island turning a projection point makula clough corner we entered no 3 elbow bending southeast on its concave northern side appeared the settlement vinda la nzádi this is the vinda le zally of tuckey on the chart veinde len zally and according to others vinda de nzadi or village of the zaire river it is probably the benda of the introduction p xxxiv and as b and v sound alike in fiote cabinda cabenda or kabendah is evidently cavindagreat village  our terminus that day was the usual restingplace of travellers mfumba behind nkumungu point kaziwa a mass of granitoid slabs with a single tree for landmark opposite us was sandi ya nzondo which others call sanga ya ngondo in the chart this one tree island is written catlo zonda it is the first of two similar formations oscar rock its western down stream neighbour had shared the fate of soonga lem paccula zunga chya makula a stone placed in the map northeast of the makula or annan debouchure both were invisible denoted only by swirls in the water we had taken seven hours to cover what we easily ran down in two and we slept comfortably with groan of rock and roar of stream for lullaby  september 7our course now lay uninterruptedly along the left bank where the scenery became yet more rhinelike in natural basins reaches on the chart here and there rugged uprocks passably simulated ruined castles the dwarf bays of yellow sand were girt by a goodly vegetation the palm and the calabash only telling us that we were in africa  our men pointed to the work of a nguvu or hippopotamus which they say sometimes attacks canoes they believe with tuckey that the riverhorses cause irregularity of soundings by assembling and trampling deep holes in the bed but the ngadi is a proof that they do not as m du chaillu supposes exclusively affect streams with shoals and shallows the jacaré crocodile is known especially to avoid the points where the current sweeps swiftly past yet no one will hang his hand over the canoe into the water we did not see any of these wretches but at boma coxswain deane observed one about sixteen feet long  curls of smoke arose from the mountainwalls of the trough showing that the bush was being burned and spired up from a grassy palmdotted plain between two rocky promontories on the left bank the site of the chacha or wembo village in a gap of the herbage stood halffinished canoes and a man was bobbing with rod line and float after an hours paddling we halted for breakfast under alecto rock a sheer bluff of reddish schist 150 feet high here a white trident inverted and placed ten feet above the water showed signs of hm ship alecto late captain hunt whose boat passed up in 1855 the people call it chimbongolo the river is now three quarters of a mile wide and the charming cove shows the brightest of sands and the densest of vegetation waving in the cool landwind  resuming our way at 9 pm we passed on the left scylla rocks then a wash and beyond them four high and treeclad heads off the right bank three are islets the zunga chya gnombeof the bullformed by a narrow arm passing round them to the north other natives called them zunga chya umbinda but all seem to differ these are the gombac islands of the chart hall island being the easternmost and the northern passage between the three horns and the main is called by us gombac creek half an hour beyond was a mass of villages in a large grassy lowland of the left bank girt by mountains higher than those down stream some outlying huts were called by the interpreters suko nkongo and formed the beach town of large interior settlements suko do wembo and mbinda others said lasugu or sugo nkongo the sooka congo of the charts others again for mbinda proposed mpeso birimba this is probably the place where according to the mail of november 73 diamonds were found and having been submitted to dr basham dr bastian before mentioned director of the museum of berlin were pronounced to be of very fine water it is possible that the sandstone may afford precious stones like the itacolumite of the brazil highlands of the brazil i 380 but the whole affair proved a hoax in midstream rose no 2 onetree island zunga chya nlemba or shika chya nzondo in tuckey it is called boola beca or blemba the husband rock the old ficus dying at the head was based upon a pedestal which appeared groinshaped from the east here the mirage was very distinct and the canoes seemed to fly not to swim       as when far out of sea a fleet descried       hangs in the clouds   the northern bank shows a stony projection called by maxwell fiddlers elbow it leads to the fourth reach the second of the northeastern series and the breadth of the stream once more a mountain lake cannot be less than two miles  i foresaw trouble in passing these settlements presently a snakelike war canoe with hawserholes like eyes crept out from the southern shore a second fully manned lay in reserve lurking along the land and armed men crowned the rocks jutting into the stream we were accosted by the first craft in which upon the central place of honour sat mpeso birimbá a petty chief of suko nkongo a pert rascal of the french factory habited in a red cap a green velvet waistcoat and a hammockshaped tippet of pineapple fibre his sword was a short sollingen blade the visit had the sole object of mulcting me in rum and cloth and my only wish was naturally to expend as little as possible in mere preliminaries the name of manbuku prata was duly thrown at him with but little effect these demands are never resisted by the slavedealers after much noise and cries of mwendi miser skinflint on the part of the myrmidons i was allowed to proceed having given up a cloth twentyfour yards long and i felt really grateful to the trade which had improved off all the other riverine settlements beyond this point we saw nothing but their distant smokes  before the second northeastern reach the interpreters exclaimed yellala fallathe cataract is speaking and we could distinctly hear the cheering roar the stream now assumed the aspect of niagara below the falls and the circular eddies boiling up from below and showing distinct convexity suggested the dangerous wells of the northern seas passing the three weird sisters unimportant rocks off the right bank we entered upon the remarkably long stretch extending upwards of five miles and from its predominating growth we proposed to call it palmyra reach the immediate river banks were clad with sedge and the broad leaves of the nymphæa a plant like the calamus of asia but here used only as a toothpick began to oust the rushy and flaggy growth of the lower bed the pink balls of the spinous mimosa and bright flowers especially the convolvulus and ipomaea illuminated the dull green the grassy land at the foot of the mountains was a mere edging faced by outlying rocks and we were shown the site of a village long ago destroyed  the nteba or palmyra nobilis mixed here and there with a glorious tamarind bombax or calabash forms a thin forest along the reach and rarely appears upon the upper hills where we should expect it the people use both fruit and wine preferring however the liquor of the ebah oil palmtree and the autumnal fires can hardly affect so sturdy a growth the other trees are the mfuma cottontree or bombax pentandria truncospinoso smith much valued as a canoe merolla uses mafuma a plural form and speaks of its wonderful fine wool the wild figs show glorious stature a truly noble growth whose parents were sun and water  the birds were lank black clivers plotus exceedingly wild the african roller coracias halcyons of several species especially a white and black kingfisher nimble and comely many swallows hornbills and wild pigeons which made the bush resound ardeine birds especially a heron like the large indian kullum kites crows whippoorwills and a fine haliaetus which flies high and settles upon the loftiest branches one of these eagles was shot after a gorge of the electric fish here common its coat was black and white and the eyes yellow with dark pupils various lizards ran over the rocks and we failed to secure a watersnake the only specimen seen on the whole trip  about noon we struggled past point masalla our diamond rock a reef ending in a triangular block towering abruptly and showing by driftwood a floodline now twelve feet high there are several of these benchmarks and the people declare that after every few years an unusual freshet takes place here the current impinges directly upon the rocks making a strong eddy they die each time said the interpreters as the canoemen with loud shouts of vai ou nao vai vai sempre vai direito ya mondele and arister a mariners word after failing to force the way tumbled overboard with a hawser of lliana to act as towline vai direito according to father ciprani also applies to a wonderful bird whose song consists in these plain words and mondele is synonymous with the utangáni of the gaboon and the east african muzungu a white man  this bend was in former days the terminus of canoe travel up stream grisly tales of mishap are told and even now a musketry salute is fired when boats pass without accident beyond diamond rock is a wellwooded stony cove salan kunkati captain tuckey makes this the name of the diamond rock and translates it the strong feather quartz before in lines and bands now appears in masses the coal rock which the chart places near insála bechope point on the northern bank was probably submerged high cliffs towered above us and fragments which must have weighed twenty tons had slipped into the water one of them bore an adansonia growing head downwards  the next feature was npunga bay low and leekgreen between the bluebrown water here some 700 yards broad and the yellow sun burnt troughsides a little further on at 2 pm the canoemen halted beyond a sandy point with two large bondeiro trees and declared their part of the bargain to have been fulfilled bonderro is a corruption of the lusitanianized imbundeiro the calabash or adansonia digitata the other baobab is called nkondo probably the aliconda and elicandy of battel and old travellers who describe the watertanks hollowed in its huge trunk and the cloth made from the bark fibre thus the condo sonio of the chart should be nkondo sonho the latter a proper name it is seldom that we find trees turned to all the uses of which they are capable the congo people despise the nutritious and slightly laxative flour of the monkey bread and the young leaves are not used as pickles the bast is not valued for cloth and ropes nor are the boles cut into cisterns  as will be seen we ought to have insisted upon being paddled to kala cliff and bight the mayumba bay of the chart where the bed trends westeast and shows the lowest rapids the first congo expedition went up even higher at nkongo ka lunga the point marked by two calabashes we inquired for the nokki congo of which we had heard at chisalla and which still exists upon the chartdistricts and villages being often confounded all laughed and declared that the porttown had long been sold off the same had been the case even in tuckeys day with the next settlement condo sonio the baobab of sonho formerly the great upstream mart where the slavetraders transacted their business all the population was now transferred inland and like our predecessors we were promised a two hours climb over the rough steep highland which lay in front then we understood that nokki was the name of a canton not of a settlement its southeastern limits may have contained the city of norchie the best situated of any place hitherto seen in ethiopia where father merolla p 280 baptized 126 soulsand this is rendered probable by the crucifixes and coleworts which were found by the first congo expedition  here then at 9750 miles from the sea ended our clans cruize we could only disembark upon the clean sand surrounded by cool shade and blocks of gneiss the favourite haltingplace as the husks of groundnuts show nchama chamvu was at once sent off with a present of gin and a verbal report of arrival to nessudikira nchinu king of banza nkaye whilst we made ready for a nights lodging à la belle étoile the mesenger returned bringing a goat and the good news that porters would be sent early next morning we slept well in the cool and dewless air with little trouble from mosquitoes the voice of the cataract in its sublime samesoundingness alone broke the silence and the scenery suggested to us as to the first britishers that we might be bivouacking among the blue misty hills of morven  september 8shortly after sunrise appeared gidi mavunga father to the king accompanied by five princes in the usual black coats and some forty slaves armed with pistols blunderbusses and guns of french and yankee build our visitors wore the official berretta european shirts that contrasted with coral necklaces and rings of zinc brass and copper and handsome waistcoats fronted by the welltanned spoil of some bush animal generally a wild cat hanging like a scotch sporranthis is and has long been the distinctive sign of a gentleman according to john barbot supplement churchill v 471 all men in loango were bound to wear a furskin over their clothes viz of an otter a tame cat or a catomountain a great wood or wild cat or an angali civetcat besides which they had very fine speckled spelts called  enkeny which might be worn only by the king and his peculiar favourites  on the great mans mat was placed a large silverhandled dagger shaped somewhat like a fishslicer and the handsome hammocks of brightdyed cottons brought down for our use shamed our humble ships canvas the visitors showed all that african câlinerie which as fatal experience told me would vanish for ever changing velvet paw to armed claws at the first question of cloth or rum meanwhile we had only to visit their village upon the head of gidi mavunga  about 9 am we attacked a true via dolorosa the normal road of the lower congo the steep ascent of dry clayey soil was strewed with schist and resplendent silvery gneiss quartz appeared in every variety crystallized and amorphous transparent white opaque dusky and rusty tuckeys mica slate appears to be mostly schist or gneiss i saw only one piece of true slate which had been brought from the upper bed merollas talc is mostly mica  followed an equally rough descent to a water set in fetid mud its iridescence declaring the presence of iron oozing out of the ground it discharges during rains into the river and throughout the dry season it keeps its little valley green with trees and shrubs i observed what appeared to be the esere or calabar bean physostigma venenosum whose hairy pod is very distasteful to the travelling skin it was a mucuna urens  another scramble upon a highly inclined hogsback where weather worn brownblack granite protruded bonelike from the clay flesh placed us at the outlying village of kinbembu with its line of palms here the aneroid showed 1322 feet after a short rest the hammock men resumed work over a rough plateau the rises were scattered with brushwood and the falls were choked with the richest vegetation every hill discharged its own rivulet bubbling over the rock and the waters were mostly chalybeate  presently appeared a kind of barracoon a large square of thick canework and thatch about eight feet high the fetish house of the jinkimba or circumcised boys who received us with unearthly yells after a march of an hour and three quarterscovering five indirect and three direct miles in a southeastern rhumb we reached banza nkaye the royal village where the sympiesometer showed 1430 feet our bearers yelled abububu showing that we had reached our destination and the villagers answered with a cry of abíaaa the entrance was triumphal we left the river with a tail of fiftysix which had swelled to 150 ragged followers  after a short delay we proceeded to the palace which was distinguished from afar by a long projecting gable forming a cool verandah descending some three hundred feet we passed a familiar sight in africa where arboribus suus horror inest a treetrunk bore three pegged skulls somewhat white with age eight years ago they were taken off certain wizards who had bewitched their enemies a labyrinthine entrance of transparent canework served to prevent indecent haste and presently we found ourselves in presence of the mfumo who of course takes the title of le rei nessudikira was a blancbec aged twenty or twentyone who till lately had been a trading lad at bomanow he must not look upon the sea he appeared habited in the usual guy style a gaudy fancy helmet a white shirt with limp byronic collar a broadcloth frock coat a purple velvet goldfringed loinwrap a theatrical dagger whose handle and sheath bore cut glass emeralds and rubies stuck in the waistbelt brass anklets depended over naked feet and the usual beadles cloak covered the whole truly a change for the worse since tuckeys day when a savage magnificence showed itself in the display of lions and leopards skins when no women were allowed to be present and when the boys could only clap hands now the verandah is surrounded by a squatting crowd and resounds with endless chatter and scream  nessudikira whose eyes by way of grandeur never wandered from the floor shook hands with us without rising from his chair somewhat after the fashion of certain women in civilized society who would be dignified and who are not his father gidi mavunga knelt before him on the ground a mat being forbidden in the presence he made the battapalmas before he addressed his filho de pistola as he called him in opposition to filho de fazenda the king had lately been crowned in virtue of his mother being a uterine sister of his predecessor here the goods and dignity of the father revert after death to his eldest maternal brother to his eldest nephew that is the eldest son of the eldest uterine sister and all others failing to the first born of the nearest maternal relative this subjection of sire to son is however mainly ceremonious in private life the king wears a cotton pagne and his governor asserts his birth right even by wigging royalty  we disposed ourselves upon seamens chests covered with red baize fronting the semicircle of frockcoated gentlemen and halfnaked dependants and slaves proceedings began with the matabicho de rigueur the inevitable preliminary and conclusion of all lifebusiness between birth and burial the congo traveller will hear nganna mata bicho master kill the worm ie give me a dram till the words seem like bakhshish further east to poison his ears this excuse for a drink arose or is said to have arisen from some epidemic which could be cured only by spirits and the same is the tradition in the new world highlands of the brazil i chap 38 similarly the fulas of the windward coast who as strict moslem will not drink fermented liquors hold a cup of rum to be the sovereignest thing in the world for taenia the entozoon of course gives rise to a variety of stale and melancholy jokes about the early bird the worm that dieth not and so forth  a greybeard of our gin was incontinently opened and a tumbler in a basin was filled to overflowing even when buying groundnuts the measure must be heaped up the glass was passed round to the great gentlemen who drank it african fashion expanding the cheeks rinsing the mouth so that no portion of the gums may lose their share and swallowing the draught with an affectedly wry face the basin then went to the little gentlemen below the salt they have the vinum garrulum and they scrambled as well as screamed for a sup of the precious liquor i need hardly quote caliban and his proposed genuflections  i had been warned by all the traders of the lower river that banza nokki would be to me the farfamed point of which it was said            quern passar o cabo de nam            ou tornará ou n o  and prepared accordingly old shimbal the linguist had declared that a year would be required by

supreme moment the interpreter who had been deaf to the charmers voice offering fifty dollars for the last three days succumbed to the truant fever he knew something of portuguese and having been employed by the french factory he had scoured the land far and wide in search of emigrants he began well cooked a fowl boiled some eggs and made tea after which he cleared out a hut that was declared très logeable and found a native couch resembling the egyptian kafas  we slept in a new climate at night the sky was misty and the mercury fell to 60° f there was a dead silence neither beast nor bird nor sound of water was heard amongst the hills only at times high winds in gusts swept over the highlands with a bullying noise and disappeared leaving everything still as the grave i felt once more

retained in our maps it is the verbele of pigafetta and the barbele of linschoten who make it issue either from the western lakereservoir of the nile or from the aquilunda water a name variously derived from ocalunga the sea  or from akilunda of kilunda  the industrious compiler james barbot 1700 mentions the umbre the modern wambre rising in the northern mountains or according to p labat in a lake dapper 1676 who so greatly improved the outline of africa had already derived with de barros the rio zaïre from a central reservoir zaïre whose island the zembre afterwards became the vambere

to term the congo rio de patron rio do padrao from the first of memorial columns built at its mouth in 1816 captain tuckeys expedition learned with maxwell that the stream should be called not zaire but moienzi enzaddi the great river or the river which absorbs all other rivers this thoroughly corrupted name which at once found its way into popular books and which is repeated to the present day even by scientific geographers suggested to some theorists zadi the name of the niger at wassenah according to sidi harriet as related by the american james riley of the brig commerce wrecked on august 28 1815 others remembered zad which shaykh yusuf hornemann misleading mungo park learned to be the niger east of tinbuktu where it turns off to the southward i need hardly say that this zadi

binue or bimúwe the great eastern fork of the negroland nile the true drainage of the chadda in ancient times has lately been determined by the adventurous dr nachtigal mr cooleyfn12 applied as was his wont a superficial knowledge of kibundo to fiote or congoese and further corrupted moienzi enzaddi to muenya for menha or menya zinzádithis angolan emendation however was not adopted  the natives dwelling upon the congo banks have as usual in africa no comprehensive generic term for the mighty artery of the west coast each tribe calls it by its own name thus even in fiote we find mulángo or lángo the water nkoko the stream mwánza the river and mwanza nnenne the great river all used synonymously at the several places the only proper name is mwánza nzádi the river nzadi hence zaire zaïre

consequently all are provided with lacustrine reservoirs of greater or smaller extent and are subject to periodical inundations varying in season according as the sun is north or south of the line those of the northern hemisphere swell with the summer rains of ethiopia a fact known in the case of the nile to democritus of abdera 5th cent bc to agatharchidas of cnidos 2nd cent bc to pomponius

the lateral chains the mosiwatúnya smoke that thunders of the zambeze and the ripon falls discovered by captains speke and grant upon the higher nile are the latest acquisitions to geography whilst the mai waterfall reported to break the upper congo still awaits exploration this accident of form suggests a division of navigation on the maritime section and on the plateaubed which in due time will be connected like the st lawrence by canals and railways all but the nzadi and perhaps even this have deltas where the divided stream deficient in watershed finds its sluggish way to the sea  the largest delta at present known is the nigerian whose base measures 155 direct geographical miles between the rivers kontoro east and benin west pliny v 9 makes the nile delta extend 170 roman miles

from north to south the zambeze extends 58 miles between the kilimani or northern and the west luabo cuama or southern outletat least if these mouths are not to be detached the nzadi is the smallest measuring a maximum of only 12 to 15 miles from the malela or bananal creek to the mangrove ditches of the southern shore  in these depressed regions the comparatively salubrious climates of the

happily share the same fate they are being robbed of their last mysteries the veil of isis is fast yielding to the white mans grasp  we can hardly as yet answer the question whether the congo was known to the ancients our acquaintance with the oldest explorations is at present fragmentary and we are apt to assume that the little told us in our schoolbooks is the sumtotal of former exploits but possibly inscriptions in the new world as well as in the old may confirm the first circumnavigation so simply recounted by herodotus especially that of the phoenicians who set out from the red sea and in three years returned to the mediterranean the expression they had the sun to the right is variously explained in the southern hemisphere the sailors facing west during our winter would see the sun at noon on the right and in the northern hemisphere on the left but why should they face west in the chronicle of schedel p ccxc printed in 1793 pigafetta pinkerton xi 412 we read these two ie jacob cam and martin behem or behaim by the help of the gods ploughing the sea at short distance from shore having passed the equinoctial line entered the nether hemisphere where fronting the east their shadow fell towards the south and on their right hand perhaps it may simply allude to the morning sun which would rise to port as they went southwards and to starboard as they returned north again the first overland expedition is related by the father of history with all the semblance of truth we see no cause to doubt that the nasammones or nasamones nás amún the five young lybians of the great syrtis fezzan crossed the greek           watered strip along the mediterranean passed through the greek         the bush on the frontier still famed for lions and the immeasurably sandy wastes the sahara proper across which caravan lines run the band of little black men can no longer be held fabulous since miani and schweinfurth added the akya to m du chaillus obongo the extensive marshes were the northern limit of the tropical rains and the city of enchanters is the type of many still existing in inner africa the great river flowing from west to east whose crocodiles showed it to be the nile must have been the niger the ancients knew middle ethiopia to be a country watered by lakes and streams strabo xvii 3 tells us that some suppose that even the nilesources are near the extremities of mauritania hence too the nilides or lake of standing water in pliny v 10 for the most part they made a great central river traverse the northern continent from west to east whereas the arabian geographers of the middle ages who were followed by the portuguese inverted the course both may be explained by the lay of the quorra and the binúwe especially the latter it was chronically confounded with the true nile whose want of western influents was not so well known then as now  the generation which has discovered the moabite stone the ruins of troy schliemann and the key to the inscriptions of etruria corssen need not despair of further progress it has been well remarked that whereas the course of modern exploration has generally been maritime the ancients whose means of navigation were less perfect preferred travelling by land we are doubtless far better acquainted with the outlines of the african coast and the immediately maritime region than the egyptians the greeks the romans and the arabs but it is still doubtful whether their information respecting the interior did not surpass ours eratosthenes librarian of alexandria b c 276196 expresses correct notions concerning the upper

shadda and enzaddi  it is still interesting to consider the circumstances which gave rise to captain tuckeys disastrous expedition as any map of africa during the early quarter of the present century bowdich or dupuis for instance may prove the course of the niger was laid down now according to the ancients then after arab information the dark continent of which danville justly said that writers abused pour ainsi dire de la vaste carrière que lintérieur y laissait prendre mém de lacad des inscriptions xxvi 61 had not been subjected to scientific analysis this was reserved for the presidential address to the royal geographical society by the late sir r i murchison 1852 geographers did not see how to pass the niger through the kong mountains which uniting with the jebel komri are supposed to run in one unbroken chain across the continent and these lunar mountains of the moslems which were stretched like a chaplet of beads from east to west undoubtedly express as m du chaillu contends a real feature the double versant probably a mere wave of ground between the great hydrographic basins of the niger and the congo of north africa and of central africa men still wasted their vigour upon the nigritis palus the chelonídes waters the mount caphas and the lakes of wangara variously written vancara and vongara not to mention other ways maps place wangarato the northwest of dahome where the natives utterly ignore the name dupuis ashantee 1824 suggests that like takrúr it is an obsolete moslem term for the 660 miles of maritime region between cape lahu and the rio formoso or the old calabar river this would include the three despotisms ashanti dahome and benin with the tribes who from a distance of twentyfive days bring gold to tinbuktu the tungubutu of de barros i 220 thus the lakes of wangara would be the lagoons of the slavecoast in which the niger may truly be said to lose itself  at length m reichard of lobenstein ephémerides géographiques weimar 1802 theoretically discovered the mouth of the niger by throwing it into the bight of benin he was right in essentials and wrong in details for instance he supposed the rio formoso or benin river and the rio del rey to join in one great stream beyond the flat alluvial delta whereas the former is indirectly connected through the wari with the niger and the latter has no connection with it at all the truth was received with scant courtesy and the hypothesis was pronounced to be worthy of very little attention there were however honourable exceptions in 1813 the learned maltebrun précis de la géographie universelle vol iv 635 sanctioned the theory hinted at by mungo park and in 1828 the wellabused caillié a frenchman who had dared to excel bruce and mungo park wrote these remarkable words if i may be permitted to hazard an opinion as to the course of the river dhioliba i should say that it empties itself by several mouths into the bight of benin in 1829 fortified by clappertons opinion my late friend james macqueen who to immense industry added many qualifications of a comparative geographer recommended a careful examination of the estuaries between the rio formoso and old calabar the question was not finally set at rest till 1830 november 15th when richard and john lander entered yoruba viâ badagry and triumphantly descending the lower niger made the sea by the nun and brass embouchures  meanwhile mr george maxwell a scotchman who had long traded in the congo and who subsequently published a chart of the lower river proposed at the end of the last century to take from england six supernumerary boats for rowing and sailing which could be carried by thirty people and portaged round the cataracts this gave rise to captain tuckeys first error depending upon labour and provisions which were not to be had for love or money anywhere on the congo above the yellala with thirty or forty black rowers probably cabinda men maxwell advised navigating the river about may when the cacimbo or dry season begins and with arms provisions and merchandize he expected to reach the sources in six weeks the scheme which was rendered abortive by the continental war of 1793 had two remarkable results it caused mungo parks fatal second journey and it led to the twin expeditions of tuckey and peddie   in july 1804 the ardent and irrepressible scot wrote from priors lynn near longtown to a friend mr william kier of milholm that the river enzaddi was frequented by portuguese who found the stream still as large as near the mouth after ascending 600 miles it is useful to observe how these distances are obtained the slavetouters for the liverpool and other dealers used we are told to march one month up country and take two to return thirty days multiplied by twenty miles per diem give 600 miles i need hardly point out that upon such a mission the buyer would be much more likely to travel 60 miles than 600 in a single month and i believe that the natives of the lower river never went beyond nsundi or 215 indirect miles from point padrão  with truly national tenacity and plausibility perfervidum ingenium contended that the congo or zaire was the nigerian debouchure major rennell who had disproved the connection of the niger and the egyptian nile by bruces barometric measurements on the course of the mountaingirt bahr el azrak and by browns altitudes at darfur condemned the bold theory for the best of reasons  mungo park after a brief coldness and coquetting with it hotly adopted to the fullest extent the wild scheme before leaving england oct 4 1804 he addressed a memoir to lord camden explaining the causes of his conversion it is curious to note his confusion of zad his belief that the congo waters are at all seasons thick and muddy and his conviction that the annual flood which he considered perpetual commences before the rains fall south of the equator the latter is to a certain extent true the real reason will presently be given infected by the enthusiasm of his brother scot he adds considered in a commercial point of view it is second only to the discovery of the cape of good hope and in a geographical point of view it is certainly the greatest discovery that remains to be made in this world  thereupon the traveller set out for the upper niger with the conviction that he would emerge by the congo and return to england viâ the west indies from the fragments of his journal and his letters to lord camden to sir joseph banks and to his wife it is evident that at sansanding he had modified his theories and that he was gradually learning the truth to the former he writes i am more and more inclined to think that it the niger can end nowhere but in the sea and presently a guide who had won his confidence assured him that the river after passing kashna runs directly to the right hand or south which would throw it into the gulf of guinea  the fatal termination of parks career in 1805 lulled public curiosity for a time but it presently revived the geographical mind was still excited by the mysterious stream which evaporation or dispersion drained into the lakeswamps of wangara and to this was added not a little curiosity concerning the lamented and popular explorers fate we find instructions concerning mungo park issued even to cruizers collecting political and other information upon the east african coast eg to captain smee sent in 1811 by the bombay government his companion lieutenant hardy converted usagára west of the zanzibar seaboard into wangarah and remarks a white man supposed to be park is said to have travelled here twenty years ago observations c  about ten years after mungo parks death two expeditions were fitted out by government to follow up his discovery major peddie proceeded to

absurd conduct will diminish the liberality of the captain towards us he is like a pointed arrow to the company and again poor cranch is almost too much the object of jest galway is the principal bantererin the professors remarks on the fat purserwe can detect the foreigner who on such occasions should never be mixed up with englishmen  sir joseph banks had suggested a steamer drawing four feet with twentyfour horsepower an admirable idea but practical difficulties of construction rendered the congo useless of the fiftyfour white men eighteen including eleven of the congo crew died in less than three months fourteen out of a party of thirty officers and men who set out to explore the cataracts viâ the northern bank lost their lives and they were followed by four more on board the congo and one at bahia the expedition remained in the river between july 6th and october 18th little more than three months yet twentyone or nearly onethird three of the superior officers and all the scientific men perished captain tuckey died of fatigue and exhaustion oct 4th rather than of disease lieutenant hawkey of fatal typhus which during 1862 followed the yellow fever in the bonny and new calabar rivers and mr eyre palpably of bilious remittent professor smith had been so charmed with the river that he was with difficulty persuaded to return prostrated four days afterwards by sickness on board the transport he refused physic and food because his stomach rejected bark and preferring cold water he became delirious apparently he died of disappointment popularly called a broken heart

28th visited sangala the highest rapid narrative p 328 in the introduction p 80 we are wrongly told that he went to banza ninga whence being taken ill on august 24th he was sent down stream he like his commander had to sleep in the open almost without food and he also succumbed to fever fatigue and exhaustion  the cause of this prodigious mortality appears in the records of the expedition officers and men were all raw unseasoned and unacclimatized captain tuckey an able navigator the author of maritime geography and statistics had served in the tropics his biographer however writes that a long imprisonment in france and residence in india had broken down his constitution and at the age of thirty ob æt thirtynine his hair was grey and his head nearly bald the men perished exactly like the missionaries of old by hard work insufficient and innutritious food physical exhaustion and by the doctor at first immediate bleeding and gentle cathartics are found to be panaceas for mild fevers p 46 presently the surgeon makes a discovery as follows with regard to the treatment i shall here only observe that bleeding was particularly unsuccessful cathartics were of the greatest utility and calomel so administered as speedily to induce copious salivation generally procured a remission of all the violent symptoms the phlebotomy was inherited from the missioners who own almost to have blinded themselves by it when one was blooded fifteen times and died his amateur sangrado said it had been better to have bled him thirty times the theory was that in so hot a climate all the european blood should be replaced by african one of the entries in captain tuckeys diary is awaking extremely unwell i directly swallowed five grains of calomela man worn out by work and sleeping in

shortwaisted red coats and knee breeches with boots or spatterdasheseven the stout lord clyde in his latest days used to recall the miseries of his march to margate and declare that the horrid dress gave him more pain than anything he afterwards endured in a lifetime of marching none seemed capable of calculating what amount of fatigue and privation the european system is able to support in the tropics and thus they perished sometimes of violent bilious remittents more often of utter weariness and starvation peace to their manesthey did their best and angels can no more they played for high

not be severely criticized had the writers lived they might have worked up their unfinished logs into interesting and instructive matter but evidently they had not prepared themselves for the work no one knew the periods of rain at the equator there was no linguist to avoid mistakes in the vocabulary moreover professor smiths notes being kept in small and illformed danish characters caused such

depositing any sediment this reminds us of the changing colours green red and milky white to which the nile and all great african rivers that flood periodically are subjectfn15  the next traveller that deserves notice is the unfortunate douvillefn16 through whose tissue of imposture runs a golden thread of truth as his first journey occupying nearly two of the three volumes was probably confined to the valley of the cuanza river so his second extending beyond the equator and to a meridian 25° east of paris becomes fable as he leaves the course of the loge stream yet although he begins by doubting that the coango and the zaire are the same waters he ends by recognizing the fact and his map justly lays down the fleuve couango dit zaire à son embouchure whether the tale of the mulatto surveyor be fact or not is of little matter the adventurer had an evident inkling of the truth  a flood of side light is thrown upon the head waters of the congo river by dr livingstones first memorable journey 185256 across africa and by the more dubious notices of his third expedition the introduction p xviii to captain tuckeys narrative had concluded from the fact of the highest flood being in march and the lowest level about the end of august that at least one branch of the river must pass through some portion of the northern hemisphere the general observations affixed to narrative p 346 contain these words if the rise of the zaire had proceeded from rains to the southward of the line swelling the tributary streams and pouring in mountain torrents the waters into the main channel the rise would have been sudden and impetuous of course the writer had recourse to the lakes of wangara in north latitude 12° to 15° that solution of the difficulty belonged inevitably to his day captain tuckey p 178 learned at mavunda that ten days of canoeing would take him beyond all the rapids to a large sandy islet which makes two channels one to the northwest the other to the northeast in the latter there is a fall above which canoes are procurable twenty days higher up the river issues by many small streams from a great marsh or lake of mudfn17 again a private letter written from the yellala p 343 declares that the zaire would be found to issue from a lake or a chain of lakes considerably to the north of the line and so far from the low state of the river in july and august militating against the hypothesis it gives additional weight provided the river swell in early septemberwhich it did in his journal p 224 we find a memorandum written as it were with a dying hand hypothesis confirmed the water  on february 24 1854 dr livingstone after leaving what he calls the dilolo lake found on an almost level plain some 4000 to 5000 feet high and then flooded after rains a great water parting between the eastern and the western continental shores i have carefully considered the strictures upon this subject by the author of dr livingstones errors p 101 and have come to the conclusion that the explorer was too experienced to make the mistakes attributed to him by the cabinet geographer the translation despair for bitterness of the fish and the reference to noahs deluge may be little touches ad captandum but the kibundo or angolan tongue certainly has a dental though it lacks a cerebral d  the easterly flow was here represented by the leeba or upper course of the leeambye the diambege of ladislaus magyar that great northern and northwestern course of the zambeze across which older geographers had thrown a dam of lofty mountains where the mosiwatunya cataract was afterwards discovered the opposite versant flowing to the north was the kasai or kasye livingstone the casais of the pombeiros the casati of douville the casasi and casézi of m cooley who derives it from casezi a priest the corrupted arabic kissis  the kassabi casabi of beke the cassaby of monteiro and gamitto p 494 and the kassaby or cassay of valdez its head water is afterwards called by the explorer lomame and loke possibly for luoke because it drains the highlands of mossamba and the district of jioke also called kioke kiboke and by the portuguese quiboque the stream is described as being one hundred yards broad running through a deep green glen like the clyde the people attested its length by asserting in true african style if you sail along it for months you will turn without seeing the end of it european geographers apparently will not understand that this declaration shows only the ignorance of the natives concerning everything a few miles beyond their homes the explorer february 271854 places the ford in south latitude 11° 15 47 and his map shows east longitude g 21° 40 30 about 7° 30 450 direct geographical miles from novo redondo on the western coast he dots its rise in the balobale country south latitude 12° to 13° and east longitude 19° to 20° pursuing his course dr livingstone march 30 first sighted the quango coango as it emerged from the dark jungles of londa a giant clyde some 350 yards broad flowing down an enormous valley of denudation he reached it on april 1854 in south latitude 9° 53 and east longitude g 18° 37 about 300 geographical linear miles from the atlantic three days to the west lies the easternmost station of angola cassange no portuguese lives or rather then lived beyond the coango valley the settlers informed him that eight days or about 100 miles march south of this position the sources are to be found in the mosamba range of the basongo country this would place them in about south latitude 12° to 13° and east longitude g 18° to 19°  the heights are also called in benguela nanos nannos or nhanos highlandsfn18 and in our latest maps they are made to discharge from their seaward face the coango and cuanza to the west and north the kasai to the northeast and possibly to the congo the cunene southwestwards to the atlantic and southwards the kubango whose destination is still doubtful dr charles beke athenæum no 2206 february 5 1870 judged from various considerations that the kassábi rising in the primeval forests of olovihenda was the great hydrophylacium of the continent of africa the central point of division between the waters flowing to the mediterranean to the atlantic and to the indian oceanin fact the headwater of the nile i believe however that our subsequent information made my late friend abandon this theory  on his return march to linyanti dr livingstone who was no longer incapacitated by sickness and fatigue perceived that all the western feeders of the kasa flow first from the western side towards the centre of the continent then gradually turn with the main stream itself to the north and after the confluence of the kasai with the quango an immense body of water collected from all these branches finds its way out of the country by means of the river congo or zaire on the western coast chap xxii he adds there is but one opinion among the balonda respecting the kasai and the quango they invariably describe the kasai as receiving the quango and beyond the confluence assuming the name of zairé or zerézeré and thus he verifies the tradition of the portuguese who always speak of the casais and the coango as suppôsto congo it is regrettable that dr livingstone has not been more explicit upon the native names the balonda could hardly have heard of the semieuropean term zaire which is utterly unknown even at the yellalas on the other hand it must be borne in mind that maxwell was informed by native travellers that the river 600 miles up country was still called enzaddi and perhaps the explorer merely intends zairé to explain zerézeré it is hardly necessary to notice douvilles assertion ii 372  meanwhile the late ladislaus magyar who had previously informed the benguelan government that the casais was reported to fall into the indian ocean at some unknown place in 1851 followed this great artery lower than any known traveller he heard that beyond his furthest exploration point about south latitude 6° 30fn19 and east longitude g 22° it pursues a north easterly direction and widening several miles it raises waves which are dangerous to canoes the waters continue to be sweet and fall into a lake variously called mouro or moura moráve or marávi uhanja or uhenje nyanza which is suspected to be the urenge or ulenge of which livingstone heard in about south latitude 3° and east longitude g 26° the hungarian traveller naturally identified it with the mythical lake nyassa which has done such portentous mischief in a day now gone by ladislaus magyar also statesfn20 the congo rises i have convinced myself by reports in the swamp named inhanha occupying the high plateau of moluwa in the lands of the luba uniting with the many streams of this region at a distance of about five days from the source it becomes a deep though narrow river which flows to the westward through a level country covered with dense forests whose frequent streams coming from the north  and south are taken up by the river then it bends northwestward under the name of kuango here we find the drowned lands the sponges of livingstone who however placed the sources much further to the southeast  dr livingstones third and last expedition which began on march 24 1866 and which ended 1873 with fatal fitness in the swamps of the bangweolo suggests a new and more distant derivation for the mighty congo after travelling from the rovuma river to lake nyassa the great explorer in l8678 came upon an earthern mound west of lake bangweolo or bemba in about south latitude 11° and here he places the sources of the nile where geographers have agreed provisionally to place the sources of the congo already in 1518 fernandez de enciso suma de geographia the theoretical discoverer of kilimanjaro was told by the congoese that their river rises in high mountains from which another great stream flows in an opposite direction but this might apply to more watersheds than one the subject is treated at considerable length in an article by dr e behmfn21 certain of whose remarks i shall notice at the end of this chapter  the article proves hypsometrically that the lualaba in which the explorer found the head waters of the egyptian river cannot feed the tanganyika nor the lake nzige nzíghe mwutan chowambe or albert nyanza lake nor even the bahr el ghazal as was once suspected from the latter indeed it is barred by the water parting of the welle the babura of jules poncet 1860 in the land of the monbuttú whose system the later explorer dr schweinfurth is disposed to connect with the shari hydrometrically considered the lualaba which at nyangwe the most northerly point explored by dr livingstone 1870 rolls a flood of 124000 cubic feet per second in the dry season cannot be connected either with the welle 5100 cubic feet nor with the bahr el ghazal 3042 to 6500 cubic feet nor with the nile below the mouth of the bahr el ghazal 11330 nor with the shari 67500 nor with the shallow ogobe through its main forks the rembo okanda and the rembo nguye  but the lualaba may issue through the congo the former is made one of the four streams ferried over by those travelling from the cazembe to the mwata ya nvo and dr de lacardafn22 records it as the guarava probably a dialectic form of lualava it is the luapula of the geographer of nyassi who with his usual felicity and boldness of conjecture p 38 bends it eastward and discharges it into his mythical central sea  dr behm greatly underestimates the congo when he assigns to it only 1800000 cubic feet per second he makes the great artery begin to rise in november instead of september and decrease in april without noticing the marchjune freshets reported by all the natives to measure about onethird of the autumnal floods his elements are taken from tuckey who found off the diamond rock a velocity of 350 knots an hour and from vidals chart showing 9000 english feet or 150 nautical miles in a thalweg fifty fathoms deep thus he assumes only two nautical miles for the current or sixty inches per second which must be considerably increased and an average depth of ten fathoms which again is too little for 1800000 cubic feet of water per second which tuckey made 2000000 we may safely read 2500000  dr livingstone himself was haunted by the idea that he was exploring the upper congo not the nile from a portuguese subordinate he learned that the luapula went to angola he asks with some truth who would care to risk being put into a cannibal pot and be converted into blackman for anything less than the grand old nile and the late sir roderick i murchison whose geographical forecasts were sometimes remarkable suspected long agofn23 that his illustrious friend would follow the drainage of the country to the western coast  the extraordinary quiet rise of the periodical flood proved by the first expedition argues that the congo issues from the gradual overflowing of a lake or a chain of lakes the increment in the lower bed only eight to twelve feet where the nile and the ganges rise thirty and the binuwe fifty would also suggest that it is provided with many large reservoirs the introduction to tuckeys narrative p xviii assumes that the highest water is in march but he entered the stream only on july 6 and the expedition ended in midoctober the best informants assured me that from march till june there are heavy freshets as in the ogobe the flood begins in early september somewhat preceding that of the lualaba but unlike the former stream it attains its highest in november and december and it gradually subsides from the end of june till august about which time the water is lowest  in the middle region of the tanganyika i found the rainy season lasting from september to may at lake liemba the southeastern projection of the tanganyika dr livingstone in 1867 saw no rain from may 12 to september and in manywemaland west of the central tanganyika about south latitude 5° the wet season began in november and continued till july with intervals marking the passage of the belt of calms but for the congo to rise in september we must assume the rains to have fallen in early august allowing ten or fifteen days for the streams to descend and the rest for the saturation of the land this postulates a supply from the central african regions far north of the equator even for the marchjune freshets we must also undoubtedly go north of the line yet herr h kiepertfn24 places the northernmost influent of congo some 150 miles south of the equator under these limitations i agree with dr behmtaking everything into consideration in the present state of our knowledge there is the strongest probability that the lualaba is the head stream of the congo and the absolute certainty that it has no connection with the nile or any other river system of the northern hemisphere and again as surely as the sun stands over the southern hemisphere in our winter and the northern in our summer bringing the rains and the swellings of the tropical rivers when it is in the zenith with regard to them so surely can it be predicated from a comparison of the rainy seasons and times of rising that the lualaba belongs to no river of the northern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere africa possesses only one river the congo which could take up the vast water supply of the lualaba the brazil shows the curious feature of widely different and even opposite rainy seasons in the same parallel of latitude but this is not the place to discuss the subject  since these lines were written i have to lament the collapse of the livingstonecongo expedition in 1872 the great explorers friends taking into consideration the prospect of his turning westward organized a relief from west as well as from east africa mr j young of kelly generously supplied the sinews of travel and mr clements r markham secretary of the royal geographical society lent important aid in preparing the exploration navigatinglieutenant w j grandy who had seen service on the eastern coast of africa landed at s paulo de loanda in early 1873 and set out from ambriz in march of that year the usual difficulties were met and overcome when lieutenant grandy was summarily recalled the official explanation royal geographical society december 14th 1874 is that the measure was in consequence of livingstones death the traveller himself sayscomplying with instructions we with many regrets at the idea of leaving our work unfinished when all seemed so full of promise commenced preparations for the return leaving good presents with the chiefs in order to procure a good reception for those who might come after us an expresident of the royal geographical society had asserted the ascent of the upper congo ought to be more productive of useful geographical results than any other branch of african exploration as it will bring to the test of experiment the navigability of the congo above the falls and thus possibly open out a means of introducing traffic by steam into the heart of the continent at least two thousand miles from the mouth of the river  with this explicit and stimulating assertion before us we must lament that england once the worthy rival in exploration of spain portugal and the netherlands is now too poor to support a single exploration on the west african coast when germany is wealthy enough liberally to subsidize two                                   note                     a nous deux dr e behm    my objections to your paper are the three following 1 it generally understates the volume of the nzadi by not allowing sufficiently for the double equinoctial periods of high water march to june as well as september to december and by ignoring the northequatorial supply 2 it arbitrarily determines the question of the tanganyika separating it from the nilesystem upon the insufficient strength of a gorilla and of an oilpalm which is specifically different from that of the western coast and 3 it wilfully misrepresents dr livingstone in the matter of the socalled victoria nyanza  my first objection has been amply discussed i therefore proceed to consider the second as mr alexander g findlay observed proceedings of the royal geographical society no 3 vol xvii of july 28 1873up to the time of stanleys arrival at ujiji and his journey to the north of the lake livingstone was fully impressed with the conviction that the tanganyika is nothing more than what he called a lacustrine river 329 miles long by twenty of average breadth flowing steadily to the north and forming a portion of the great nile basin the letters contained his reasons for forming that opinion stating that he had been for weeks and months on the shores of the lake watching the flow of the water northwards at the rate of a knot per hour at times the current appeared to run southwards but that was under the influence of strong northerly winds also by dr livingstones letters to sir thomas maclear and dr mann  proceedings of the royal geographical societyno i of 1873 pp 6970 it is evident that the explorer believed only in the lake outlet north of ujiji again mr findlay after attentively considering the unsatisfactory visit of dr livingstone and mr stanley to the rusizi river in november and december 1871 holds it to be a mere marshdrain which when the south winds prevail would possibly flow in the opposite direction and he still believes that captain speke and i when at uvira were within five or six miles of the head  since dr livingstones visit we have heard more upon this disputed subject a native of karagwah assured my friend sir samuel bakerwho despite all prepossessions candidly accepted the statementthat it is possible and feasible to canoe from chiberoon the socalled albert nyanza past uvira where the stream narrows and where a pilot is required to the arab dépôt ujiji he described the northern portion of the tanganyika as varying much in breadth immensely wide beyond vacovia and again contracting at uvira his report was confirmed by a msawahíli sent by king mtesa with whom he had lived many years to communicate with baker pasha at fatiko this man knew both uvira and ujiji which he called uyiyi nothing can be more substantial than this double testimony which wears all the semblance of truth  on the other hand lieut cameron whose admirable work has so to speak reconstructed the tanganyika lake discovered on the 3rd of may 1874 the lukuga river which he supposes to form the outlet it lies 25 direct miles to the south of the kasenge archipelago numbering seventeen isles visited by captain speke in march 1857 dr livingstone touched here on july 13 1869 and heard nothing of the outlet he describes a current sweeping round kasenge to southeast or southwards according to the wind and carrying trees at the rate of a knot an hour but mr stanley pp 400 et passim agrees with dr krapf who made a large river issue from the lake westwards and who proposed by following its course to reach the atlantic the discoverer of livingstone evidently inclines to believe that the tanganyika drains through the caverns of kabogo near uguhha and he records the information of native travellers that kabogo is a great mountain on the other side of the tanganyika full of deep holes into which the water rolls moreover that at the distance of over a hundred miles he himself heard the sound of the thundering surf which is said to roll into the caves of kabogoin his map he cutely avoids inserting anything beyond kabogo mountains 6000 to 7000 feet high  the gallant young naval lieutenants exploration of the lukuga has not yet reached us in a satisfactory form he found the current sluggishly flowing at the rate of 12 knots per hour he followed it for four or five miles and he was stopped by floating grass and enormous rushes papyri a friendly chief told him that the lukuga feeds the lualaba which beyond nyangwe livingstones furthest point in about south latitude 4° takes the name of ugarowwa an arab had descended this stream fifty five marches and reached a place where there were ships and white merchants who traded largely in palmoil and ivory both rare on the congo river and unfortunately the name river congo was also mentioned a term utterly unknown except to the few portuguesespeaking natives  at present therefore we must reserve judgment and the only conclusion to which the unprofessional reader would come is that the weight of authority is in favour of a double issue for the tanganyika north and west  the wilful misrepresentation is couched in these words the reports obtained by livingstone are if anything favourable to the unity of the victoria nyanza ukerewe ukara because along with it he names only such lakes as were already known to have a separate existence from it as several were recognized ergo it is one dr livingstone heard from independent sources that the socalled victoria nyanza is a lake region not a lake his account of the okara ukara and the three or four waters run into a single huge sheet is substantially the same as that which after a study of the rev mr wakefields reports i offered to the royal geographical society and which i subsequently published in zanzibar city island and coast you dr behm are apparently satisfied with a lake drained by an inverted delta of halfadozen issuesi am not nor can i agree with you that whether the victoria nyanza is one lake or several is a point of detail of less importance when it has disfigured the best maps of africa for nearly a score of years the last intelligence concerning the unity of the lake is from colonel c c long a staffofficer in the service of his highness the khedive who was sent by colonel gordon on a friendly mission to king mtesa of uganda with permission to descend murchison creek and to view lake victoria nyanza colonel long after a march of three hours took boat he sounded the waters of the lake and found a depth of from 25 to 35 feet in clear weather the opposite shore was visible appearing to an unnautical eye from 12 to 15 miles distant nor could this estimate be greatly wrong after much negotiation and opposition he obtained leave to return to egyptian territory by water and on the way in north latitude 1° 30 he discovered a second lake or large basin at least 20 to 25 miles wide the geography is somewhat hazy but the assertions are not to be mistaken  finally i read with regret such statements as the following made by so wellknown a geographer as yourself spekes views have been splendidly confirmed the attacks of his opponents especially of burton who was most inimically inclined to him collapse into nothing this unwarrantable style of assertion might be expected from the mittheilungen but it is not honourable to a man of science there are you well know three main points of difference between the late captain speke and myself the first is the horseshoe of mountains blocking up the northern end of the tanganyika this after a dozen years i succeeded in abolishing the second is the existence of the victoria nyanza which i assert to be a lake region not a lake it is far from being a point of detail and i hope presently to see it follow the way of the horseshoe thirdly is the drainage of the tanganyika which captain speke threw southward to the zambeze a theory now universally abandoned this may be your view of splendid confirmationi venture to think that it will not be accepted by the geographical world                                chapter xi                        life at banza nokki    i was now duly established with my books and instruments at nkaye

annuals were nearly dried up the pictorial effects were those of            autumn laying here and there            a fiery finger on the leaves  yet with factotum selims assistance i managed to collect some 490 specimens within the fortnight we had not the good fortune of the late dr welwitsch welwitschia mirabilis but there is still a copious treasure left for those who visit the congo river in the right season  i was delighted with the country a counterpart of the usumbara hills in eastern africa disposed upon nearly the same parallel the cacimbo season corresponded with the harmattan north of the line still grey mornings and covered rainless noons so distasteful to the expedition which complained that from four to five days together it could not obtain an altitude the curious contrast in a region of evergreens was not wanting the varied tintage of winter on one tree and upon another the brightest hues of budding spring the fair land of grass and flowers rough but beautiful of shrubberypath and dense mottes or copse islets with clear fountains bubbling from the rocks adorned by noble glimpses of the lakelike river and of a blue horizon which suggested the oceanever one of the most attractive points in an african landscapewas easily invested by the eye of fancy with gold and emerald and steely azure from above whilst the blue masses of bare mountain thrown against a cloudless sky towered over the blackgreen sea of vegetation at their base like icebergs rising from the bosom of the atlantic  as in the brazilian rio de são francisco the few miles

portals of the sierra del crystalthe vine will flourish the soil will produce the cereals as well as the fruits and vegetables of europe and this region will become one of the paradises of africa  the banzas of congoland show the constitution of native society which as in syria and indeed in most barbarous and semi barbarous places is drawn together less by reciprocal wants than by the ties of blood here families cannot disperse and thus each hamlet is a single house with its patriarch for president and judge when the population outgrows certain limits instead of being confounded with its neighbours it adds a settlement upon neighbouring ground and removal is the work of a single day the towns are merely big villages whose streets are labyrinths of narrow pathways often grassgrown because each man builds in his own way some translate the word banza by city unaware that central african people do not build cities professor smith rightly explains it a village which with them means a paterfamilias and his private dependants so the maligned douville i 159on donne le nom de banza à la ville ou réside le chef dune peuplade ou nation nègre on lattribue aussi à lenceinte que le chef

there are not less than twelve villages with a total perhaps of 2400 souls  banza nkaye as usual uninclosed contains some forty habitations which may lodge two hundred head the tenements are built upon platforms cut out of the hill slopes and the make proves that even during the rains there is little to complain of climate ten of these huts belong to royalty which lives upon the lowest plane and each wife has her own abode whilst the senzallas of the slaves cluster outside the foundation is slightly raised to prevent flooding the superstructure strikes most travellers as having somewhat the look of a châlet although proyart compares it with a large basket turned upside down two strong uprights firmly planted support on their forked ends a long strutbeam tightly secured the eaves are broad to throw off the rain and the neat thatch of grass laid with points upwards in regular courses and kept in site by bamboo strips is renewed before the stormy season the roof and walls are composed of six screens they are made upon the ground often occupying months and they can be put together in a few minutes the material which an old traveller says is of leaves interwoven not contemptibly with one another is a grass growing everywhere on the hills plaited and attached to strips of cane or bamboo palm raphia vinifera the gable walls are often a cheque pattern produced by twining tietie monkey rope or creepers stained black round the dullyellow groundwork and one end is pierced for a doorway that must not front the winds and rains it is a small square hole keeping the interior dark and cool and the defence is a screen of canework fastened with a rude wooden latch the flooring is hard tamped clay in the centre of which the fire is laid the cooking however is confined to the broad eaves or to the compound which surrounded with neat walls backs the house the interior is divided into the usual but and ben the latter communicates with the former by a passage masked with a reed screen it is the sleepingplace and the storeroom and there is generally a second wicket for timely escape the only furniture consists of mats calabashes and a standing bedstead of rude construction or a bamboo cot like those built at lagosin fact the four bare walls suggest penury but in the small countries as the landward towns are called where the raid and the foray are not feared the householder entrusts to some faithful slave large stores of cloth and rum of arms and gunpowder  the abodes suggest those of our semibarbarous ancestors as described by holingshed where earth mixed with lime formed the floor where the fire was laid to the wall where the smoke which besides hardening timber was expected to keep the good man and his family from quake and fever curled from the door and where the bed was a straw pallet with a log of wood for a pillow but the congoese is better lodged than we were before the days of queen elizabeth what are luxuries in the north broad beds and deep armchairs would here be far less comfortable than the mats which serve for all purposes i soon civilized my hut with a divan the hindostani chabutarah the spanish estrada the mud

white the large teeth are of good shape and colour extensive tattoos appear on breasts backs and shoulders the wearers are generally slaves also known by scantier clothing by darker skins and by a wilder expression of countenance during their country nursing the children run about wholly nude except the coating of red wood applied by the mothers or the dust gathered from the ground i could not hear of the weaning custom mentioned by merolla the father lifting the child by the arm and holding him for a time hanging in the air falsely believing that by those means he will become more strong

but it is carried to the fore like a toucans crest some by way of coquetterie trace upon the scalp a complicated network showing the finest and narrowest lines of black wool and pale skin so the old traveller tells us the heads of those who aspire to glory in apparel resemble a parterre you see alleys and figures traced on them with a great deal of ingenuity the bosom elaborately bound downwards

mwanangambe labouring people or wantu slaves  the missionaries found a regular system of handfasting their neophytes did not approve of marriage in facie ecclesiæ for they must first be satisfied whether their wife will have children whether she will be diligent in her daily labour and lastly whether she will prove obedient before they will marry her if they find her faulty in any of these points they immediately send her back again to her parents the woman not being looked upon the worse for being returned into stores soon afterwards underwent another trial perhaps with success converts were fined nine crowns for such irregularities but oh exclaims a good father what pains do we take to bring them to marry the lover and how many ridiculous arguments and reasons do they bring to excuse themselves from this duty and restraint he tells us how he refused absolution to a dying woman unless she compelled her daughter to marry a man with whom she was living upon trial the mother answered wisely enough father i will never give my daughter cause to curse me after i am dead by obliging her to wedlock where she does not fancy whereupon the priest replied what do you not stand more in awe of a temporal than an eternal curse and working upon the feelings of the girl who began to tremble and to weep extorted from her a promise to accept the feigned husband he adds notwithstanding this some obstinate mothers have rather chosen to die unconfessed than to concern themselves with the marriage of their daughters being obliged to attend communion at easter these temporary couples would part on the first day of lent obtain absolution and a week afterwards either cohabit once more or find otherpartners the indiscreet method of courtship popularly known as bundling here existed and was found by caillié amongst the southern moors when everybody is at rest the man creeps into his intendeds tent and remains with her till daybreak  an energetic attempt was made to abolish polygamy which instead of diminishing population as some sciolists pretend caused the country to swarm like maritime china father carli who also dilates upon the evil practice of the sexes living together on trial ca didly owns that his main difficulty lay in bringing the multitude to keep to one wife they being wholly averse to that law yet old travellers declare that when the missionaries succeeded the people lived so christianlike and lovingly together that the wife would suffer herself to be cut to pieces rather than deceive her husband merolla indeed enlarges on the constancy of women whether white or black when lawfully married to their mates and praises them for living together in all manner of love and amity hence may be learned what a propensity the women have to chastity in these parts many of whom meet together on the first day of lent and oblige themselves under pain of severe penance to a strict continence till easter in case of adultery the husband could divorce the wife he was generally satisfied by her begging his pardon and by taking a slave from the lover widowed countesses proved guilty of immorality suffered death by fire or sword on the other hand the princess had a right to choose her husband but as in persia the day of his splendid wedding was the last of his liberty he became a prisoner and a slave he was surrounded by spies he was preceded by guards out of doors and at the least écart his head was chopped off and his paramour was sold these ladies amply revenged the servitude of their sex             asperius nihil est humili cum surgit in altum  rich women were allowed to support quasihusbands until they became mothers and the slaves of course lived together without marriage since the days of the expedition a change for the better has come over the gentil sesso the traveller is no longer in the dilemma of frère jean and except at the rivermouth and at the adjacent villages there is none of that officious complaisance which characterizes every hamlet in the gaboon country the men appear peculiarly jealous and the women fearful of the white face whenever we approached a feminine group it would start up and run away if cooking groundnuts the boldest would place a little heap upon the bottom of an upturned basket push it towards us and wave us off the lowest orders will submit to a kind of marriage for four fathoms of cloth exactly double the tariff paid in tuckeys time pp 171181 and this ratio will apply to all other articles of living amongst themselves nubile girls are not remarkably strict but as matrons they are rigid the adulterer is now punished by a heavy fine and if he cannot pay his death as on many parts of the southern coast is lawful to the husband  the life is regular and society is simple and patriarchal as amongst the iroquois and mohawks or in the shetlands two centuries ago the only excitement a fight or a slave hunt is now become very rare yet i can hardly lay down the curriculum vitae as longer than fiftyfive years and there are few signs of great age merolla declares the women to be longerlived than the men gidi mavunga who told me that the congo expedition visited their banza when his mother was a child can hardly be fortyfive as his eldest son shows and yet he looks sixty the people rise at dawn and stirring up the fire light the cachimbos or large clay pipes which are rarely out of their mouths tobacco nsunza grows everywhere and when rudely cured it is sold in ringlets or twisted leaves it is never snuffed and the only chaw is the mákázo or kola nut which grows all over these hills of these i bought 200 for 100 coloured porcelain beads probably paying treble the usual price no food is eaten at dawn a bad practice which has extended to the brazil and the argentine republic but if a dram be procurable it is taken por la manana the slavewomen often escorted by one of the wives and accompanied by the small girls who must learn to work whilst their brothers are idling with their rattles set out with water pots balanced on their astrachan wool or with baskets for grain and firewood slung by a headstrap to the back the freeborn remain at home bathing and anointing with palmoil which renders the skin smooth and supple but leaves a peculiar aroma they are mostly cross enough till they have thoroughly shaken off sleep and the morning generally begins with scolding the slaves or a family wrangle i have seen something of the kind in europe  visiting chatting and strolling from place to place lead to the substantial breakfast or first dinner between 9 and 10 am meat rarely appears river fish fresh or sundried is the usual kitchen eaten with manioc toasted maize and peeled roasted and scraped plantain vegetables and palmoil obtained by squeezing the nut in the hands are the staple dish and beans are looked upon rather as slaves food they have no rice and no form of daily bread i happened to take with me a few boxes of twicebaked and this mbolo was the object of every chiefs ambition coleworts are noticed by merolla as a missionary importation he tells us that they produce no seed and are propagated by planting the sprouts which grow to a great height the greens cabbages spinach and french beans mentioned by tuckey have been allowed to die out tea coffee sugar and all such exotics are unappreciated if not unknown chillies which grow wild enter into every dish and the salt of native manufacture brown and earthy is bought in little baskets  between breakfast and midday there is a mighty drink the palm wine here called msámbá and on the lower river manjewa is not brought in at dawn or it would be better the endogen in general use is the elais which is considered to supply a better and more delicate liquor than the raphia the people do not fell the tree like the krumen but prefer the hoop of supplejack affected by the natives of fernando po and camarones a leaf folded funnelwise and inserted as usual in the lowest part of the frond before the fruit forms conveys the juice into the calabashes often three which hang below the crown and the daily produce may be ten quarts on the first day of tapping the sap is too sweet it is best during the following week and when it becomes tart no more must be drawn or the tree will be injured it cannot be kept acetous fermentation sets in at once and presently it coagulates and corrupts at banana and boma it is particularly good at porto da lenha it is half water but the agents dare not complain for the reason which prevents them offering spliced grog to the prepotent negro europeans enjoy the taste but dislike the smell of palmwine those in whom it causes flatulence should avoid it but where it agrees it is a pleasant stimulant pectoral refreshing and clearing the primæ vice mixed with wine or spirits it becomes highly intoxicating the rude beers called by merolla guallo and by tuckey p 120 baamboo the oualo of douville and the pombeof east africa mentioned by almost every traveller are not now found on the lower river  about noon the slaves return from handling their trowelshaped iron hoes and the gentleman takes a siesta proportioned to his drink the poorer classes sit at home weaving spinning or threading beads whilst the wives attend to household work prepare the meals buy and sell dig and delve europeans often pity the sex thus doomed to perform the most laborious drudgery but it is a waste of sentiment the women are more accustomed to labour in all senses of the word and the result is that they equal their mates in strength and stature they enjoy robust health and their children born without difficulty are sturdy and vigorous the same was the case amongst the primitive tribes of europe zamacola anthrop mem ii 38 assures us that the basque women were physically powerful as the men with whom they engaged in prizefights  the master awakes about 3 pm and smokes visits plays with his children and dawdles away his time till the cool sunset when a second edition of the first meal is served up if there be neither dance nor festival all then retire to their bens light the fire and sit smoking tobacco or bhang with frequent interruptions of palm wine or rum till joined by their partners douville ii 113 says that the pangué or chanvre croît naturellement dans lepays i believe the questions to be still sub judice whether the intoxicating cannabis be or be not indigenous to africa as well as to asia and whether smoking was not known in the old world as it certainly was in the new before tobacco was introduced the cannabis indica was the original anæsthetic known to the arabs and to civilized orientals many centuries before the west invented ether and chloroform  our landlord has two wives but one is a mother and will not rejoin him till her child can carry a calabash of water unaided to avoid exciting jealousy he lives in a hut apart surrounded by seven or eight slaves almost all of them young girls this regular life is varied by a little extra exertion at seedtime and harvest by attending the various quitandas or markets of the country side and by an occasional trip to town boma when the bush is burning all sally out with guns clubs and dogs to bring home beef and thus they dwell in the presence of their brethren thinking little of today and literally following the precept take no thought for the morrow as the old missioners testify they have happy memories their tempers are mild and quarrels rarely lead to blows they are covetous but not miserly they share what they have and they apply the term closefist to the european who gives nuffin for nuffin  the most superstitious of men they combine the two extremes of belief and unbelief they have the firmest conviction in their own tenets whilst those of others flow off their minds like water from a greased surface the catholic missioners laboured amongst them for nearly two hundred years some of these ecclesiastics were ignorant and bigoted as those whom we still meet on the west african coast but not a few were earnest and energetic scrupulous and conscientious able and learned as the best of our modern day all did not hurry over their superficial tasks like the neapolitan father jerome da montesarchio who baptized 100000 souls and others who sprinkled children till their arms were tired many lived for years in the country learning the language and identifying themselves with their flocks yet the most they ever effected was to make their acolytes resemble the assyrians whom shalmaneser transplanted to assyria who feared the lord and served their graven images 2 kings xvii 3341 their only traces are the word deus foully perverted like the chinese joss and an occasional crucifix which is called cousa de brancowhite mans thing tuckey was justified in observing at nokki that the crucifixes left by missioners were strangely mixed with native fetishes and that the people seemed by no means improved by the muddle of christian and pagan idolatry  the system is at once complicated and unsettled there is apparently the sensus numinis the vague deity being known as nzambi or njambi which the missionaries translated into god as nganna zambilord zambi merolla uses zambiabungù and in the vocabulary zabiambunco for the spirit above zambianpungo battel tells us that the king of loango was called sambee and pango which mean god the abbé proyart terms the supreme zambi and applies zambianpongou to a species of malady brought on by perjury he also notices the manichæan idea of zambianbi or badgod drawing the fine distinction of european belief in a deity supremely good who permits evil without participating in it but the dualism of moral light and darkness noticed by all travellersfn25 is a bonâ fide existence with africans and the missionaries converted the angolan cariapemba into the aryosemitic devil  zambi is the anyambia of the gaboon country a vox et præterea nihil dr livingstone first expedition p 641 finds the word general amongst the balonda or people of lunda with the cazembes the word is pambi or liza and o muata cazembe p 297 mentions the proverb ao pambi e ao mambi the king nada iguala in the vocabulario da lingua cafrial we see p 469 that murungo means god or thunder it is the rudimental idea of the great zeus which the greeks worked out the god of Æther the eternal omnipotent and omniscient who was who is and who is to come the unknown and unknowable concerning whom st paul quoted aristæus on mars hill but the african brain naturally confused it with a something gross and material thus nzambianpungu is especially the lightning god cariambemba is properly kadi mpemba or ntangwa the being that slays mankind merolla describes it as an abominable idol and the word is also applied to the owl here as in dahome the object of superstition i could trace no sign of worship paid to the sun tangwa or muinyi but there are multitudes of minor gods probably deified ghosts haunting particular places thus simbi presides over villages and the tadi nzazhi or lightning rock near boma whilst the yellala is the abode of an evil being which must be propitiated by offerings as usual amongst fetish worshippers the only trace of belief in a future state is faith in revenantsreturning men or ghosts  each village has an idol under a little wallless roof apparently an earthern pot of grease and feathers called mavunga this may be the ovengwa of the camma people a terrible catcher and eater of men a vampire of the dead personal whilst the ibamba are indistinct tall as a tree wandering through the woods ever winking whereas the greek immortals were known by their motionless eyelids ngolo wanga is a manshaped figure of unpainted wood kept in the hut every house is stuck inside and outside with idols and fetishes interpreters of the deity each having its own jurisdiction over lightning wind and rain some act as scarecrows others teach magic avert evils preserve health and sight protect cattle and command fish in the sea or river they are in all manner of shapes strings of mucuna and poisonbeans carved images stuck over with feathers and tassels padlocks with a cowrie or a mirror set in them horns full of mysterious medicine iron tipped poles bones birds beaks and talons skins of snakes and leopards and so forth we shall meet them again upon our travels  no man walks abroad without his protecting charms nkisi or nkizi the monda of the gaboon slung en baudrier or hanging from his shoulder the portable fetish of our host is named báká chyá mázínga professor smith p 323 makes mázengá to be fetishes for the detection of theft these magicæ vanitates are prophylactics against every evil to which mans frailty is heir the missioners were careful not to let their congo converts have anything from their bodies like hair or nail parings for fear lest it be turned to superstitious use and a beard the price of conversion was refused to the king of micocco like the idols these talismans avert ill luck bachelorhood childlessness poverty and ill health they are equally powerful against the machinations of foes natural or supernatural against wild beasts the crocodile the snake and the leopard and against wounds of lead and steel they can produce transformation destroy enemies cause rain or drought fine or foul weather raise and humble enrich and impoverish countries and above all things they are sovereign to make man brave in battle shortly before we entered banza nkaye a propitiation of the tutelary gods took place coxswain deane had fired an enfield and the report throughout the settlement was that our guns would kill from the riverbank  the nganga of congoland the mganga of the wasawahili and the uganga of the gaboon exactly corresponds with m michelets sorcière of the middle ages physicienne that is doctor for the people and poisoner we cannot however apply in africa the adage of louis xiiis day to one wizard ten thousand witches in the muata cazembe pp 57 et passim we read o ganga or o surjão the magician is there called muroi which like fite is also applied to magic the abbé proyart opines of his professional brother he is ignorant as the rest of the people but a greater roguea pregnant saying yet here the man of two worlds is not lhomme de révolution and he suffices for the small spiritual wants of his flock he has charge of the kizila the chigella of merolla and the quistilla of james barbotanglicè putting things in fetish which corresponds with the tahitian tapu or taboo the african idea is that he who touches the article for instance gold on the eastern coast of guinea will inevitably come to grief when fetish is taken off as by the seller of palm wine who tastes it in presence of the buyer the precaution is evidently against poison many of these kizila are selfimposed for instance a water melon may never enter banza nokki and though slaves may eat bananas upon a journey the master may not others refuse the flesh of a fowl until it has been tasted by a woman these rules are delivered to the young either by the fetishman or the parents and when broken they lead to death doubtless often the consequence of strong belief the nganga superintends as grand inquisitor the witchordeal by causing the accused to chew redwood and other drugs in this land ferax venenorum park was right by witchcraft is meant pretended magic affecting the lives and healths of persons in other words it is the administering of poison european narratives of sorcery and magic exactly explain the african idea except in one point there the witch only suffered from not being able to prove to satan how much she burned to suffer for his sake here she has no satan both european and african are the firmest believers in their own powers they often confess although knowing that the confession leads directly to torture and death with all the diabolical ingenuity of which either race was capable in tuckeys time a bargain was concluded by breaking a leaf or a blade of grass and this rite it was found necessary to perform with the seller of every fowl apparently it is now obsolete finally although the fetish man may be wrong the fetish cannot err if a contretemps occur a reason will surely be found and should the doctor die he has fallen a victim to a rival or an enemy more powerful than himself  a striking institution of the congo region is that of the jinkemba which curious to say is unnoticed by tuckey it is not however peculiar to the congo it is the semo of the susus or soosoos of the windward coast and the purrah of the sherbroballoms or bulloms rendered anglicè by freemasonry the novitiate there lasts for seven or eight years and whilst the boys live in the woods food is placed for them by their relations the initiation indeed appears to be especially severe here all the freeborn males are subjected to the wrongly called mosaic rite merolla tells us that the wizards circumcise children on the eighth day like the jews not out of regard for the law but with some wicked end and purpose of their own at any time between the ages of five and fifteen eight to ten being generally preferred boys are taken from their parents which must be an exceeding comfort to the latter and for a native year which is half of ours they must dwell in the vivála ya ankimba or casa de feitiço like that which we passed before reaching banza nokki they are now instructed by the nganga in the practices of their intricate creed they are taught the mysteries under solemn oaths and in fine they are prepared for marriage upon the congo they must eat no cooked food living wholly upon roots and edibles but they are allowed to enter the villages for provisions and here they often appear armed with matchets bayonets and wooden swords their faces and necks bodies and arms are ghastly white with chalk or ashes the hair is left in its original jet and the dingy lower limbs contrast violently with the ghostlike absence of colour above the dress is a crinoline of palmfronds some fresh and green others sere and brown a band of strong midrib like a yellow hoop passed round the waist spreads out the petticoat like a farthingale and the ragged ends depend to the knees sometimes it is worn under the axillae but in all cases the chalked arms must be outside the favourite attitude is that of the rhodian colossus with the elbows bent to the fore and the hands clasped behind the head to increase their prestige of terror the jinkomba abjure the use of human language and meeting a stranger ejaculate with all their might hárrrrrrrrr and jojolo jojolo words mystic and meaningless when walking in procession they warn the profane out of the way by striking one slip of wood upon another they are wilder in appearance than the hindu jogi or sanyasi who also affects the use of ashes but neglects that of the palmthatch it is certainly enough to startle a man of impressible nerves one for instance who cannot enter a room without a sidelong glance at an unexpected coffinto see these hideous beings starting with their savage cry from the depths of an african forest evidently also such is the intention of the costume  contrasting the congoese with the goanese we obtain a measure of difference between the african and the asiatic both were portuguese colonies founded about the same time and under very similar circumstances both were catechized and christianized in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries both had governors and palaces bishops and cathedrals educational establishments and a large staff of missioners but asia was not so inimical mentally or bodily to the european frame as africa the goanese throve after a fashion the mixed breed became the staple population and thus it continues till this day on the other hand the hamitic element so completely asserted its superiority over insititious japheth that almost every trace has disappeared in a couple of centuries there lingers it is true amongst the congoese of the coastregions a something derived from the olden age still distinguishing them from the wild people of the interior and at times they break out naturally in the tongue of their conquerors but it requires a practised eye to mark these minutiae  the congoese are passably brave amongst themselves crafty and confined in their views they carry knowledge of life as far as it is required and their ceremonious intercourse is remarkable and complicated they have relapsed into the analphabetic state of their ancestors they are great at eloquence and though without our poetical forms they have a variety of songs upon all subjects and they improvise panegyrics in honour of chiefs and guests their dances have been copied in europe without ever inventing the modes of the greeks which are still preserved by the hindoos they have an original music dealing in harmony rather than in tune and there are motives of course all in the minor key which might be utilized by advanced peoples these sons of nature would especially supply material for that recitative which verdi first made something better than a vehicle for dialogue hence the old missioners are divided in opinion whilst some find the sound of the little guitar with strings of palmthread and played with the thumbs of both hands very low but not ungrateful others speak of the hellish harmony of their neophytes bands the instrument alluded to is the nsambi or nchambi four strings are attached to bent sticks springing from the box it is the wambi of the shekyanis du chaillu chap xii but the bridge like that of our violin gives it an evident superiority and great care and labour are required in the maker  this form of the universal marimba is a soundingboard of light wood measuring eight inches by five some eight to eleven iron keys flat strips of thin metal pass over an upright bamboo bridge fixed by thongs to the body and rest at the further end upon a piece of skin which prevents twanging the tocador or performer brings out soft and pleasing tones with the sides of the thumbs and fingers they have drums and the belllike cymbals called chingufu m valdez ii 221 et passim writes clincufo which he has taken from a misprint in monteiro and gamitto the chingufu of east africa is a hollow box performed upon with a drumstick of caoutchouc the pipes are wooden tubes with sundry holes and a bridge below the mouthpiece they are played over edge like our flutes the hellish harmonies mostly result from an improvised band one strumming the guitar another clapping the sticks and the third beating the bellshaped irons that act as castanets  the language of the people on and near the congo river is called fiote a term used by old travellers to denote a black man as opposed to mundele white and also applied to things as bondefiote or black baft james barbot p 512 gives specimens of some thirtythree words and the numerals in the angoy language spoken at cabinde which proves to be that of the river of these many are erroneous for instance nova to sleep kunúa sursu a hen nsusu while fina scarlet bayeta baize and fumu tobacco are corrupted portuguese a young lad muleche moleque father merollas molecchas a general name among the negroes for which douville prefers moleke masc and molecka fem is applied only to a slave and in this sense it has extended west of the atlantic in the numerals wale 2 should be kwále quina 4 kúyá and evona 9 iowá we may remark the pentenary system of the windward coast and the gaboon negroes eg 6 is sambano mose and tano 1  5 and 7 is sambwale mose and kwale and so forth whilst kumi 10 possibly derived from neighbouring races belongs to the decimal system  the first attempt at a regular vocabulary was made by douville vol iii p 261 vocabidaire de la langue mogialoua et des deux dialectcs principaux abunda angolan et congo fiote it is also very incorrect the best is that published in appendix no i to the congo expedition under the name of embomma we may quote the authors final remark this vocabulary i do not consider to be free from mistakes which i cannot now find time to discover all the objects of the senses are however correct m parrot showed me a ms left at banana point by a french medical officer but little could be said in its praise monteiro and gamitto pp 479480 give seventeen conguez words and the congo numerals as opposed to the bundo  the fiote is a member of the great south african family some missionaries argued from its beauty and richness that it had formerly been written but of this there is no proof m malte brun supposes the congoese dialects to indicate a meditative genius foreign to the habitual condition of these people ignoring the fact that the most complicated and laborious tongues are those of barbarous nations whilst modern civilization in variably labours to simplify it is copious every place tree shrub or plant used by the people has its proper name it is harmonious and pleasing abounding in vowels and liquids destitute of gutturals and sparing in aspirates and other harsh consonants at the same time like the rest of the family it is clumsy and unwieldy whilst immense prolixity and frequent repetition must develope the finer shades of meaning its peculiarity is a greater resemblance to the zanzibarian kisawahili than any tongue known to me on the western coast often a question asked by the guide as njia hápá is this the road and jina lako nani whats your name was perfectly intelligible to methe latter is a fair specimen of the peculiar euphony which i have noticed in zanzibar vol i chap x we should expect jina jako whereas this would offend the native ear it requires a scholarlike knowledge of the tongue to apply the curious process correctly and the selfsufficient critic should beware how he attempts to correct quotations from the native languages  i need hardly say that the speakers are foulmouthed as the angloafrican of sa leone and the english coast they borrow the vilest words from foreign tongues a spade is called a spade with a witness and feminine relatives are ever the subject of abuse a practice which beginning in europe with the slav race extends more or less throughout the old world i specify the old world because the socalled indians of north and south america apparently ignore the habit except where they have learned it from southern europe finally cursing takes the place of swearing the latter being confined i believe to the scandinavians the teutons and their allied races  nothing can be more unpleasant than the portuguese spoken by the congoman he transposes the letters lacking the proper sounds in his own tongue for instance sinholo sinyolo is senhor munyele or minyele is mulher o luo stands in lieu of o rio the river rua of lua luna and so forth for to morrow you must use cedo as manhaa would not be understood and the prolixity of the native language is transferred to the foreign idiom for instance if you ask what do you call this thing the paraphrase to be intelligible would be the white man calls this thing soandso what does the fiote call this thing sixteen words for six i have elsewhere remarked how englishmen make themselves unintelligible by transferring to hindostani and other asiatic tongues the conciseness of their own idiom in which as much is understood as is expressed we can well understand the outraged feelings with which poor father cannecattim heard his sermons travestied by the abundo negroes do paiz or linguists the effect of which was to make him compose his laborious dictionary in angolan latin and portuguese his wrath in reflecting upon estos homems ou estos brutos drives the ecclesiastic to imitate the illconditioned layman who habitually addresses his slave as o bruto o burro o bicho o diabo when he does not apply the more injurious native terms as konongwako and vendengwandi it is only fair to confess that no race is harsher in its language and manners to its black brethren than the liberated africans of the english settlements  at banza nokki i saw the first specimen of a mundongo slave girl the tribe is confounded with the mandingo mandenga moslems by the author of the introduction to tuckeys journey p ixxxi by tuckey p 141 who also calls them mandonzo p 135 and by prof smith p 315 but not by the accurate marsden p 389 she described her tribe as living inland to the east and north east of the congo peoples distant two moonsa detail of course not to be depended upon i afterwards met many of these captives who declared that they had been sold after defeats a fine tall race one is equal to two congo men and the boldness of demeanour in both sexes distinguishes them from other serviles apparently under this name there are several tribes inhabiting lands of various elevations some are coloured café au lait as if born in a high and healthy region others are almost jet black with the hair frightfully wispy like a mop generally the head is bulletshaped the face round the features negroid not negro and the hands and feet large but not ill shaped some again have the hausa mark threadlike perpendicular cuts from the zygomatic arches running parallel with the chin in other cases the stigmata are broad beautyslashes drawn transversely across the cheeks to the jawbone and forming with the vertical axis an angle of 45° all are exceedingly fond of meat and like the krumen will devour it semiputrified the congoese declare them to be papagentes cannibals a term generally applied by the more advanced to the bushmen living beyond their frontier and useful to deter travellers and runaways they themselves declare that they eat the slain only after a battlethe sentimental form of anthropophagy the slave girl produced on this occasion was told to sing after receiving some beads without which she would not open her lips we were treated to a criard performance which reminded me of the heavenly muse in the lake regions of central africa  the neighbours of the mundonoros are the mubangos the muyanji muyanzi and the mijolo by some called mijere possibly tuckey alludes to the mijolos when he tells us p 141 that the mandingo slave whom he bought on the upper river called his country mintolo i have seen specimens of the three who are so similar in appearance that a stranger distinguishes them only by the tattoo no 1 gashes a line from the root of the hair to the commissure of the nose no 2 has a patch of cuts five in length and three in depth extending from the bend of the eye brow across the zygomata to the ear and no 3 wears cuts across the forehead i was shown a sword belonging to the mijolo all declared that it is of native make yet it irresistibly suggested the old twohanded weapon of europe preserved by the bedawin and the eastern arabs who now mostly derive it from sollingen the long straight flexible and doubleedged blade is neatly mounted by the tang in a handle with a pommel or terminating knob of ivory others prefer wood the guard is very peculiar a thin bar of iron springing from the junction of blade and grip forming an open oval below and prolonged upwards and downwards in two branches parallel with the handle and protecting the hand they dance brandishing this weapon according to the slaves in the presence of their princes  i inquired vainly about the anzicos anzichi anzigui anzigi or anziki whose king makoko the ruler of thirteen kingdoms was placed by dapper northwest of monemugi unyamwezi and whom pigafetta p 79 located close to the congo and near his northern lake it is true that there are two lakes not however lying east and west ptolemys system but north and south of each other and about 400 miles asunder the first is in south latitude 12° the nile issuing from it does not according to odoardo duarte lopez sink in the earth nor conceal itself but after flowing northwards it enters the second lake which is 220 miles in extent and is called by the natives a sea if the tanganyika shall be found to connect with the luta nzige or mwutan lake this passage will be found wonderfully truthful the tanganyikas southern versant is now placed in south latitude 8° 46 54 or in round numbers 9° and the other figures are nearly as correct james barbot causes these anzikos to wander almost through all africa from nubia to the congo like negro bedawin or scythians the common food was mans flesh fattened for the market and eaten by the relatives even of those who died diseased their capital monsol was built by danville close to the equator in the very centre of africa east longitude greenwich 26° 20 hard by douvilles yanvo and the opener of inner africa in 1852 pp 3 4 69 with equal correctness caused them to occupy the hills opposite to sundi and extending downwards to emboma below the falls  mr cooley ocean highways june 1873 now explains the word as anzico people not of the country barbarians bushmen this kind of information derived from a superficial knowledge of an angolan vocabulary is peculiarly valueless i doubt that a negative can thus be suffixed to a genitive the name may simply have been anziko man of the backsettlement in 1832 mr cooley writes the nation of the anziko or ngeco in 1845 the anziki north of congo in 1852 the micoco or king of the anzikound so weiter what can we make of this geographical proteus the first congo expedition who covered all the ground where the creator of the great central sea places the anzikos never heard of themnor will the second  not being then so well convinced of the nonexistence of the giaghi giagas gagas or jagas as a nation i inquired as vainly for those terrible cannibals who had gone the way of all the anzikos according to lopez battel merolla and others they consider human flesh as the most delicious food and goblets of warm blood as the most exquisite beverage this act on the part of savage warriors might have been a show of mere bravado but i cannot agree with the editor of tuckeys narrative from the character and disposition of the native african it may fairly be doubted whether throughout the whole of this great continent a negro cannibal has any existence the year 1816 was the augustan age of outrageous negrophilism and equally extreme anti napoleonism if a french general introduction p i brutally seized the person and papers of a british naval officer on his return from a voyage of discovery who i would ask plundered and destroyed the fine botanical collection made at risk of health and life during fifteen months of hard labour by the learned palisot de beauvois author of the flore doware the reviewer of douville p 177 as sensibly declares that cannibalism has hitherto continually retired before the investigation of soberminded enlightened men when after a century or two of intercourse with white traders it still flourishes on the bonny and new calabar rivers  we are glad to be rid of the jagas a subject which has a small literature of its own the savage race appeared everywhere like a deus ex machina and it became to intertropical africa what the lost tribes were and even now are in some cases to asia and not rarely to europe even the sensible mr wilson west africa p 238 has no doubt of the jagas being the same people with the more modernly discovered pangwes fans and this is duly copied by m du chaillu chap viii m valdez ii 150 more sensibly records that the first jaga established in portuguese territory was called colaxingo kolashingo and that his descendants were named jagas like the egyptian pharaohs the roman ceesars the austrian kaisers and the russian czars he also reminds us p 150 that the chief of the bangalas inhabiting cassange  kasanjí was the jaga or ruler par excellence  early on the morning of september 11 i was aroused by a bob in the open before us we started up fearing that some death by accident had taken place the occasion proved on the contrary to be one of ushering into life the women were assembled in a ring round the mother and each howled with all the might of her lungs either to keep off some evil spirit or to drown the sufferers cries in some parts of africa the gold coast for instance it is considered infamous for a woman thus to betray her pain but here we are amongst a softer race                                chapter xii                    preparations for the march    gidi mavunga finding me in his power began like a thoroughbred african to raise obstacles we must pass through the lands of two kings the mfumo ma vivi bibbie of tuckey and the mfumu nkulu or nkuru cooloo the distance was short but it would occupy five days meaning a week before positively promising an escort he said it would be necessary to inspect my outfit i at once placed it in the old mans hands the better to say this is not mine ask gidi mavunga for it  my patience had been severely tried on first arrival at banza nokki from ruler to slave every one begged for cloth and rum till i learned to hate the names of these necessaries besides the five recognized kings of the district who wore black cloth coats all the petty chiefs of the neighbourhood flocked in importunate to share the spoils a tariff about onethird higher than at boma was set upon every article and if the most outrageous price was refused the seller assuming an insipid expression of countenance declared that great white men travelled with barrels not with bottles of aguardente and that without liberality it would be impossible to leave the village nsundi the settlement above the falls was a journey of two moons and none of the ten kings on the way would take less than nessudikiras dash congo grande as the people call são salvador was only four marches to the ese the road however was dangerous and an escort of at least fifty men would be necessary  but when i was upon the head of gidi mavunga matters changed for the better shortly after he took charge one tetu mayella king of neprat accompanied by some twenty followers entered the village with a view to the strangers rum by referring them to the new owner they perforce contented themselves after three hours parliamenting with a single bottle the ruler of nokki wanted besides gin and cloth a pair of shoes for his poor feet which looked clad in alligators skin i referred him to his father and he got little by that motion  on the evening of september 10 gidi mavunga who had been visiting his small country returned and declared himself ready to set out he placed before me ten heaps each of as many groundnuts and made me understand that for visiting nsundi and s salvador he would take fifty short pieces of cloth for himself and the same number for his slaves one moiety to be advanced before the first trip to the cataracts and the rest to follow for half my store of beads he undertook to ration his men a work which would have given us endless trouble as i agreed to all his conditions he promised to move on the next day without the least intention of carrying out any one of his conditions  these people are rich and not easily tempted to hard work during the french émigration the district of banza nokki drove slaves to the value of 60000 dollars per annum and the dollar is to the african the pound sterling of europe it is one of the hundred outstations which supplied the main dépôts boma and porto da lenha small parties went out at certain seasons provided with rum gunpowder and a little cloth and either bought the chattels or paid earnest money promising to settle the whole debt at their villages gidi mavunga like most of the elders was perfectly acquainted with the routes to nsundi s salvador and other frontier places where the bush people brought down their criminals and captives for barter beyond those points his information was all from hearsay  besides the large stores in their small countries the middle men have a multitude of retainers who may at any moment be converted into capital yet slave is a term hardly applicable to such chattels who as a rule are free as their lords they hold at their disposal all that the master possesses except his wives they sleep when they choose they work when they like they attend to their private affairs and if blamed or punished they either run away as at zanzibar to their own country or they take sanctuary with some neighbouring mfumo who despite the inevitable feud is bound by custom to protect them cold and hunger the torments of the poor in europe are absolutely unknown to them and their condition contrasts most favourably with the vassus and the servus of our feudal times their wives and children are their own the master cannot claim the tyrannous marriagerights of the baron no weddingdish is carried up to the castle nor is the eldest born accounted the son of the serfs lord for he perchance it was who begat him the brutality of slavery i must repeat is mainly the effect of civilization i shall never forget says captain boteler the impatient tosses of the head and angry looks displayed by a ladywhen the subject was canvassed a negro a paltry negro ever understand or conform to the social tie of wedlock no never never yet this lady was an englishwoman and when james barbots supercargo begins to examine his negroes like cattle he is begged for decencys sake to do it in a private place which shows these blacks are very modest it rather proved the whites to be the reverse  at 720 am on september 11 the moleques seized our luggage and we suddenly found ourselves on the path gidi mavunga wearing pagne and fetishbag and handling a thin stick in which two bulges had been cut led us out of banza nokki and took a ssw direction the uneven ground was covered with a bitter tomato nenga and with the shrub which according to herodotus bears wool instead of fruit i sent home specimens of this gossypium arboreum which everywhere grows wild and which is chiefly used for wicks there is scant hope of cottonculture amongst a people whose industry barely suffices for groundnuts the stiff clay soil everywhere showed traces of iron and the guide pointed out a palmtree which had been split by the electric fluid and a broad deep furrow several feet long ending in a hole the nzazhi lightning is as dangerous and as much dreaded on these hills as in uganda the southwest trade meets the land wind from the northeast strata of clouds in different states of electricity combine says the popular theory to produce the thunder and lightning which accompany rain like the storms upon the mountains of yemen after 30  150 miles we reached our destination banza chinguvu the headquarters of gidi mavunga as we entered it he pointed to a pot full of greasy stuff under a dwarf shed saying isso è meu deus it was in fact his baka chya mazinga beyond it stood the temple of nbambi two suspended pieces of wood cut in the shape of horns bore monkey skins on both sides of a dead armadillo an animal supposed to attract lightning when alive and to repel it after death  the banza was beautifully situated on a dwarf platform catching the full force of the seabreeze and commanding to the north west a picturesque glimpse of the                 waters rippling flowing            flashing along the valley to the sea  a mountain tarn representing the mighty stream on the right lay fields dotted with papawtrees and plantations of maize and manioc thur cajanus and sweet potatoes a vegetable now common but not noticed by tuckey on the left a deep ravine densely forested with noble growth and supplying the best of water divides it from tadi ja mfimo a pile of rock on the opposite hillside here lay the itombo village belonging to gidi mavungas eldest son beyond it the treeclad heights rolling away into the distance faded from bluebrown to the faintest azure hardly to be distinguished from the empyrean above the climate of these breezy uplands is superior even to that of banza nokki which lies some 170 feet lower and the nights are sensibly cooler  a few fathoms of altitude here make a surprising difference the little valleys with their chaletlike huts reminded me of the maroro and kisanga basins in the sister formation the east african ghats but now we have a hillclimate without ague and fever our parallel is that of yorukan abokuta where the people are antioeci both being about 6° distant from the line those north these south there the bush is fetid and the clammy air gives a sense of deadly depression here the atmosphere is pure the land is open and there is enjoyment in the mere sense of life the effete matter in the blood and the fatty degeneration of the muscles the results of inactivity imperfect respiration and f po were soon consumed by the pure oxygen of the highland air i can attribute this superiority of the congo region only to the labours of an old civilization now obsolete none but a thick and energetic population could have cleared off the forest which at one time must have covered their mountains  the banza consists of about fifty cottages which are being new thatched before the rains and the population may number 300 our host assigned to us one of his own huts it fronted west and was a facsimile of that which we had just left the old fox determined not to be taken alive has provided his earth with three holes opening to the north to the east and to the west we often detected him in the ben the matrimonial sanctum listening to private conversations which he could not understand gidi mavunga is decidedly a serious person the three walls round the standing bedstead are hung with charms and amulets like the sacred pictures in country parts of europe and at the head is his mavunga of which tuckey says p 180 each village has a grand kissey nkisi or presiding divinity named mevonga it is an anthropoid log about three feet high red white and black the former colour predominating two bits of lookingglass represent the eyes the nose is patulous as though offended by evil savour the upper lip is drawn up in disdain the under overlaps the chin and a little mirror is inserted into the umbilical region mavungas dress is represented by an english billycock hat while all kinds of medicines calabashes and a coarse knife depend from his neck to his shoulders the figures at the door are generally called ngolowándá  it is said i believe of the englishwoman            if she will she will you may depend ont            if she wont she wont and theres an end ont  i may safely predicate the same of the negro who owns like the goose a singularly inflexible organization whenever he can he will and he must have his head gidi mavunga would not even break his fast before touching the cloth and beads which are to pay for guidance and carriage the hutdoor was closed and in half an hour all was settled to every ones satisfaction yet the veteran did not disdain a little rascality awaiting his opportunity he tossed into a dark corner a little bundle of two fancy cloths which i had given the linguistero and when detected he shamelessly declared that such people have no right to trade  finally our departure was settled for the next morning and the women at once began their preparations although they have sperm candles torches are preferred for the road odoriferous gums are made up as in the gaboon with rags or splints of bark hence the old writers say instead of putting wicks into the torches they put torches into the wicks the travelling foods are mostly boiled batatas sweet potatoes kwanga a hard and innutritious puddinglike preparation of cassava which the expedition p 197 calls coongo a bitter root that requires four days boiling to deprive it of its pernicious quality this is probably the black or poisonous manioc the national dish chindungwa would test the mouth of any curryeater in the world it is composed of boiled groundnuts and red peppers in equal proportions pounded separately in wooden mortars mixed and squeezed to drain off the oil the hard mass flavoured with salt or honey will keep for weeks the bees are not hived in congoland but smoked out of hollow trees as in f po and camarones peaks they rarely sting like the harmless angelito of the caraccas silla or saddleback which humboldt personal narrative chap xiii describes as a little hairy bee a little smaller than the honeybee of the north of europe captain hall found the same near tampico and a hivefull was sent to the blind but ingenious francis huber of geneva who died in 1831 this seems to be the case with the busy hymenopter generally in the highlands of africa the lowland swarms have been the terror of travellers from mungo parks day to that of the first east african expedition  about noon we were visited by the confidential slaves of a neighbouring chief who prospectively welcomed us to his territory these men were gaudily attired in castoff clothes and in the crimson nightcaps formerly affected by the english labourer on the mountains where the helmet is confined to royalty it is the headdress used for state occasions they sat in the hut chatting laughing and discussing palm wine by the gallon till they had their wicked will in the shape of a bottle of gin after this they departed with many low congés  it was a study to see gidi mavunga amidst the vassals and serfs of his own village he had no moated castle no quinquengrogne but his habitation was grander farthat glorious hillside with all its prospects of mountain and river field and forest valley and village as he sat upon the mat under his little piazza all the dependants gathered in an outer semicircle the children dogs and cats forming an inner chord a crowd of moleques placed before him three black pots one containing a savoury stew the others beans and vegetables which he transferred to a deep platter and proved himself no mean trencherman the earthenware is of native make by no means ornamental but useful because it retains the heat it resembles the produce of the gold coast and the pepperpot platter of the west indies his cup was filled as fast as he drained the palm wine and at times he passed a huge mouthful to a small son or daughter smiling at the serious and awkward attempts at deglutition the washing of hands and mouth before and after feeding shows progress after tuckeys day p 360 we were not asked to join him an african when upon a journey will beg for everything he sees you eat or drink but there is no return in kind i have read of negro hospitality but it has never been my fate to witness an approach to that virtue the chief will it is true quarrel with you if his house be passed without a visit but his object in taking you in is to make all he can of you if a purse be pulled out he waxes wroth because he wishes to secure at once the reputation of generosity and the profits of a present doubling the worth of a regular addition when gidi mavunga rose from his meal the elder dependants took his place the junior bipeds followed and the remnants were thrown to the quadrupeds it was a fair copy in black of a baronial and mediæval life  the dogs were not neglected during the meal but overeagerness was repressed by a stout truncheon lying handily near the old negro jarl the animals are small and stunted longnosed and crookedlimbed with curly tails often cut sharp ears which show that they have not lost the use of the erecting muscles and so far wild that they cannot bark the colour is either black and white or yellow and white as in stambul and india overrun with ticks and foul with mange they are too brokenspirited to rob except by secretly sneaking into the huts and however often beaten off they return to the charge like sitting hens the people prize these wretched tikes because they are ever ready to worry a stranger and are useful in driving game from the bush yet they barbarously illtreat them the hungry cats are as poor a breed as the pure english and though no one feeds them these domesticated tigerkins swarm the only happy pets are the parrots every village swarms with hogs the filthy wealth of the old saxon proprietor and their habits are disgusting as their forms are obscene every angloindian will understand what i mean  my memory of congo chop is all in its favour i can recommend it even to fin bee the people of sa leone declare that your life is safe when you can enjoy native food perhaps this means that during the time required to train the palate strangers will have escaped their seasoning fevers and chills but foreigners will certainly fare better and cæteris paribus outlive their brother whites when they can substitute african stews for the roast and boiled goat and cow likest to donkey meat for the waxy and insipid potato and for heavy pudding and tart with which their jaded stomach is laden as if it had the digestion of north latitude 50° it is popularly believed that the germans who come from the land of greatest extremes live longer at the white mans grave than the english whereas the spaniards are the most shortlived one consul per annum being the normal rate perhaps the greater adaptability of the teuton explains the cause  the evening began with a game of ball in the large open space amongst the houses forming the village square the implement was a roll of palmcoir tightly bound with the central fibre of the plantainleaf the players two parties of some twenty slaves of all ages and sizes mingled each side striving to catch the ball and with many feints and antics to pass it on to a friend when it fell out of bounds the juniors ran to pick it up with frantic screams it was interesting as showing the difference between the highlander and the lowlander one might pass years on the congo plains without seeing so much voluntary exertion yet a similar game of ball is described by the rev mr waddell twentynine years in the west indies and central africa chap xvii london nelsons 1863 the evening ended as it often does before a march when rest is required with extra hard work a drinking bout deep as the rhineland barons in the good old time and a dance in which both sexes joined as there were neither torches nor moon i did not attend the singing the shouting and the drumming which lasted till midnight spoke well for the agility and endurance of the fair montagnardes  what lightens gidi mavungas steps is the immediate prospect of the munlola or preliminary showers which beginning in mid september last with a certain persistence of fall till october during the munlola the seabreeze is silent and the sky is clad with a very thin mist which however supplies abundant downfalls the year in the lower congo corresponds with that of the gaboon in practice if not in theory and the storms are furious as those of yoruba where the seasons are of course inverted the great rains extending from may to august the climate is capricious as everywhere about the equator and the nearer the river the heavier are the showers the people double their lives by reckoning the rains as one year and the dries as another when the old missionaries wished to explain that the saviour offered himself for the sins of man at the age of thirty three they said that he was sixtysix seasons old  after the light rains of the autumnal equinox come the mvula za chintomba the chuvas grandes of the portuguese lasting to the end of november they are heavy accompanied by violent tornadoes and storms greatly feared by the people the moisture of the atmosphere not being gradually condensed by forests must be precipitated in violent downfalls and this is perhaps the principal evil of clearing the country december begins the little dries which extend to february and march then set in the rains of the vernal equinox with furious discharges of electricity june is the wettest month on the highlands but not on the lower river in midjuly commence the middledries here called ngondi asivu tuckeys gondy assivoo upon the upper river this cacimbo lasts between april and september when it passes over the bush is burned and the women hoe the ground to receive its seed carli well describes this season when he says the winter of the kingdom of congo is the mild spring or autumn of italy it is not subject to rains but every morning there falls a dew which fertilizes the earth this meteor was not observed on the highlands of banza nokki and nkulu it is probably confined to the low country where i found it falling heavily                               chapter xiii                     the march to banza nkulu    but revelry at night brings morning headache and we did not set out as agreed at dawn by slow degrees the grumbling loitering party was mustered the chiefs were gidi mavunga head guide and his son papagayo a dull quiet body chico mpamba french landlord of banza nokki and my interpreter nchama chamvu fourteen armed moleques carried our hammocks and our little viaticum in the shape of four bottles of presentgin two costa finas  twentyfour yards of fancy cotton and fourteen fathoms of satinstripe the latter a reserved fund the boy lendo whose appropriate name means the go bore a burden of his own size all day and acted as little footpage at the halt the gentlemen were in full travelling costume slung by a thong to the chief guides left shoulder were a tigercat skin cardamomsheaths and birds beaks and claws clustering round a something in shape like the largest german sausage the whole ruddled with ochre this charm must not be touched by the herd a slavelad having unwittingly offended knelt down whilst the wearer applied a dusty big toe between his eyebrows papagayo had a bag of grasscloth and bits of cane from which protruded strips of leather and scarlet broadcloth  at 645 am on saturday september 12 we exchanged the fields surrounding banza chinguvu for a ridge or narrow plateau trending to the northeast and bending to the magnetic north a few minutes led to a rockslope fit only for goathoofs or nude footed natives winding along the hillsides we passed out of the nokki territory into that of ntombo the property of mfumo nelongo here we descended into a little vale or gorge bright as verdure could make it                     arborets and flowers           imborderd on each bank  of a bubbling brook a true naiad of the hills which ran to the embrace of the mighty stream it characteristically stained its bed with iron on our right was a conspicuous landmark zululu ke sombe a tall rock bearing the semblance of an elephant from the northeast visible from the congos right bank and commanding a view of all the hills banza vivi our first destination perching high on the farther side of the blue depression bore due north we then struck the roughest of descents down broken outcrops and chines of graniteno wonder that the women have such grand legs this led us into a dark green depression where lay banza chinsavu the abode of king nelongo our course had been three miles to the northnortheast  nothing can be more charming than the site a small horseshoe valley formed by a wady or fiumara upon whose raised left bank stands the settlement sheltered by palms plantations and wild figs eastward is a slope of bare rock polished by the rain torrents westward rise the grassy hills variegated with bush and boulder we next crossed a rocky divide to the north and found a second basin also fertilized by its own stream here the cactus and aloes the vegetation of the desert contrasted with halfa dozen shades of green the banana the sycamore the eggplant the sweet potato the wild pepper and the grass whose colours were paling but not so rapidly as in the lower lands  we dismounted in state from our tipoias at the verandah of an empty house where a chair had been placed and we prepared for the usual delay and display the guides will not leave these villages unvisited lest a war result all the chiefs are cousins and one must not monopolize the plunder a great man takes an hour to dress and nelongo was evidently soothing the toils of the toilette with a musical bellows called an accordeon he sent us some poor wellwatered msámbá palm toddy and presently he appeared a fat goodnatured man as usual ridiculously habited he took the first opportunity of curtly saying in better portuguese than usual there is no more march today this was rather too much for a somewhat testy traveller when he changed his tone begged me not to embroil him with a powerful neighbour and promised that we should set out that evening he at once sent for provisions fowls and a small riverfish sugarcane and a fine bunch of s thomé bananas  about noon appeared chico furano son of the late chico de ouro in his quality of english linguister a low position to which want of savvy has reduced him his studies of our tongue are represented by an eternal yes his wits by the negative he boasts of knowing how to tratar com o branco and declining to bargain he robs double he is a short small dark man with mountaineer legs a frightful psora and an inveterate habit of drink he saluted his superior nelongo with immense ceremony dating probably from the palmy times of the mwanicongo equals squat before one another and shaking hands crosswise clap palms chico furano kneels places both ferients upon the earth and touches his nosetip he then traces three groundcrosses with the jovian finger again touches his nose beats his volæ on the dust and draws them along the cheeks then he bends down applying firstly the right secondly the left face side and lastly the palms and dorsa of the hands to mother earth both superior and inferior end with the sakila or battapalmasfn26 three bouts of three claps in the best of time separated by the shortest of pauses and lastly a tiger of four claps the ceremony is more elaborate than the wallowings and dust shovellings described by ibn batuta at the asiatic courts by jobson at tendaby chapperton at oyoby denham amongst the mesgows and by travellers to dahome and to the cazembe yet the system is virtually the same in these distant kingdoms which do not know one anothers names  chico furano brought a mundongo slave a fine specimen of humanity some six feet high weighing perhaps thirteen stone all bone and muscle willing and hardworking looking upon the congo men as if they were women or children he spoke a few words of portuguese and with the masters assistance i was able to catechize him he did not deny that his people were papagentes but he declared that they confined the practice to slain enemies he told a number of classical tales about double men attached not like the siamese twins but dosàdos of tribes whose feet acted as parasols the plinian sciapodæ and the persian tasmeh pa and of mermen who live and sleep in the inner watersi also heard this from m parrot a palpable believer he described his journey down the great river and declared that beyond his countrys frontier the nzadi issues from a lake which he described as having a seahorizon where canoes lose sight of land and where they are in danger from violent storms he described the latter with great animation and his descriptions much reminded me of dibbie the dark lake probably this was genuine geography although he could not tell the name of the inner sea the achelunda of old cosmographers tuckeys map also lays down in n lat 2° to 3° and in e long g 17° to 18° a great swamp draining to the south and his narrative p 178 tells us that some thirty days above banza mavunda which is 20 to 24 miles above the yellala the river issues by many small streams from a great marsh or lake of mud this would suggest a reservoir alternately flooded and shrinking possibly lacustrine bays and the bulges formed by the middle course of the lualaba  despite the promise we were delayed by king nekorado whose town palabala lies at some distance and who negrolike will consult only his own convenience in the afternoon we were visited by a royal son who announced that his royal father feared the heat but would appear with the moon which was equivalent to saying that we might expect him on the morrow he is known to be a gueux and gidi mavunga boasts of having harried and burned sundry of his villages so he must make up by appearance for deficient reality his appearance was announced by the mpungi the egyptian zagharit the persian kil this lullilooing in the bush country becomes an odd moaning howl like the hyaenas laugh runners and criers preceded the hammock which he had probably mounted at the first field a pet slave carried his chair covered with crimson cloth and frédérique his linguister paced proudly by its side  after robing himself in nelongos house king nekorado held a levee under the shadiest fig which acted bentangtree all the moleques squatting in a demilune before the presence a short black man with the round eyes the buttonlike nose the fat circular face and the weakly vanishing chin which denote the lower type of congoese he coldly extended a chimpanzees paw without rising or raising his eyes in token that nothing around him deserved a glance i made him aufait as to my intentions produced as matabicho a bottle of gin and sent a dash of costafina to which a few yards of satinstripe were thrown in  the gin was drunk with the usual greed and the presents were received with the normal objections  why should not i a king like nessudikira receive a dash equal to his  he is my host i pay him for bed and board  we are all cousins why shall one be treated better than the other  as you please you have received your due and today we march  after this i rose and returned to my hut ready for the inevitable row  it was not long coming the new arrivals set up the warsong and gidi mavunga thought it time to make a demonstration drawing an old cutlass and bending almost double he began to rush about slashing and cutting down imaginary foes whilst his men looked to their guns the greenhorn would have expected a regular stand up fight ending in halfadozen deaths but the papagayo snatched away his fathers rusty blade and chico furano seizing the warriors head despite the mildest of resistance bent it almost to the ground thus valour succumbed to numbers he is a great man whispered my interpreter and if they chaunt their battlesong he must show them his bravery the truly characteristic scene ended in our being supplied with some fourteen black pots full of flesh fowl beans and manioc together with an abundance of plantains and sugarcane a select dish was put in fetish set aside for gidi mavunga and the friendly foes all sat down to feast the querelle dallemand ended with a general but vain petition for tother bottle  fahrenheit showed 90° in the shade as we bade adieu to the little landbay and made for the high rugged wall to the north northeast separating the river valley from the inner country on the summit we halted to enjoy the delicious seabreeze with its ascending curve and the delightful prospect far below some 1300 feet beneath us appeared the nzadi narrowed to a torrent and rushing violently down its highly inclined bed a straight reach running east and west in length from four and a half to five miles as we fronted north the morro cliff kala fell bluff towards its blue bight the mayumba bay of the chart on our left to the right a black gate formed by twin cliffs shut out the upper stream from view the panorama of hillfold and projection each bounded by deep green lines which argued torrents during the rains the graceful slopes sinking towards the river and indenting the bed and the little treeclad isle zun gáchyá idí tuckeys zunga tooly calavangoo hugging the northern side where the lufu torrent adds its tribute to the waters convinced me that the charms of congo scenery had not been exaggerated yet the prospect had its element of sadness the old ruffian gidi mavunga recounted how he had burned this place and broken that where palmclumps grassclearings and plantations lying waste denoted the curse of ham upon the land  our course now wound northeastwards along hillshoulders rich in flowery plants and scented mimosa after two hours walking we came suddenly upon the morro or cliff of the rivertrough now about 1000 feet deep here the prospect again shifted the black gate opened showing the lowest of the long line of rapids called borongwa ya vivi with the natives and their canoes like flies upon bits of straw  on the southern bank was a small perennial influent lined with bright green above and with chocolate brown below within some twenty yards of its mouth it arises they say near s salvador and is not navigable although in places it bears canoes the people call it npozo possibly it represents the s salvador river of old travellers the distance was three direct or five indirect miles north of the stony cone zululu ke sombe  the descent was a malevoie over slabs and boulders loose stones and clayey ground slippery as ice after rain the moleques descended like chamois within twenty minutes selim and i with booted feet took double the time but on return we ascended it in fortyfive minutes viewed from below the base rests upon cliffs of gneiss with debris and quartz in masses bands and pebbles pure and impure white and rusty upon it rises a stratum of ferruginous clay with large hardheads of granite gneiss and schist blocks of conglomerate and nodules of ironstone higher still is the bank of yellow clay capped with shallow humus the waving profile is backed by steep hills with rocky sides and long ridges of ground the site of the palm hidden banzas  reaching the base a heap of tumbled boulders we crossed in a canoe the mouth of the npozo to a sandy cove in the southern bank the terminus of river navigation the people called it unyenge assiku i cannot but suspect that this is the place where tuckey left his boats and which he terms nomaza cove the name is quite unknown and suggests that the interpreters tried to explain by no majia water that here the voyage must end  off this baylet are three rocky islets disposed in a triangle slabs collected by a broken reef and collectively known as zunga nuapozo the clearway is between them and the southern bank which is partly provided with a backwater the northern three quarters of the bed show something like a scour and a rapid zunga chya ingololo the northernmost and smallest bears a single tree and projects a bar far into the stream the central and westernmost is a rock with a canoe passage between it and the southern and largest zunga chya tuvi the latter has three tree clumps and a patch of clean white sand on its western side measures the daily rise of the water eight inches to a foot and shows the highest level of the flood here twelve to thirteen feet the fishermen use it as a dryingground for their game they also crowd every day to two sandy covelets on the southern bank separated by a tongue of rough boulders here naked urchins look on whilst their fathers work or aid in drying the nets or lie prone upon the sand exposing their backs to the broiling sun the other denizens of the place are fisheagles who sit en faction upon the topmost branches of withered trees i saw only two kinds of fish one small as a minnow and the other approaching the size of a herring up stream they are said to be much larger they are not salted but smoked or sundried when the weather serves stuffed with chillies and fried with oil they are good eating as the kinnam of the gold coast  we prepared to bivouac under a fine shady saffu or wild fig a low thick trunk whose dark foliage fleshy as the limeleaf so often hangs its tresses over the river and whose red berries may feed man as well as monkey the yellow flowers of hypericum blooming around us made me gratefully savour our escape from mangrove and pandamus about sunset a gentle shower the first of the season caused the fisherboys to dance with joy it lasted two good hours and then it was dispersed by a strong westerly breeze canoes and lights flashed before our eyes during half the night and wild beasts answering one another from rock to rock hundreds of feet above us added a savage african feature to the goodly miseenscène  arising early next morning i was assured that it is necessary to cross the stream in order to reach the cataracts tuckey did so but further inquiry convinced me that it is a mistake to march along the northern bank of course in skirting the southern side we should not have approached so near the stream where bluffs and débris rendered travelling hopeless the amiable ichthyophagi agreed for two fathoms of fancy cloth to ferry us across the river which is here half a mile broad the sixknot current compels canoes to run up the left shore by means of its backwater and when crossing to make allowance for the drift downwards the aneroid now showed 860 feet of absolute altitude and about sixtyfive feet above the landingplace of banza nokki the distance along the stream is fourteen miles and thus the fall will be about five feet per mile below the borongwa ya vivi we could see from a level the smaller rapids of vivi bursting through their black gate with angry foam flashing white from side to side no canoe could shoot this cachoeira but i do not think that a nile dahabiyah or a brazilian ajôjô would find great difficulty between us and the rapids the concavity of the southern bank forms a bight or bay the vortices in which tuckeys sloop was whirled round despite oars and sails and in whose hollow the punt entirely disappeared so that the depression must have been three or four feet deep were nowhere seen at this fuller season the aspect of the surface is that of every large deep stream with broken bottom the water boils up in ever widening domes as though a system of fountains sprang from below each centre is apparently higher than its circle it spreads as if a rock had been thrown into it and the outer rim throws off little eddies and whirls no larger than a thimble the mirrory surface of the lower river thus becomes mottled with light and shade and the reflected image of the troughcliff is broken into the most fantastic shapes  fifteen minutes of hard paddling landed us at selele a stony point between two sandy baylets amongst the mass of angular boulders a tree again showed the highest floodmark to be 13 feet here for the first time i remarked the black glaze concerning which so much has been writtenfn28 the colour is a sunburnt black tinted ferruginous red like meteoric stones and it is generally friable crumbling under the nails it tastes strongly of iron which flavours almost every spring in the country yet the most likely places do not show this incrustation sometimes it looks like a matrix in which pudding stone has been imbedded it may be two or three lines in thickness and it does not colour the inside at other times it hardly measures the thickness of paper coating the gneiss slabs like plumbago humboldt tells us personal narrative ii 243 bohn that the indians of the atures declare the rocks to be burnt carbonized by the suns rays and i have often found the same black glaze upon the marly sandstones that alternate with calcareous formations where no stream ever reached themfor instance on the highlands of judea between jerusalem and the dead sea in inner istria and in most countries upon the borders of the mediterranean  leaving selele we ascended a steep hill with many glissadès the effect of last nights rain these hammockjourneys are mostly equivalent to walking and paying for carriage it would be cruelty to animals were one to ride except when entering the villages after threading for half an hour lanes of grass we were received in a little village of the banza vivi district by nessala linguistère to king luvungungwete the guest room was furnished with every luxury hides of a fine antelope described as the kudu cruets basins bottles and other vases lustre mugs john andersons and toby philpots a good calabash full of                      freshening wine           more bounteous far than all the frantic juice           which bacchus pours  was produced although the drought and scarcity of june rain had dried the palms before i outstretched myself the fairer half of the population sent a message to say that they had never seen a white man what less could be done than to distribute a few beads and pat the children who screamed like sucking pigs and squirmed like young monkeys  the chrononhotonthologus of a king came in the afternoon with a tail of a hundred vertebræ he was a milder specimen than usual he had neither mambrinos helmet nor beadles cloak and perhaps his bashfulness in the presence of strangers arose from a consciousness that his headgear and robes were not in keeping with his station but he did not fail to grumble at his dash indeed he must be more than african who shall say hold enough he vouchsafed a small return in fowls and beneficent manioc and sent with us three slaves to serve not as guides but as a basis for a separate charge  after sunset all was made ready for the batuque the ballroom was the village square the decorations were the dense trees the orchestra consisted of two drums a grande caisse eight feet and a half long placed horizontally and a smaller specimen standing on a foot like that of an oldfashioned champagneglass the broader ends were covered with deer skins upon which both hands perform and the illuminations were flaming heaps of straw which when exhausted were replaced by groundnuts spitted upon a bamboo splint this contrivance is far simpler than a dip candle the arachis is broken off as it chars and when the lamp dims turning it upside down causes a fresh flow of oil the ruder sex occupied one half of the ring and the rest was appropriated to dame and damsel the batuque is said to be the original cachucha barbot calls it a danse des filoux and it has the merit of perfectly expressing as captain cooks companions remarked of the performances in the south sea islands what it means  the hero of the night was chico mpamba he must have caused a jealous pang to shoot through many a masculine bosom with bending waist arms gracefully extended forwards and fingers snapping louder than castanets with the upper half of the body fixed as to a stake and with the lower convulsive as a scotched snake he advanced and retired by a complicated shuffle keeping time with the tomtom and jingling his brass anklets which weighed at least three pounds and which by the by lamed him for several days but he was heroic as the singer who broke his collarbone by the ut di petto a peculiar accompaniment was a dulcet whistle with lips protruded hence probably the fable of plinys astomoi and the africans of eudoxus whose joined lips compelled them to eat a single grain at a time and to drink through a cane before sherrycobblers were known others joined him dancing either visàvis or by his side and more than one girl who could no longer endure being a wallflower glided into the ring and was received with a roar of applause in the feminine performance the eyes are timidly bent upon the ground the steps are shorter and daintier and the ritrosa appears at once to shun and to entice her cavalier who thus repulsed and attracted redoubles the exciting measure till the delight of the spectators knows no bounds old gidi mavunga flings off his upper garment and with the fire of a youth of twenty enters the circle where his performance is looked upon with respect if not with admiration wilder and wilder waxeth the devils delight till even the bystanders especially the women though they keep their places in the outer circle cannot restrain that wonderful movement of haunch and flank i laughed till midnight and left the dancers dancing still  at 5 am the strayed revellers found to their disgust a thick fog or rather a thin drizzle damping grass and path and suggesting anything but a pleasant trudge they declared that starvation awaited us as the fancy cloths were at an end but i stopped that objection by a reference to the reserved fund after an hour of sulky talk we set out towards the upper part of banza vivi passing a small but pretty hill plain with manioc fields gumtrees and the bombax very symmetrical we saw no animals here and there appeared the trail of a hyaena the only larger carnivor that now haunts the mountains the song of mkuka mpela the wild pigeon and fungú the cuckoo were loud in the brake the abbé proyart makes the male cuculus chant his coo coo coo mounting one note above another with as much precision as a musician would sound his ut re mi when he reached the third note his mate takes it up and ascends to the octave after this both recommence the same song  the stiff ascent gave us lovely views of the lakelike river and both its banks after three quarters of an hour we reached vivi of banza simbo the people vainly called to us wiza come thou and luiza luiza kwenu come come here our moleques disliking the dangerous proximity advanced at a walk which might be called a canter  presently we reached the dividing ridge 1394 feet high between banza vivi and nkulu whose palmtrees thrown out against the sky bore 82° m looking to the north with easting we had a view of no less than six distinct distances the actual foreground a hollow between two landwaves could not conceal the crocodiles head the latter five miles off and bearing 65° m forms the southern staple of the yellala gate whose rapids were not visible and it fronts the quoin which hems in the stream on the other side the keystone of the inverted arch between them was a yellowflanked treetopped hill rising immediately above the great rapids beyond if waved in far succession three several swells of ground each flatter and bluer than its nearer neighbour and capping the whole stood kongo de lemba a tall solitary sugarloaf bearing 75° m with its outlying conelets concealing like a mass of smoke the world that lay beyond  the ridges appeared to trend north and south and to approach the rivers bending bed at different angles their sides were steep and in places scarped where they fell into the intervening hollows the valleys conducted many a water to the main drain and during the wet season they must be wellnigh impassable at the end of the dries the only green is in the hillfolds and the basinsinks where the trees muster strong enough to defend themselves from the destructive annual fires these bushburnings have effectually disforested the land and in some places building timber and even fuel have become scarce in the abrus barely two feet high i could hardly recognize the tall tree of eastern africa except by its scarlet carats which here the people disdain to use as beads the scorching of the leaves stunts the shrubs thickens the bark and makes the growth scrubby so that the labourer has nothing to do but to clear away the grass i afterwards remarked the same effects on the brazilian campos  we descended the dividing ridge which is also painfully steep especially near the foot and crossed the rolling hollow with its three chalybeate brooks beyond which lay our destination tuckey describes the hills between boma and nkulu as stony and barren which is perhaps a little too strong the dark red clay soil dried almost to the consistency of laterite cannot be loosened by rain or sun and in places it is hardened like that of brazilian porto seguro where the people complain that they cannot bury their dead all the uplands however grow grass which is sometimes ten to twelve feet tall and in places there are shrubs and trees about nkulu the highlands are rightly described as steep hills of quartz ferruginous earth and syenite with fertile tops rocks and stones are rare upon the plateaux they are rich enough to produce everything from wheat to coffee and hardly a hundredth part is cultivated thin and almost transparent lines of palms denote the several banzas on the ridges and in the valley are rock circles like magnified and prostrated stonehenges  the termes arborum is universal and anthills form a prominent feature it has been remarked that these buildings are the most conspicuous architectural efforts of the country and the abbé proyart observes that here more effectually than in any other land man ought to be sent to the ant school the material is of dark and sometimes black earth as in the gaboon and the shape is the umbrella rarely double or pagodaroofed the column may be twelve to eighteen inches high and the diameter of the capital attains two feet i never saw however a gigantic toadstool as high as a onestoried housefn28 nor are the mushroom tops now used as chafingdishes  the grateful tamarind grows everywhere but nowhere so gloriously as on the lower elevations the only true sycomores which i saw were stunted specimens near the yellala they contrasted poorly with the growth of the ugogi dhun a noble patriarch whose circle of shade under a vertical sun was 500 feet and which i thought worthy of a portrait in lake regions of central africa p 195 vol i i need hardly warn the reader that properly speaking it is the sycamine which produces the fruit called syconwrus or figmulberry but we apply the term sycomore to the tree as well as to its fruit  after three hours of actual marching  seven miles in an east northeasterly direction we ascended a path greasy with drizzle parquetted by negro feet and infested with drivers which now became troublesome it led to banza nkulu a shabby settlement of unclean plantations and ragged huts of far inferior construction stacks of grass were piled upon the ground and this new thatch was greatly wanted here the lands of the bushmen begin instead of marching directly to the chiefs house we sat in our wet clothes under a friendly wild fig the women flocked out at the cry of the hammockbearers and nursing their babies sat down to the enjoyment of a stare they had lost however the merriment of their more civilized sisters and they hardly ever vouchsafed a laugh or a smile the curiosity of the zinkomba knew no bounds all were unusually agitated by the aspect of a man coloured like themselves they jerked out their leafy crinolines by forward movements of the lower body swayed violently from side to side and cried harrrrrrrr and jojolo jojolo till they were hoarse as usual the adults would not allow me to approach them and i was obliged to rest contented with sketching their absurdities to punish this daring the jinkomba brought a man masked like a white with beard and whiskers who is supposed to strike the stranger with awe it was all in vain i had learned to trill the r as roundly as themselves and they presently left me as a perdido an incorrigible  in the days of the expedition nkulu had but one ruler of whom tuckey says p 148 that he found less pomp and noise but much more civility and hospitality than from the richer kings he had visited now there are three who require their dashes and each has his linguister who must not be passed by without notice moreover as population and luxury have increased on the line of route barkcloth has disappeared and even the slaves are dressed in cottons we waited patiently hungry till 4 pm because the interpreters had gone on some fish palaver to the river at that hour a procession of some two hundred and fifty men headed by a drum and chingufu cymbalbells defiled before us crowding round three umbrellas tradearticles in the last stage of seediness these comforts protected from the sun which was deep hid behind a purple nimbus an equal number of great men in absurd red nightcaps or old felt wideawakes shirts of coloured cotton and secondhand waistcoats of silk or satin the only signs of luxury were here and there a wellcarved ebony stick and a gunstock resplendent with brass tacks all sat down in a semicircle before us six or seven deep in front and four or five at the sides the women and children took their places in the rear and one of them fondled a prickeared cur with an attempt at a ribbon round its neck  the head linguister who like persian interpreters to commanders in chief of india during my clay could not speak a word of any language but his own after clapping hands congratulated us in the name of the great king nekulu he lives it appears in a banza at some distance to the north or north east out of sight of the river and he cannot be visited without great outlay of gunpowder and strong waters we returned compliments and after the usual complications we came to the main point the dash i had privily kept a piece of satin stripe and this was produced as the very last of our viaticum the interpreter having been assured that we had nothing else to give retired with his posse to debate whilst we derided the wild manners of these bushfolk who feared to shake hands with us after an hour or so the council returned clapped palms sat clown grumbled at the gift and gave formal leave to see the yellalahow the word now jarred in my ears after its abominable repetition had these men been told a month before that a white would have paid for permission to visit what they considered common property they would have refused belief with characteristic readiness however the moment they saw an opportunity of making money they treated the novelty as a matter of course  this palaver settled the chiefs danced within a ring formed by their retainers the speeches were all sung not spoken and obeisances and dustings of elaborate complexity concluded the eventful meeting which broke up as it began with drum and chingufu there was not a symptom of hospitality we had preserved some provaunt from our last station or we should have been famished my escort forgot their disappointments in a ball which lasted through the cool clear and dewy night till nearly dawn it is evidently a happy temperament which can dance off hunger and fatigue                                chapter xiv                     the yellala of the congo    at dawn september 16 i began the short march leading to the yellalafn29 by stepping a few paces south of nkulu we had a fine view of the borongwa ya vivi the lowest rapids whose foaming slope contrasted well with the broad smooth basin beyond palabala the village of nekorado on the other side of the stream bore south mag still serving as a landmark and in this direction the ridges were crowned with palm orchards and settlements but the great yellala was hidden by the hill shoulder  we at once fell into a descent of some 890 feet which occupied an hour the ground was red ironclay greasy and slippery dew dripping grass twelve to fifteen feet tall lined the path the surface was studded with dark anthills of the mushroom shape short sycomores appeared and presently we came to rough gradients of stone which severely tried the jarrets after an hour we crossed at the troughfoot a brook of pure water which uniting with two others turns to the northeast and tumbling over a little ledge discharges itself into the main drain an ascent then led over a rounded hill with level summit and precipitous face all steps and drops of rock some of them six and seven feet high opposed to the stream another half hour and a descent of 127 feet placed us under a stunted calabash 100 feet above the water and commanding a full view of the yellala  on the whole the impression was favourable old shimbah the linguister at porto da lenha and other natives had assured me that the cataracts were taller than the tallest trees on the other hand the plain and unadorned narrative of the expedition had prepared me for a secondrate stream bubbling over a strong bed the river here sweeps round from the northwest and bends with a sharp elbow first to the southwest and then to the south east the length of the latter reach being between four and five miles as far as the eye can see the bed which narrows from 900 to 400 and 500 yards is broken by rocks and reefs a gate at the upper end pours over its lintel a clear but dwarf fall perhaps two feet high the eastern staple rises at first sheer from the waters edge to the estimated altitude of a thousand feetthis is the crocodiles head which we saw on the last march and already the thin rains are robing its rocky surface with tender green the strata are disposed at angles varying from 35° to 45° and three streaks of bright trees denote fiumaras about to be filled opposite it is the quoin hill bluff to the stream and falling west with gradual incline the noise of this higher fall can hardly be heard at nkulu except on the stillest nights  below the upper gate the bed now narrowing to 300 yards shows the great yellala the waters after breaking into waves for a mile and a half above rush down an inclined plane of some thirty feet in 300 yards spuming colliding and throwing up foam which looks dingy white against the dull yellowbrown of the less disturbed channelthe movement is that of waves dashing upon a pier the bed is broken by the zunga chya malemba which some pronounced sanga chya malemba an oval islet in midstream whose greater diameter is disposed along the axis of the bed the northwestern apex raised about fifty feet above the present level of the waters shows a little bay of pure sand the detritus of its rocks with a floodmark fifteen feet high whilst the opposite side bears a few windwrung trees the materials are gneiss and schist banded with quartztuckeys great masses of slate this is the terrapin of the nzadi the eastern fork about 150 yards broad is a mountaintorrent coursing unobstructed down its sandy trough and viewed from an eminence the waters of the midchannel appear convex a shallow section of a cylinderit is a familiar shape well marked upon the st lawrence rapids the western half is traversed by a reef connecting the islets with the right bank during august this branch was found almost dry in midseptember it was nearly full and here the water breaks with the greatest violence the right bank is subtended for some hundred yards by blocks of granite and greenstone pitted with large basins and potholes delicately rounded turned as with a lathe by the turbid waters the people declare that this greenstone contains copper and professor smith found particles in his specimens the portuguese agents to whom the natives carefully submit everything curious doubt the fact as well as all reports of gold yet there is no reason why the latter should not be found  the current whirls and winds through its tortuous channels which are like castings of metal in many distinct flows some places are almost stagnant suggesting passages for canoes here the fishermen have planted their weirs some are wading in the pools others are drying their nets upon the stony ledges during the floods however this chevaldefrise of boulders must all be under water and probably impassable tuckey supposes that the inundation must produce a spectacle which justifies the high flown description of the people i should imagine the reverse to be the case and dr livingstone justly remarkedfn30that when the river was full the yellala rapids would become comparatively smooth as he had found those of the zambeze and that therefore a voyage pittoresque up the congo should be made at that season  before leaving the yellala i wandered along the right bank and found a cliff whose overhanging brow formed a fine cavern it remarkably resembled the martianez fountain under the rock near the beautiful puerto de orotava here the fishermen were disporting themselves and cooking their game which they willingly exchanged for beads all were of the silurus family varying from a few inches to two feet fisheagles sat upon the ledges overhanging the stream and a flight of large cranes wheeled majestically in the upper air according to the people they are always to be seen at the yellalas  the extent of a few hundred feet afforded a good birds eye view of the scene the old rivervalley shown by the scarp of the rocks must have presented gigantic features and the height of the troughwalls at least a thousand feet gives the yellala a certain beauty and grandeur the site is apparently the highest axis of the dividing ridge separating the maritime lowlands from the inner plateau looking eastward the land smoothens the dorsa fall more gently towards the counterslope and there are none of the morros which we have traversed  with the members of the congo expedition i was somewhat startled by the contrast between the apparently shrunken volume of waters and the vast breadth of the lower river hence professor smiths theory of underground caverns and communications in fact of a subterraneous river a favourite hobby in those days but there is not a trace of limestone formation around nor is there the hollow echo which inevitably would result from such a tunnel evidently the difference is to be accounted for by the rapidity of the torrent the effect of abnormal slope deceiving the eye at the mosîwatunya falls the gigantic zambeze from a breadth of a thousand yards suddenly plunges into a trough only forty five to sixty feet wide the same is the case with the brazilian são francisco which a mile wide above the cachoeira de paulo affonso is choked to a minimum breadth of fiftyone feet at the pongo narrows de manseriche also the amazonas already a noble river is contracted at its narrowest part to a width of only twentyfive toises bounded on each margin by lofty perpendicular cliffs at the end of which the andes are fairly passed and the river emerges on the great plainfn31 thus the yellala belongs to the class of obstructed rapids like those of the nile compared with the unobstructed of which a fine specimen is the st lawrence it reminded me strongly of the búsa boussa described by richard lander where the breadth of the niger is reduced to a stonethrow and the stream is broken by black rugged rocks arising from midchannel it is probably a less marked feature than the congo for in june after the malka or fourteen days of incessant rain the author speaks of whirlpools not of a regular break  i thus make the distance of the yellala from the mouth between 116 and 117 miles and the total fall 390 feet of which about one half 195 occurs in the sixtyfour miles between boma and the yellala of this figure again 100 feet belong to the section of five miles between the vivi and the great rapids the zambeze according to dr livingstone first expedition p 284 has a steeper declivity than some other great rivers reaching even 7 inches per mile with 3 to 4 inches the ganges the amazonas and the mississippi flow at the rate of three knots an hour in the lowest season and five or six during the flood what then may be expected from the nzadi  according to the people beyond the small upper fall where projections shut out the view the channel smoothens for a short space and carries canoes native travellers from nkulu usually take the mountainpath cutting across an easterly bend of the bed to banza menzi the manzy of tuckeys text and the menzi macooloo of his map it is situated on a level platform 9 miles north of nkulu and they find the stream still violent the second march is to banza ninga by the first expedition called inga an indirect line of five hours  15 miles the third of about the same distance makes banza mavunda where 20 to 24 miles above the yellala tuckey found the river once more navigable clear in the middle and flowing at the rate of two miles an houra retardation evidently caused by the rapids beyond i have remarked this effect in the brazilian cachoeirasfn32 above it the nzadi widens and canoeing is practicable with portages at the two sangallas the southern feature double like the yellala shows an upper and a lower break separated by two miles the rapids being formed as usual by sunken ledges of rock two days paddling lead to the northern or highest sangalla which obstructs the stream for 22 miles tuckey p 184 makes his songo sangalla contain three rapids prof smith whose topography is painfully vague doubles the number at the same time he makes sanga jalala p 327 the uppermost fall but one and the highest finally at nsundi on the map soondy nsanga which was reached on sept 9 a picturesque sandy cove at the opening of a creek behind along projecting point begins a lake like river three miles broad with fine open country on both banks the explorer describes it as beautiful scenery equal to anything on the banks of the thames  here the nzadi is bounded by low limestone hills already showing the alluvial basin of central africa and the land is well populated because calcareous districts are fertile in the tropics and provisions are plentiful prof smith p 336 was so much enraptured with the improved appearance of the country and the magnificence of the river that it was with the greatest difficulty he was prevailed on to return of course the coaster middlemen report the people to be cannibals  from the vivi rapids to nsundi along the windings of the bed is a total of 115 miles about the distance of vivi to the sea the direct land march was 75 miles captain tuckey heard nothing of the lumini river entering 43 leagues above the yellala and he gives no professional opinion touching the navigability of the total of six greater rapids which to judge from what i saw can hardly offer any serious obstruction to the development of the nzadi  at nkulu an intelligent native traveller whom i examined through the interpreters strongly advised the line of the southern bank five stages would lead to nsundi and the ten kings on the road are not such rapacious gentlemen as our present hosts a glance at tuckeys map shows that this southern line cuts across a long westerly deflection of the bed  i had been warned when setting out that a shipful of goods would not take me past nkulu this was soon confirmed on the evening after arrival i had directed my interpreter to sound the bush kings touching the expense of a march to nsundi they modestly demanded 100 lbs of beads fifty kegs of powder forty demijohns of rum twelve uniforms ten burnuses a few swords and 200 whole pieces of various expensive cloths such as costa finas riscados and satin stripesbriefly about £300 for three days march it suggested the modest demand made by king adooley of badagry from the brothers lander  the air of nkulu was a cordial the aspect of the land suggested that it is the threshold to a country singularly fertile and delicious in fact the paradise which bishop berkeley gaudentio di lucca placed in central africa the heat of the lowlands had disappeared                      the scorching ray           here pierceth not impregnate with disease  the thermometer it is true did not sink below 67° f whilst the expedition p 118 had found it 60° in august even at boma during the dewy nights the lowest temperature of the water was 75° and the highest 79° whereas at the mouth it is sometimes 83° tuckey gives 76°77° 74° in the upper river above the falls and 73° where there are limestone springs the oxydization of iron suddenly ceased after a single days drying the plants were ready for a journey to england and meat which wrill hardly keep one day in the lowlands is here eatable on the fifth  whilst the important subject of dash was being discussed i set out in my hammock to visit a quitanda or market held hard by as we started the women sang            lungwá u telemene ko            mwanza ko yellala o kwenda  the boat that arrives at the mwanza the river the same shall go up to the yellala rapids it is part of a chant which the mothers of men now old taught them in childhood and the sole reminiscence of the congo expedition whose double boats the ajôjôs of the brazil struck their rude minds half a century ago  these quitandas are attended by people living a dozen miles off and they give names to the days which consequently everywhere vary thus at boma friday saturday sunday and monday are respectively called nkenge sona kandu and konzo this style of dividing time which is common throughout pagan west africa is commonly styled a week thus the abbé proyart tells us that the loango week consists of four days and that on the fourth the men rest by hunting and going to market tuckey also recognizes the week of four days opposed to the seven days week of the gold coast  after half an hours run to the northwest my bearers raising loud shouts of alii vai sempre dashed into the marketplace where about a hundred souls were assembled the women rose in terror from their baskets and piles of vendibles some began hastily to pack up others threw themselves into the bush order was soon restored by the interpreter both sexes and all ages crowded round me with hootings of wonder and when they had stared their fill allowed me to sit down under a kind of ficus not unlike the banyantree ficus indica tuckey p 181 says that this fig is planted in all marketplaces and is considered sacred his people got into trouble by piling their muskets against one of them i heard of nothing of the kind the scanty suppliesa few fowls sundried fish kolanuts beans and red pepperswere spread upon skins or stored in wellworked baskets an art carried to perfection in africa even the somali bedawin weave pots that will hold water the small change was represented by a medium which even montesquieu would not set down as a certain mark of civilization the horseshoe of loggun denham and clapperton the fán fleam the small piece of iron like an ace of spades on the upper nile baker and the iron money of the brachycephalic nyamnyams described and drawn by schwein furth i 279 here becomes a triangle or demisquare of bastcloth about 5 inches of max length fringed coloured like a torchon after a month of kitchen use and worth onetwentieth of the dollar or fathom of cloth these moneymats or coinclouts are known to old travellers as macuitas and libonges in angolan libangos carli and merolla make them equivalent to brass money the former were grasscloth a yard long and ten  100 reis in 1694 they were changed at angola for a small copper coin worth 2 12 d and the change caused a disturbance for which five soldiers were shot silver was represented by intagas thick cottons the size of two large kerchiefs  is 6d and folingas finer sorts used for waistcloths  3s 6d and gold by beirames alii biramis carli says the latter are coarse indian cottons 5 ells long and each  200 reis others describe them as fine linen each piece worth 7s 6d to 8s the banknote was the indian piece or mulech a young black about twenty years of age worth 20 mil keys dollars each carli in the barbots day each coinclout was equivalent to 2d some were unmarked whilst others bore the portuguese arms single or double the wilder krumen still keep up their buyapart  25 cents a cloth 4 inches square and thickly sewn over with cowries  the only liquor was palm wine in huge calabashes the smoking of lyamba bhang or cannabis sativa seems to become more common as we advance i did not find the plant growing as did dr livingstone at linyanti and amongst the batoka first expedition 198 541 the pipe is the gourd of a baobab which here sometimes grows a foot and a half long it is cleared filled with water and provided with a wooden tube fixed in the upper part away from the mouth and supporting a small chillam or bowl of badly baked clay the people when smoking affect the bunched shoulders the deep inhalation and the loud and body shaking bark which seems inseparable from the enjoyment of this stimulant i have used it for months together and my conclusion is that mostly the cough is an affectation tobacco is smoked in the usual heavy clay pipes with long mouthpieces of soft wood quite as civilized as the best european progress seems unknown to the pipe the most advanced nations are somewhat behind the barbarians and in the matter of snuff the tupi or brazilian savage has never been rivalled  the greater part of the vendors seemed to be women of the buyers men there was more difference of appearance than in any european fair and the population about nkulu seemed to be a very mixed race some were ultranegro of the dead dullblack type prognathous and longheaded like apes others were of the red variety with hair and eyes of a brownish tinge and a few had features which if whitewashed could hardly be distinguished from europeans the tattoo was remarkable as amongst the tribes of the lower zambezefn33 there were waistcoats epaulettes braces and crossbelts of huge welts and raised polished lumps which must have cost not a little suffering the skin is pinched up between the fingers and sawn across with a bluntish knife the deeper the better various plants are used as styptics and the proper size of the cicatrice is maintained by constant pressure which makes the flesh protrude from the wound the teeth were as barbarously mutilated as the skin these had all the incisors sharptipped those chipped a chevronshaped hole in the two upper or lower frontals and not a few seemed to attempt converting the whole denture into molars the legs were undeniably fine even hieland marys would hardly be admired here whilst the brown mothers smoked and carried their babies the men bore guns adorned with brass tacks or leaned upon their short straight conical spuds and hoes longhandled bits of iron whose points after african fashion passed through the wood i nowhere saw the handsome carved spoons the hafts and knifesheaths figured by the congo expedition  we left the quitanda with the same shouting and rushing which accompanied my appearance                                chapter xv                     return to the congo mouth    in the evening there was a palaver  i need hardly say that my guide after being paid to show me nsundi never had the slightest intention to go beyond the yellala irritated by sleeping in the open air and by the total want of hospitality amongst the bushmen he and his moleques had sat apart all day the picture of stubborn discontent and                      not a man in the place           but had discontent written large in his face  i proposed to send back a party for rum powder and cloth to the extent of £150 or half the demand and my factotum selim behaved like a trump gidi mavunga quite beyond selfcontrol sprang up and declared that if the mundele would not follow him that obstinate person might remain behind the normal official deprecation as usual made him the more headstrong he rushed off and disappeared in the bush followed by a part of his slaves the others crying aloud to him wenda get out seeing that the three linguisters did not move he presently returned and after a furious address in fiote began a portuguese tirade for my benefit this white man had come to their country and instead of buying captives was bent upon enslaving their mfumos but that branco should suffer for his attempt no mukanda or book that is letter should go down stream all his goods belonged of right to his guide and thus he would learn to sit upon the heads of the noblesse with much of the same kind  there are times when the traveller either rises above or sinks to the level of or rather below his party i had been sitting abstractedly like the great quietist buddha when the looks of the assembly suggested an address this was at once delivered in portuguese with a loud and angry voice gidi mavunga who had been paid for nsundi not for the yellala had spoken like a small boy ie a chattel i had no wish to sit upon other mens heads but no man should sit on mine englishmen did not want slaves nor would they allow others to want them but they would not be made slaves themselves my goods were my own and king nessala not to speak of mambuco pratathe name toldhad made themselves responsible for me lastly if the senhor gidi mafung wanted to quarrel the contents of a colts sixshooter were at his disposal  such a tone would have made a european furious it had a contrary effect upon the african gidi mavunga advanced from his mat and taking my hand placed it upon his head declaring me his mwenemputo the linguisters then entered the circle chanted sundry speeches made little dances then bent their knuckles to earth much in the position of boys preparing to jump over their own joined hands dusted themselves and clapped palms very opportunely arrived a present from the king of fowls dried fish and plantains which restored joy to the camp mwenemputo i must explain primarily meaning the king of portugal is applied in east central africa to a negro king and chiefs the lands of the cazembe p 17 in loango also it is the name of a high native official and when used as in the text it is equivalent to mfumo chief or head of family  at night gidi mavunga came to our quarters and began to talk sense knowing that my time was limited he enlarged upon the badness of the road and the too evident end of the travelling season when the great rains would altogether prevent fast travel banza ninga the next stage was distant two or three marches and neither shelter nor provisions were to be found on the way here a canoe would carry us for a day 12 miles to the sangala rapids then would come the third portage of two days 22 miles to nsundi my outfit at banza nokki was wholly insufficient the riverine races were no longer tractable as in the days of his father when white men first visited the land my best plan was to return to boma at once organize a party and march upon congo grande s salvador there i should find whites portuguese englishmen and their krumen the term generally applied on the southern coast to all native employés of foreign traders if determined upon bring converted into black man i might join some trading party into the interior as regards the cloth and beads advanced by me for the journey to nsundi a fair proportion would be returned at banza nokki and so saying the old fox managed to look as if he meant what he said  all this taken with many a grain was reasonable the edge of my curiosity had been taken off by the yellala and nothing new could be expected from the smaller formations up stream time forbade me to linger at banza nkulu the exorbitant demand had evidently been made by express desire of gidi mavunga and only a fortnights delay could have reduced it to normal dimensions yet with leisure success was evident all the difficulties of the nsundi road would have vanished when faced the wild people showed no feeling against foreigners and the nkulu linguisters during their last visit begged me to return as soon as possible and no tell lie i could only promise that their claims should be laid before the public accordingly a report of this trip was at once sent in to her majestys foreign office and a paper was read before the british association of september 1864  early on thursday morning sept 17 we began the down march it was a repetition of the up march except that all were bent upon rushing home like asses to their stables none of those posés or regular halts on the line of march as practised by well trained voyageurs are known to congoland there was some reason for the hurry and travellers in these regions will do well to remember it or they may starve with abundance around them the kings and chiefs hold it their duty to entertain the outward bound but when cloth beads and rum have been exhausted the returning wanderer sits under a tree instead of entering the banza and it is only an exceptional householder who will send him a few eggs or plantains they cut you as a rule more coolly than ever town man cut a continental acquaintance finally the selfimposed hardships of the down march break mens spirits for further attempts and their cupidity cannot neutralize their natural indolence thus reinforced  we entered on the next afternoon gidi mavungas village where the lieges received him with shouts and handclappings at the papagayos there was a dance which lasted through that night and the next i stayed three days at chinguvu finishing my sketches but to have recovered anything from the guide would have required three weeks the old villain relaxed his vigilance over the women who for the first time were allowed to enter the doors without supervision merolla treats of this stale trick and exclaims            ah pereat didicit fallere si qua virum  i was reminded of the classical sentiment upon the rio de s francisco highlands of the brazil ii chap xiv where amongst other sentiments the boatmen severely denounce in song            mulher que engana tropeiro  as a rule throughout west africa where even the wildest tribes practise it the panel dodge served as dupuis remarked to supply the slavetrade and in places like abeokuta it became a nuisance the least penalty to which it leads is the confiscation of the lotharios goods and chattels foiled in his benevolent attempt the covetous senior presently entered the hut and began unceremoniously to open a package of cloth which did not belong to him selim cocked his revolver and placed it handy so the goods were afterwards respected  at length on sept 19 a piece of cloth 48 yards procured a canoe but calico and beads are not removed from an african settlement without disturbance my factotum has given a detailed account of the scenefn35 gidi mavunga so managed that the porters instead of proceeding straight to the stream marched upon banza nokki where his royal son was awaiting us worse still nessudikiras royal mother was there a large old virago who smoked like a steamengine and who swore awful the moleques were armed but none liked proceeding to extremes so after an unusually loud quarrel we reached the river in three hours and at 945 am we set out for boma  the down voyage was charming instead of hugging the southern bank we raced at a swinging pace down midstream a few showers had wonderfully improved the aspect of the land where            every tree well from his fellow grew            with branches broad laden with leaves new            that springen out against the sunny sheen            some very red and some a glad light green  and the first breath of spring gave life to the queer antediluvian vegetationcalabash and cactus palmyra bombax and fern an admirable mirage lifted the canoes which preceded us clean out of the river and looking down stream the water seemed to flow up hill as it does according to mrs in the aqueducts of madeira although the tide began to flow up shortly after 10 am and the seabreeze wafe unusually strong we covered the fortyfive miles in 7 hrs 15 m amidst shouts of izakula mundehwhite men cum agenwe landed at boma and found that the hospitable sr pereira had waited dinner to which i applied myself most wishedly  once more in civilization we prepared for a march upon s salvador  no white man at boma knew anything of the road to the old capital but as a letter had been received from it after three days march there was evidently no difficulty i wrote to porto da lenha for an extra supply of black money which was punctually forwarded both chico furano and nihama chamvu volunteered for the journey and preparations were progressing as rapidly as could be expected in these slowmoving lands when they were brought to the abruptest conclusion on the 24th sept a letter from the commodore of the station informed me that i had been appointed h ms commissioner to dahome and that unless i could at once sail in hms griffon no other opportunity would be found for some time the only step left was to apply for a canoe and after a kindly farewell to my excellent host i left boma on the evening of sept 25  with a view of doing the mosquitoes we ran down the nshibul or central arm of the nzadi and found none of the whirlpools mentioned by the expedition near fetish rock the bright clear night showed us silhouettes of dark holms high and wooded to the north and southwards banks of papyrus outlying long straggling lines of thin islands like a huge caterpillar the canoemen attempted to land at one place declaring that some king wanted dash but we were now too strong for them these fellows if allowed will halt to speak every boat on the river the wind fell to a dead calm and five hours and a half sufficed to cover the thirty miles between boma and porto da lenha here mr scott supplied me with a fine canoe and a fresh crew of seven paddles  the noon was grey and still as we left the whydah of the south but at 2 pm the seabreeze came up stiff and sudden the tide also began to flow the river roared the meeting of wind and water produced what the indus boatmen call a lahar tide rip and the thalweg became almost as rough as the yellala our canoe was literally            laying her whole side on the sea            as a leaping fish does  unwilling to risk swamping my instruments i put into the northern bank where our friend the palhabote espérance passed under a tricolour and manned only by laptots as we waved a signal to them they replied with a straggling fire of musketry to what they considered a treacherous move on the part of plundering musurungus at sunset a lump of scirrhus before the sun was so dense that its dark shadow formed a brush like the trabes of a comet this soon melted away and a beautifully diaphanous night tempted us to move towards the dreary funnel of darkness which opened ahead the clouds began to pour again the stream became rough and the swift upper or surface current meeting the crosstide below represented an agitated race of portland wet and weary we reached banana point on sunday sept 27 1863 fortunately not too late for the mail and next day i was on board griffon ready for dahome and for my late host king gelele                                chapter xvi         the slaver and the missionary in the congo river    in the preceding pages some details have been given concerning domestic slavery upon the congo river like polygamy the system of barbarous and semibarbarous races it must be held provisional but in neither case can we see any chance of present end should the moslem wave of conquest in a moral as well as a material form sweepand i am persuaded that it will sweepfrom north africa across the equator the effect will be only to establish both these patriarchal institutions upon a stronger and a more rational basis  all who believe in progress are socially antislavers as we all are politically republicans but between the two extremes between despotism in which society is regimented like an army and liberty where all men are theoretically free and equal there are infinite shades of solid rule and government which the wisdom of nations adapts to their wants the medium of constitutional monarchy or hereditary presidentship recommends itself under existing circumstances to the more advanced peoples and with good reason we nowhere find a prevalence of those manly virtues disinterestedness and selfsacrifice to the respublica which rendered the endurance of ancient republics possible rome could hardly have ruled the world for centuries had her merchants supplied carthage with improved triremes or furnished the parthians with the latest style of weapons we must be wise and virtuous before we can hope to be good republicans and man in the mass is not yet homo sapiens he is not wise and certainly he is not virtuous  the present state of africa suggests two questions concerning the abolition of the export slavetrade which must be kept essentially distinct from domestic servitude the first is does the change benefit the negro into this extensive subject i do not propose to enter contenting myself with recording a negative answer but upon the second is the world ready for its abolition i would offer a few remarks they will be ungrateful to that small but active faction which has laboured so long and so hard to misinform the english public concerning africa and which is as little fitted to teach anything about the african as to legislate for mongolian tartary it has prevailed for a time to the great injury of the cause and we cannot but see its effects in almost every step taken by the englishman civilian or soldier who lands his british opinions and prejudices on the west coast and who utterly ignoring the fact that the african as far as his small interests are concerned is one of the clearest sighted of men unhesitatingly puts forth addresses and proclamations which he would not think of submitting to europeans but i have faith in my countrymen if there be any nation that deserves to be looked upon as the arbiter of public opinion in europe it is england proper which to the political education of many generations adds an innate sense of moderation of justice and of fair play and a suspicion of extreme measures however theoretically perfect which do not exist elsewhere heinrich heine expressed this idea after his maccabean fashion ask the stupidest englishman a question of politics and he will say something clever ask the cleverest englishman a question of religion and he will say something stupid hence the wellwishers of england can feel nothing but regret when they find her clear and cold light of reason obscured as it has been upon the negro question by the mists and clouds of sentimental passion and their first desire is to see this weakness pass away   i unhesitatingly assertand all unprejudiced travellers will agree with methat the world still wants the black hand enormous tropical regions yet await the clearing and the draining operations by the lower races which will fit them to become the dwellingplace of civilized man  but slaveexportation is practically dead we would not revive it nor indeed could we the revival would be a new institution completely in disaccord with the spirit of the age it is for us to find something which shall take its place and which shall satisfy the just aspirations of those who see their industry and energy neutralized by want of labour i need hardly say that all requirements would be met by negroemigration and that not only africa but the world of the east as well as of the west call for some measure of the kind the cooly from hindostan may in time become a valuable article but it will be long before he can be induced to emigrate in sufficient numbers the chinese will be a mistake when the neglected resources of the mighty central empire mineral and others shall be ready to be developed as they soon must under the supervision of europeans it remains only for us to draw upon the great labourbank of negroland  a bonâ fide emigration a free engagé system would be a boon to western and inner africa where the tribes live in an almost continual state of petty warfare the antislavers and the abolitionists of course represent this to be the effect of the european trade in mans flesh and blood but it prevails and has ever prevailed and long will prevail even amongst peoples which have never sent a head of negro to the coast and there is a large class of men captured in battle and a host of those condemned to death by savage superstition whose lives can be saved only by their exportation which indeed is the african form of transportation we believe says the abbé proyart 1776 that the father sells his son and the prince his subjects he only who has lived among them can know that it is not even lawful for a man to sell his slave if he be born in the country unless he have incurred that penalty by certain crimes specified by law  it will be objected that any scheme of the kind must be so involved in complicated difficulties that it cannot fail to degenerate into the old export slavetrade this i deny admitting that such must at first be its tendency i am persuaded that the details can so be controlled as to secure the use without the abuse women and children for instance should never be allowed on board ship unless accompanying husbands and parents those who speak some words of a foreign tongue english french spanish or portuguese and on the eastern coast hindostani might lead the way to be followed in due time by the wilder races probably the best ground for the trial would be the island of zanzibar where we can completely control its operations and what should lend us patience and courage to meet and to beat down all difficulties is the consideration that success will be the sole possible means independent of el islam of civilizing or rather of humanizing the dark continent the excellent abbé proyart begins his history of loango with the wise and memorable words touching the africans these people have viceswhat people is exempt from vice but were they even more wicked and more vicious they would be so much the more entitled to the commiseration and good offices of their fellow men and should the missionary despair of making them christians men ought still to endeavour to make them men  the free emigration schemes hitherto attempted have been mere snares and delusions chiefly i hold because the age was not ripe for them in 1844 three agencies were established at sierra leone for supplying hands to british guiana trinidad and jamaica as wages they offered per diem 075 to 1 with leave to return at pleasure the liberated preferred however to live upon sixpence at home suspecting that the bait was intended as a lure to captivity nor were their fears lulled by the fact that the agents shipped amongst 250 volunteers some seventysix wild slaves fresh captives who were not allowed to communicate with their fellowcountrymen ashore in 1850 certain correspondents from liverpool inquired of king eyo honesty if he could provide for service in the west indies 10000 men women and children as the quotum from the old calabar river which would mean 100000 from the west coast he be all same ole slavetrade very justly remarked that knowing potentate he added that he would respect the suppression treaty with england and that he personally preferred palmoil but that all the calabar gentlemen and the neighbouring kings would be glad to supply slaves at a fixed price four boxes of brass and copper rods  followed in 18523 the gigantic scheme of mm régis et cie which began operations upon the east as well as the west coast of africa having studied it on both sides of the continent i could not help forming the worst opinion of the attempt the agents never spoke of it except as a slave trade the facetiæ touching achat and rachat were highly suited to african taste and i have often heard them declare before the people that captives are the only articles which can profitably be exported from the coastsin fact as old caspar barlé said precipuæ merces ipsi ethiopes sunt i subjoin to this chapter the form of french passport it will serve when a bonâ fide emigration shall be attempted to show how not to do it happily this emigration has come to an end m régis seeing no results gave orders to sell off all the goods in his factories and to retain only one clerk as housekeeper the ouvriers libres deserted and fled in all directions for fear of being put in a cannibal pot and being eaten by the white anthropophagi  the history of missionary enterprise in the congo regions is not less interesting than the slavetrade the first missioners sailed in december 1490 under goncalo de sousa of the three one were killed by the heat and another having made himself chaplain to the congolan army by a giaghi chief the seed sown by these friars was cultivated by twelve franciscans of the order of observants the right reverend fathers of the company appeared in 1560 with the conquistador paulo dias de novaes according to lopez de lima who seems to endorse the saying si cum jesuitis non cum jesu itis they worried one captain general to death and they attempted to found in congoland another uruguay or paraguay but here they totally failed and as yet indeed they have not carried out either in east or west africa the celebrated boast popularly attributed to their general borgia 1572            we shall come in like the lambs            we shall be driven out like the dogs            we shall rush like the wolves            we shall be icnewed like the eagles  the baptism of d alvaro i 1491 the founding of the cathedral at s salvador 1534 the appointment of the bishop and chapter and their transfer to são paulo de loanda 1627 have already been alluded to  according to fathers carli and merolla pope alexander vii sent twelve to fifteen capuchins and apostolic missioners who baptized the king and queen of congo and the count of sonho between ad 1490 and 1690 were the palmy days of christianity in congoland and for two centuries it was more or less the state religion after this great effort missionary zeal seems to have waxed cold and disestablishment resulted as happens in such cases from unbelief within and violent assaults from without under the attacks of the dutch and french the church seems to have lost ground during the eighteenth century in ad 1682 the number of propagandists in sonho fell from a father superior and six missioners to two merolla in ad 1700 james barbot found at sonho only two portuguese friars of the order of bernardins in ad 1768 the loango mission was established and in ad 1777 the fathers were followed by four italian priests sent by the propaganda for the purpose of rechristianizing sonho embarking at la rochelle they entered the nzadi where one died of poison and the survivors escaped only by stratagem christianity fell before the old heathenism and in 1814 we find the king of congo d garcia v complaining to his most faithful majesty that missioners were sadly wanted captain tuckeys expedition ad 1816 well sets forth the spiritual destitution of the land he tells us that three years before his arrival some missionaries had been murdered by the sohnese the only specimen he met was an ignorant halfcaste with a diploma from the capuchins of loanda and a wife plus five concubines in 1863 i found that all traces of christianity had disappeared  these reverendswho were allowed to dispense with any irregularity except bigamy or wilful murder and to read forbidden books except machiaveltook the title of nganga mfumofn35lord medicineman in the fulness of early zeal they built at s salvador the cathedral of santa cruz a jesuit college a capuchin convent the residence of the father superior maintained by the king of portugal a religious house for the franciscans an establishment for the bishop and his chapter and halfadozen stone churches all these edifices have long been in ruins  father cavazzi da monte cuccoli denis de carli and merolla themselves missioners have left us ample accounts of the ecclesiastical rule which during its short tenure of office bore a remarkable family resemblance to that of the jesuit missions in south america the religious despotism was complete a tyranny grossly aggravated by the credulity the bigotry and the superstitioni will not say of the age because such things are of all ages but of the imperfect education which the age afforded there was no improvement but rather a deterioration from the days of pliny one father tells the converts that comets forbode ill to the world another describes a bird not much unlike a sparrow at first sight it seems wholly black but upon a nearer view it looks blue the excellency of its song is that it harmoniously and articulately pronounces the name of jesus christ a third remarks they the heathen are excited by the heavens forming a cross under the zone they are excited by the mountains which have the cross carved on them without knowing by whom they are excited by the earth which draws the crucifix in its fruit called nicefo yet all these things are of little force to move the hearts of those gentiles who scoffingly cry when we are sick forsooth the wood of this cross will cure us another father resolving to denounce certain heathen practices placed on the feast of purification an image of the virgin in relievo upon the altar and with a dagger struck through her breast on which the blood followed like mark antony he improved the occasion and sent home the fathers of families to thrash their wives and daughters who were shut up in the paint houses it is gravely related how a hungry friar dines copiously on fish with an angel how another was saved by the father of miracles the glorious saint anthony of padua whom another priest taking as his patron sees before his hammock a woman bearing a child in her arms and supposed to be the virgin attends the portuguese army and she again appears in the shape of a beautiful beggar the miraculous resurrection of a boiled cock is gravely chronicled a certain man lived 380 years at the intercession of saint francis dassise of course the missioners saw watermonsters in the congo river a child came from his mothers womb with a beard and all his teeth perhaps to show he was born into the world grown old in vice a certain scoffer being one day to pass a river with two companions was visibly taken up by an invisible hand into the air one of his companions going to take hold of him by the feet had such a cuff given him that he fell down in the boat and the offender was seen no more father merolla talks of a breed in the cabo verde islands between bulls and sheasses which they compassed by binding a cows hide upon the latter it would be worth inquiring if this was ever attempted and it might add to our traditions about the jumart and the tale of the elephanthunters deceiving the animals by anointing themselves with their droppings deserves investigation wounds of poisoned arrows are healed by that which produced them a womans milk cures the venomous foam which cobras spit into the eyes a snake as big as a beam kills and consumes men with its look an ill liver reprimanded by his father for vicious inclinations fires a pistol at him the rebound of the bullet from the paternal forehead which remains whole severely wounds the wouldbe parricide the ablest surgeons cannot heal the hurt and the flesh ever continues to be sore and raw upon the forehead acting like the brand of cain  it is said that two of a trade never agree and accordingly we find the hottest wrath of the missioners vented upon their rival brethren the ngangas or medicinemen in africa and the pages or tupi doctors in south america the priestly presence deprives an idol of all its powers the sacerdotal power annihilates all charms and devices thereby showing that the performances of christs ministers are always above those of the devils these scinghili or gods of the earth magicians can sink boats be ferried over rivers by crocodiles and converse with tigers serpents lions and other wild animals the great ugly wizards are sent martyrs to the devil on all possible occasions one father soundly belabours one of these wicked magi with the cord of his order invoking all the while the aid of saint michael and the rest of the saints he enters the hellish tabernacle arming himself frequently with the sign of the cross but he retreats for fear of a mischief from the poor deluded pagansshowing that he is after all but an unbelieving thomas on the other hand the wizards solidly revenged themselves by killing and eating father philip da salesia and the deluded ones must have found some difficulty in discovering the superiority of exotic over indigenous superstitions when there is a calm at sea the sailors stick their patron against the mast and kneeling before him say saint antony our countryman you shall be pleased to stand there till you have given us a fair wind to continue our voyage a certain bishop of congo makes the sign of the cross upon a banyantree whereupon it immediately died like the figtree cursed by oursaviour a ship is sunk in a trice for not having a chaplain on board her the missioners strongly recommend medals relics agnidei and palmleaves consecrated on palm sundays they rage furiously against and they flog those who wear wizards mats against magic cords fastened round young children as amulets and against the teeth and bones of animals and cloth made from the rind of certain trees carried as preservatives from disease and supernatural influences even banners in burialplaces are superstitious and blamable they claim the power of stopping rain by cursing the air and of producing it by prayer and by a devout procession to our lady of pinda a belief truly worthy of the nganga and a fast ship is stranded that men may learn to honour holidays better when the magicians swear falsely they either burst like judas or languish and diea warning to be more cautious how they jest with god an old hag grumbling after a brutish manner proceeds to bewitch a good father to death by digging a hole and planting a certain herb the ecclesiastic resolved to defeat her object by not standing long in one place he remembers the saying of the wise man mulier nequam plaga mortis and at last by ordering her off in the name of the blessed trinity and the holy virgin withal gently blowing towards her she all of a sudden giving three leaps and howling thrice flies away in a trice the bolungo or chilumbo oath or ordeal is of course a hellish ceremony demons play as active a part in africa as in china the portuguese nuncio permits the people in their simplicity to light candles before and to worship the socalled bull of the blessed sacrament that by which urban viii allowed the congo kings to be crowned after the catholic manner by the capuchins because the paper bears the venerable effigies  priests may be good servants but they are mundanely speaking bad masters the ecclesiastical tyranny exercised upon the people from the highest to the lowest goes far to account for the extinction of christianity in the country where so much was done to spread it the kings of congoland who tread on the lion in the kingdom of their mothers must abjectly address their spiritual lords i conjure you prostrate at your holy feet to hearken to my words whilst the friars talk of that meekness which becomes a missioner their unwise and unwarrantable interference extends to the count of sonho himself whose election was not valid unless published in the church owning withal that though a black he is an absolute prince and not unworthy of a crown though he were even in italy considering the number of his servants and the extent of his dominions they issue eight ordinances or spiritual memorandums degrading governors of cities and provinces who are not properly married who neglect mass or who do not keep saints festivals flogging seems to have been the punishment of all infractions of discipline for those who used magic guards to their fields instead of setting the sign of the cross and for all who did not teach their children to repeat so many times a day the rosary or the crown in honour of the blessed virgin to fast on saturdays to eat no flesh on wednesdays and such things used among christians one of the mwanis governors refuses to grub up and level with his own hands a certain grove where the hellish trade magic was practised he is commanded to discipline himself in the church during the whole time of celebrating mass if the governor is negligent in warning the people that a missioner has arrived he will receive a deserved punishment for we make it our business to get such a person removed from his employment even within his yeara system of temporal penalties affixed to spiritual lâches not unknown elsewhere the following anecdote will show the style of reproof father benedict da belvedere a neapolitan who had preached at rome and was likewise confessor to the nuns heard the chief elector one of the principal nobles asking the heretical question are we not all to be saved by baptism a sound box on the ear was the reply and it led to a tumult the head of the mission sent for the offended dignitary and offered him absolution if he would sincerely recant his words and beg pardon of the churchman militant the answer was that would be pleasant indeed he was the aggressor yet i must make the excuse must i receive a blow and notwithstanding be thought to have done wrong but the peacemaker explained that the blow was given not to offend but to defend from hearkening to heresies that it was administered moreover out of paternal affection by a spiritual father whom it did not misbecome to a son who was not dishonoured by receiving it the unfortunate elector not only suffered in the ear but was also obliged to make an abject apology and to kiss the offenders feet before he was readmitted to communion at maopongo the priests lost favour with the court and the women by whipping the queen and by the same process they abated the superhuman pretensions of the blacksmith  when the chiefs and princes were so treated what could the subjects expect the smallest ecclesiastical faults were punished with fining and a talmudic flogging and for disobedience a man was sent bound to brazil a thing they are more than ordinarily afraid of a man taking to wife after the mosaic law a woman left in widowhood by his kinsman is severely scourged and the same happens to a man who marries his cousin besides being deprived of a profitable employment every city and town in sonho had a square with a central cross where those who had not satisfied the easter command or who died unconfessed were buried without privilege of clergy the missioners insist upon their privilege of travelling free of expense and make a barefaced use of the corvée the following is the tone of a mild address to the laity some among you are like your own maccacos or monkeys amongst us who keeping possession of anything they have stolen will sooner suffer themselves to be taken and killed than to let go their prey so impure swine wallow in their filth and care not to be cleansed  a perpetual source of trouble was of course the slavetrade negroes being the staple of the land and ivory the other and minor item the great profits could not fail to render it the subject of contention the reasons why the portuguese never succeeded in making themselves masters of sonho are reduced by the missioner annalists to three firstly the opposition of the people caused by fear secondly the objections of the sonhese to buying arms and ammunition and thirdly the small price paid by the portuguese for captives the most reverend cardinal cibo writing in the name of the sacred college complained that the pernicious and abominable abuse of slaveselling was carried on under the eyes of the missioners and peremptorily ordered them to remedy the evil finding this practically impossible the holy men salved their consciences by ordering their flocks not to supply negroes to the heretical hollanders and english whose religion is so very contrary to ours but to the portuguese who would withdraw the poor souls out of the power of lucifer one father goes so far in his fear of heretical influences as to remunerate by the gift of a slave the dealer ferdinando gomez who had supplied him with a flask of wine for the sacrament and some other small things yet he owns f gomez to be a rogue  as the portuguese would not pay high prices like the heretics disturbances resulted and these were put down by the desperate expedient of shutting the churchdoorsa suicidal act not yet quite obsolete whereupon the count of sonho we are told changed his countenance almost from black to yellow and complained to the bishop at loanda that the sacraments were not administered the appeal was in vain and worse an extra aid was sent to the truculent churchmen happily for them the small pox broke out and the ruler was persuaded by his subjects to do the required penance appearing at the convent unattended with a large rope round his neck clad in sackcloth crowned with thorns unshod and carrying a crucifix he knelt down and kissed the feet of the priest who said to him if thou hast sinned like david imitate him likewise in thy repentance  the schismatics caused abundant trouble captain cornelius clas went about sowing heretical tares amidst the true corn of the gospel amongst other damnable doctrines and subtleties this nautical and volunteer theologian persuaded the blacks whom he knew to be desirous of greater liberty in such matters that baptism is the only sacrament necessary to salvation because it takes away original sin as the blood of the saviour actual sin he furthermore impudently disowned the real presence in the consecrated host he invoked saint anthony although his tribe generally denies that praying to saints can be of any use to man and he declared that priests should preach certain doctrines which by the way were perniciously heretical thus in a single hour he so prevailed upon those miserable negroes that their hearts became quite as black as their faces an especially offensive practice of the hollanders in the eyes of the good shepherds was that of asking the feminine sheep for a whiff of tobaccoit being a country custom to consider the taking a pipe from a womans mouth a probable earnest of future favours when an english ship entered the river the priests forbade by manifesto the sale of slaves to the captain he being a briton ergò a heretic despite the duke of york the count of sonho disobeyed and was excommunicated accordingly he took his punishment with much patience although upon occasions of reproof he would fly into passions and disdains he was reconciled only after obliging 400 couples that lived in concubinage to lawful wedlock and thus a number of strayed souls was reduced to matrimony  we can hardly wonder that under such discipline a large ecclesiastical body was necessary to maintain the country in its due obedience to the christian faith and that despite their charity in alms and their learning no permanent footing was possible for the strangers nor can we be astonished that the good fathers so frequently complain of being poisoned on one occasion a batch of six was thus treated near bamba in this matter perhaps they were somewhat fanciful as the white man in india is disposed to be one of them for instance cured himself with a fruit called a lemon and an elkhoof from what he took to be poison but what was possibly the effect of too much pease and pullet broth in o muata cazembe pp 6566 we find that the asiatic portuguese attach great value to the hoof of the nhumbo a gnu they call it unha de grãbesta and use it even in the gottacoral epilepsy  and yet many of these ecclesiastics whom lopez de lima justly terms fabulistas were industrious and sensible men where religion was not concerned they carefully studied the country its situation possessions habitations and clothing they formed always outside their faith the justest estimate of their black fellowcreatures i cannot too often repeat father merollas dictum the reader may perceive that the negroes are both a malicious and subtle people that spend the most part of their time in circumventing and deceiving  nor has spiritual despotism been confined to the catholic missions in west africa certain john knoxes in the old calabar river have repeated especially in the case of the king young eyo whom they excluded from communion all the abuses and the errors of judgment of the seventeenth century with the modifications of the nineteenth and we must not readily endorse dr livingstones professional opinion in view of the desolate condition of this fine missionary field it is more than probable that the presence of a few protestants would soon provoke the priests if not to love to good works such is not the history of our propagandism about the cape of good hope dr gustav fritsch the natives of south africa 1872 thus speaks of the missionary livingstone who must not be confounded with the great explorer livingstone a man who is borne onward by religious enthusiasm and a glowing ambition without our being able to say which of these two levers works more powerfully in his soul certain it is that he endured more labours and overcame more geographical difficulties than any other african traveller either before or after him yet it is also sure that on account of the defective naturalhistorical education of the author and the indiscreet partisanship for the natives against the settlers his works have spread many false views concerning south africa this i doubt not will be the verdict of posterity see anthropologia in which are included the proceedings of the london anthropological society inaugurated 22 january 1873 no 1 october 1873 london baillière tindall and co the review pp 89102 bears the wellknown initials j b d and it is not saying too much that no man in england is so well fitted as dr davis to write it i quote these passages without any feeling of disrespect for the memory of the great african explorer truth is a higher duty even than generous appreciation of a heroic name and the time will come when negrophilism must succumb to fact                               chapter xvii                        concluding remarks    i have thus attempted to trace a picture of the congo river in the latter days of the slavetrade and of its lineal descendant limmigration africaine the people at large are satisfied and the main supporters of the trafficthe chiefs the medicine men and the white tradershave at length been powerless to arrest its destruction  and here we may quote certain words of wisdom from the congo expedition in 1816 it is not to be expected that the effects of abolition will be immediately perceptible on the contrary it will probably require more than one generation to become apparent for effects which have been the consequence of a practice of three centuries will certainly continue long after the cause is removed the allusion in the sentence which i have italicized is of course to the american exportationdomestic slavery must date from the earliest ages these sensible remarks conclude with advocating colonization in the cause of civilization a process which at present cannot be too strongly deprecated  that the nzadi is capable of supplying something better than slaves may be shown by a list of what its banks produce merolla says in 1682 cotton here is to be gathered in great abundance and the shrubs it grows on are so prolific that they never almost leave sprouting captain tuckey narrative p 120 declares the only vegetable production at boma of any consequence in commerce is cotton which grows wild most luxuriantly but the natives have ceased to gather it since the english have left off trading to the river i will not advocate tobacco cotton and sugar they are indigenous it is true but their cultivation is hardly fitted to the african in africa copper in small quantities has been brought from the interior but the mineral resources of the wide inland regions are wholly unknown if reports concerning mines on the plateau be trustworthy there will be a rush of white hands which must at once change and radically change all the conditions of the riverine country wax might be supplied in large quantities the natives however have not yet learnt to hive their bees ivory was so despised by the slavetrade that it was sent from the upper congo to mayumba and the other exporting harbours demand would certainly produce a small but regular supply  the two staples of commerce are now represented by palmoil which can be produced in quantities over the lowlands upon the whole river delta and along the banks from the mouth to boma a distance of at least fifty direct miles the second and the more important is the arachis or groundnut which flourishes throughout the highlands of the interior and which at the time of my visit was beginning to pay as the experience of some thirty years on different parts of the west coast has proved both these articles are highly adapted to the peculiarities of the negro cultivator they require little labour and they command a ready a regular and a constant sale  when time shall be ripe for a bonâ fide emigration the position of boma at the head of the delta a charming station with healthy air and delicious climate points it out as the head quarters houses can be built for nominal sums the neighbouring hills offer a sanatorium and due attention to diet and clothing will secure the white man from the inevitable sufferings that result from living near the lower course  with respect to the exploration of the upper stream these pages compared with the records of the first congo expedition will show the many changes which time has brought with it and will suggest the steps most likely to forward the travellers views at some period to come explorers will follow the line chosen by the unfortunate tuckey but the effects of the slavetrade must have passed away before that march can be made without much obstruction when lieutenant grandy did me the honour of asking my advice i suggested that he might avoid great delay and excessive outlay by turning the obstacle and by engaging cabindas instead of sierra leone men at the royal geographical society dec 14th 1874 he thus recorded his decision for the guidance of future travellers in the congo country i would suggest that all the carriers be engaged at sierra leone where any number can be obtained for 1s 3d a day from my experience of them i can safely say they will be found to answer every requirement and the employment of them would render an expedition entirely independent of the natives who by their cowardice and constant desertion entailed upon us such heavy expenses and serious delays my conviction after nearly four years of travel upon the west african coast is this if sierra leone men be used they must be mixed with cabindas and with congoese carregadores registered in presence of the portuguese authorities at s paulo de loanda  i conclude with the hope that the great nzadi one of the noblest and still the least known of the four principal african arteries will no longer be permitted to flow through the white blot a region unexplored and blank to geography as at the time of its creation and that my labours may contribute something however small to clear the way for the more fortunate explorer                                             appendix
