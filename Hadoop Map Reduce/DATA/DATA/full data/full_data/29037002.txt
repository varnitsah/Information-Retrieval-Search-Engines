of humblethwaite  chapter i  sir harry hotspur   sir harry hotspur of humblethwaite was a mighty person in cumberland and one who well understood of what nature were the duties and of what sort the magnificence which his position as a great english commoner required of him he had twenty thousand a year derived from land his forefathers had owned the same property in cumberland for nearly four centuries and an estate nearly as large in durham for more than a century and a half he had married an earls daughter and had always lived among men and women not only of high rank but also of high character he had kept racehorses when he was young as noblemen and gentlemen then did keep them with no view to profit calculating fairly their cost as a part of his annual outlay and thinking that it was the proper thing to do for the improvement of horses and for the amusement of the people he had been in parliament but had made no figure there and had given it up he still kept his house in bruton street and always spent a month or two in london but the life that he led was led at humblethwaite and there he was a great man with a great domain around himwith many tenants with a world of dependants among whom he spent his wealth freely saving little but lavishing nothing that was not his own to lavishunderstanding that his enjoyment was to come from the comfort and respect of others for whose welfare as he understood it the good things of this world had been bestowed upon him he was a proud man with but few intimacieswith a few dear friendships which were the solace of his lifealtogether gracious in his speech if it were not for an apparent bashfulness among strangers never assuming aught deferring much to others outwardly and showing his pride chiefly by a certain impalpable noli me tangere which just sufficed to make itself felt and obeyed at the first approach of any personal freedom he was a handsome manif an old man near to seventy may be handsomewith grey hair and bright keen eyes and arched eyebrows with a wellcut eagle nose and a small mouth and a short dimpled chin he was under the middle height but nevertheless commanded attention by his appearance he wore no beard save a slight grey whisker which was cut away before it reached his chin he was strongly made but not stout and was hale and active for his age  such was sir harry hotspur of humblethwaite the account of lady elizabeth his wife may be much shorter she was knownwhere she was knownsimply as sir harrys wife he indeed was one of those men of whom it may be said that everything appertaining to them takes its importance from the fact of its being theirs lady elizabeth was a good woman a good wife and a good mother and was twenty years younger than her husband he had been fortyfive years old when he had married her and she even yet had not forgotten the deference which was due to his age  two years before the time at which our story will begin a great sorrow an absolutely crushing grief had fallen upon the house of humblethwaite an only son had died just as he had reached his majority when the day came on which all humblethwaite and the surrounding villages were to have been told to rejoice and make merry because another man of the hotspurs was ready to take the reins of the house as soon as his father should have been gathered to his fathers the poor lad lay adying while his mother ministered by his bedside and the baronet was told by the physicianwho had been brought from londonthat there was no longer for him any hope that he should leave a male heir at humblethwaite to inherit his name and his honours  for months it was thought that lady elizabeth would follow her boy sir harry bore the blow bravely though none who do not understand the system well can conceive how the natural grief of the father was increased by the disappointment which had fallen upon the head of the house but the old man bore it well making but few audible moans shedding no tears altering in very little the habits of life still spending money because it was good for others that it should be spent and only speaking of his son when it was necessary for him to allude to those altered arrangements as to the family property which it was necessary that he should make but still he was a changed man as those perceived who watched him closest cloudesdale the butler knew well in what he was changed as did old hesketh the groom and gilsby the gamekeeper he had never been given to much talk but was now more silent than of yore of horses dogs and game there was no longer any mention whatever made by the baronet he was still constant with mr lanesby the steward because it was his duty to know everything that was done on the property but even mr lanesby would acknowledge that as to actual improvementsthe commencement of new work in the hope of future returns the baronet was not at all the man he had been how was it possible that he should be the man he had been when his life was so nearly gone and that other life had gone also which was to have been the renewal and continuation of his own  when the blow fell it became sir harrys imperative duty to make up his mind what he would do with his property as regarded the two estates they were now absolutely every acre of them at his own disposal he had one child left him a daughterin whom it is hoped the reader may be induced to take some interest and with her to feel some sympathy for she will be the person with whom the details of this little story must most be concerned and he had a male heir who must needs inherit the title of the family one george hotspurnot a nephew for sir harry had never had a brother but the son of a first cousin who had not himself been much esteemed at humblethwaite  now sir harry was a man who in such a condition as this in which he was now placed would mainly be guided by his ideas of duty for a month or two he said not a word to any one not even to his own lawyer though he himself had made a will a temporary will duly witnessed by mr lanesby and another so that the ownership of the property should not be adjusted simply by the chance direction of law in the event of his own sudden demise but his mind was doubtless much burdened with the subject how should he discharge this fresh responsibility which now rested on him while his boy had lived the responsibility of his property had had nothing for him but charms all was to go to the young harryall as a matter of course and it was only necessary for him to take care that every acre should descend to his heir not only unimpaired by him in value but also somewhat increased provision for his widow and for his girl had already been made before he had ventured on matrimonyprovision sufficient for many girls had fortune so far favoured him but that an eldest son should have all the family landone though as many sons should have been given to him as to priamand that that one should have it unencumbered as he had had it from his fatherthis was to him the very law of his being and he would have taught that son had already begun to teach him when the great blow came that all this was to be given to him not that he might put it into his own belly or wear it on his own back or even spend it as he might list himself but that he might so live as to do his part in maintaining that order of gentlehood in england by which england had becomeso thought sir harrythe proudest and the greatest and the justest of nations  but now he had no son and yet the duty remained to him of maintaining his order it would perhaps have been better for him it would certainly have been easier had some settlement or family entail fixed all things for him those who knew him well personally but did not know the affairs of his family declared among themselves that sir harry would take care that the property went with the title a marriage might be arranged there could be nothing to object to a marriage between second cousins at any rate sir harry hotspur was certainly not the man to separate the property from the title but they who knew the family and especially that branch of the family from which george hotspur came declared that sir harry would never give his daughter to such a one as was this cousin and if not his daughter then neither would he give to such a scapegrace either humblethwaite in cumberland or scarrowby in durham there did exist a party who said that sir harry would divide the property but they who held such an opinion certainly knew very little of sir harrys social or political tenets any such division was the one thing which he surely would not effect  when twelve months had passed after the death of sir harrys son george hotspur had been at humblethwaite and had gone and sir harrys will had been made he had left everything to his daughter and had only stipulated that her husband should she marry should take the name of hotspur he had decided that should his daughter as was probable marry within his lifetime he could then make what settlements he pleased even to the changing of the tenor of his will should he think fit to change it should he die and leave her still a spinster he would trust to her in everything not being a man of mystery he told his wife and his daughter what he had doneand what he still thought that he possibly might do and being also a man to whom any suspicion of injustice was odious he desired his attorney to make known to george hotspur what had been settled and in order that this blow to cousin george might be lightenedcousin george having in conversation acknowledged to a few debtsan immediate present was made to him of four thousand pounds and double that amount was assured to him at the baronets death  the reader may be sure that the baronet had heard many things respecting cousin george which he did not like to him personally it would have been infinitely preferable that the title and the estates should have gone together than that his own daughter should be a great heiress that her outlook into the world was fair and full of promise of prosperity either way was clear enough twenty thousand a year would not be necessary to make her a happy woman and then it was to him a manifest and a sacred religion that to no man or to no woman were appointed the high pinnacles of fortune simply that that man or that woman might enjoy them they were to be held as thrones are held for the benefit of the many and in the disposition of this throne the necessity of making which had fallen upon him from the loss of his own darling he had brought himself to thinknot of his daughters happiness or to the balance of which in her possessing or not possessing the property he could venture on no prophecybut of the welfare of all those who might measure their weal or woe from the manner in which the duties of this high place were administered he would fain that there should still have been a sir harry or a sir george hotspur of humblethwaite but he found that his duty required him to make the other arrangement  and yet he had liked the cousin who indeed had many gifts to win liking both from men and women previously to the visit very little had been known personally of young george hotspur at humblethwaite his father also a george had in early life quarrelled with the elder branch of the family and had gone off with what money belonged to him and had lived and died in paris the younger george had been educated abroad and then had purchased a commission in a regiment of english cavalry at the time when young harry died it was only known of him at humblethwaite that he had achieved a certain reputation in london and that he had sold out of the army he was talked of as a man who shot birds with precision pigeons he could shoot with wonderful dexteritywhich art was at humblethwaite supposed to be much against him but then he was equally successful with partridges and pheasants and partly on account of such success and partly probably because his manner was pleasant he was known to be a welcome guest at houses in which men congregate to slaughter game in this way he had a reputation and one that was not altogether cause for reproach but it had not previously recommended him to the notice of his cousin  just ten months after poor harrys death he was asked and went to humblethwaite probably at that moment the baronets mind was still somewhat in doubt the wish of lady elizabeth had been clearly expressed to her husband to the effect that encouragement should be given to the young people to fall in love with each other to this sir harry never assented though there was a timeand that time had not yet passed when george hotspur reached humblethwaitein which the baronet was not altogether averse to the idea of the marriage but when george left humblethwaite the baronet had made up his mind tidings had reached him and he was afraid of the cousin and other tidings had reached him also or rather perhaps it would be truer to him to say that another idea had come to him of all the young men now rising in england there was no young man who more approved himself to sir harrys choice than did lord alfred gresley the second son of his old friend and political leader the marquis of milnthorp lord alfred had but scanty fortune of his own but was in parliament and in office and was doing well all men said all good things of him then there was a word or two spoken between the marquis and the baronet and just a word also with lord alfred himself lord alfred had no objection to the name of hotspur this was in october while george hotspur was still declaring that gilbsy knew nothing of getting up a head of game and then lord alfred promised to come to humblethwaite at christmas it was after this that george owned to a few debts his confession on that score did him no harm sir harry had made up his mind that day sir harry had at that time learned a good deal of his cousin georges mode of life in london and had already decided that this young man was not one whom it would be well to set upon the pinnacle  and yet he had liked the young man as did everybody lady elizabeth had liked him much and for a fortnight had gone on hoping that all difficulties might have solved themselves by the young mans marriage with her daughter it need hardly be said that not a word one way or the other was spoken to emily hotspur but it seemed to the mother that the young people though there was no lovemaking yet liked each other sir harry at this time was up in london for a month or two hearing tidings seeing lord alfred who was at his office and on his return that solution by family marriage was ordered to be for ever banished from the maternal bosom sir harry said that it would not do  nevertheless he was good to the young cousin and when the time was drawing nigh for the young mans departure he spoke of a further visit the coverts at humblethwaite such as they were would always be at his service this was a week before the cousin went but by the coming of the day on which the cousin took his departure sir harry regretted that he had made that offer of future hospitality     chapter ii  our heroine   he has said nothing to her asked sir harry anxiously of his wife  i think not replied lady elizabeth  had he said anything that meant anything she would have told you  certainly she would said lady elizabeth  sir harry knew his child and was satisfied that no harm had been done nevertheless he wished that that further invitation had not been given if this christmas visitor that was to come to humblethwaite could be successful all would be right but it had seemed to sir harry during that last week of cousin georges sojourn beneath his roof there had been more of cousinly friendship between the cousins than had been salutary seeing as he had seen that any closer connection was inexpedient but he thought that he was sure that no great harm had been done had any word been spoken to his girl which she herself had taken as a declaration of love she would certainly have told her mother sir harry would no more doubt his daughter than he would his own honour there were certain points and lines of duty clearly laid down for a girl so placed as was his daughter and sir harry though he could not have told whence the knowledge of these points and lines had come to his child never for a moment doubted but that she knew them and would obey them to know and to obey such points of duty were a part of the inheritance of such an one as emily hotspur nevertheless it might be possible that her fancy should be touched and that she herself should know nothing of itnothing that she could confide even to a mother sir harry understanding this and having seen in these last days something as he thought of too close a cousinly friendship was anxious that lord alfred should come and settle everything if lord alfred should be successful all danger would be at an end and the cousin might come again and do what he liked with the coverts alas alas the cousin should never have been allowed to show his handsome wicked face at humblethwaite  emily hotspur was a girl whom any father would have trusted and let the reader understand this of her that she was one in whom intentional deceit was impossible neither to her father nor to any one could she lie either in word or action and all these lines and points of duty were well known to her though she knew not and had never asked herself whence the lesson had come will it be too much to say that they had formed a part of her breeding and had been given to her with her blood she understood well that from her as heiress of the house of humblethwaite a double obedience was due to her fatherthe obedience of a child added to that which was now required from her as the future transmitter of honours of the house and yet no word had been said to her of the honours of the house nor indeed had many words ever been said as to that other obedience these lessons when they have been well learned have ever come without direct teaching  but she knew more than this and the knowledge had reached her in the same manner though she owed a great duty to her father there was a limit to that duty of which unconsciously she was well aware when her mother told her that lord alfred was coming having been instructed to do so by sir harry and hinted with a caress and a kiss and a soft whisper that lord alfred was one of whom sir harry approved greatly and that if further approval could be bestowed sir harry would not be displeased emily as she returned her mothers embrace felt that she had a possession of her own with which neither father nor mother might be allowed to interfere it was for them or rather for him to say that a hand so weighted as was hers should not be given here or there but it was not for them not even for him to say that her heart was to be given here or to be given there let them put upon her what weight they might of family honours and of family responsibility that was her own propertyif not perhaps to be bestowed at her own pleasure because of the pressure of that weight still her own and absolutely beyond the bestowal of any other  nevertheless she declared to herself and whispered to her mother that she would be glad to welcome lord alfred she had known him well when she was a child of twelve years old and he was already a young man in parliament since those days she had met him more than once in london she was now turned twenty and he was something more than ten years her senior but there was nothing against him at any rate on the score of age lord alfred was admitted on every side to be still a young man and though he had already been a lord of one board or of another for the last four years and had earned a reputation for working he did not look like a man who would be more addicted to sitting at boards than spending his time with young women he was handsome pleasant goodhumoured and full of talk had nothing about him of the official fogy and was regarded by all his friends as a man who was just now fit to marry they say that he is such a good son and such a good brother said lady elizabeth anxiously  quite a phoenix said emily laughing then lady elizabeth began to fear that she had said too much and did not mention lord alfreds name for two days  but miss hotspur had by that time resolved that lord alfred should have a fair chance if she could teach herself to think that of all men walking the earth lord alfred was the best and the most divine the nearest of all men to a god how excellent a thing would it be her great responsibility as to the family burden would in that case already be acquitted with credit the wishes of her father which on such a subject were all but paramount would be gratified and she herself would then be placed almost beyond the hand of misfortune to hurt her at any rate the great and almost crushing difficulty of her life would so be solved but the man must have enough in her eyes of that godlike glory to satisfy her that she had found in him one who would be almost a divinity at any rate to her could he speak as that other man spoke could he look as that other one looked would there be in his eye such a depth of colour in his voice such a sound of music in his gait so divine a grace for that other one though she had looked into the brightness of the colour though she had heard the sweetness of the music though she had watched the elastic spring of the step she cared nothing as regarded her hearther heart which was the one treasure of her own no she was sure of that of her one own great treasure she was much too chary to give it away unasked and too independent as she told herself to give it away unauthorized the field was open to lord alfred and as her father wished it lord alfred should be received with every favour if she could find divinity then she would bow before it readily  alas for lord alfred we may all know that when she thought of it thus there was but poor chance of success for lord alfred let him have what of the godlike he might she would find but little of it there when she made her calculations and resolutions after such fashion as this the man who becomes divine in a womans eyes has generally achieved his claim to celestial honours by sudden assault and alas the qualities which carry him through it and give the halo to his head may after all be very ungodlike some such achievement had already fallen in the way of cousin george though had cousin george and lord alfred been weighed in just scales the divinity of the latter such as it was would have been found greatly to prevail indeed it might perhaps have been difficult to lay hold of and bring forward as presentable for such office as that of a lover for such a girl any young man who should be less godlike than cousin george but he had gifts of simulation which are valuable and poor emily hotspur had not yet learned the housewifes trick of passing the web through her fingers and of finding by the touch whether the fabric were of fine wool or of shoddy made up with craft to look like wool of the finest  we say that there was but small chance for lord alfred nevertheless the lady was dutifully minded to give him all the chance that it was in her power to bestow she did not tell herself that her fathers hopes were vain of her preference for that other man she never told herself anything she was not aware that it existed she knew that he was handsome she thought that he was clever she knew that he had talked to her as no man had ever talked before she was aware that he was her nearest relative beyond her father and mother and that therefore she might be allowed to love him as a cousin she told herself that he was a hotspur and that he must be the head of the hotspurs when her father should be taken from them she thought that he looked as a man should look who would have to carry such a dignity but there was nothing more no word had been said to her on the subject but she was aware because no word had been said that it was not thought fitting that she should be her cousins bride she could not but know how great would be the advantage could the estates and the title be kept together even though he should inherit no acre of the landand she had been told by her father that such was his decisionthis cousin george must become the head of the house of hotspur and to be head of the house of hotspur was to her a much greater thing than to be the owner of humblethwaite and scarrowby gifts like the latter might be given to a mere girl like herselfwere to be so given but let any man living do what he might george hotspur must become the head and chief of the old house of hotspur nevertheless it was not for her to join the two things together unless her father should see that it would be good for her to do so  emily hotspur was very like her father having that peculiar cast of countenance which had always characterized the family she had the same arch in her eyebrows indicating an aptitude for authority the same wellformed nose though with her the beak of the eagle was less prominent the same short lip and small mouth and delicate dimpled chin with both of them the lower part of the face was peculiarly short and finely cut with both of them the brow was high and broad and the temples prominent but the girls eyes were blue while those of the old man were brightly green it was told of him that when a boy his eyes also had been blue her hair which was very plentiful was light in colour but by no means flaxen her complexion was as clear as the finest porcelain but there were ever roses in her cheeks for she was strong by nature and her health was perfect she was somewhat short of stature as were all the hotspurs and her feet and hands and ears were small and delicate but though short she seemed to lack nothing in symmetry and certainly lacked nothing in strength she could ride or walk the whole day and had no feeling that such vigour of body was a possession of which a young lady should be ashamed such as she was she was the acknowledged beauty of the county and at carlisle where she showed herself at least once a year at the county ball there was neither man nor woman young nor old who was not ready to say that emily hotspur was among maidens the glory of cumberland  her life hitherto had been very quiet there was the ball at carlisle which she had attended thrice on the last occasion because of her brothers death she had been absent and the family of the hotspurs had been represented there only by the venison and game which had been sent from humblethwaite twice also she had spent the months of may and june in london but it had not hitherto suited the tone of her fathers character to send his daughter out into all the racket of a london season she had gone to balls and to the opera and had ridden in the park and been seen at flowershows but she had not been so common in those places as to be known to the crowd and hitherto neither in town or country had her name been connected with that of any suitor for her hand she was now twenty and the reader will remember that in the twelve months last past the house of humblethwaite had been clouded with deep mourning  the cousin was come and gone and the baronet hoped in his heart that there might be an end of him as far as humblethwaite was concernedat any rate till his child should have given herself to a better lover tidings had been sent to sir harry during the last week of the young mans sojourn beneath his roof which of all that had reached his ears were the worst he had before heard of recklessness of debt of dissipation of bad comrades now he heard of worse than these if that which he now heard was true there had been dishonour but sir harry was a man who wanted ample evidence before he allowed his judgment to actuate his conduct and in this case the evidence was far from ample he did not stint his hospitality to the future baronet but he failed to repeat that promise of a future welcome which had already been given and which had been thankfully accepted but a man knows that such an offer of renewed hospitality should be repeated at the moment of departure and george hotspur as he was taken away to the nearest station in his cousins carriage was quite aware that sir harry did not then desire that the visit should be repeated  lord alfred was to be at humblethwaite on christmaseve the emergencies of the board at which he sat would not allow of an earlier absence from london he was a man who shirked no official duty and was afraid of no amount of work and though he knew how great was the prize before him he refused to leave his board before the day had come at which his board must necessarily dispense with his services between him and his father there had been no reticence and it was clearly understood by him that he was to go down and win twenty thousand a year and the prettiest girl in cumberland if his own capacity that way joined to all the favour of the girls father and mother would enable him to attain success to emily not a word more had been said on the subject than those which have been already narrated as having been spoken by the mother to the daughter with all his authority with all his love for his only remaining child with all his consciousness of the terrible importance of the matter at issue sir harry could not bring himself to suggest to his daughter that it would be well for her to fall in love with the guest who was coming to them but to lady elizabeth he said very much he had quite made up his mind that the thing would be good and having done so he was very anxious that the arrangement should be made it was natural that this girl of his should learn to love some youth and how terrible was the danger of her loving amiss when so much depended on her loving wisely the whole fate of the house of hotspur was in her handsto do with it as she thought fit sir harry trembled as he reflected what would be the result were she to come to him some day and ask his favour for a suitor wholly unfitted to bear the name of hotspur and to sit on the throne of humblethwaite and scarrowby  is she pleased that he is coming he said to his wife the evening before the arrival of their guest  certainly she is pleased she knows that we both like him  i remember when she used to talk about himoften said sir harry  that was when she was a child  but a year or two ago said sir harry  three or four years perhaps and with her that is a long time it is not likely that she should talk much of him now of course she knows what it is that we wish  does she think about her cousin at all he said some hours afterwards  yes she thinks of him that is only natural you know  it would be unnatural that she should think of him much  i do not see that said the mother keen to defend her daughter from what might seem to be an implied reproach george hotspur is a man who will make himself thought of wherever he goes he is clever and very amusingthere is no denying that and then he has the hotspur look all over  i wish he had never set his foot within the house said the father  my dear there is no such danger as you think said lady elizabeth emily is not a girl prone to fall in love at a moments notice because a man is goodlooking and amusingand certainly not with the conviction which she must have that her doing so would greatly grieve you sir harry believed in his daughter and said no more but he thoroughly wished that lord alfreds weddingday was fixed  mamma said emily on the following day wont lord alfred be very dull  i hope not my dear  what is he to do with nobody else here to amuse him  the crutchleys are coming on the 27th  now mr and mrs crutchley were as emily thought very ordinary people and quite unlikely to afford amusement to lord alfred mr crutchley was an old gentleman of county standing and with property in the county living in a large dull red house in penrith of whom sir harry thought a good deal because he was a gentleman who happened to have had greatgrandfathers and greatgrandmothers but he was quite as old as sir harry and mrs crutchley was a great deal older than lady elizabeth  what will lord alfred have to say to mrs crutchley mamma  what do people in society always have to say to each other and the lathebys are coming here to dine tomorrow and will come again i dont doubt on the 27th  mr latheby was the young vicar of humblethwaite and mrs latheby was a very pretty young bride whom he had just married  and then lord alfred shoots continued lady elizabeth  cousin george said that the shooting wasnt worth going after said emily smiling mamma i fear it will be a failure this made lady elizabeth unhappy as she thought that more was meant than was really said but she did not confide her fears to her husband     chapter iii  lord alfreds courtship   the hall as the great house at humblethwaite was called consisted in truth of various edifices added one to another at various periods but the result was this that no more picturesque mansion could be found in any part of england than the hall at humblethwaite the oldest portion of it was said to be of the time of henry vii but it may perhaps be doubted whether the set of rooms with lattice windows looking out on to the bowlinggreen each window from beneath its own gable was so old as the date assigned to it it is strange how little authority can usually be found in family records to verify such statements it was known that humblethwaite and the surrounding manors had been given to or in some fashion purchased by a certain harry hotspur who also in his day had been a knight when church lands were changing hands under henry viii and there was authority to prove that that sir harry had done something towards making a home for himself on the spot but whether those very gables were a portion of the building which the monks of st humble had raised for themselves in the preceding reign may probably be doubted that there were fragments of masonry and parts of old timber remaining from the monastery was probably true enough the great body of the old house as it now stood had been built in the time of charles ii and there was the date in the brickwork still conspicuous on the wall looking into the court the hall and front door as it now stood very prominent but quite at the end of the house had been erected in the reign of queen anne and the modern drawingrooms with the best bedrooms over them projecting far out into the modern gardens had been added by the present baronets father the house was entirely of brick and the old windowsnot the very oldest the reader will understand but those of the caroline agewere built with strong stone mullions and were longer than they were deep beauty of architecture having in those days been more regarded than light who does not know such windows and has not declared to himself often how sad a thing it is that sanitary or scientific calculations should have banished the like of them from our houses two large oriel windows coming almost to the ground and going up almost to the ceilings adorned the diningroom and the library from the drawingrooms modern windows opening on to a terrace led into the garden  you entered the mansion by a court that was enclosed on two sides altogether and on the two others partially facing you as you drove in was the body of the building with the huge porch projecting on the right so as to give the appearance of a portion of the house standing out on that side on the left was that old mythic tudor remnant of the monastery of which the back wall seen from the court was pierced only with a small window here and there and was covered with ivy those lattice windows from which emily hotspur loved to think that the monks of old had looked into their trim gardens now looked on to a bowlinggreen which was kept very trim in honour of the holy personages who were supposed to have played there four centuries ago then at the end of this old building there had been erected kitchens servants offices and various rooms which turned the corner of the court in front so that only one corner had as it were been left for ingress and egress but the court itself was large and in the middle of it there stood an old stone ornamental structure usually called the fountain but quite ignorant of water loaded with griffins and satyrs and mermaids with ample busts all overgrown with a green damp growth which was scraped off by the joint efforts of the gardener and mason once perhaps in every five years  it often seems that the beauty of architecture is accidental a great man goes to work with great means on a great pile and makes a great failure the world perceives that grace and beauty have escaped him and that even magnificence has been hardly achieved then there grows up beneath various unknown hands a complication of stones and brick to the arrangement of which no great thought seems to have been given and lo there is a thing so perfect in its glory that he who looks at it declares that nothing could be taken away and nothing added without injury and sacrilege and disgrace so it had been or rather so it was now with the hall at humblethwaite no rule ever made for the guidance of an artist had been kept the parts were out of proportion no two parts seemed to fit each other put it all on paper and it was an absurdity the huge hall and porch added on by the builder of queen annes time at the very extremity of the house were almost a monstrosity the passages and staircases and internal arrangements were simply ridiculous but there was not a portion of the whole interior that did not charm nor was there a corner of the exterior nor a yard of an outside wall that was not in itself eminently beautiful  lord alfred gresley as he was driven into the court in the early dusk of a winter evening having passed through a mile and a half of such park scenery as only cumberland and westmoreland can show was fully alive to the glories of the place humblethwaite did not lie among the lakeswas indeed full ten miles to the north of keswick but it was so placed that it enjoyed the beauty and the luxury of mountains and rivers without the roughness of unmanageable rocks or the sterility and dampness of moorland of rocky fragments indeed peeping out through the close turf and here and there coming forth boldly so as to break the park into little depths with now and again a real ravine there were plenty and there ran right across the park passing so near the hall as to require a stone bridge in the very flowergarden the caldbeck as bright and swift a stream as ever took away the water from neighbouring mountains and to the south of humblethwaite there stood the huge skiddaw and saddleback with its long gaunt ridge while to the west brockleband fell seemed to encircle the domain lord alfred as he was driven up through the old trees and saw the deer peering at him from the knolls and broken fragments of stone felt that he need not envy his elder brother if only his lines might fall to him in this very pleasant place  he had known humblethwaite before and irrespective of all its beauties and of the wealth of the hotspurs was quite willing to fall in love with emily hotspur that a man with such dainties offered to him should not become greedy that there should be no touch of avarice when such wealth was shown to him is almost more than we may dare to assert but lord alfred was a man not specially given to covetousness he had recognized it as his duty as a man not to seek for these things unless he could in truth love the woman who held them in her hands to give but as he looked round him through the gloaming of the evening he thought that he remembered that emily hotspur was all that was loveable  but reader we must not linger long over lord alfreds love a few words as to the father a few as to the daughter and a few also as to the old house where they dwelt together it has been necessary to say but this little love story of lord alfredsif it ever was a love storymust be told very shortly  he remained five weeks at humblethwaite and showed himself willing to receive amusement from old mrs crutchley and from young mrs latheby the shooting was quite good enough for him and he won golden opinions from every one about the place he made himself acquainted with the whole history of the house and was prepared to prove to demonstration that henry viis monks had looked out of those very windows and had played at bowls on that very green emily became fond of him after a fashion but he failed to assume any aspect of divinity in her eyes  of the thing to be done neither father nor mother said a word to the girl and she though she knew so well that the doing of it was intended said not a word to her mother had lady elizabeth known how to speak had she dared to be free with her own child emily would soon have told her that there was no chance for lord alfred and lady elizabeth would have believed her nay lady elizabeth though she could not speak had the womans instinct which almost assured her that the match would never be made sir harry on the other side thought that things went prosperously and his wife did not dare to undeceive him he saw the young people together and thought that he saw that emily was kind he did not know that this frank kindness was incompatible with love in such a maidens ways as for emily herself she knew that it must come she knew that she could not prevent it a slight hint or two she did give or thought she gave but they were too fine too impalpable to be of avail  lord alfred spoke nothing of love till he made his offer in form at last he was not hopeful himself he had found it impossible to speak to this girl of love she had been gracious with him and almost intimate and yet it had been impossible he thought of himself that he was dull stupid lethargic and miserably undemonstrative but the truth was that there was nothing for him to demonstrate he had come there to do a stroke of business and he could not throw into this business a spark of that fire which would have been kindled by such sympathy had it existed there are men who can raise such sparks the pretence of fire where there is no heat at allfalse fraudulent men but he was not such an one nevertheless he went on with his business  miss hotspur he said to her one morning between breakfast and lunch when as usual opportunity had been given him to be alone with her i have something to say to you which i hope at any rate it will not make you angry to hear  i am sure you will say nothing to make me angry she replied  i have already spoken to your father and i have his permission i may say more he assures me that he hopes i may succeed he paused a moment but she remained quite tranquil he watched her and could see that the delicate pink on her cheek was a little heightened and that a streak of colour showed itself on her fair brow but there was nothing in her manner to give him either promise of success or assurance of failure you will know what i mean  yes i know she said almost in a whisper  and may i hope to say that i love you dearly seems to be saying what must be a matter of course  i do not see that at all she replied with spirit  i do love you very dearly if i may be allowed to think that you will be my wife i shall be the happiest man in england i know how great is the honour which i seek how immense in every way is the gift which i ask you to give me can you love me  no she said again dropping her voice to a whisper  is that all the answer miss hotspur  what should i say how ought i to answer you if i could say it without seeming to be unkind indeed indeed i would do so  perhaps i have been abrupt  it is not that when you ask metotolove you of course i know what you mean should i not speak the truth at once  must this be for always  for always she replied and then it was over  he did not himself press his suit further though he remained at humblethwaite for three days after this interview  before lunch on that day the story had been told by emily to her mother and by lord alfred to sir harry lady elizabeth knew well enough that the story would never have to be told in another way sir harry by no means so easily gave up his enterprise he proposed to lord alfred that emily should be asked to reconsider her verdict with his wife he was very round saying that an answer given so curtly should go for nothing and that the girl must be taught her duty with emily herself he was less urgent less authoritative and indeed at last somewhat suppliant he explained to her how excellent would be the marriage how it would settle this terrible responsibility which now lay on his shoulders with so heavy a weight how glorious would be her position and how the hotspurs would still live as a great family could she bring herself to be obedient and he said very much in praise of lord alfred pointing out how good a man he was how moral how diligent how safe how cleverhow sure with the assistance of the means which she would give him to be one of the notable men of the country but she never yielded an inch she said very littleanswered him hardly a word standing close to him holding by his arm and his hand there was the fact that she would not have the man would not have the man now or ever certainly would not have him and sir harry let him struggle as he might and talk his best could not keep himself from giving absolute credit to her assurance  the visit was prolonged for three days and then lord alfred left humblethwaite hall with less appreciation of all its beauties than he had felt as he was first being driven up to the hall doors when he went sir harry could only bid god bless him and assure him that should he ever choose to try his fortune again he should have all the aid which a father could give him  it would be useless said lord alfred she knows her own mind too well  and so he went his way     chapter iv  vacillation   when the springtime came sir harry hotspur with his wife and daughter went up to london during the last season the house in bruton street had been empty he and his wife were then mourning their lost son and there was no place for the gaiety of london in their lives sir harry was still thinking of his great loss he was always thinking of the boy who was gone who had been the apple of his eye his one great treasure the only human being in the world whose superior importance to his own he had been ready in his heart of hearts to admit but it was needful that the outer signs of sorrow should be laid aside and emily hotspur was taken up to london in order that she might be suited with a husband that in truth was the reason of their going neither sir harry nor lady elizabeth would have cared to leave cumberland had there been no such cause they would have been altogether content to remain at home had emily been obedient enough in the winter to accept the hand of the suitor proposed for her  the house was opened in bruton street and lord alfred came to see them so also did cousin george there was no reason why cousin george should not come indeed had he not done so he must have been the most ungracious of cousins he came and found lady elizabeth and emily at home emily told him that they were always there to receive visitors on sundays after morning church and then he came again she had made no such communication to lord alfred but then perhaps it would have been hardly natural that she should have done so lady elizabeth in a note which she had occasion to write to lord alfred did tell him of her custom on a sunday afternoon but lord alfred took no such immediate advantage of the offer as did cousin george  as regarded the outward appearance of their life the hotspurs were gayer this may than they had been heretofore when living in london there were dinnerparties whereas in previous times there had only been dinners at which a few friends might join themand there was to be a ball there was a box at the opera and there were horses for the park and there was an understanding that the dealings with madame milvodi the milliner were to be as unlimited as the occasion demanded it was perceived by every one that miss hotspur was to be settled in life not a few knew the story of lord alfred every one knew the facts of the property and emilys position as heiress though every one probably did not know that it was still in sir harrys power to leave every acre of the property to whom he pleased emily understood it all herself there lay upon her that terrible responsibility of doing her best with the hotspur interests to her the death of her brother had at the time been the blackest of misfortunes and it was not the less so now as she thought of her own position she had been steady enough as to the refusal of lord alfred knowing well enough that she cared nothing for him but there had since come upon her moments almost of regret that she should have been unable to accept him it would have been so easy a way of escape from all her troubles without the assistance of madame milvodi and the operabox and the park horses at the time she had her own ideas about another man but her ideas were not such as to make her think that any further work with madame milvodi and the operabox would be unnecessary  then came the question of asking cousin george to the house he had already been told to come on sundays and on the very next sunday had been there he had given no cause of offence at humblethwaite and lady elizabeth was of opinion that he should be asked to dinner if he were not asked the very omission would show that they were afraid of him lady elizabeth did not exactly explain this to her husbanddid not accurately know that such was her fear but sir harry understood her feelings and yielded let cousin george be asked to dinner  sir harry at this time was vacillating with more of weakness than would have been expected from a man who had generally been so firm in the affairs of his life he had been quite clear about george hotspur when those inquiries of his were first made and when his mind had first accepted the notion of lord alfred as his chosen soninlaw but now he was again at sea he was so conscious of the importance of his daughters case that he could not bring himself to be at ease and to allow himself to expect that the girl would in the ordinary course of nature dispose of her young heart not to her own injury as might reasonably be hoped from her temperament her character and her education he could not protect himself from daily and hourly thought about it her marriage was not as the marriage of other girls the house of hotspur which had lived and prospered for so many centuries was to live and prosper through her or rather mainly through the man whom she should choose as her husband the girl was allimportant now but when she should have once disposed of herself her importance would be almost at an end sir harry had in the recess of his mind almost a conviction that although the thing was of such utmost moment it would be better for him better for them all better for the hotspurs that the matter should be allowed to arrange itself than that there should be any special judgment used in selection he almost believed that his girl should be left to herself as are other girls but the thing was of such moment that he could not save himself from having it always before his eyes  and yet he knew not what to do nor was there any aid forthcoming from lady elizabeth he had tried his hand at the choice of a proper husband and his daughter would have none of the man so chosen so he had brought her up to london and thrown her as it were upon the market let madame milvodi and the operabox and the park horses do what they could for her of course a watch should be kept on hernot from doubt of her excellence but because the thing to be disposed of was so allimportant and the girls mode of disposing of it might without disgrace or fault on her part be so vitally prejudicial to the family  for let it be remembered no curled darling of an eldest son would suit the exigencies of the case unless such eldest son were willing altogether to merge the claims of his own family and to make himself by name and purpose a hotspur were his child to present to him as his soninlaw some heir to a noble house some future earl say even a duke in embryo all that would be as nothing to sir harry it was not his ambition to see his daughter a duchess he wanted no name or place or dominion for any hotspur greater or higher or more noble than those which the hotspurs claimed and could maintain for themselves to have humblethwaite and scarrowby lost amidst the vast appanages and domains of some titled family whose gorgeous glories were new and paltry in comparison with the mellow honours of his own house would to him have been a ruin to all his hopes there might indeed be some arrangement as to the second son proceeding from such a marriageas to a future chance hotspur but the claims of the hotspurs were he thought too high and too holy for such future chance and in such case for one generation at least the hotspurs would be in abeyance no it was not that which he desired that would not suffice for him the soninlaw that he desired should be well born a perfect gentleman with belongings of whom he and his child might be proud but he should be one who should be content to rest his claims to material prosperity and personal position on the name and wealth that he would obtain with his wife lord alfred had been the very man but then his girl would have none of lord alfred eldest sons there might be in plenty ready to take such a bride and were some eldest son to come to him and ask for his daughters hand some eldest son who would do so almost with a right to claim it if the girls consent were gained how could he refuse and yet to leave a hotspur behind him living at humblethwaite and hotspurs who should follow that hotspur was all in all to him  might he venture to think once again of cousin george cousin george was there coming to the house and his wife was telling him that it was incumbent on them to ask the young man to dinner it was incumbent on them unless they meant to let him know that he was to be regarded absolutely as a strangeras one whom they had taken up for a while and now chose to drop again a very ugly story had reached sir harrys ears about cousin george it was said that he had twice borrowed money from the moneylenders on his commission passing some document for security of its value which was no security and that he had barely escaped detection the two jews knowing that the commission would be forfeited altogether if the fraud were brought to light the commission had been sold and the proceeds divided between the jews with certain remaining claims to them on cousin georges personal estate such had been the story which in a vague way had reached sir harrys ears it is not easily that such a man as sir harry can learn the details of a disreputable cousins life among all his old friends he had none more dear to him than lord milnthorp and among his younger friends none more intimate than lord burton the eldest son of lord milnthorp lord alfreds brother lord burton had told him the story telling him at the same time that he could not vouch for its truth upon my word i dont know said lord burton when interrogated again i think if i were you i would regard it as though i had never heard it of course he was in debt  that is altogether another thing said sir harry  altogether i think that probably he did pawn his commission that is bad but it isnt so very bad as for the other charge against him i doubt it so said lord burton and sir harry determined that the accusation should go for nothing  but his own child his only child the transmitter of all the great things that fortune had given to him she in whose hands were to lie the glories of humblethwaite and scarrowby she who had the giving away of the honour of their ancient familycould she be trusted to one of whom it must be admitted that all his early life had been disreputable even if the worlds lenient judgment in such matters should fail to stigmatize it as dishonourable in other respects however he was so manifestly the man to whom his daughter ought to be given in marriage by such arrangement would the title and the property be kept togetherand by no other which sir harry could now make for his word had been given to his daughter that she was to be his heiress let him make what arrangements he might this cousin george at his death would be the head of the family every peerage that was printed would tell the old story to all the world by certain courtesies of the law of descent his future heirs would be hotspurs were his daughter married to lord alfred or the like but the children of such a marriage would not be hotspurs in very truth nor by any courtesy of law or even by any kindness of the minister or sovereign could the child of such a union become the baronet the sir harry of the day the head of the family the position was one which no sovereign and no minister could achieve or touch or bestow it was his beyond the power of any earthly potentate to deprive him of it and would have been transmitted by him to a son with as absolute security butalas alas  sir harry gave no indication that he thought it expedient to change his mind on the subject when lady elizabeth proposed that cousin george should be asked to dinner he frowned and looked black as he acceded but in truth he vacillated the allurements on that side were so great that he could not altogether force upon himself the duty of throwing them from him he knew that cousin george was no fitting husband for his girl that he was a man to whom he would not have thought of giving her had her happiness been his only object and he did not think of so bestowing her now he became uneasy when he remembered the danger he was unhappy as he remembered how amusing how handsome how attractive was cousin george he feared that emily might like himby no means hoped it and yet he vacillated and allowed cousin george to come to the house only because cousin george must become on his death the head of the hotspurs  cousin george came on one sunday came on another sunday dined at the house and was of course asked to the ball but lady elizabeth had so arranged her little affairs that when cousin george left bruton street on the evening of the dinner party he and emily had never been for two minutes alone together since the family had come up to london lady elizabeth herself liked cousin george and had an edict to that effect been pronounced by her husband would have left them alone together with great maternal satisfaction but she had been told that it was not to be so and therefore the young people had never been allowed to have opportunities lady elizabeth in her very quiet way knew how to do the work of the world that was allotted to her there had been other balls and there had been ridings in the park and all the chances of life which young men and sometimes young women also know so well how to use but hitherto cousin george had kept or had been constrained to keep his distance  i want to know mamma said emily hotspur the day before the ball whether cousin george is a black sheep or a white sheep  what do you mean my dear by asking such a question as that  i dont like black sheep i dont see why young men are to be allowed to be black sheep but yet you know they are  how can it be helped  people should not notice them mamma  my dear it is a most difficult questionquite beyond me and i am sure beyond you a sheep neednt be black always because he has not always been quite white and then you know the black lambs are just as dear to their mother as the white  dearer i think  i quite agree with you emily that in general society black sheep should be avoided  then they shouldnt be allowed to come in said emily lady elizabeth knew from this that there was danger but the danger was not of a kind which enabled her specially to consult sir harry     chapter v  george hotspur   a little must now be told to the reader of cousin george and the ways of his life as lady elizabeth had said to her daughter that question of admitting black sheep into society or of refusing them admittance is very difficult in the first place whose eyes are good enough to know whether in truth a sheep be black or not and then is it not the fact that some little amount of shade in the fleece of male sheep is considered if not absolutely desirable at any rate quite pardonable a male sheep with a fleece as white as that of a ewelambis he not considered to be among muttons somewhat insipid it was of this taste which pope was conscious when he declared that every woman was at heart a rake and so it comes to pass that very black sheep indeed are admitted into society till at last anxious fathers and more anxious mothers begin to be aware that their young ones are turned out to graze among ravenous wolves this however must be admitted that lambs when so treated acquire a courage which tends to enable them to hold their own even amidst wolfish dangers  cousin george if not a ravenous wolf was at any rate a very black sheep indeed in our anxiety to know the truth of him it must not be said that he was absolutely a wolfnot as yetbecause in his career he had not as yet made premeditated attempts to devour prey but in the process of delivering himself up to be devoured by others he had done things which if known of any sheep should prevent that sheep from being received into a decent flock there had been that little trouble about his commission in which although he had not intended to cheat either jew he had done that which the world would have called cheating had the world known it as for getting goods from tradesmen without any hope or thought of paying for them that with him was so much a thing of customas indeed it was also with themthat he was almost to be excused for considering it the normal condition of life for a man in his position to gamble and lose money had come to him quite naturally at a very early age there had now come upon him an idea that he might turn the tables that in all gambling transactions some one must win and that as he had lost much so possibly might he now win more he had not quite yet reached that point in his education at which the gambler learns that the ready way to win much is to win unfairlynot quite yet but he was near it the wolfhood was coming on him unless some good fortune might save him there might however be such good fortune in store for him as lady elizabeth had said a sheep that was very dark in colour might become white again if it be not so what is all this doctrine of repentance in which we believe  blackness in a male sheep in regard to the other sin is venial blackness whether the teller of such a tale as this should say so outright may be matter of dispute but unless he say so the teller of this tale does not know how to tell his tale truly blackness such as that will be all condoned and the sheep received into almost any flock on condition not of repentance or humiliation or confession but simply of change of practice the change of practice in certain circumstances and at a certain period becomes expedient and if it be made as regards tints in the wool of that nature the sheep becomes as white as he is needed to be in this respect our sheep had been as black as any sheep and at this present period of his life had need of much change before he would be fit for any decent social herding  and then there are the shades of black which come from convivialitywhich we may call table blacknessas to which there is an opinion constantly disseminated by the moral newspapers of the day that there has come to be altogether an end of any such blackness among sheep who are gentlemen to make up for this indeed there has been expressed by the piquant newspapers of the day an opinion that ladies are taking up the game which gentlemen no longer care to play it may be doubted whether either expression has in it much of truth we do not see ladies drunk certainly and we do not see gentlemen tumbling about as they used to do because their fashion of drinking is not that of their grandfathers but the love of wine has not gone out from among men and men now are as prone as ever to indulge their loves our black sheep was very fond of wineand also of brandy though he was wolf enough to hide his taste when occasion required it  very early in life he had come from france to live in england and had been placed in a cavalry regiment which had unfortunately for him been quartered either in london or its vicinity and perhaps equally unfortunate for him he had in his own possession a small fortune of some £500 a year this had not come to him from his father and when his father had died in paris about two years before the date of our story he had received no accession of regular income some couple of thousand of pounds had reached his hands from his fathers effects which had helped him through some of the immediately pressing difficulties of the dayfor his own income at that time had been altogether dissipated and now he had received a much larger sum from his cousin with an assurance however that the family property would not become his when he succeeded to the family title he was so penniless at the time so prone to live from hand to mouth so little given to consideration of the future that it may be doubted whether the sum given to him was not compensation in full for all that was to be withheld from him  still there was his chance with the heiress in regarding this chance he had very soon determined that he would marry his cousin if it might be within his power to do so he knew and fully appreciated his own advantages he was a handsome mantall for a hotspur but with the hotspur fair hair and blue eyes and wellcut features there lacked however to him that peculiar aspect of firmness about the temples which so strongly marked the countenance of sir harry and his daughter and there had come upon him a blasé look and certain outer signs of a bad life which however did not mar his beauty nor were they always apparent the eye was not always bloodshot nor was the hand constantly seen to shake it may be said of him both as to his moral and physical position that he was on the edge of the precipice of degradation but that there was yet a possibility of salvation  he was living in a bachelors set of rooms at this time in st jamess street for which it must be presumed that ready money was required during the last winter he had horses in northamptonshire for the hire of which it must be feared that his prospects as heir to humblethwaite had in some degree been pawned at the present time he had a horse for park riding and he looked upon a good dinner with good wine as being due to him every day as thoroughly as though he earned it that he had never attempted to earn a shilling since the day on which he had ceased to be a soldier now four years since the reader will hardly require to be informed  in spite of all his faults this man enjoyed a certain social popularity for which many a rich man would have given a third of his income dukes and duchesses were fond of him and certain persons standing very high in the world did not think certain parties were perfect without him he knew how to talk enough and yet not to talk too much no one could say of him that he was witty wellread or given to much thinking but he knew just what was wanted at this point of time or at that and could give it he could put himself forward and could keep himself in the background he could shoot well without wanting to shoot best he could fetch and carry but still do it always with an air of manly independence he could subserve without an air of cringing and then he looked like a gentleman  of all his welltodo friends perhaps he who really liked him best was the earl of altringham george hotspur was at this time something under thirty years of age and the earl was four years his senior the earl was a married man with a family a wife who also liked poor george an enormous income and a place in scotland at which george always spent the three first weeks of grouseshooting the earl was a kindly goodhumoured liberal but yet hard man of the world he knew george hotspur well and would on no account lend him a shilling he would not have given his friend money to extricate him from any difficulty but he forgave the sinner all his sins opened castle corry to him every year provided him with the best of everything and let him come and dine at altringham house in carlton gardens as often almost as he chose during the london season the earl was very good to george though he knew more about him than perhaps did any other man but he would not bet with george nor would he in any way allow george to make money out of him  do you suppose that i want to win money of you he once said to our friend in answer to a little proposition that was made to him at newmarket i dont suppose you do george had answered then you may be sure that i dont want to lose any the earl had replied and so the matter was ended and george made no more propositions of the kind  the two men were together at tattersalls looking at some horses which the earl had sent up to be sold the day after the dinner in bruton street sir harry seems to be taking to you very kindly said the earl  wellyes in a halfandhalf sort of way  it isnt everybody that would give you £5000 you know  i am not everybodys heir said george  no and you aint hisworse luck  i amin regard to the title  what good will that do you  when hes gone i shall be the head of the family as far as i can understand these matters he hasnt a right to leave the estates away from me  power is right my boy legal power is undoubtedly right  he should at any rate divide them there are two distinct properties and either of them would make me a rich man i dont feel so very much obliged to him for his moneythough of course it was convenient  very convenient i should say george how do you get on with your cousin  they watch me like a cat watches a mouse  say a rat rather george dont you know they are right would not i do the same if she were my girl knowing you as i do  she might do worse my lord  ill tell you what it is he thinks that he might do worse i dont doubt about that all this matter of the family and the title and the name would make him ready to fling her to youif only you were a shade less dark a horse than you are  i dont know that im darker than others  look here old fellow i dont often trouble you with advice but i will now if youll set yourself steadily to work to live decently if youll tell sir harry the whole truth about your money matters and really get into harness i believe you may have her such a one as you never had such a chance before but theres one thing you must do  what is the one thing  wash your hands altogether of mrs morton youll have a difficulty i know and perhaps it will want more pluck than youve got you havent got pluck of that kind  you mean that i dont like to break a womans heart  fiddlestick do you see that mare there  i was just looking at her why should you part with her  she was the best animal in my stables but shes given to eating the stableboys old badger told me flat that he wouldnt have her in the stables any longer i pity the fellow who will buy heror rather his fellow she killed a lad once in brookboroughs stables  why dont you shoot her  i cant afford to shoot horses captain hotspur i had my chance in buying her and somebody else must have his chance now thats the lot of them one or two good ones and the rest what i call rags do you think of what ive said and be sure of this mrs morton and your cousin cant go on together ta taim going across to my mothers  george hotspur when he was left alone did think a great deal about it he was not a man prone to assure himself of a ladys favour without cause and yet he did think that his cousin liked him as to that terrible difficulty to which lord altringham had alluded he knew that something must be done but there were cruel embarrassments on that side of which even altringham knew nothing and then why should he do that which his friend had indicated to him before he knew whether it would be necessary as to taking sir harry altogether into his confidence about his money matters that was clearly impossible heaven and earth how could the one man speak such truths or the other man listen to them when money difficulties come of such nature as those which weighted the shoulders of poor george hotspur it is quite impossible that there should be any such confidence with any one the sufferer cannot even make a confidant of himself cannot even bring himself to look at his own troubles massed together it was not the amount of his debts but the nature of them and the characters of the men with whom he had dealings that were so terrible fifteen thousand poundsless than one years income from sir harrys propertywould clear him of everything as far as he could judge but there could be no such clearing otherwise than by money disbursed by himself without a disclosure of dirt which he certainly would not dare to make to sir harry before his marriage  but yet the prize to be won was so great and there were so many reasons for thinking that it might possibly be within his grasp if after all he might live to be sir george hotspur of humblethwaite and scarrowby after thinking of it as well as he could he determined that he would make the attempt but as to those preliminaries to which lord altringham had referred he would for the present leave them to chance  lord altringham had been quite right when he told george hotspur that he was deficient in a certain kind of pluck     chapter vi  the ball in bruton street   sir harry vacillated lady elizabeth doubted and cousin george was allowed to come to the ball at this time in the common understanding of such phrase emily hotspur was heartwhole in regard to her cousin had she been made to know that he had gone away for everbeen banished to some antipodes from which he never could returnthere would have been no lasting sorrow on her part though there might have been some feeling which would have given her an ache for the moment she had thought about him as girls will think of men as to whom they own to themselves that it is possible that they may be in love with them some dayand she liked him much she also liked lord alfred but the liking had been altogether of a different kind in regard to lord alfred she had been quite sure from the first days of her intercourse with him that she could never be in love with him he was to her no more than old mr crutchley or young mr lathebya man and a good sort of man but no more than a man to worship lord alfred must be impossible to her she had already conceived that it would be quite possible for her to worship her cousin george in the teeth of all the hard things that she had heard of him the reader may be sure that such a thought had passed through her mind when she asked her mother whether cousin george was to be accepted as a black sheep or a white one  the ball was a very grand affair and emily hotspur was a very great lady it had come to be understood that the successful suitor for her hand would be the future lord of humblethwaite and the power with which she was thus vested gave her a prestige and standing which can hardly be attained by mere wit and beauty even when most perfectly combined it was not that all who worshipped either at a distance or with passing homage knew the fact of the heiressship or had ever heard of the £20000 a year but given the status and the worshippers will come the word had gone forth in some mysterious way and it was acknowledged that emily hotspur was a great young lady other young ladies who were not great allowed themselves to be postponed to her almost without jealousy and young gentlemen without pretensions regarded her as one to whom they did not dare to ask to be introduced emily saw it all and partly liked it and partly despised it but even when despising it she took advantage of it the young gentlemen without pretensions were no more to her than the chairs and tables and the young ladies who submitted to her and adored herwere allowed to be submissive and to adore but of this she was quite surethat her cousin george must some day be the head of her own family he was a man whom she was bound to treat with attentive regard if they who had the custody of her chose to place her in his company at all  at this ball there were some very distinguished people indeedpersons whom it would hardly be improper to call illustrious there were two royal duchesses one of whom was english and no less than three princes the russian and french ambassadors were both there there was the editor of the most influential newspaper of the dayfor a few minutes only and the prime minister passed through the room in the course of the evening dukes and duchesses below the royal degree were common and as for earls and countesses and their daughters they formed the ruck of the crowd the poetlaureate didnt come indeed but was expected and three chinese mandarins of the first quality entered the room at eleven and did not leave till one poor lady elizabeth suffered a great deal with those mandarins from all this it will be seen that the ball was quite a success  george hotspur dined that day with lord and lady altringham and went with them to the ball in the evening lord altringham though his manner was airy and almost indifferent was in truth most anxious that his friend should be put upon his feet by the marriage and the countess was so keen about it that there was nothing in the way of innocent intrigue which she would not have done to accomplish it she knew that george hotspur was a rake was a gambler was in debt was hampered by other difficulties and all the rest of it but she liked the man and was therefore willing to believe that a rich marriage would put it all right emily hotspur was nothing to her nor was sir harry but george had often made her own house pleasant to her and therefore to her thinking deserved a wife with £20000 a year and then if there might have been scruples under other circumstances that fact of the baronetcy overcame them it could not be wrong in one placed as was lady altringham to assist in preventing any separation of the title and the property of course george might probably squander all that he could squander but that might be made right by settlements and entails lady altringham was much more energetic than her husband and had made out quite a plan of the manner in which george should proceed she discussed the matter with him at great length the one difficulty she was indeed obliged to slur over but even that was not altogether omitted in her scheme whatever incumbrances there may be free yourself from them at once she had advised  that is so very easy to say lady altringham but so difficult to do  as to debts of course they cant be paid without money sir harry will find it worth his while to settle any debts but if there is anything else stop it at once of course there was something else and of course lady altringham knew what that something else was she demanded in accordance with her scheme that george should lose no time this was in may it was known that sir harry intended to leave town early in june of course you will take him at his word and go to humblethwaite when you leave us she had said  no time has been named  then you can name your own without difficulty you will write from castle corry and say you are coming that is if its not all settled by that time of course it cannot be done in a minute because sir harry must consent but i should begin at onceonly captain hotspur leave nothing for them to find out afterwards what is past they will forgive such had been lady altringhams advice and no doubt she understood the matter which she had been discussing  when george hotspur entered the room his cousin was dancing with a prince he could see her as he stood speaking a few words to lady elizabeth and in talking to lady elizabeth he did not talk as a stranger would or a common guest he had quite understood all that he might gain by assuming the intimacy of cousinhood and he had assumed it lady elizabeth was less weary than before when he stood by her and accepted from his hand some little trifle of help which was agreeable to her and he showed himself in no hurry and told her some little story that pleased her what a pity it was that cousin george should be a scamp she thought as he went on to greet sir harry  and with sir harry he remained a minute or two on such an occasion as this sir harry was all smiles and quite willing to hear a little town gossip come with the altringhams have you im told altringham has just sold all his horses whats the meaning of that  the old story sir harry he has weeded his stable and got the buyers to think that they were getting the cream there isnt a man in england knows better what hes about than altringham  sir harry smiled his sweetest and answered with some goodhumoured remark but he said in his heart that birds of a feather flock together and that his cousin wasnot a man of honour  there are some things that no rogue can do he can understand what it is to condemn roguery to avoid it to dislike it to disbelieve in itbut he cannot understand what it is to hate it cousin george had probably exaggerated the transaction of which he had spoken but he had little thought that in doing so he had helped to imbue sir harry with a true idea of his own character  george passed on and saw his cousin who was now standing up with a foreign ambassador he just spoke to her as he passed her calling her by her christian name as he did so she gave him her hand ever so graciously and he when he had gone on returned and asked her to name a dance  but i dont think ive one left that i mean to dance she said  then give me one that you dont mean to dance he answered and of course she gave it to him  it was an hour afterwards that he came to claim her promise and she put her arm through his and stood up with him there was no talk then of her not dancing and she went whirling round the room with him in great bliss cousin george waltzed well all such men do it is a part of their stockintrade on this evening emily hotspur thought that he waltzed better than any one else and told him so another turn of course i will with you because you know what youre about  id blush if id time said he  a great many gentlemen ought to blush i know that prince whose name i always forget and you are the only men in the room who dance well according to my ideas  then off they went again and emily was very happy he could at least dance well and there could be no reason why she should not enjoy his dancing well since he had been considered to be white enough to be asked to the ball  but with george there was present at every turn and twist of the dance an idea that he was there for other work than that he was tracking a head of game after which there would be many hunters he had his advantages and so would they have theirs one of his was thisthat he had her there with him now and he must use it she would not fall into his mouth merely by being whirled round the room pleasantly at last she was still and consented to take a walk with him out of the room somewhere out amidst the crowd on the staircase if possible so as to get a breath of fresh air of course he soon had her jammed into a corner out of which there was no immediate mode of escape  we shall never get away again she said laughing had she wanted to get away her tone and manner would have been very different  i wonder whether you feel yourself to be the same sort of person here that you are at humblethwaite he said  exactly the same  to me you seem to be so different  in what way  i dont think you are half so nice  how very unkind  of course she was flattered of all flattery praise is the coarsest and least efficacious when you would flatter a man talk to him about himself and criticise him pulling him to pieces by comparison of some small present fault with his past conductand the rule holds the same with a woman to tell her that she looks well is feeble work but complain to her wofully that there is something wanting at the present moment something lacking from the usual high standard some temporary loss of beauty and your solicitude will prevail with her  and in what am i not nice i am sure im trying to be as nice as i know how  down at humblethwaite you are simply yourselfemily hotspur  and what am i here  that formidable thinga success dont you feel yourself that you are lifted a little off your legs  not a bitnot an inch why should i  i fail to make you understand quite what i mean dont you feel that with all these princes and potentates you are forced to be something else than your natural self dont you know that you have to put on a special manner and to talk in a special way does not the champagne fly to your head more or less  of course the princes and potentates are not the same as old mrs crutchley if you mean that  i am not blaming you you know only i cannot help being very anxious and i found you so perfect at humblethwaite that i cannot say that i like any change you know i am to come to humblethwaite again  of course you are  you go down next month i believe  papa talks of going to scarrowby for a few weeks he always does every year and it is so dull did you ever see scarrowby  never  you ought to come there some day you know one branch of the hotspurs did live there for ever so long  is it a good house  very bad indeed but there are enormous woods and the country is very wild and everything is at sixes and sevens however of course you would not come because it is in the middle of your london season there would be ever so many things to keep you you are a man who i suppose never was out of london in june in your life unless some race meeting was going on  do you really take me for such as that emily  yes i do that is what they tell me you are is it not true dont you go to races  i should be quite willing to undertake never to put my foot on a racecourse again this minute i will do so now if you will only ask it of me  she paused a moment half thinking that she would ask it but at last she determined against it  no she said if you think it proper to stay away you can do so without my asking it i have no right to make such a request if you think races are bad why dont you stay away of your own accord  they are bad he said  then why do you go to them  they are bad and i do go to them they are very bad and i go to them very often but i will stay away and never put my foot on another racecourse if you my cousin will ask me  that is nonsense  try me it shall not be nonsense if you care enough about me to wish to save me from what is evil you can do it i care enough about you to give up the pursuit at your bidding  as he said this he looked down into her eyes and she knew that the full weight of his gaze was upon her she knew that his words and his looks together were intended to impress her with some feeling of his love for her she knew at the moment too that they gratified her and she remembered also in the same moment that her cousin george was a black sheep  if you cannot refrain from what is bad without my asking you she said your refraining will do no good  he was making her some answer when she insisted on being taken away i must get into the dancingroom i must indeed george i have already thrown over some poor wretch no not yet i see however i was not engaged for the quadrille but i must go back and look after the people  he led her back through the crowd and as he did so he perceived that sir harrys eyes were fixed upon him he did not much care for that if he could carry his cousin emily he thought that he might carry the baronet also  he could not get any special word with her again that night he asked her for another dance but she would not grant it to him you forget the princes and potentates to whom i have to attend she said to him quoting his own words  he did not blame her even to himself judging by the importance which he attached to every word of private conversation which he could have with her that she found it to be equally important it was something gained that she should know that he was thinking of her he could not be to her now like any cousin or any other man with whom she might dance three or four times without meaning anything as he was aware of it so must she be and he was glad that she should feel that it was so  emily tells me that you are going to scarrowby next month he said afterwards to sir harry  sir harry frowned and answered him very shortly yes we shall go there in june  is it a large place  large how do you mean it is a good property  but the house  the house is quite large enough for us said sir harry but we do not have company there  this was said in a very cold tone and there was nothing more to be added george to do him justice had not been fishing for an invitation to scarrowby he had simply been making conversation with the baronet it would not have suited him to go to scarrowby because by doing so he would have lost the power of renewing his visit to humblethwaite but sir harry in this interview had been so very ungraciousand as george knew very well because of the scene in the cornerthat there might be a doubt whether he would ever get to humblethwaite at all if he failed however it should not be for the want of audacity on his own part  but in truth sir harrys blackness was still the result of vacillation though he would fain redeem this prodigal if it were possible and give him everything that was to be given yet when he saw the prodigal attempting to help himself to the good things his wrath was aroused george hotspur as he betook himself from bruton street to such other amusements as were at his command meditated much over his position he thought he could give up the racecourses but he was sure that he could at any rate say that he would give them up     chapter vii  lady altringham   there was one more meeting between cousin george and emily hotspur before sir harry left london with his wife and daughter on the sunday afternoon following the ball he called in bruton street and found lord alfred there he knew that lord alfred had been refused and felt it to be a matter of course that the suit would be pressed again nevertheless he was quite free from animosity to lord alfred he could see at a glance that there was no danger for him on that side lord alfred was talking to lady elizabeth when he entered and emily was engaged with a baldheaded old gentleman with a little ribbon and a star the baldheaded old gentleman soon departed and then cousin george in some skilfully indirect way took an opportunity of letting emily know that he should not go to goodwood this july  not go to goodwood said she pretending to laugh it will be most unnatural will it not theyll hardly start the horses without you i should think  theyll have to start them without me at any rate of course she understood what he meant and understood also why he had told her but if his promise were true so much good had been doneand she sincerely believed that it was true in what way could he make love to her better than by refraining from his evil ways for the sake of pleasing her other baldheaded old gentlemen and bewigged old ladies came in and he had not time for another word he bade her adieu saying nothing now of his hope of meeting her in the autumn and was very affectionate in his farewell to lady elizabeth i dont suppose i shall see sir harry before he starts say goodbye for me  i will george  i am so sorry you are going it has been so jolly coming in here of a sunday lady elizabeth and you have been so good to me i wish scarrowby was at the bottom of the sea  sir harry wouldnt like that at all  i dare say not and as such places must be i suppose they ought to be looked after only why in june goodbye we shall meet again some day but not a word was said about humblethwaite in september he did not choose to mention the prospect of his autumn visit and she did not dare to do so sir harry had not renewed the offer and she would not venture to do so in sir harrys absence  june passed awayas junes do pass in londonvery gaily in appearance very quickly in reality with a huge outlay of money and an enormous amount of disappointment young ladies would not accept and young men would not propose papas became cross and stingy and mammas insinuated that daughters were misbehaving the daughters fought their own battles and became tired in the fighting of them and many a one had declared to herself before july had come to an end that it was all vanity and vexation of spirit  the altringhams always went to goodwoodhusband and wife goodwood and ascot for lady altringham were festivals quite as sacred as were epsom and newmarket for the earl she looked forward to them all the year learned all she could about the horses which were to run was very anxious and energetic about her party and if all that was said was true had her little book it was an institution also that george hotspur should be one of the party and of all the arrangements usually made it was not the one which her ladyship could dispense with the easiest george knew exactly what she liked to have done and how the earl himself would take no trouble and desired simply to be taken there and back and to find everything that was wanted the very moment it was needed and in all such matters the countess chose that the earl should be indulged but it was necessary to have some one who would look after somethingwho would direct the servants and give the orders and be responsible george hotspur did it all admirably and on such occasions earned the hospitality which was given to him throughout the year at goodwood he was almost indispensable to lady altringham but for this meeting she was willing to dispense with him i tell you captain hotspur that youre not to go she said to him  nonsense lady altringham  what a child you are dont you know what depends on it  it does not depend on that  it may every little helps didnt you promise her that you wouldnt  she didnt take it in earnest  i tell you you know nothing about a woman she will take it very much in earnest if you break your word  shell never know  she will shell learn it a girl like that learns everything dont go and let her know that you have not gone  george hotspur thought that he might go and yet let her know that he had not gone an accomplished and successful lie was to him a thing beautiful in itselfan event that had come off usefully a piece of strategy that was evidence of skill so much gained on the world at the least possible outlay an investment from which had come profit without capital lady altringham was very hard on him threatening him at one time with the earls displeasure and absolute refusal of his company but he pleaded hard that his book would be ruinous to him if he did not go that this was a pursuit of such a kind that a man could not give it up all of a moment that he would take care that his name was omitted from the printed list of lord altringhams party and that he ought to be allowed this last recreation the countess at last gave way and george hotspur did go to goodwood  with the success or failure of his book on that occasion our story is not concerned he was still more flush of cash than usual having something left of his cousins generous present at any rate he came to no signal ruin at the races and left london for castle corry on the 10th of august without any known diminution to his prospects at that time the hotspurs were at humblethwaite with a party but it had been already decided that george should not prepare to make his visit till september he was to write from castle corry all that had been arranged between him and the countess and from castle corry he did write      dear lady elizabethsir harry was kind enough to say    last winter that i might come to humblethwaite again    this autumn will you be able to take me in on the 2nd    september we have about finished with altringhams house    and lady a has had enough of me they remain here till    the end of this month with kind regards to sir harry and    emily     believe me yours always     george hotspur   nothing could be simpler than this note and yet every word of it had been weighed and dictated by lady altringham that wont do at all you mustnt seem to be so eager she had said when he showed her the letter as prepared by himself just write as you would do if you were coming here then she sat down and made the copy for him  there was very great doubt and there was much deliberation over that note at humblethwaite the invitation had doubtless been given and sir harry did not wish to turn against his own flesh and bloodto deny admittance to his house to the man who was the heir to his title were he to do so he must give some reason he must declare some quarrel he must say boldly that all intercourse between them was to be at an end and he must inform cousin george that this strong step was taken because cousin george was ablackguard there was no other way of escape left and then cousin george had done nothing since the days of the london intimacies to warrant such treatment he had at least done nothing to warrant such treatment at the hands of sir harry and yet sir harry thoroughly wished that his cousin was at jerusalem he still vacillated but his vacillation did not bring him nearer to his cousins side of the case every little thing that he saw and heard made him know that his cousin was a man to whom he could not give his daughter even for the sake of the family without abandoning his duty to his child at this moment while he was considering georges letter it was quite clear to him that george should not be his soninlaw and yet the fact that the property and the title might be brought together was not absent from his mind when he gave his final assent i dont suppose she cares for him he said to his wife  shes not in love with him if you mean that  what else should i mean he said crossly  she may learn to be in love with him  she had better not she must be told he may come for a week i wont have him here for longer write to him and say that we shall be happy to have him from the second to the ninth emily must be told that i disapprove of him but that i cant avoid opening my house to him  these were the most severe words he had ever spoken about cousin george but then the occasion had become very critical lady elizabeths reply was as follows      my dear cousin georgesir harry and i will be very happy    to have you on the second as you propose and hope you    will stay till the eleventh     yours sincerely     elizabeth hotspur   he was to come on a saturday but she did not like to tell him to go on a saturday because of the following day where could the poor fellow be on the sunday she therefore stretched her invitation for two days beyond the period sanctioned by sir harry  its not very gracious said george as he showed the note to lady altringham  i dont like it the less on that account it shows that theyre afraid about her and they wouldnt be afraid without cause  there is not much of that i fancy  they oughtnt to have a chance against younot if you play your game well even in ordinary cases the fathers and mothers are beaten by the lovers nine times out of ten it is only when the men are oafs and louts that they are driven off but with you with your cousinship and halfheirship and all your practice and the family likeness and the rest of it if you only take a little trouble  ill take any amount of trouble  no you wont youll deny yourself nothing and go through no ordeal that is disagreeable to you i dont suppose your things are a bit better arranged in london than they were in the spring she looked at him as though waiting for an answer but he was silent its too late for anything of that kind now but still you may do very much make up your mind to this that youll ask miss hotspur to be your wife before you leavewhats the name of the place  i have quite made up my mind to that lady altringham  as to the manner of doing it i dont suppose that i can teach you anything  i dont know about that  at any rate i shant try only remember this get her to promise to be firm and then go at once to sir harry dont let there be an appearance of doubt in speaking to him and if he tells you of the propertyangrily i meanthen do you tell him of the title make him understand that you give as much as you get i dont suppose he will yield at first why should he you are not the very best young man about town you know but if you get her he must follow she looks like one that would stick to it if she once had said it  thus prompted george hotspur went from castle corry to humblethwaite i wonder whether he was aware of the extent of the friendship of his friend and whether he ever considered why it was that such a woman should be so anxious to assist him in making his fortune let it be at what cost it might to others lady altringham was not the least in love with captain hotspur was bound to him by no tie whatsoever would suffer no loss in the world should cousin george come to utter and incurable ruin but she was a woman of energy and as she liked the man she was zealous in his friendship     chapter viii  airey force   lady elizabeth had been instructed by sir harry to warn her daughter not to fall in love with cousin george during his visit to humblethwaite and lady elizabeth was as a wife accustomed to obey her husband in all things but obedience in this matter was very difficult such a caution as that received is not easily given even between a mother and a child and is especially difficult when the mother is unconsciously aware of her childs superiority to herself emily was in all respects the bigger woman of the two and was sure to get the best of it in any such cautioning it is so hard to have to bid a girl and a good girl too not to fall in love with a particular man there is left among us at any rate so much of reserve and assumed delicacy as to require us to consider or pretend to consider on the girls behalf that of course she wont fall in love we know that she will sooner or later and probably as much sooner as opportunity may offer that is our experience of the genus girl in the general and we quite approve of her for her readiness to do so it is indeed her nature and the propensity has been planted in her for wise purposes but as to this or that special sample of the genus girl in reference to this or that special sample of the genus young man we always feel ourselves bound to take it as a matter of course that there can be nothing of the kind till the thing is done any caution on the matter is therefore difficult and disagreeable as conveying almost an insult mothers in wellregulated families do not caution their daughters in reference to special young men but lady elizabeth had been desired by her husband to give the caution and must in some sort obey the instruction two days before georges arrival she endeavoured to do as she was told not with the most signal success  your cousin george is coming on saturday  so i heard papa say  your papa gave him a sort of invitation when he was here last time and so he has proposed himself  why should not he it seems very natural he is the nearest relation we have got and we all like him  i dont think your papa does like him  i do  what i mean is your papa doesnt approve of him he goes to races and bets and all that kind of thing and then your papa thinks that hes over head and ears in debt  i dont know anything about his debts as for his going to races i believe he has given them up i am sure he would if he were asked then there was a pause for lady elizabeth hardly knew how to pronounce her caution why shouldnt papa pay his debts  my dear  well mamma why shouldnt he and why shouldnt papa let him have the property i mean leave it to him instead of to me  if your brother had lived  he didnt live mamma that has been our great misfortune but so it is and why shouldnt george be allowed to take his place im sure it would be for the best papa thinks so much about the name and the family and all that  my dear you must leave him to do as he thinks fit in all such matters you may be sure that he will do what he believes to be his duty what i was going to say was this and instead of saying it lady elizabeth still hesitated  i know what you want to say mamma just as well as though the words were out of your mouth you want to make me to understand that george is a black sheep  im afraid he is  but black sheep are not like blackamoors they may be washed white you said so yourself the other day  did i my dear  certainly you did and certainly they may why mamma what is all religion but the washing of black sheep white making the black a little less black scraping a spot white here and there  i am afraid your cousin george is beyond washing  then mamma all i can say is he oughtnt to come here mind i think you wrong him i daresay he has been giddy and fond of pleasure but if he is so bad as you say papa should tell him at once not to come as far as i am concerned i dont believe he is so bad and i shall be glad to see him  there was no cautioning a young woman who could reason in this way and who could look at her mother as emily looked it was not at least within the power of lady elizabeth to do so and yet she could not tell sir harry of her failure she thought that she had expressed the caution and she thought also that her daughter would be wise enough to be guidednot by her mothers wisdom but by the words of her father poor dear woman she was thinking of it every hour of the day but she said nothing more on the subject either to her daughter or to sir harry  the black sheep came and made one of a number of numerous visitors it had been felt that the danger would be less among a multitude and there was present a very excellent young man as to whom there were hopes steps had not been taken about this excellent young man as had been done in reference to lord alfred but still there were hopes he was the eldest son of a lincolnshire squire a man of fair property and undoubted family but who it was thought would not object to merge the name of thoresby in that of hotspur nothing came of the young man who was bashful and to whom miss hotspur certainly gave no entertainment of a nature to remove his bashfulness but when the day for georges coming had been fixed sir harry thought it expedient to write to young thoresby and accelerate a visit which had been previously proposed sir harry as he did so almost hated himself for his anxiety to dispose of his daughter he was a gentleman every inch of him and he thoroughly desired to do his duty he knew however that there was much in his feelings of which he could not but be ashamed and yet if something were not done to assist his girl in a right disposal of all that she had to bestow with her hand how was it probable that it could be disposed aright  the black sheep came and found young thoresby and some dozen other strangers in the house he smiled upon them all and before the first evening was over had made himself the popular man of the house sir harry like a fool as he was had given his cousin only two fingers and had looked black at their first meeting nothing could be gained by conduct such as that with such a guest before the gentlemen left the dinnertable on the first day even he had smiled and joked and had asked questions about altringhams mountains the worst of you fellows who go to scotland is that you care nothing for real sport when you come down south afterwards all this conversation about lord altringhams grouse and the scotch mountains helped george hotspur so that when he went into the drawingroom he was in the ascendant many men have learned the value of such ascendancy and most men have known the want of it  poor lady elizabeth had not a chance with cousin george she succumbed to him at once not knowing why but feeling that she herself became bright amusing and happy when talking to him she was a woman not given to familiarities but she did become familiar with him allowing him little liberties of expression which no other man would take with her and putting them all down to the score of cousinhood he might be a black sheep she feared there could be but little doubt that he was one but from her worstedwork up to the demerits of her dearest friend he did know how to talk better than any other young man she knew to emily on that first evening he said very little when he first met her he had pressed her hand and looked into her eyes and smiled on her with a smile so sweet that it was as though a god had smiled on her she had made up her mind that he should be nothing to hernothing beyond a dear cousin nevertheless her eye had watched him during the whole hour of dinner and not knowing that it was so she had waited for his coming to them in the evening heavens and earth what an oaf was that young thoresby as the two stood together near the door she did not want her cousin to come and talk to her but she listened and laughed within herself as she saw how pleased was her mother by the attentions of the black sheep  one word cousin george did say to emily hotspur that night just as the ladies were leaving the room it was said in a whisper with a little laugh with that air of half joke half earnest which may be so efficacious in conversation i did not go to goodwood after all  she raised her eyes to his for a quarter of a second thanking him for his goodness in refraining i dont believe that he is really a black sheep at all she said to herself that night as she laid her head upon her pillow  after all the devil fights under great disadvantages and has to carry weights in all his races which are almost unfair he lies as a matter of course believing thoroughly in lies thinking that it is by lies chiefly that he must make his running good and yet every lie he tells after it has been told and used remains as an additional weight to be carried when you have used your lie gracefully and successfully it is hard to bury it and get it well out of sight it crops up here and there against you requiring more lies and at last too often has to be admitted as a lie most usually so admitted in silence but still admittedto be forgiven or not according to the circumstances of the case the most perfect forgiveness is that which is extended to him who is known to lie in everything the man has to be taken lies and all as a man is taken with a squint or a harelip or a bad temper he has an uphill game to fight but when once well known he does not fall into the difficulty of being believed  george hotspurs lie was believed to our readers it may appear to have been most gratuitous unnecessary and inexpedient the girl would not have quarrelled with him for going to the raceswould never have asked anything about it but george knew that he must make his running it would not suffice that she should not quarrel with him he had to win her and it came so natural to him to lie and the lie was efficacious she was glad to know that he stayed away from the racesfor her sake had it not been for her sake she would not bid him stay away but she was so glad that he had stayed the lie was very usefulif it only could have been buried and put out of sight when used  there was partridgeshooting for four days not good shooting but work which carried the men far from home and enabled sir harry to look after his cousin george so looked after did not dare to say that on any day he would shirk the shooting but sir harry as he watched his cousin gradually lost his keenness for watching him might it not be best that he should let matters arrange themselves this young squire from lincolnshire was evidently an oaf sir harry could not even cherish a hope on that side his girl was very good and she had been told and the work of watching went so much against the grain with him and then added to it all was the remembrance that if the worst came to the worst the title and property would be kept together george hotspur might have fought his fight we think without the aid of his lie  on the friday the party was to some extent broken up the oaf and sundry other persons went away sir harry had thought that the cousin would go on the saturday and had been angry with his wife because his orders on that head had not been implicitly obeyed but when the friday came and george offered to go in with him to penrith to hear some case of fishpoaching which was to be brought before the magistrates he had forgiven the offence george had a great deal to say about fish and then went on to say a good deal about himself if he could only get some employment a farm say where he might have hunting how good it would be for he did not pretend to any virtuous abnegation of the pleasures of the world but was willingso he saidto add to them some little attempt to earn his own bread on this day sir harry liked his cousin better than he had ever done before though he did not even then place the least confidence in his cousins sincerity as to the farm and the earning of bread  on their return to the hall on friday they found that a party had been made to go to ulleswater on the saturday a certain mrs fitzpatrick was staying in the house who had never seen the lake and the carriage was to take them to airey force airey force as everybody knows is a waterfall near to the shores of the lake and is the great lion of the lake scenery on that side of the mountains the waterfall was full fifteen miles from humblethwaite but the distance had been done before and could be done again emily mrs fitzpatrick and two other young ladies were to go mr fitzpatrick would sit on the box there was a youth there also who had left school and not yet gone to college he was to be allowed to drive a dogcart of course george hotspur was ready to go in the dogcart with him  george had determined from the commencement of his visit when he began to foresee that this saturday would be more at his command than any other day that on this saturday he would make or mar his fortune for life he had perceived that his cousin was cautious with him that he would be allowed but little scope for lovemaking that she was in some sort afraid of him but he perceived also that in a quiet undemonstrative way she was very gracious to him she never ignored him as young ladies will sometimes ignore young men but thought of him even in his absence and was solicitous for his comfort he was clever enough to read little signs and was sure at any rate that she liked him  why did you not postpone the party till george was gone sir harry said to his wife  the fitzpatricks also go on monday she answered and we could not refuse them  then again it occurred to sir harry that life would not be worth having if he was to be afraid to allow his daughter to go to a picnic in company with her cousin  there is a bridge across the water at the top of airey force which is perhaps one of the prettiest spots in the whole of our lake country the entire party on their arrival of course went up to the bridge and then the entire party of course descended how it happened that in the course of the afternoon george and emily were there again and were there unattended who can tell if she had meant to be cautious she must very much have changed her plans in allowing herself to be led thither and as he stood there with no eye resting on them his arm was round her waist and she was pressed to his side  dearest dearest he said may i believe that you love me  i have said so you may believe it if you will  she did not attempt to make the distance greater between them she leant against him willingly  dear george i do love you my choice has been made i have to trust to you for everything  you shall never trust in vain he said  you must reform you know she said turning round and looking up into his face with a smile they say that you have been wild you must not be wild any more sir  i will reform i have reformed i say it boldly i have become an altered man since i knew you i have lived with one hope and even the hope alone has changed me now i have got all that i have hoped for oh emily i wish you knew how much i love you  they were there on the bridge or roaming together alone among the woods for nearly an hour after that till mrs fitzpatrick who knew the value of the prize and the nature of the man began to fear that she had been remiss in her duty as chaperon as emily came down and joined the party at last she was perfectly regardless either of their frowns or smiles there had been one last compact made between the lovers  george she had said whatever it may cost us let there be no secrets  of course not he replied  i will tell mamma tonight and you must tell papa you will promise me  certainly it is what i should insist on doing myself i could not stay in his house under other circumstances but you too must promise me one thing emily  what is it  you will be true to me even though he should refuse his consent  she paused before she answered him  i will be true to you i cannot be otherwise than true to you my love was a thing to give but when given i cannot take it back i will be true to you but of course we cannot be married unless papa consents  he urged her no further he was too wise to think it possible that he could do so without injuring his cause then they found the others and emily made her apologies to mrs fitzpatrick for the delay with a quiet dignity that struck her cousin george almost with awe how had it been that such a one as he had won so great a creature  george as he was driven home by his young companion was full of joyous chatter and light small talk he had done a good stroke of business and was happy if only the baronet could be brought round all the troubles which had enveloped him since a beard had first begun to grow on his chin would disappear as a mist beneath the full rays of the sun or even if there still might be a trouble or twoand as he thought of his prospects he remembered that they could not all be made to disappear in the mist fashionthere would be that which would gild the clouds at any rate he had done a good stroke of business and he loved the girl too he thought that of all the girls he had seen about town or about the country either she was the bonniest and the brightest and the most clever it might well have been that a poor devil like he in search of an heiress might have been forced to put up with personal disadvantageswith age with plain looks with vulgar manners with low birth but here so excellent was his fortune there was everything which fortune could give love her of course he loved her he would do anything on earth for her and how jolly they would be together when they got hold of their share of that £20000 a year and how jolly it would be to owe nothing to anybody as he thought of this however there came upon him the reminiscence of a certain captain stubber and the further reminiscence of a certain mr abraham hart with both of whom he had dealings and he told himself that it would behove him to call up all his pluck when discussing those gentlemen and their dealings with the baronet he was sure that the baronet would not like captain stubber nor mr hart and that a good deal of pluck would be needed but on the whole he had done a great stroke of business and as a consequence of his success talked and chatted all the way home till the youth who was driving him thought that george was about the nicest fellow that he had ever met  emily hotspur as she took her place in the carriage was very silent she also had much of which to think much on whichas she dreamedto congratulate herself but she could not think of it and talk at the same time she had made her little apology with graceful ease she had just smiledbut the smile was almost a rebukewhen one of her companions had ventured on the beginning of some little joke as to her company and then she had led the way to the carriage mrs fitzpatrick and the two girls were nothing to her now let them suspect what they choose or say what they might she had given herself away and she triumphed in the surrender the spot on which he had told her of his love should be sacred to her for ever it was a joy to her that it was near to her own home the home that she would give to him so that she might go there with him again and again she had very much to consider and to remember a black sheep no of all the flock he should be the least black it might be that in the energy of his pleasures he had exceeded other men as he did exceed all other men in everything that he did and said who was so clever who so bright who so handsome so full of poetry and of manly grace how sweet was his voice how fine his gait how gracious his smile and then in his brow there was that look of command which she had ever recognized in her fathers face as belonging to his race as a hotspuronly added to it was a godlike beauty which her father never could have possessed  she did not conceal from herself that there might be trouble with her father and yet she was not sure but that upon the whole he would be pleased after a while humblethwaite and the family honours would still go together if he would sanction this marriage and she knew how he longed in his heart that it might be so for a time probably he might be averse to her prayers should it be so she would simply give him her word that she would never during his lifetime marry without his permissionand then she would be true to her troth as to her truth in that respect there could be no doubt she had given her word and that for a hotspur must be enough  she could not talk as she thought of all this and therefore had hardly spoken when george appeared at the carriage door to give the ladies a hand as they came into the house to her he was able to give one gentle pressure as she passed on but she did not speak to him nor was it necessary that she should do so had not everything been said already     chapter ix  i know what you are   the scene which took place that night between the mother and daughter may be easily conceived emily told her tale and told it in a manner which left no doubt of her persistency she certainly meant it lady elizabeth had almost expected it there are evils which may come or may not but as to which though we tell ourselves that they may still be avoided we are inwardly almost sure that they will come such an evil in the mind of lady elizabeth had been cousin george not but what she herself would have liked him for a soninlaw had it not been so certain that he was a black sheep  your father will never consent to it my dear  of course mamma i shall do nothing unless he does  you will have to give him up  no mamma not that that is beyond what papa can demand of me i shall not give him up but i certainly shall not marry him without papas consent or yours  nor see him  well if he does not come i cannot see him  nor correspond with him  certainly not if papa forbids it  after that lady elizabeth did give way to a considerable extent she did not tell her daughter that she considered it at all probable that sir harry would yield but she made it to be understood that she herself would do so if sir harry would be persuaded and she acknowledged that the amount of obedience promised by emily was all that could be expected but mamma said emily before she left her mother do you not know that you love him yourself  love is such a strong word my dear  it is not half strong enough said emily pressing her two hands together but you do mamma  i think he is very agreeable certainly  and handsomeonly that goes for nothing  yes he is a finelooking man  and clever i dont know how it is let there be who there may in the room he is always the best talker  he knows how to talk certainly  and mamma dont you think that there is a somethingi dont know whatsomething not at all like other men about him that compels one to love him oh mamma do say something nice to me to me he is everything that a man should be  i wish he were my dear  as for the sort of life he has been leading spending more money than he ought and all that kind of thing he has promised to reform it altogether and he is doing it now at any rate you must admit mamma that he is not false  i hope not my dear  why do you speak in that way mamma does he talk like a man that is false have you ever known him to be false dont be prejudiced mamma at any rate  the reader will understand that when the daughter had brought her mother as far as this the elder lady was compelled to say something nice at last at any rate there was a loving embrace between them and an understanding that the mother would not exaggerate the difficulties of the position either by speech or word  of course you will have to see your papa tomorrow morning lady elizabeth said  george will tell him everything tonight said emily she as she went to her bed did not doubt but what the difficulties would melt luckily for herso luckilyit happened that her lover possessed by his very birth a right which beyond all other possessions would recommend him to her father and then had not the man himself all natural good gifts to recommend him of course he had not money or property but she had or would have property and of all men alive her father was the least disposed to be greedy as she half thought of it and half dreamt of it in her last waking moments of that important day she was almost altogether happy it was so sweet to know that she possessed the love of him whom she loved better than all the world beside  cousin george did not have quite so good a time of it that night the first thing he did on his return from ulleswater to humblethwaite was to write a line to his friend lady altringham this had been promised and he did so before he had seen sir harry      dear lady ai have been successful with my younger    cousin she is the bonniest and the best and the    brightest girl that ever lived and i am the happiest    fellow but i have not as yet seen the baronet i am to do    so tonight and will report progress tomorrow i doubt i    shant find him so bonny and so good and so bright but    as you say the young birds ought to be too strong for the    old onesyours most sincerely     g h   this was written while he was dressing and was put into the letterbox by himself as he came downstairs it was presumed that the party had dined at the falls but there was a tea prepared for them on an extensive scale sir harry suspecting nothing was happy and almost jovial with mr fitzpatrick and the two young ladies emily said hardly a word lady elizabeth who had not as yet been told but already suspected something was very anxious george was voluble witty and perhaps a little too loud but as the lad who was going to oxford and who had drank a good deal of champagne and was now drinking sherry was loud also georges manner was not specially observed it was past ten before they got up from the table and nearly eleven before george was able to whisper a word to the baronet he almost shirked it for that night and would have done so had he not remembered how necessary it was that emily should know that his pluck was good of course she would be asked to abandon him of course she would be told that it was her duty to give him up of course she would give him up unless he could get such a hold upon her heart as to make her doing so impossible to her she would have to learn that he was an unprincipled spendthriftnay worse than that as he hardly scrupled to tell himself but he need not weight his own character with the further burden of cowardice the baronet could not eat him and he would not be afraid of the baronet sir harry he whispered could you give me a minute or two before we go to bed sir harry started as though he had been stung and looked his cousin sharply in the face without answering him george kept his countenance and smiled  i wont keep you long he said  you had better come to my room said sir harry gruffly and led the way into his own sanctum when there he sat down in his accustomed armchair without offering george a seat but george soon found a seat for himself and now what is it said sir harry with his blackest frown  i have asked my cousin to be my wife  what emily  yes emily and she has consented i now ask for your approval we must give cousin george his due and acknowledge that he made his little request exactly as he would have done had he been master of ten thousand a year of his own quite unencumbered  what right had you sir to speak to her without coming to me first  one always does i think go to the girl first said george  you have disgraced yourself sir and outraged my hospitality you are no gentleman  sir harry that is strong language  strong of course it is strong i mean it to be strong i shall make it stronger yet if you attempt to say another word to her  look here sir harry i am bound to bear a good deal from you but i have a right to explain  you have a right sir to go away from this and go away you shall  sir harry you have told me that i am not a gentleman  you have abused my kindness to you what right have you who have not a shilling in the world to speak to my daughter i wont have it and let that be an end of it i wont have it and i must desire that you will leave humblethwaite tomorrow i wont have it  it is quite true that i have not a shilling  then what business have you to speak to my daughter  because i have that which is worth many shillings and which you value above all your property i am the heir to your name and title when you are gone i must be the head of this family i do not in the least quarrel with you for choosing to leave your property to your own child but i have done the best i could to keep the property and the title together i love my cousin  i dont believe in your love sir  if that is all i do not doubt but that i can satisfy you  it is not all and it is not half all and it isnt because you are a pauper you know it all as well as i do without my telling you but you drive me to tell you  know what sir  though you hadnt a shilling you should have had her if you could win herhad your life been even fairly decent the title must go to youworse luck for the family you can talk well enough and what you say is true i would wish that they should go together  of course it will be better  but sir then sir henry paused  well sir harry  you oblige me to speak out you are such a one that i do not dare to let you have my child your life is so bad that i should not be justified in doing so for any family purpose you would break her heart  you wrong me there altogether  you are a gambler  i have been sir harry  and a spendthrift  wellyes as long as i had little or nothing to spend  i believe you are over head and ears in debt now in spite of the assistance you have had from me within twelve months  cousin george remembered the advice which had been given him that he should conceal nothing from his cousin i do owe some money certainly he said  and how do you mean to pay it  wellif i marry emily i suppose thatyou will pay it  thats cool at any rate  what can i say sir harry  i would pay it all though it were to half the property  less than a years income would clear off every shilling i owe sir harry  listen to me sir though it were ten years income i would pay it all if i thought that the rest would be kept with the title and that my girl would be happy  i will make her happy  but sir it is not only that you are a gambler and spendthrift and an unprincipled debtor without even a thought of paying you are worse than this therei am not going to call you names i know what you are and you shall not have my daughter  george hotspur found himself compelled to think for a few moments before he could answer a charge so vague and yet as he knew so well founded nevertheless he felt that he was progressing his debts would not stand in his way if only he could make this rich father believe that in other matters his daughter would not be endangered by the marriage i dont quite know what you mean sir harry i am not going to defend myself i have done much of which i am ashamed i was turned very young upon the world and got to live with rich people when i was myself poor i ought to have withstood the temptation but i didnt and i got into bad hands i dont deny it there is a horrid jew has bills of mine now  what have you done with that five thousand pounds  he had half of it and i had to settle for the last leger which went against me  it is all gone  pretty nearly i dont pretend but what i have been very reckless as to money i am ready to tell you the truth about everything i dont say that i deserve her but i do say thisthat i should not have thought of winning her in my position had it not been for the title having that in my favour i do not think that i was misbehaving to you in proposing to her if you will trust me now i will be as grateful and obedient a son as any man ever had  he had pleaded his cause well and he knew it sir harry also felt that his cousin had made a better case than he would have believed to be possible he was quite sure that the man was a scamp utterly untrustworthy and yet the mans pleading for himself had been efficacious he sat silent for full five minutes before he spoke again and then he gave judgment as follows you will go away without seeing her tomorrow  if you wish it  and you will not write to her  only a line  not a word said sir harry imperiously  only a line which i will give open to you you can do with it as you please  and as you have forced upon me the necessity i shall make inquiries in london as to your past life i have heard things which perhaps may be untrue  what things sir harry  i shall not demean myself or injure you by repeating them unless i find cause to believe they are true i do believe that the result will be such as to make me feel that in justice to my girl i cannot allow you to become her husband i tell you so fairly should the debts you owe be simple debts not dishonourably contracted i will pay them  and then she shall be mine  i will make no such promise you had better go now you can have the carriage to penrith as early as you please in the morning or to carlisle if you choose to go north i will make your excuses to lady elizabeth good night  cousin george stood for a second in doubt and then shook hands with the baronet he reached penrith the next morning soon after ten and breakfasted alone at the hotel  there were but very few words spoken on the occasion between the father and daughter but emily did succeed in learning pretty nearly the truth of what had taken place on the monday her mother gave her the following note      dearestat your fathers bidding i have gone suddenly    you will understand why i have done so i shall try to do    just as he would have me but you will i know be quite    sure that i should never give you upyours for ever and    ever     g h   the father had thought much of it and at last had determined that emily should have the letter  in the course of the week there came other guests to humblethwaite and it so chanced that there was a lady who knew the altringhams who had unfortunately met the altringhams at goodwood and who most unfortunately stated in emilys hearing that she had seen george hotspur at goodwood  he was not there said emily quite boldly  oh yes with the altringhams as usual he is always with them at goodwood  he was not at the last meeting said emily smiling  the lady said nothing till her lord was present and then appealed to him frank didnt you see george hotspur with the altringhams at goodwood last july  to be sure i did and lost a pony to him on eros  the lady looked at emily who said nothing further but she was still quite convinced that george hotspur had not been at those goodwood races  it is so hard when you have used a lie commodiously to bury it and get well rid of it     chapter x  mr hart and captain stubber   when george hotspur left humblethwaite turned out of the house by the angry baronet early in the morningas the reader will rememberhe was at his own desire driven to penrith choosing to go south rather than north he had doubted for a while as to his immediate destination the altringhams were still at castle corry and he might have received great comfort from her ladyships advice and encouragement but intimate as he was with the altringhams he did not dare to take a liberty with the earl a certain allowance of splendid hospitality at castle corry was at his disposal every year and lord altringham always welcomed him with thorough kindness but george hotspur had in some fashion been made to understand that he was not to overstay his time and he was quite aware that the earl could be very disagreeable upon occasions there was a something in the earl of which george was afraid and to tell the truth he did not dare to go back to castle corry and then might it not be well for him to make immediate preparation in london for those inquiries respecting his debts and his character which sir harry had decided to make it would be very difficult for him to make any preparation that could lead to a good result but if no preparation were made the result would be very bad indeed it might perhaps be possible to do something with mr hart and captain stubber he had no other immediate engagements in october he was due to shoot pheasants with a distinguished party in norfolk but this business which he had now in hand was of so much importance that even the pheasantshooting and the distinguished party were not of much moment to him  he went to penrith and thence direct to london it was the habit of his life to give up his london lodgings when he left town at the end of the season and spare himself the expense of any home as long as he could find friends to entertain him there are certain items of the cost of living for which the greatest proficient in the art of tick must pay or he will come to a speedy endand a mans lodging is one of them if indeed the spendthrift adapts himself to the splendour of housekeeping he may provided his knowledge of his business be complete and his courage adequate house himself gloriously for a year or two with very small payment in ready money he may even buy a mansion with an incredibly small outlay and when once in it will not easily allow himself to be extruded george hotspur however not from any want of knowledge or of audacity but from the nature of the life he chose to lead had abstained from such investment of his credit and had paid for his lodgings in st james street he was consequently houseless at the moment and on his arrival in london took himself to an hotel close behind the military club to which he belonged  at this moment he was comparatively a rich man he had between three and four hundred pounds at a bank at which he kept an account when possessed of funds but demands upon him were very pressing and there was a certain captain stubber who was bitter against him almost to blood because one mr abraham hart had received two thousand pounds from the proceeds of sir harrys generosity captain stubber had not received a shilling and had already threatened cousin george with absolute exposure if something were not done to satisfy him  george when he had ordered his dinner at his club wrote the following letter to lady altringham he had intended to write from penrith in the morning but when there had been out of sorts and unhappy and had disliked to confess after his note of triumph sounded on the previous evening that he had been turned out of humblethwaite he had got over that feeling during the day with the help of sundry glasses of sherry and a little mixed curaçoa and brandy which he took immediately on his arrival in londonand so supported made a clean breast of it as the reader shall see      dear lady a he saidhere i am back in town banished    from heaven my darling gentle future papainlaw    gave me to understand when i told him the extent of my    hopes last night that the outside of the parkgates at    humblethwaite was the place for me nevertheless he sent    me to penrith with the family horses and taking it as    a whole i think that my interview with him although    very disagreeable was not unsatisfactory i told him    everything that i could tell him he was kind enough to    call me a blackguard  because i had gone to emily    without speaking to him first on such occasions however    a man takes anything i ventured to suggest that what i    had done was not unprecedented among young people and    hinted that while he could make me the future master of    humblethwaite i could make my cousin the future lady    hotspur and that in no other way could humblethwaite and    the hotspurs be kept together it was wonderful how he    cooled down after a while saying that he would pay all my    debts if he found themsatisfactory i can only say that    i never found them so     it ended in thisthat he is to make inquiry about me and    that i am to have my cousin unless i am found out to be    very bad indeed how or when the inquiries will be made i    do not know but i am here to prepare for them     yours always most faithfully     g h     i do not like to ask altringham to do anything for me no    man ever had a kinder friend than i have had in him and    i know he objects to meddle in the money matters of other    people but if he could lend me his name for a thousand    pounds till i can get these things settled i believe    i could get over every other difficulty i should as a    matter of course include the amount in the list of debts    which i should give to sir harry but the sum at once    which i could raise on his name without trouble to him    would enable me to satisfy the only creditor who will be    likely to do me real harm with sir harry i think you    will understand all this and will perceive how very    material the kindness to me may be but if you think that    altringham will be unwilling to do it you had better not    show him this letter   it was the mixed curaçoa and brandy which gave george hotspur the courage to make the request contained in his postscript he had not intended to make it when he sat down to write but as he wrote the idea had struck him that if ever a man ought to use a friend this was an occasion for doing so if he could get a thousand pounds from lord altringham he might be able to stop captain stubbers mouth he did not believe that he should be successful and he thought it probable that lord altringham might express vehement displeasure but the game was worth the candle and then he knew that he could trust the countess  london was very empty and he passed a wretched evening at his club there were not men enough to make up a pool and he was obliged to content himself with a game of billiards with an old halfpay naval captain who never left london and who would bet nothing beyond a shilling on the game the halfpay navy captain won four games thereby paying for his dinner and then cousin george went sulkily to bed  he had come up to town expressly to see captain stubber and mr hart and perhaps also to see another friend from whom some advice might be had but on the following morning he found himself very averse to seeking any of these advisers he had applied to lady altringham for assistance and he told himself that it would be wise to wait for her answer and yet he knew that it would not be wise to wait as sir harry would certainly be quick in making his promised inquiries for four days he hung about between his hotel and his club and then he got lady altringhams answer we need only quote the passage which had reference to georges special request      gustavus says that he will have nothing to do with money    you know his feelings about it and he says that it would    do no good whatever the debts are tell them plainly to    sir harry if this be some affair of play as gustavus    supposes tell that to sir harry gustavus thinks that the    baronet would without doubt pay any such debt which could    be settled or partly settled by a thousand pounds   dd heartless selfish fellow quite incapable of anything like true friendship said cousin george to himself when he read lady altringhams letter  now he must do something hitherto neither stubber nor hart nor the other friend knew of his presence in london hart though a jew was much less distasteful to him than captain stubber and to mr abraham hart he went first  mr abraham hart was an attorneyso called by himself and friendsliving in a genteel street abutting on grays inn road with whose residence and place of business all beneath the same roof george hotspur was very well acquainted mr hart was a man in the prime of life with black hair and a black beard and a new shining hat and a coat with a velvet collar and silk lining he was always dressed in the same way and had never yet been seen by cousin george without his hat on his head he was a pleasantspoken very ignorant smiling jocose man with a slightly jewish accent who knew his business well pursued it diligently and considered himself to have a clear conscience he had certain limits of forbearance with his customerslimits which were not narrow but when those were passed he would sell the bed from under a dying woman with her babe or bread from the mouth of a starving child to do so was the necessity of his tradefor his own guidance in which he had made laws the breaking of those laws by himself would bring his trade to an end and therefore he declined to break them  mr hart was a man who attended to his business and he was found at home even in september yes mr oshspur its about time something was done now aint it said mr hart smiling pleasantly  cousin george also smiling reminded his friend of the two thousand pounds paid to him only a few months since not a shilling was mine of that captain oshspur not a brass fardin that was quite neshesshary just then as you know captain oshspur or the fat must have been in the fire and whats up now  not without considerable difficulty cousin george explained to the jew gentleman what was up he probably assumed more inclination on the part of sir harry for the match than he was justified in doing but was very urgent in explaining to mr hart that when inquiry was made on the part of sir harry as to the nature of the debt the naked truth should not be exactly told  it was very bad vasnt it captain oshspur having to divide with that fellow stubber the money from the orse guards you vas too clever for both of us there mr oshspur verent you now captain oshspur and ive two cheques still on my ands which is marked no account no account is very bad isnt no account very bad on a cheque captain oshspur and then ive that cheque on drummond signedgod knows how that is signed there aint no such person at all baldebeque thats more like it than nothing else when you brought me that i thought there vas a lord baldebeque and i know you live among lords captain oshspur  on my honour i brought it youjust as i took it at tattersalls  there was an expert as i showed it to says it is your handwriting captain oshspur  he lies said cousin george fiercely  but when stubber would have half the sale money for the commissionand wanted it all too lord how he did curse and swear that was bad captain oshspur  then cousin george swallowed his fierceness for a time and proceeded to explain to mr hart that sir harry would certainly pay all his debts if only those little details could be kept back to which mr hart had so pathetically alluded above all it would be necessary to preserve in obscurity that little mistake which had been made as to the pawning of the commission cousin george told a great many lies but he told also much that was true the jew did not believe one of the lies but then neither did he believe much of the truth when george had finished his story then mr hart had a story of his own to tell  to let you know all about it captain oshspur the old gent has begun about it already  what sir harry  yes sir arry mr boltby  hes the family lawyer  i suppose so captain oshspur vell he vas here yesterday and vas very polite if id just tell him all about everything he thought as ow the baronet would settle the affair off and he vas very generous in his offer vas mr boltby but he didnt say nothin of any marriage captain oshspur  of course he didnt you are not such a fool as to suppose he would  no i aint such a fool as i looks captain oshspur am i i didnt think it likely seeing vat vas the nature of his interrogatories mr boltby seemed to know a good deal it is astonishing how much them fellows do know  you didnt tell him anything  not much captain oshspurnot at fust starting im a going to have my money you know captain oshspur and if i see my vay to my money one vay and if i dont see no vay the other vay vy vhats a man to do you cant blame me captain oshspur ive been very indulgent with you i have captain oshspur  cousin george promised threatened explained swore by all his gods and ended by assuring mr abraham hart that his life and death were in that gentlemans keeping if mr hart would only not betray him the money would be safe and the marriage would be safe and everything would easily come right over and above other things cousin george would owe to mr abraham hart a debt of gratitude which never would be wholly paid mr hart could only say that he meant to have his money but that he did not mean to be ungenteel much in his opinion must depend on what stubber would do as for stubber he couldnt speak to stubber himself as he and stubber were two as for himself if he could get his money he certainly would not be ungenteel and he meant what he saidmeant more than he said he would still run some risk rather than split on an old customer such as captain oshspur but now that a sudden way to his money was opened to him he could not undertake to lose sight of it  with a very heavy heart cousin george went from mr harts house to the house of call of captain stubber mr boltby had been before him with hart and he augured the worst from sir harrys activity in the matter if mr boltby had already seen the captain all his labour would probably be too late where captain stubber lived even so old a friend of his as cousin george did not know and in what way captain stubber had become a captain george though he had been a military man himself had never learned but captain stubber had a house of call in a very narrow dirty little street near red lion square it was close to a publichouse but did not belong to the publichouse george hotspur who had been very often to the place of call had never seen there any appurtenances of the captains business there were no accountbooks no writingtable no ink even except that contained in a little box with a screw which captain stubber would take out of his own pocket mr hart was so far established and civilized as to keep a boy whom he called a clerk but captain stubber seemed to keep nothing a dirty little girl at the house of call would run and fetch captain stubber if he were within reach but most usually an appointment had to be made with the captain cousin george well remembered the day when his brother captain first made his acquaintance about two years after the commencement of his life in london captain stubber had had an interview with him in the little waitingroom just within the club doors captain stubber then had in his possession a trumpery note of hand with georges signature which as he stated he had done for a small tradesman with whom george had been fool enough to deal for cigars from that day to the present he and captain stubber had been upon most intimate and confidential terms if there was any one in the world whom cousin george really hated it was captain stubber  on this occasion captain stubber was forthcoming after a delay of about a quarter of an hour during that time cousin george had stood in the filthy little parlour of the house of call in a frame of mind which was certainly not to be envied had mr boltby also been with captain stubber he knew his two creditors well enough to understand that the jew getting his money would be better pleased to serve him than to injure him but the captain would from choice do him an ill turn nothing but selfinterest would tie up captain stubbers tongue captain stubber was a tall thin gentleman probably over sixty years of age with very seedy clothes and a red nose he always had berlin gloves very much torn about the fingers carried a cotton umbrella woreas his sole mark of respectabilitya very stiff clean white collar round his neck and invariably smelt of gin no one knew where he lived or how he carried on his business but such as he was he had dealings with large sums of money or at least with bills professing to stand for large sums and could never have been found without a case in his pocket crammed with these documents the quarter of an hour seemed to george to be an age but at last captain stubber knocked at the front door and was shown into the room  how dye do captain stubber said george  id do a deal better captain hotspur if i found it easier sometimes to come by my own  well yes but no doubt you have your profit in the delay captain stubber  its nothing to you captain hotspur whether i have profit or loss all you as got to look to is to pay me what you owe me and i intend that you shall or by g you shall suffer for it im not going to stand it any longer i know where to have you and have you i will  cousin george was not quite sure whether the captain did know where to have him if mr boltby had been with him it might be so but then captain stubber was not a man so easily found as mr hart and the connection between himself and the captain might possibly have escaped mr boltbys inquiries it was very difficult to tell the story of his love to such a man as captain stubber but he did tell it he explained all the difficulties of sir harrys position in regard to the title and the property and he was diffuse upon his own advantages as head of the family and of the need there was that he should marry the heiress  but there is not an acre of it will come to you unless he gives it you inquired captain stubber  certainly not said cousin george anxious that the captain should understand the real facts of the case to a certain extent  and he neednt give you the girl  the girl will give herself my friend  and he neednt give the girl the property  but he will she is his only child  i dont believe a word about it i dont believe such a one as sir harry hotspur would lift his hand to help such as you  he has offered to pay my debts already  very well let him make the offer to me look here captain hotspur i am not a bit afraid of you you know  who asks you to be afraid  of all the liars i ever met with you are the worst  george hotspur smiled looking up at the red nose of the malignant old man as though it were a joke but that which he had to hear at this moment was a heavy burden captain stubber probably understood this for he repeated his words  i never knew any liar nigh so bad as you and then there is such a deal worse than lies i believe i could send you to penal servitude captain hotspur  you could do no such thing said cousin george still trying to look as though it were a joke and you dont think you could  ill do my best at any rate if i dont have my money soon you could pay mr hart two thousand pounds but you think im nobody  i am making arrangements now for having every shilling paid to you  yes i see ive known a good deal about your arrangements look here captain hotspur unless i have five hundred pounds on or before saturday ill write to sir harry hotspur and ill give him a statement of all our dealings you can trust me though i cant trust you good morning captain hotspur  captain stubber did believe in his heart that he was a man much injured by cousin george and that cousin george was one whom he was entitled to despise and yet a poor wretch more despicable more dishonest more false more wicked or more cruel than captain stubber could not have been found in all london his business was carried on with a small capital borrowed from a firm of low attorneys who were the real holders of the bills he carried and the profits which they allowed him to make were very trifling but from cousin george during the last twelve months he had made no profit at all and cousin george in former days had trodden upon him as on a worm  cousin george did not fail to perceive that mr boltby had not as yet applied to captain stubber     chapter xi  mrs morton   five hundred pounds before saturday and this was tuesday as cousin george was taken westward from red lion square in a cab three or four different lines of conduct suggested themselves to him in the first place it would be a very good thing to murder captain stubber in the present effeminate state of civilization and with the existing scruples as to the value of human life he did not see his way clearly in this direction but entertained the project rather as a beautiful castle in the air the two next suggestions were to pay him the money demanded or to pay him half of it the second suggestion was the simpler as the state of cousin georges funds made it feasible but then that brute would probably refuse to take the half in lieu of the whole when he found that his demand had absolutely produced a tender of ready cash as for paying the whole it might perhaps be done it was still possible that with such prospects before him as those he now possessed he could raise a hundred or hundred and fifty pounds but then he would be left penniless the last course of action which he contemplated was to take no further notice of captain stubber and let him tell his story to sir harry if he chose to tell it the man was such a blackguard that his entire story would probably not be believed and then was it not almost necessary that sir harry should hear it of course there would be anger and reproaches and threats and difficulty but if emily would be true to him they might all by degrees be levelled down this latter line of conduct would be practicable and had this beautiful attractionthat it would save for his own present use that charming balance of ready money which he still possessed had altringham possessed any true backbone of friendship he might now he thought have been triumphant over all his difficulties  when he sat down to his solitary dinner at his club he was very tired with his days work attending to the affairs of such gentlemen as mr hart and captain stubberwho well know how to be masterful when their time for being masterful has comeis fatiguing enough but he had another task to perform before he went to bed which he would fain have kept unperformed were it possible to do so he had written to a third friend to make an appointment for the evening and this appointment he was bound to keep he would very much rather have stayed at his club and played billiards with the navy captain even though he might again have lost his shillings the third friend was that mrs morton to whom lord altringham had once alluded i supposed that it was coming said mrs morton when she had listened without letting a word fall from her own lips to the long rambling story which cousin george told hera rambling story in which there were many lies but in which there was the essential truth that cousin george intended if other things could be made to fit to marry his cousin emily hotspur mrs morton was a woman who had been handsomedark thin with great brown eyes and thin lips and a long wellformed nose she was in truth three years younger than george hotspur but she looked to be older she was a clever woman and well read too and in every respect superior to the man whom she had condescended to love she earned her bread by her profession as an actress and had done so since her earliest years what story there may be of a mr morton who had years ago married and illused and deserted her need not here be told her strongest passion at this moment was love for the coldblooded reprobate who had now come to tell her of his intended marriage she had indeed loved george hotspur and george had been sufficiently attached to her to condescend to take aid from her earnings  i supposed that it was coming she said in a low voice when he brought to an end the rambling story which she had allowed him to tell without a word of interruption  what is a fellow to do said george  is she handsome  george thought that he might mitigate the pain by making little of his cousin well no not particularly she looks like a lady  and i suppose i dont for a moment there was a virulence in this which made poor george almost gasp this woman was patient to a marvel longbearing affectionate imbued with that conviction so common to woman and the cause of so much delight to menthat illusage and suffering are intended for woman but george knew that she could turn upon him if goaded far enough and rend him he could depend upon her for very much because she loved him but he was afraid of her you didnt mean that i know she added smiling  of course i didnt  no your cruelties dont lie in that line do they george  im sure i never mean to be cruel to you lucy  i dont think you do i hardly believe that you ever mean anythingexcept just to get along and live  a fellow must live you know said george  in ordinary society george hotspur could be bright and he was proud of being bright with this woman he was always subdued always made to play second fiddle always talked like a boy and he knew it he had loved her once if he was capable of loving anything but her mastery over him wearied him even though he was after a fashion proud of her cleverness and he wished that she werewell dead if the reader choose that mode of expressing what probably were georges wishes but he had never told himself that he desired her death he could build pleasant castles in the air as to the murder of captain stubber but his thoughts did not travel that way in reference to mrs morton  she is not pretty thenthis rich bride of yours  not particularly shes well enough you know  and well enough is good enough for youis it do you love her george  the womans voice was very low and plaintive as she asked the question though from moment to moment she could use her little skill in pricking him with her satire still she loved him and she would vary her tone and as at one minute she would make him uneasy by her raillery so at the next she would quell him by her tenderness she looked into his face for a reply when he hesitated tell me that you do not love her she said passionately  not particularly replied george  and yet you would marry her  whats a fellow to do you see how i am fixed about the title these are kinds of things to which a man situated as i am is obliged to submit  royal obligations as one might call them  by george yes said george altogether missing the satire from any other lips he would have been sharp enough to catch it one cant see the whole thing go to the dogs after it has kept its head up so long and then you know a man cant live altogether without an income  you have done so pretty well  i know that i owe you a lot of money lucy and i know also that i mean to pay you  dont talk about that i dont know how at such a time as this you can bring yourself to mention it then she rose from her seat and flashed into wrath carried on by the spirit of her own words look here george if you send me any of that womans money by the living god i will send it back to herself to buy me with her money but it is so like a man  i didnt mean that sir harry is to pay all my debts  and will not that be the same will it not be her money why is he to pay your debts because he loves you  it is all a family arrangement you dont quite understand  of course i dont understand such a one as i cannot lift myself so high above the earth great families form a sort of heaven of their own which poor broken illconditioned wretched common creatures such as i am cannot hope to comprehend but by heaven what a lot of the vilest clay goes to the making of that garden of eden look here georgeyou have nothing of your own  not much indeed  nothing is not that so you can answer me at any rate  you know all about it he saidtruly enough for she did know  and you cannot earn a penny  i dont know that i can i never was very good at earning anything  it isnt gentlemanlike is it but i can earn money  by george yes ive often envied you i have indeed  how flattering as far as it went you should have had it allnearly allif you could have been true to me  but lucyabout the family  and about your debts of course i couldnt pay debts which were always increasing and of course your promises for the future were false we both knew that they were false when they were made did we not she paused for an answer but he made none they meant nothing did they he is dead now  morton is dead  yes he died in san francisco months ago  i couldnt have known that lucy could i  dont be a fool what difference would it have made dont pretend anything so false it would be disgusting on the very face of it it mattered nothing to you whether he lived or died when is it to be  when is what to be  your marriage with this illlooking young woman who has got money but whom you do not even pretend to love  it struck even george that this was a way in which emily hotspur should not be described she had been acknowledged to be the beauty of the last season one of the finest girls that had ever been seen about london and as for loving herhe did love her a man might be fond of two dogs or have two pet horses and why shouldnt he love two women of course he loved his cousin but his circumstances at the moment were difficult and he didnt quite know how to explain all this  when is it to be she said urging her question imperiously  in answer to this he gave her to understand that there was still a good deal of difficulty he told her something of his position with captain stubber and definednot with absolute correctnessthe amount of consent which sir harry had given to the marriage  and what am i to do she asked  he looked blankly into her face she then rose again and unlocking a desk with a key that hung at her girdle she took from it a bundle of papers  there she said there is the letter in which i have your promise to marry me when i am freeas i am now it could not be less injurious to you than when locked up there but the remembrance of it might frighten you she threw the letter to him across the table but he did not touch it and here are others which might be taken to mean the same thing there i am not so injured as i might seem to befor i never believed them how could i believe anything that you would say to meanything that you would write  dont be down on me too hard lucy  no i will not be down upon you at all if these things pained you i would not say them shall i destroy the letters then she took them one after another and tore them into small fragments you will be easier now i know  easy i am not very easy i can tell you  captain stubber will not let you off so gently as i do is that it  then there was made between them a certain pecuniary arrangement which if mrs morton trusted at all the undertaking made to her showed a most wonderful faith on her part she would lend him £250 towards the present satisfaction of captain stubber and this sum to be lent for such a purpose she would consent to receive back again out of sir harrys money she must see a certain manager she said but she did not doubt but that her loan would be forthcoming on the saturday morning captain george hotspur accepted the offer and was profuse in his thanks after that when he was going her weakness was almost equal to his vileness  you will come and see me she said as she held his hand again he paused a moment george you will come and see me  oh of course i will  a great deal i can bear a great deal i have borne but do not be a coward i knew you before she did and have loved you better and have treated you better than ever she will do of course you will come  he promised her that he would and then went from her  on the saturday morning captain stubber was made temporarily happy by the most unexpected receipt of five hundred pounds     chapter xii  the hunt becomes hot   september passed away with captain hotspur very unpleasantly he had various interviews with captain stubber with mr hart and with other creditors and found very little amusement lady altringham had written to him again advising him strongly to make out a complete list of his debts and to send them boldly to sir harry he endeavoured to make out the list but had hardly the audacity to do it even for his own information when the end of september had come and he was preparing himself to join the party of distinguished pheasantshooters in norfolk he had as yet sent no list to sir harry nor had he heard a word from humblethwaite certain indications had reached himcontinued to reach him from day to daythat mr boltby was at work but no communication had been made actually to himself even by mr boltby when and how and in what form he was expected to send the schedule of his debts to sir harry he did not know and thus it came to pass that when the time came for his departure from town he had sent no such schedule at all his sojourn however with the distinguished party was to last only for a week and then he would really go to work he would certainly himself write to sir harry before the end of october  in the meantime there came other troublesvarious other troubles one other trouble vexed him sore there came to him a note from a gentleman with whom his acquaintance was familiar though slightas follows      dear hotspurdid i not meet you at the last goodwood    meeting if you dont mind pray answer me the question    you will remember i do not doubt that i did that i lost    my money too and paid ityours ever     f stackpoole   he understood it all immediately the stackpooles had been at humblethwaite but what business had the man to write letters to him with the object of getting him into trouble he did not answer the note but nevertheless it annoyed him much and then there was another great vexation he was now running low in funds for present use he had made what he feared was a most useless outlay in satisfying stubbers immediate greed for money and the effect was that at the beginning of the last week in september he found himself with hardly more than fifty sovereigns in his possession which would be considerably reduced before he could leave town he had been worse off beforevery much worse but it was especially incumbent on him now to keep up that look of high feather which cannot be maintained in its proper brightness without ready cash he must take a manservant with him among the distinguished guests he must fee gamekeepers pay railway fares and have loose cash about him for a hundred purposes he wished it to be known that he was going to marry his cousin he might find some friend with softer heart than altringham who would lend him a few hundreds on being made to believe in this brilliant destiny but a roll of banknotes in his pocket would greatly aid him in making the destiny credible fifty pounds as he well knew would melt away from him like snow the last fifty pounds of a thousand always goes quicker than any of the nineteen other fifties  circumstances had made it impossible for him to attend the leger this year but he had put a little money on it the result had done nothing for or against himexcept this that whereas he received between one and two hundred pounds he conceived the idea of paying only a portion of what he had lost with reference to the remainder he wrote to ask his friend if it would be quite the same if the money were paid at christmas if not of course it should be sent at once the friend was one of the altringham set who had been at castle corry and who had heard of georges hopes in reference to his cousin george added a postscript to his letter this kind of thing will be over for me very soon i am to be a benedict and the house of humblethwaite and the title are to be kept together i know you will congratulate me my cousin is a charming girl and worth all that i shall lose ten times over it was impossible he thought that the man should refuse him credit for eighty pounds till christmas when the man should know that he was engaged to be married to £20000 a year but the man did refuse the man wrote back to say that he did not understand this kind of thing at all and that he wanted his money at once george hotspur sent the man his money not without many curses on the illiberality of such a curmudgeon was it not cruel that a fellow would not give him so trifling an assistance when he wanted it so badly all the world seemed to conspire to hurt him just at this most critical moment of his life in many of his hardest emergencies for ready money he had gone to mrs morton but even he felt that just at present he could not ask her for more  nevertheless a certain amount of cash was made to be forthcoming before he took his departure for norfolk in the course of the preceding spring he had met a young gentleman in mr harts small front parlour who was there upon ordinary business he was a young gentleman with good prospects and with some command of ready money but he liked to live and would sometimes want mr harts assistance his name was walker and though he was not exactly one of that class in which it delighted captain hotspur to move nevertheless he was not altogether disdained by that wellborn and wellbred gentleman on the third of october the day before he left london to join his distinguished friends in norfolk george hotspur changed a cheque for nearly three hundred pounds at mr walkers bankers poor mr walker but cousin george went down to norfolk altogether in high feather if there were play he would play he would bet about pulling straws if he could find an adversary to bet with him he could chink sovereigns about at his ease at any rate during the week cousin george liked to chink sovereigns about at his ease and this point of greatness must be conceded to himthat however black might loom the clouds of the coming sky he could enjoy the sunshine of the hour  in the meantime mr boltby was at work and before cousin george had shot his last pheasant in such very good company sir harry was up in town assisting mr boltby how things had gone at humblethwaite between sir harry and his daughter must not be told on this page but the reader may understand that nothing had as yet occurred to lessen sir harrys objection to the match there had been some correspondence between sir harry and mr boltby and sir harry had come up to town when the reader learns that on the very day on which cousin george and his servant were returning to london by the express train from norfolk smoking many cigars and drinking many glassesgeorge of sherry and the servant probably of beer and spirits alternatelyeach making himself happy with a novel georges novel being french and that of the servant english sensationalthe reader when he learns that on this very day sir harry had interviews with captain stubber and also with mrs morton will be disposed to think that things were not going very well for cousin george but then the reader does not as yet know the nature of the persistency of emily hotspur  what sir harry did with captain stubber need not be minutely described there can be no doubt that cousin george was not spared by the captain and that when he understood what might be the result of telling the truth he told all that he knew in that matter of the £500 cousin george had really been illtreated the payment had done him no sort of service whatever of captain stubbers interview with sir harry nothing further need now be said but it must be explained that sir harry led astray by defective information made a mistake in regard to mrs morton and found out his mistake he did not much like mrs morton but he did not leave her without an ample apology from mrs morton he learned nothing whatever in regard to cousin georgenothing but this that mrs morton did not deny that she was acquainted with captain hotspur mr boltby had learned however that cousin george had drawn the money for a cheque payable to her order and he had made himself nearly certain of the very nature of the transaction  early on the morning after georges return he was run to ground by mr boltbys confidential clerk at the hotel behind the club it was so early to george at least that he was still in bed but the clerk who had breakfasted at eight been at his office by nine and had worked hard for two hours and a half since did not think it at all early george who knew that his pheasantshooting pleasure was past and that immediate trouble was in store for him had consoled himself overnight with a good deal of curaçoa and seltzer and brandy and had taken these comforting potations after a bottle of champagne he was consequently rather out of sorts when he was run to ground in his very bedroom by boltbys clerk he was cantankerous at first and told the clerk to go and be dd the clerk pleaded sir harry sir harry was in town and wanted to see his cousin a meeting must of course be arranged sir harry wished that it might be in mr boltbys private room when cousin george objected that he did not choose to have any interview with sir harry in presence of the lawyer the clerk very humbly explained that the private room would be exclusively for the service of the two gentlemen sick as he was cousin george knew that nothing was to be gained by quarrelling with sir harry though sir harry should ask for an interview in presence of the lord mayor he must go to it he made the hour as late as he could and at last three oclock was settled  at one cousin george was at work upon his broiled bones and tea laced with brandy having begun his meal with soda and brandy he was altogether dissatisfied with himself had he known on the preceding evening what was coming he would have dined on a mutton chop and a pint of sherry and have gone to bed at ten oclock he looked at himself in the glass and saw that he was bloated and redand a thing foul to behold it was a matter of boast to himthe most pernicious boast that ever a man madethat in twentyfour hours he could rid himself of all outward and inward sign of any special dissipation but the twentyfour hours were needed and now not twelve were allowed him nevertheless he kept his appointment he tried to invent some lie which he might send by a commissioner and which might not ruin him but he thought upon the whole that it would be safer for him to go  when he entered the room he saw at a glance that there was to be warwar to the knifebetween him and sir harry he perceived at once that if it were worth his while to go on with the thing at all he must do so in sole dependence on the spirit and love of emily hotspur sir harry at their first greeting declined to shake hands with him and called him captain hotspur  captain hotspur he said in a word understand that there must be no further question of a marriage between you and my daughter  why not sir harry  because sir and then he pausedi would sooner see my girl dead at my feet than entrust her to such a one as you it was true what you said to me at humblethwaite there would have been something very alluring to me in the idea of joining the property and the title together a man will pay much for such a whim i would not unwillingly have paid very much in money but i am not so infamously wicked as to sacrifice my daughter utterly by giving her to one so utterly unworthy of her as you are  i told you that i was in debt sir harry  i wanted no telling as to that but i did want telling as to your mode of life and i have had it now you had better not press me you had better see mr boltby he will tell you what i am willing to do for you upon receiving your written assurance that you will never renew your offer of marriage to miss hotspur  i cannot do that said cousin george hoarsely  then i shall leave you with your creditors to deal with as they please i have nothing further to suggest myself and i would recommend that you should see mr boltby before you leave the chambers  what does my cousin say he asked  were you at goodwood last meeting asked sir harry but of course you were  i was he answered he was obliged to acknowledge so much not quite knowing what stackpoole might have said or done but i can explain that  there is no need whatever of any explanation do you generally borrow money from such ladies as mrs morton cousin george blushed when this question was asked but made no answer to it it was one that he could not answer but it makes no difference captain hotspur i mention these things only to let you feel that i know you i must decline any further speech with you i strongly advise you to see mr boltby at once good afternoon  so saying the baronet withdrew quickly and cousin george heard him shut the door of the chambers  after considering the matter for a quarter of an hour cousin george made up his mind that he would see the lawyer no harm could come to him from seeing the lawyer he was closeted with mr boltby for nearly an hour and before he left the chamber had been forced to confess to things of which he had not thought it possible that mr boltby should ever have heard mr boltby knew the whole story of the money raised on the commission of the liabilities to both hart and stubber and had acquainted himself with the history of lord baldebeques cheque mr boltby was not indignant as had been sir harry but intimated it as a thing beyond dispute that a man who had done such things as could be proved against cousin georgeand as would undoubtedly be proved against him if he would not give up his pursuit of the heiressmust be disposed of with severity unless he retreated at once of his own accord mr boltby did indeed hint something about a criminal prosecution and utter ruin andincarceration  but if george hotspur would renounce his cousin utterlyputting his renunciation on papersir harry would pay all his debts to the extent of twenty thousand pounds would allow him four hundred a year on condition that he would live out of england and would leave him a further sum of twenty thousand pounds by his will on condition that no renewed cause of offence were given  you had better perhaps go home and think about it mr hotspur said the lawyer cousin george did go away and think about it     chapter xiii  i will not desert him   sir harry before he had left humblethwaite for london in october had heard enough of his cousins sins to make him sure that the match must be opposed with all his authority indeed he had so felt from the first moment in which george had begun to tell him of what had occurred at airey force he had never thought that george hotspur would make a fitting husband for his daughter but without so thinking he had allowed his mind to dwell upon the outside advantages of the connection dreaming of a fitness which he knew did not exist till he had vacillated and the evil thing had come upon him when the danger was so close upon him to make him see what it was to force him to feel what would be the misery threatened to his daughter to teach him to realize his own duty he condemned himself bitterly for his own weakness could any duty which he owed to the world be so high or so holy as that which was due from him to his child he almost hated his name and title and position as he thought of the evil that he had already done had his cousin george been in no close succession to the title would he have admitted a man of whom he knew so much ill and of whom he had never heard any good within his park palings and then he could not but acknowledge to himself that by asking such a one to his housea man such as this young cousin who was known to be the heir to the titlehe had given his daughter special reason to suppose that she might regard him as a fitting suitor for her hand she of course had knownhad felt as keenly as he had felt for was she not a hotspurthat she would be true to her family by combining her property and the title and that by yielding to such a marriage she would be doing a family duty unless there were reasons against it stronger than those connected with his name but as to those other reasons must not her father and her mother know better than she could know when she found that the man was made welcome both in town and country was it not natural that she should suppose that there were no stronger reasons all this sir harry felt and blamed himself and determined that though he must oppose his daughter and make her understand that the hope of such a marriage must be absolutely abandoned it would be his duty to be very tender with her he had sinned against her already in that he had vacillated and had allowed that handsome but vile and worthless cousin to come near her  in his conduct to his daughter sir harry endeavoured to be just and tender and affectionate but in his conduct to his wife on the occasion he allowed himself some scope for the illhumour not unnaturally incident to his misfortune why on earth you should have had him in bruton street when you knew very well what he was i cannot conceive said sir harry  but i didnt know said lady elizabeth fearing to remind her husband that he also had sanctioned the coming of the cousin  i had told you it was there that the evil was done and then to let them go to that picnic together  what could i do when mrs fitzpatrick asked to be taken you wouldnt have had me tell emily that she should not be one of the party  i would have put it off till he was out of the house  but the fitzpatricks were going too pleaded the poor woman  it wouldnt have happened at all if you had not asked him to stay till the monday said sir harry and to this charge lady elizabeth knew that there was no answer there she had clearly disobeyed her husband and though she doubtless suffered much from some dim idea of injustice she was aware that as she had so offended she must submit to be told that all this evil had come from her wrongdoing  i hope she will not be obstinate said sir harry to his wife lady elizabeth though she was not an acute judge of character did know her own daughter and was afraid to say that emily would not be obstinate she had the strongest possible respect as well as affection for her own child she thoroughly believed in emilymuch more thoroughly than she did in herself but she could not say that in such a matter emily would not be obstinate lady elizabeth was very intimately connected with two obstinate persons one of whom was young and the other old and she thought that perhaps the younger was the more obstinate of the two  it is quite out of the question that she should marry him said sir harry sadly still lady elizabeth made no reply i do not think that she will disobey me continued sir harry still lady elizabeth said nothing if she gives me a promise she will keep it said sir harry  then the mother could answer i am sure she will  if the worst come to the worst we must go away  to scarrowby suggested lady elizabeth who hated scarrowby  that would do no good scarrowby would be the same as humblethwaite to her or perhaps worse i mean abroad we must shut up the place for a couple of years and take her to naples and vienna or perhaps to egypt everything must be changed to herthat is if the evil has gone deep enough  is he so very bad asked lady elizabeth  he is a liar and a blackguard and i believe him to be a swindler said sir harry then lady elizabeth was mute and her husband left her  at this time he had heard the whole story of the pawning of the commission had been told something of money raised by worthless cheques and had run to ground that lie about the goodwood races but he had not yet heard anything special of mrs morton the only attack on georges character which had as yet been made in the hearing of emily had been with reference to the goodwood races mrs stackpoole was a lady of some determination and one who in society liked to show that she was right in her assertions and well informed on matters in dispute and she hated cousin george there had therefore come to be a good deal said about the goodwood meeting so that the affair reached sir harrys ears he perceived that cousin george had lied and determined that emily should be made to know that her cousin had lied but it was very difficult to persuade her of this that everybody else should tell stories about george and the goodwood meeting seemed to her to be natural enough she contented herself with thinking all manner of evil of mr and mrs stackpoole and reiterating her conviction that george hotspur had not been at the meeting in question  i dont know that it much signifies mrs stackpoole had said in anger  not in the least emily had replied only that i happen to know that my cousin was not there he goes to so many race meetings that there has been some little mistake  then mr stackpoole had written to cousin george and cousin george had thought it wise to make no reply sir harry however from other sources had convinced himself of the truth and had told his daughter that there was evidence enough to prove the fact in any court of law emily when so informed had simply held her tongue and had resolved to hate mrs stackpoole worse than ever  she had been told from the first that her engagement with her cousin would not receive her fathers sanction and for some days after that there had been silence on the subject at humblethwaite while the correspondence with mr boltby was being continued then there came the moment in which sir harry felt that he must call upon his daughter to promise obedience and the conversation which has been described between him and lady elizabeth was preparatory to his doing so  my dear he said to his daughter sit down i want to speak to you  he had sent for her into his own morning room in which she did not remember to have been asked to sit down before she would often visit him there coming in and out on all manner of small occasions suggesting that he should ride with her asking for the loan of a gardener for a week for some project of her own telling him of a big gooseberry interrupting him ruthlessly on any trifle in the world but on such occasions she would stand close to him leaning on him and he would scold herplayfully or kiss her or bid her begone from the roombut would always grant what she asked of him to him though he hardly knew that it was so such visits from his darling had been the bright moments of his life but up to this morning he had never bade her be seated in that room  emily he said i hope you understand that all this about your cousin george must be given up she made no reply though he waited perhaps for a minute it is altogether out of the question i am very very sorry that you have been subjected to such a sorrow i will own that i have been to blame for letting him come to my house  no papa no  yes my dear i have been to blame and i feel it keenly i did not then know as much of him as i do now but i had heard that which should have made me careful to keep him out of your company  hearing about people papa is that fair are we not always hearing tales about everybody  my dear child you must take my word for something  i will take it for everything in all the world papa  he has been a thoroughly bad young man  but papa  you must take my word for it when i tell you that i have positive proof of what i am telling you  but papa  is not that enough  no papa i am heartily sorry that he should have been what you call a bad young man i wish young men werent so badthat there were no racecourses and betting and all that but if he had been my brother instead of my cousin  dont talk about your brother emily  should we hate him because he has been unsteady should we not do all that we could in the world to bring him back i do not know that we are to hate people because they do what they ought not to do  we hate liars  he is not a liar i will not believe it  why did he tell you that he was not at those races when he was there as surely as you are here but my dear i will not argue about all this with you it is not right that i should do so it is my duty to inquire into these things and yours to believe me and to obey me then he paused but his daughter made no reply to him he looked into her face and saw there that mark about her eyes which he knew he so often showed himself which he so well remembered with his father i suppose you do believe me emily when i tell you that he is worthless  he need not be worthless always  his conduct has been such that he is unfit to be trusted with anything  he must be the head of our family some day papa  that is our misfortune my dear no one can feel it as i do but i need not add to it the much greater misfortune of sacrificing to him my only child  if he was so bad why did he come here  that is true i did not expect to be rebuked by you emily but i am open to that rebuke  dear dear papa indeed i did not mean to rebuke you but i cannot give him up  you must give him up  no papa if i did i should be false i will not be false you say that he is false i do not know that but i will not be false let me speak to you for one minute  it is of no use  but you will hear me papa you always hear me when i speak to you she had left her chair now and was standing close to him not leaning upon him as was her wont in their pleasantest moments of fellowship but ready to do so whenever she should find that his mood would permit it i will never marry him without your leave  thanks emily i know how sacred is a promise from you  but mine to him is equally sacred i shall still be engaged to him i told him how it would be i said that as long as you or mamma lived i would never marry without your leave nor would i see him or write to him without your knowledge i told him so but i told him also that i would always be true to him i mean to keep my word  if you find him to be utterly worthless you cannot be bound by such a promise  i hope it may not be so i do not believe that it is so i know him too well to think that he can be utterly worthless but if he was who should try to save him from worthlessness if not his nearest relatives we try to reclaim the worst criminals and sometimes we succeed and he must be the head of the family remember that ought we not to try to reclaim him he cannot be worse than the prodigal son  he is ten times worse i cannot tell you what has been his life  papa i have often thought that in our rank of life society is responsible for the kind of things which young men do if he was at goodwood which i do not believe so was mr stackpoole if he was betting so was mr stackpoole  but mr stackpoole did not lie  i dont know that she said with a little toss of her head  emily you have no business either to say or to think it  i care nothing for mr stackpoole whether he tells truth or not he and his wife have made themselves very disagreeablethat is all but as for george he is what he is because other young men are allowed to be the same  you do not know the half of it  i know as much as i want to know papa let one keep as clear of it as one can it is impossible not to hear how young men live and yet they are allowed to go everywhere and are flattered and encouraged i do not pretend that george is better than others i wish he were oh how i wish it but such as he is he belongs in a way to us and we ought not to desert him he belongs i know to me and i will not desert him  sir harry felt that there was no arguing with such a girl as this some time since he had told her that it was unfit that he should be brought into an argument with his own child and there was nothing now for him but to fall back upon the security which that assertion gave him he could not charge her with direct disobedience because she had promised him that she would not do any of those things which as a father he had a right to forbid he relied fully on her promise and so far might feel himself to be safe nevertheless he was very unhappy of what service would his child be to him or he to her if he were doomed to see her pining from day to day with an unpermitted love it was the dearest wish of his heart to make her happy as it was his fondest ambition to see her so placed in the world that she might be the happy transmitter of all the honours of the house of humblethwaiteif she could not transmit all the honours of the name time might help him and then if she could be made really to see how base was the clay of which had been made this image which she believed to be of gold might it not be that at last she would hate a thing that was so vile in order that she might do so he would persist in finding out what had been the circumstances of this young mans life if as he believed the things which george hotspur had done were such as in another rank of life would send the perpetrator to the treadmill surely then she would not cling to her lover it would not be in her nature to prefer that which was foul and abominable and despised of all men it was after this when he had seen mr boltby that the idea occurred to him of buying up cousin george so that cousin george should himself abandon his engagement  you had better go now my dear he said after his last speech i fully rely upon the promise you have made me i know that i can rely upon it and you also may rely upon me i give you my word as your father that this man is unfit to be your husband and that i should commit a sin greater than i can describe to you were i to give my sanction to such a marriage  emily made no answer to this but left the room without having once leaned upon her fathers shoulder  that look of hers troubled him sadly when he was alone what was to be the meaning of it and what the result she had given him almost unasked the only promise which duty required her to give but at the same time she had assured him by her countenance as well as by her words that she would be as faithful to her lover as she was prepared to be obedient to her father and then if there should come a long contest of that nature and if he should see her devoted year after year to a love which she would not even try to cast off from her how would he be able to bear it he too was firm but he knew himself to be as tenderhearted as he was obstinate it would be more than he could bear all the world would be nothing for him then and if there were ever to be a question of yielding it would be easier to do something towards lessening the vileness of the man now than hereafter he too had some of that knowledge of the world which had taught lady altringham to say that the young people in such contests could always beat the old people thinking of this and of that look upon his childs brows he almost vacillated again any amount of dissipation he could now have forgiven but to be a liar too and a swindler before he went to bed that night he had made up his mind to go to london and to see mr boltby     chapter xiv  pertinacity   on the day but one after the scene narrated in the last chapter sir harry went to london and lady elizabeth and emily were left alone together in the great house at humblethwaite emily loved her mother dearly the proper relations of life were reversed between them and the younger domineered over the elder but the love which the daughter felt was probably the stronger on this account lady elizabeth never scolded never snubbed never made herself disagreeable was never cross and emily with her strong perceptions and keen intelligence knew all her mothers excellence and loved it the better because of her mothers weakness she preferred her fathers company but no one could say she neglected her mother for the sake of her father  hitherto she had said very little to lady elizabeth as to her lover she had in the first place told her mother and then had received from her mother secondhand her fathers disapproval at that time she had only said that it was too late poor lady elizabeth had been able to make no useful answer to this it certainly was too late the evil should have been avoided by refusing admittance to cousin george both in london and at humblethwaite it certainly was too latetoo late that is to avoid the evil altogether the girl had been asked for her heart and had given it it was very much too late but evils such as that do admit of remedy it is not every girl that can marry the man whom she first confesses that she loves lady elizabeth had some idea that her child being nobler born and of more importance than other peoples children ought to have been allowed by fate to do soas there certainly is a something withdrawn from the delicate aroma of a firstclass young woman by any transfer of affectionsbut if it might not be so even an emily hotspur must submit to a lot not uncommon among young women in general and wait and wish till she could acknowledge to herself that her heart was susceptible of another wound that was the mothers hope at presenther hope when she was positively told by sir harry that george hotspur was quite out of the question as a husband for the heiress of humblethwaite but this would probably come the sooner if little or nothing were said of george hotspur  the reader need hardly be told that emily herself regarded the matter in a very different light she also had her ideas about the delicacy and the aroma of a maidens love she had confessed her love very boldly to the man who had asked for it had made her rich present with a free hand and had grudged nothing in the making of it but having given it she understood it to be fixed as the heavens that she could never give the same gift again it was herself that she had given and there was no retracting the offering she had thought and had then hoped and had afterwards hoped more faintly that the present had been well bestowedthat in giving it she had disposed of herself well now they told her that it was not so and that she could hardly have disposed of herself worse she would not believe that but let it be as it might the thing was done she was his he had a right in her which she could not withdraw from him was not this sort of giving acknowledged by all churches in which the words for better or for worse were uttered as part of the marriage vow here there had been as yet no church vow and therefore her duty was still due to her father but the sort of sacrificeso often a sacrifice of the good to the badwhich the church not only allowed but required and sanctified could be as well conveyed by one promise as by another what is a vow but a promise and by what process are such vows and promises made fitting between a man and a woman is it not by that compelled rendering up of the heart which men call love she had found that he was dearer to her than everything in the world besides that to be near him was a luxury to her that his voice was music to her that the flame of his eyes was sunlight that his touch was to her as had never been the touch of any other human being she could submit to him she who never would submit to any one she could delight to do his bidding even though it were to bring him his slippers she had confessed nothing of this even to herself till he had spoken to her on the bridge but then in a moment she had known that it was so and had not coyed the truth with him by a single nay and now they told her that he was bad  bad as he was he had been good enough to win her twas thus she argued with herself who was she that she should claim for herself the right of having a man that was not bad that other man that had come to her that lord alfred was she was told good at all points and he had not moved her in the least his voice had possessed no music for her and as for fetching his slippers for himhe was to her one of those men who seem to be created just that they might be civil when wanted and then get out of the way she had not been able for a moment to bring herself to think of regarding him as her husband but this man this bad man from the moment that he had spoken to her on the bridge she knew that she was his for ever  it might be that she liked a bad man best so she argued with herself again if it were so she must put up with what misfortune her own taste might bring upon her at any rate the thing was done and why should any man be thrown over simply because the world called him bad was there to be no forgiveness for wrongs done between man and man when the whole theory of our religion was made to depend on forgiveness from god to man it is the duty of some one to reclaim an evident prodigal and why should it not be her duty to reclaim this prodigal clearly the very fact that she loved the prodigal would give her a potentiality that way which she would have with no other prodigal it was at any rate her duty to try it would at least be her duty if they would allow her to be near enough to him to make the attempt then she filled her mind with ideas of a long period of probation in which every best energy of her existence should be given to this work of reclaiming the prodigal so that at last she might put her own hand into one that should be clean enough to receive it with such a task before her she could wait she could watch him and give all her heart to his welfare and never be impatient except that he might be made happy as she thought of this she told herself plainly that the work would not be easy that there would be disappointment almost heartbreak delays and sorrows but she loved him and it would be her duty and then if she could be successful how great how full of joy would be the triumph even if she were to fail and perish in failing it would be her duty as for giving him up because he had the misfortune to be bad she would as soon give him up on the score of any other misfortunebecause he might lose a leg or become deformed or be stricken deaf by gods hand one does not desert those one loves because of their misfortunes twas thus she argued with herself thinking that she could seewhereas poor child she was so very blind  mamma she said has papa gone up to town about cousin george  i do not know my dear he did not say why he was going  i think he has i wish i could make him understand  understand what my dear  all that i feel about it i am sure it would save him much trouble nothing can ever separate me from my cousin  pray dont say so emily  nothing can is it not better that you and he should know the truth papa goes about trying to find out all the naughty things that george has ever done there has been some mistake about a race meeting and all manner of people are asked to give what papa calls evidence that cousin george was there i do not doubt but george has been what people call dissipated  we do hear such dreadful stories  you would not have thought anything about them if it had not been for me he is not worse now than when he came down here last year and he was always asked to bruton street  what do you mean by this dear  i do not mean to say that young men ought to do all these things whatever they aregetting into debt and betting and living fast of course it is very wrong but when a young man has been brought up in that way i do think he ought not to be thrown over by his nearest and dearest friendsthat last epithet was uttered with all the emphasis which emily could give to itbecause he falls into temptation  i am afraid george has been worse than others emily  so much the more reason for trying to save him if a man be in the water you do not refuse to throw him a rope because the water is deep  but dearest your papa is thinking of you lady elizabeth was not quick enough of thought to explain to her daughter that if the rope be of more value than the man and if the chance of losing the rope be much greater than that of saving the man then the rope is not thrown  and i am thinking of george said emily  but if it should appear that he had done thingsthe wickedest things in the world  i might break my heart in thinking of it but i should never give him up  if he were a murderer suggested lady elizabeth with horror  the girl paused feeling herself to be hardly pressed and then came that look upon her brow which lady elizabeth understood as well as did sir harry then i would be a murderers wife she said  oh emily  i must make you understand me mamma and i want papa to understand it too no consideration on earth shall make me say that i will give him up they may prove if they like that he was on all the racecourses in the world and get that mrs stackpoole to swear to itand it is ten times worse for a woman to go than it is for a man at any ratebut it will make no difference if you and papa tell me not to see him or write to himmuch less to marry himof course i shall obey you but i shall not give him up a bit the more and he must not be told that i will give him up i am sure papa will not wish that anything untrue should be told george will always be to me the dearest thing in the whole worlddearer than my own soul i shall pray for him every night and think of him all day long and as to the property papa may be quite sure that he can never arrange it by any marriage that i shall make no man shall ever speak to me in that way if i can help it i wont go where any man can speak to me i will obeybut it will be at the cost of my life of course i will obey papa and you but i cannot alter my heart why was he allowed to come herethe head of our own familyif he be so bad as this bad or good he will always be all the world to me  to such a daughter as this lady elizabeth had very little to say that might be of avail she could quote sir harry and entertain some dim distant wish that cousin george might even yet be found to be not quite so black as he had been painted     chapter xv  cousin george is hard pressed   the very sensible and as one would have thought very manifest idea of buying up cousin george originated with mr boltby he will have his price sir harry said the lawyer then sir harrys eyes were opened and so excellent did this mode of escape seem to him that he was ready to pay almost any price for the article he saw it at a glance emily had highflown notions and would not yield he feared that she would not yield let cousin georges delinquencies be shown to be as black as styx but if cousin george could be made to give her upthen emily must yield and yielding in such manner having received so rude a proof of her lovers unworthiness it could not be but that her heart would be changed sir harrys first idea of a price was very noble all debts to be paid a thousand a year for the present and scarrowby to be attached to the title what price would be too high to pay for the extrication of his daughter from so grievous a misfortune but mr boltby was more calm as to the payment of the debtsyes within a certain liberal limit for the present an income of five hundred pounds he thought would be almost as efficacious a bait as double the amount and it would be well to tack to it the necessity of a residence abroad it might perhaps serve to get the young man out of the country for a time if the young man bargained on either of these headings the matter could be reconsidered by mr boltby as to settling scarrowby on the title mr boltby was clearly against it he would raise every shilling he could on postobits within twelve months at last the offer was made in the terms with which the reader is already acquainted george was sent off from the lawyers chambers with directions to consider the terms and mr boltby gave his clerk some little instructions for perpetuating the irritation on the young man which hart and stubber together were able to produce the young man should be made to understand that hungry creditors who had been promised their money on certain conditions could become very hungry indeed  george hotspur blackguard and worthless as he was did not at first realize the fact that sir harry and mr boltby were endeavouring to buy him he was asked to give up his cousin and he was told that if he did so a certain very generous amount of pecuniary assistance should be given to him but yet he did not at the first glance perceive that one was to be the price of the otherthat if he took the one he would meanly have sold the other it certainly would have been very pleasant to have all his debts paid for him and the offer of five hundred pounds a year was very comfortable of the additional sum to be given when sir harry should die he did not think so much it might probably be a long time coming and then sir harry would of course be bound to do something for the title as for living abroadhe might promise that but they could not make him keep his promise he would not dislike to travel for six months on condition that he should be well provided with ready money there was much that was alluring in the offer and he began to think whether he could not get it all without actually abandoning his cousin but then he was to give a written pledge to that effect which if given no doubt would be shown to her no that would not do emily was his prize and though he did not value her at her worth not understanding such worth still he had an idea that she would be true to him then at last came upon him an understanding of the fact and he perceived that a bribe had been offered to him  for half a day he was so disgusted at the idea that his virtue was rampant within him sell his emily for money never his emilyand all her rich prospects and that for a sum so inadequate they little knew their man when they made a proposition so vile that evening at his club he wrote a letter to sir harry and the letter as soon as written was put into the club letterbox addressed to the house in bruton street in which with much indignant eloquence he declared that the baronet little understood the warmth of his love or the extent of his ambition in regard to the family i shall be quite ready to submit to any settlements he said so long as the property is entailed upon the baronet who shall come after myself i need not say that i hope the happy fellow may be my own son  but on the next morning on his first waking his ideas were more vague and a circumstance happened which tended to divert them from the current in which they had run on the preceding evening when he was going through the sad work of dressing he bethought himself that he could not at once force this marriage on sir harrycould not do so perhaps within a twelvemonth or more let emily be ever so true to himand that his mode of living had become so precarious as to be almost incompatible with that outward decency which would be necessary for him as emilys suitor he was still very indignant at the offer made to him which was indeed bribery of which sir harry ought to be ashamed but he almost regretted that his letter to sir harry had been sent it had not been considered enough and certainly should not have been written simply on afterdinner consideration something might have been inserted with the view of producing ready money something which might have had a flavour of yielding but which could not have been shown to emily as an offer on his part to abandon her and then he had a general feeling that his letter had been too grandiloquentall arising no doubt from a fall in courage incidental to a sick stomach  but before he could get out of his hotel a visitor was upon him mr hart desired to see him at this moment he would almost have preferred to see captain stubber he remembered at the moment that mr hart was acquainted with mr walker and that mr walker would probably have sought the society of mr hart after a late occurrence in which he cousin george had taken part he was going across to breakfast at his club when he found himself almost forced to accompany mr hart into a little private room at the left hand of the hall of the hotel he wanted his breakfast badly and was altogether out of humour he had usually found mr hart to be an enduring man not irascible though very pertinacious and sometimes almost goodnatured for a moment he thought he would bully mr hart but when he looked into mr harts face his heart misgave him  this is a most inconvenient time he had begun but he hesitated and mr hart began his attack at once  captain oshspursir let me tell you this vont do no longer  what wont do mr hart  vat vont do you know vat vont do let me tell you this youll be at the old bailey very soon if you dont do just vat you is told to do  me at the old bailey  yes captain oshspuryou at the old bailey in vat vay did you get those moneys from poor mr valker i know vat i says more than three hundred pounds it was cardsharping  who says it was cardsharping  i says so captain oshspur and so does mr bullbean mr bullbean vill prove it mr bullbean was a gentleman known well to mr hart who had made one of the little party at mr walkers establishment by means of which cousin george had gone flush of money down among his distinguished friends in norfolk vat did you do with poor valkers moneys it vas very hard upon poor mr valkervery hard  it was fair play mr hart  gammon captain oshspur vere is the moneys  what business is that of yours  oh very well bullbean is quite ready to go before a magistrateready at once i dont know how that vill help us with our pretty cousin with all the fortune  how will it help you then  look here captain oshspur i vill tell you vat vill help me and vill help captain stubber and vill help everybody the young lady isnt for you at

sharp as sure as my name is abraham hart everything shall come out every dd thing captain oshspur and now good morning captain oshspur you had better see mr boltby today captain oshspur  how was a man so weighted to run for such stakes as those he was striving to carry off when mr hart left him he was not only sick in the stomach but sick at heart alsosick all over he had gone from bad to worse he had lost the knowledge of the flavour of vice and virtue and yet now when there was present to him the vanishing possibility of redeeming everything by this great marriage it seemed to him that a life of honourable easesuch a life as sir harry would wish him to live if permitted to marry the girl and dwell among his friends at humblethwaitewould be much sweeter much more to his real taste than the life which he had led for the last ten years what had been his positive delights in what moments had he actually enjoyed them from first to last had there not been trouble and danger and vexation of spirit and a savour of dirt about it all which even to his palate had been nauseous would he not willingly reform and yet when the prospect of reform was brought within reach of his eyes of a reform so pleasant in all its accompaniments of reform amidst all the wealth of humblethwaite with emily hotspur by his side there came these harpies down upon him rendering it all impossible thrice in speaking of them to himself he called them harpies but it never occurred to him to think by what name mr walker would have designated him  but things around him were becoming so serious that he must do something it might be that he would fall to the ground losing everything he could not understand about bullbean bullbean had had his share of the plunder in regard to all that he had seen the best part of the evenings entertainment had taken place after mr bullbean had retired no doubt however mr bullbean might do him a damage  he had written to sir harry refusing altogether the offer made to him could he after writing such a letter at once go to the lawyer and accept the offer and must he admit to himself finally that it was altogether beyond his power to win his cousins hand was there no hope of that life at humblethwaite which when contemplated at a distance had seemed to him to be so green and pleasant and what would emily think of him in the midst of all his other miseries that also was a misery he was able though steeped in worthlessness so to make for himself a double identity as to imagine and to personify a being who should really possess fine and manly aspirations with regard to a woman and to look upon himselfhis second selfas that being and to perceive with how withering a contempt such a being would contemplate such another man as was in truth the real george hotspur whose actual sorrows and troubles had now become so unendurable  who would help him in his distress the altringhams were still in scotland and he knew well that though lady altringham was fond of him and though lord altringham liked him there was no assistance to be had there of the kind that he needed his dearly intimate distinguished friends in norfolk with whom he had been always george would not care if they heard that he had been crucified it seemed to him that the world was very hard and very cruel who did care for him there were two women who cared for him who really loved him who would make almost any sacrifice for him who would even forget his sins or at least forgive them he was sure of that emily hotspur loved him but there were no means by which he could reach emily hotspur she loved him but she would not so far disobey her father and mother or depart from her own word as to receive even a letter from him but the other friend who loved himhe still could see her he knew well the time at which he would find her at home and some three or four hours after his interview with mr hart he knocked at mrs mortons door  well george she said how does your wooing thrive  he had no preconceived plan in coming to her he was possessed by that desire which we all of us so often feel to be comforted by sympathy but he hardly knew even how to describe the want of it  it does not thrive at all he said throwing himself gloomily into an easy chair  that is bad news has the lady turned against you  oh no said he moodilynothing of that sort  that would be impossible would it not fathers are stern but to such a one as you daughters are always kind that is what you mean eh george  i wish you would not chaff me lucy i am not well and i did not come to be chaffed  the chaffing is all to be on one side is it george well i will say nothing to add to your discomforts what is it ails you you will drink liqueurs after dinner that is what makes you so wretched and i believe you drink them before dinner too  hardly ever i dont do such a thing three times in a month it is not that but things do trouble me so  i suppose sir harry is not well pleased  he is doing what he ought not to do i must say thatquite what i call ungentlemanlike a lawyer should never be allowed to interfere between gentlemen i wonder who would stand it if an attorney were set to work to make all manner of inquiries about everything that he had ever done  i could not certainly i should cave in at once as the boys say  other men have been as bad as i have i suppose he is sending about everywhere  not only sending george but going himself do you know that sir harry did me the honour of visiting me  no  but he did he sat there in that very chair and talked to me in a manner that nobody ever did before certainly what a fine old man he is and how handsome  yes he is a goodlooking old fellow  so like you george  is he  only you know lesslessless what shall i sayless goodnatured perhaps  i know what you mean he is not such a fool as i am  youre not a fool at all george but sometimes you are weak he looks to be strong is she like him  very like him  then she must be handsome  handsome i should think she is too said george quite forgetting the description of his cousin which he had given some days previously to mrs morton  she smiled but took no notice aloud of his blunder she knew him so well that she understood it all yes she went on he came here and said some bitter things he said more perhaps than he ought to have done  about me lucy  i think that he spoke chiefly about myself there was a little explanation and then he behaved very well i have no quarrel with him myself he is a fine old gentleman and having one only daughter and a large fortune i do not wonder that he should want to make inquiries before he gives her to you  he could do that without an attorney  would you tell him the truth the fact is george that you are not the sort of soninlaw that fathers like i suppose it will be off eh george george made no immediate reply it is not likely that she should have the constancy to stick to it for years and i am sure you will not has he offered you money then george told her almost with accuracy the nature of the proposition made to him  it is very generous she said  i dont see much of that  it certainly is very generous  what ought a fellow to do  only fancy that you should come to me to ask me such a question  i know you will tell me true  do you love her  yes  with all your heart  what is the meaning of that i do love her  better than her fathers money  much better  then stick to her through thick and thin but you dont i must not advise you in accordance with what you say but with what i think you will be beaten certainly she will never be your wife and were you so married you would not be happy with such people but she will never be your wife take sir harrys offer and write to her a letter explaining how it is best for all that you should do so  he paused a moment and then he asked her one other question would you write the letter for me lucy  she smiled again as she answered him yes if you make up your mind to do as sir harry asks you i will write a draft of what i think you should say to her     chapter xvi  sir harrys return   sir harry received the grandly worded and indignant letter which had been written at the club and cousin george hesitated as to that other letter which his friend was to dictate for him consequently it became necessary that sir harry should leave london before the matter was settled in truth the old baronet liked the grandly worded and indignant letter it was almost such a letter as a hotspur should write on such an occasion there was an admission of pecuniary weakness which did not quite become a hotspur but otherwise the letter was a good letter before he left london he took the letter with him to mr boltby and on his way thither could not refrain from counting up all the good things which would befall him and his if only this young man might be reclaimed and recast in a mould such as should fit the heir of the hotspurs he had been very badso bad that when sir harry counted up his sins they seemed to be as black as night and then as he thought of them the father would declare to himself that he would not imperil his daughter by trusting her to one who had shown himself to be so evil but again another mode of looking at it all would come upon him the kind of vice of which george had been undoubtedly guilty was very distasteful to sir harry it had been ignoble and ungentlemanlike vice he had been a liar and not only a gambler but a professional gambler he had not simply got into debt but he had got into debt in a fashion that was fraudulentso at least sir harry thought and yet need it be said that this reprobate was beyond the reach of all forgiveness had not men before him done as bad and yet were brought back within the pale of decent life in this still vacillating mood of mind sir harry reached his lawyers mr boltby did not vacillate at all when he was shown the letter he merely smiled  i dont think it is a bad letter said sir harry  words mean so little sir harry said mr boltby and come so cheap  sir harry turned the letter over in his hand and frowned he did not quite like to be told even by his confidential lawyer that he was mistaken unconsciously he was telling himself that after all george hotspur had been born a gentleman and that therefore underlying all the young mans vileness and villany there must be a substratum of noble soil of which the lawyer perhaps knew nothing mr boltby saw that his client was doubting and having given much trouble to the matter and not being afraid of sir harry he determined to speak his mind freely  sir harry he said in this matter i must tell you what i really think  certainly  i am sorry to have to speak ill of one bearing your name and were not the matter urgent as it is i should probably repress something of my opinion as it is i do not dare to do so you could not in all london find a man less fit to be the husband of miss hotspur than her cousin  he is a gentlemanby birth said sir harry  he is an unprincipled blackguard by education and the more blackguard because of his birth there is nothing too bad for him to do and very little so bad but what he has done it he is a gambler a swindler and as i believe a forger and a cardsharper he has lived upon the wages of the woman he has professed to love he has shown himself to be utterly spiritless abominable and vile if my clerk in the next room were to slap his face i do not believe that he would resent it sir harry frowned and moved his feet rapidly on the floor in my thorough respect and regard for you sir harry continued mr boltby i have undertaken a work which i would not have done for above two or three other men in the world beside yourself i am bound to tell you the result which is thisthat i would sooner give my own girl to the sweeper at the crossing than to george hotspur  sir harrys brow was very black perhaps he had not quite known his lawyer perhaps it was that he had less power of endurance than he had himself thought in regard to the mention of his own family affairs of course he said i am greatly indebted to you mr boltby for the trouble you have taken  i only hope it may be of service to you  it has been of service what may be the result in regard to this unfortunate young man i cannot yet say he has refused our offeri must say as i thinkhonourably  it means nothing  how nothing mr boltby  no man accepts such a bargain at first he is playing his hand against yours sir harry and he knows that he has got a very good card in his own it was not to be supposed that he would give in at once in besieging a town the surest way is to starve the garrison wait a while and he will give in when a town has within its walls such vultures as will now settle upon him it cannot stand out very long i shall hear more of him before many days are over  you think then that i may return to humblethwaite  certainly sir harry but i hope sir harry that you will return with the settled conviction on your mind that this young man must not on any consideration be allowed to enter your family  the lawyer meant well but he overdid his work sir harry got up and shook hands with him and thanked him but left the room with some sense of offence he had come to mr boltby for information and he had received it but he was not quite sure that he had intended that mr boltby should advise him touching his management of his own daughter mr boltby he thought had gone a little beyond his tether sir harry acknowledged to himself that he had learned a great deal about his cousin and it was for him to judge after that whether he would receive his cousin at humblethwaite mr boltby should not have spoken about the crossingsweeper and then sir harry was not quite sure that he liked that idea of setting vultures upon a man and sir harry remembered something of his old lore as a hunting man it is astonishing what blood will do in bringing a horse through mud at the end of a long day mr boltby probably did not understand how much at the very last might be expected from breeding when sir harry left mr boltbys chambers he was almost betterminded towards cousin george than he had been when he entered them and in this frame of mind both for and against the young man he returned to humblethwaite it must not be supposed however that as the result of the whole he was prepared to yield he knew beyond all doubt that his cousin was thoroughly a bad subjecta worthless and as he believed an irredeemable scamp but yet he thought of what might happen if he were to yield  things were very sombre when he reached humblethwaite of course his wife could not refrain from questions it is very bad he saidas bad as can be  he has gambled  gambled if that were all you had better not ask about it he is a disgrace to the family  then there can be no hope for emily  no hope why should there not be hope all her life need not depend on her fancy for a man of whom after all she has not seen so very much she must get over it other girls have had to do the same  she is not like other girls harry  how not like them  i think she is more persistent she has set her heart upon loving this young man and she will love him  then she must  she will break her heart said lady elizabeth  she will break mine i know said sir harry  when he met his daughter he had embraced her and she had kissed him and asked after his welfare but he felt at once that she was different from what she used to bedifferent not only as regarded herself but different also in her manner there came upon him a sad ponderous conviction that the sunlight had gone out from their joint lives that all pleasant things were over for both of them and that as for him it would be well for him that he should die he could not be happy if there were discord between him and his childand there must be discord the man had been invited with a price to take himself off and had not been sufficiently ignoble to accept the offer how could he avoid the discord and bring back the warmth of the sun into his house then he remembered those terribly forcible epithets which mr boltby had spoken he is an unprincipled blackguard and the worse blackguard because of his birth the words had made sir harry angry but he believed them to be true if there were to be any yielding he would not yield as yet but that living in his house without sunshine was very grievous to him she will kill me he said to himself if she goes on like this  and yet it was hard to say of what it was that he complained days went by and his daughter said nothing and did nothing of which he could complain it was simply thisthat the sunshine was no longer bright within his halls days went by and george hotspurs name had never been spoken by emily in the hearing of her father or mother such duties as there were for her to do were done the active duties of a girl in her position are very few it was her custom of a morning to spread butter on a bit of toast for her father to eat this she still did and brought it to him as was her wont but she did not bring it with her old manner it was a thing still donesimply because not to do it would be an omission to be remarked never mind it said her father the fourth or fifth morning after his return id sooner do it for myself she did not say a word but on the next morning the little ceremony which had once been so full of pleasant affection was discontinued she had certain hours of reading and these were prolonged rather than abandoned but both her father and mother perceived that her books were changed her italian was given up and she took to works of religionsermons treatises and long commentaries  it will kill me said sir harry to his wife  i am afraid it will kill her said lady elizabeth do you see how her colour has gone and she eats so little  she walks every day  yes and comes in so tired and she goes to church every wednesday and friday at hesket im sure she is not fit for it such weather as this  she has the carriage  no she walks  then sir harry gave orders that his daughter should always have the carriage on wednesdays and fridays but emily when her mother told her this insisted that she would sooner walk  but what did the carriage or no carriage on wednesday signify the trouble was deeper than that it was so deep that both father and mother felt that something must be done or the trouble would become too heavy for their backs ten days passed and nothing was heard either from mr boltby or from cousin george sir harry hardly knew what it was then he expected to hear but it seemed that he did expect something he was nervous at the hour of post and was aware himself that he was existing on from day to day with the idea of soon doing some special thinghe knew not whatbut something that might put an end to the frightful condition of estrangement between him and his child in which he was now living it told even upon his duty among his tenants it told upon his farm it told upon almost every workman in the parish he had no heart for doing anything it did not seem certain to him that he could continue to live in his own house he could not bring himself to order that this wood should be cut or that those projected cottages should be built everything was at a standstill and it was clear to him that emily knew that all this had come from her rash love for her cousin george she never now came and stood at his elbow in his own room or leaned upon his shoulder she never now asked him questions or brought him out from his papers to decide questions in the gardenor rather to allow himself to be ruled by her decisions there were greetings between them morning and evening and questions were asked and answered formally but there was no conversation what have i done that i should be punished in this way said sir harry to himself  if he was prompt to think himself hardly used so also was his daughter in considering the matter in her own mind she had found it to be her duty to obey her father in her outward conduct founding her convictions in this matter upon precedent and upon the general convictions of the world in the matter of bestowing herself upon a suitor a girl is held to be subject to her parents so much she knew or believed that she knew and therefore she would obey she had read and heard of girls who would correspond with their lovers clandestinely would run away with their lovers would marry their lovers as it were behind their fathers backs no act of this kind would she do she had something within her which would make it dreadful to her ever to have to admit that she had been personally wrongsome mixture of pride and principle which was strong enough to keep her stedfast in her promised obedience she would do nothing that could be thrown in her teeth nothing that could be called unfeminine indelicate or undutiful but she had high ideas of what was due to herself and conceived that she would be wronged by her father should her father take advantage of her sense of duty to crush her heart she had her own rights and her own privileges with which grievous and cruel interference would be made should her father because he was her father rob her of the only thing which was sweet to her taste or desirable in her esteem because she was his heiress he had no right to make her his slave but even should he do so she had in her own hands a certain security the bondage of a slave no doubt he might allot to her but not the taskwork because she would cling to her duty and keep the promise which she had made to him it would be in his power to prevent the marriage upon which she had set her heart but it was not within his power or within his privilege as a father to force upon her any other marriage she would never help him with her hand in that adjustment of his property of which he thought so much unless he would help her in her love and in the meantime sunshine should be banished from the house such sunshine as had shone round her head she did not so esteem herself as to suppose that because she was sad therefore her father and mother would be wretched but she did feel herself bound to contribute to the house in general all the wretchedness which might come from her own want of sunlight she suffered under a terrible feeling of illusage why was she because she was a girl and an heiress to be debarred from her own happiness if she were willing to risk herself why should others interfere and if the life and conduct of her cousin were in truth so bad as they were representedwhich she did not in the least believewhy had he been allowed to come within her reach it was not only that he was young clever handsome and in every way attractive but that in addition to all this he was a hotspur and would some day be the head of the hotspurs her father had known well enough that her family pride was equal to his own was it not natural that when a man so endowed had come in her way she should learn to love him and when she had loved him was it not right that she should cling to her love  her father would fain treat her like a beast of burden kept in the stables for a purpose or like a dog whose obedience and affections might be transferred from one master to another for a price she would obey her father but her father should be made to understand that hers was not the nature of a beast of burden or of a dog she was a hotspur as thoroughly as was he and then they brought men there to her selected suitors whom she despised what did they think of her when imagining that she would take a husband not of her own choosing what must be their idea of love and of marriage duty and of that close intercourse of man and wife to her feeling a woman should not marry at all unless she could so love a man as to acknowledge to herself that she was imperatively required to sacrifice all that belonged to her for his welfare and good such was her love for george hotspurlet him be what he might they told her that he was bad and that he would drag her into the mud she was willing to be dragged into the mud or at any rate to make her own struggle during the dragging as to whether he should drag her in or she should drag him out  and then they brought men to herwalkingstickslord alfred and young mr thoresby and insulted her by supposing of her that she would marry a man simply because he was brought there as a fitting husband she would be dutiful and obedient as a daughter according to her idea of duty and of principle but she would let them know that she had an identity of her own and that she was not to be moulded like a piece of clay  no doubt she was hard upon her father no doubt she was in very truth disobedient and disrespectful it was not that she should have married any lord alfred that was brought to her but that she should have struggled to accommodate her spirit to her fathers spirit but she was a hotspur and though she could be generous she could not yield and then the hold of a child upon the father is so much stronger than that of the father on the child our eyes are set in our face and are always turned forward the glances that we cast back are but occasional  and so the sunshine was banished from the house of humblethwaite and the days were as black as the night     chapter xvii  let us try   things went on thus at humblethwaite for three weeks and sir harry began to feel that he could endure it no longer he had expected to have heard again from mr boltby but no letter had come mr boltby had suggested to him something of starving out the town and he had expected to be informed before this whether the town were starved out or not he had received an indignant and grandiloquent letter from his cousin of which as yet he had taken no notice he had taken no notice of the letter although it had been written to decline a proposal of very great moment made by himself he felt that in these circumstances mr boltby ought to have written to him he ought to have been told what was being done and yet he had left mr boltby with a feeling which made it distasteful to him to ask further questions from the lawyer on the subject altogether his position was one as disagreeable and painful as it well could be  but at last in regard to his own private life with his daughter he could bear it no longer the tenderness of his heart was too much for his pride and he broke down in his resolution to be stern and silent with her till all this should have passed by them she was so much more to him than he was to her she was his all in allwhereas cousin george was hers he was the happier at any rate in this that he would never be forced to despise where he loved  emily he said to her at last why is it that you are so changed to me  papa  are you not changed do you not know that everything about the house is changed  yes papa  and why is it so i do not keep away from you you used to come to me every day you never come near me now  she hesitated for a moment with her eyes turned to the ground and then as she answered him she looked him full in the face it is because i am always thinking of my cousin george  but why should that keep us apart emily i wish that it were not so but why should that keep us apart  because you are thinking of him too and think so differently you hate him but i love him  i do not hate him it is not that i hate him i hate his vices  so do i  i know that he is not a fit man for you to marry i have not been able to tell you the things that i know of him  i do not wish to be told  but you might believe me when i assure you that they are of a nature to make you change your feelings towards him at this very moment he is attached totoanother person  emily hotspur blushed up to her brows and her cheeks and forehead were suffused with blood but her mouth was set as firm as a rock and then came that curl over her eye which her father had so dearly loved when she was a child but which was now held by him to be so dangerous she was not going to be talked out of her love in that way of course there had been thingswere things of which she knew nothing and desired to know nothing though she herself was as pure as the driven snow she did not require to be told that there were impurities in the world if it was meant to be insinuated that he was untrue to her she simply disbelieved it but what if he were his untruth would not justify hers and untruth was impossible to her she loved him and had told him so let him be ever so false it was for her to bring him back to truth or to spend herself in the endeavour her father did not understand her at all when he talked to her after this fashion but she said nothing her father was alluding to a matter on which she could say nothing  if i could explain to you the way in which he has raised money for his daily needs you would feel that he had degraded himself beneath your notice  he cannot degrade himself beneath my noticenot now it is too late  but emilydo you mean to say then that let you set your affections where you mighthowever wrongly on however base a subjectyour mamma and i ought to yield to them merely because they are so set  he is your heir papa  no you are my heir but i will not argue upon that grant that he were my heir even though every acre that is mine must go to feed his wickedness the very moment that i die would that be a reason for giving my child to him also do you think that you are no more to me than the acres or the house or the empty title they are all nothing to my love for you  papa  i do not think that you have known it nay darling i have hardly known it myself all other anxieties have ceased with me now that i have come to know what it really is to be anxious for you do you think that i would not abandon any consideration as to wealth or family for your happiness it has come to that with me emily that they are nothing to me nownothing you are everything  dear papa and now once again she leant upon his shoulder  when i tell you of the young mans life you will not listen to me you regard it simply as groundless opposition  no papa not groundlessonly useless  but am i not bound to see that my girl be not united to a man who would disgrace her misuse her drag her into the dirtthat idea of dragging george out was strong in emilys mind as she listened to thismake her wretched and contemptible and degrade her surely this is a fathers duty and my child should not turn from me and almost refuse to speak to me because i do it as best i can  i do not turn from you papa  has my darling been to me as she used to be  look here papa you know what it is i have promised you  i do dearest  i will keep my promise i will never marry him till you consent even though i were to see him every day for ten years i would not do so when i had given my word  i am sure of it emily  but let us try you and i and mamma together if you will do that oh i will be so good to you let us see if we cannot make him good i will never ask to marry him till you yourself are satisfied that he has reformed she looked into his face imploringly and she saw that he was vacillating and yet he was a strong man not given in ordinary things to much doubt papa let us understand each other and be friends if we do not trust each other who can trust any one  i do trust you  i shall never care for any one else  do not say that my child you are too young to know your own heart these are wounds which time will cure others have suffered as you are suffering and yet have become happy wives and mothers  papa i shall never change i think i love him more because he isso weak like a poor child that is a cripple he wants more love than those who are strong i shall never change and look here papa i know it is my duty to obey you by not marrying without your consent but it can never be my duty to marry any one because you or mamma ask me you will agree to that papa  i should never think of pressing any one on you  that is what i mean and so we do understand each other nothing can teach me not to think of him and to love him and to pray for him as long as i live i shall do so nothing you can find out about him will alter me in that pray pray do not go on finding out bad things find out something good and then you will begin to love him  but if there is nothing good sir harry as he said this remembered the indignant refusal of his offer which was at that moment in his pocket and confessed to himself that he had no right to say that nothing good could be found in cousin george  do not say that papa how can you say that of any one remember he has our name and he must some day be at the head of our family  it will not be long first said sir harry mournfully  many many many years i hope for his sake as well as ours i pray that it may be so but still it is natural to suppose that the day will come  of course it will come  must it not be right then to make him fit for it when it comes it cant be your great duty to think of him as it is mine but still it must be a duty to you too i will not excuse his life papa but have there not been temptationssuch great temptations and then other men are excused for doing what he has done let us try together papa say that you will try  it was clear to sir harry through it all that she knew nothing as yet of the nature of the mans offences when she spoke of temptation not resisted she was still thinking of commonplace extravagance of the ordinary pleasures of fast young men of racecourses and betting perhaps and of tailors bills that lie which he had told about goodwood she had as it were thrown behind her so that she should not be forced to look at it but sir harry knew him to be steeped in dirty lies up to the hip one who cheated tradesmen on system a gambler who looked out for victims a creature so mean that he could take a womans money mr boltby had called him a swindler a cardsharper and a cur and sir harry though he was inclined at the present moment to be angry with mr boltby had never known the lawyer to be wrong and this was the man for whom his daughter was pleading with all the young enthusiasm of her naturewas pleading not as for a cousin but in order that he might at last be welcomed to that house as her lover her husband the one human being chosen out from all the world to be the recipient of the good things of which she had the bestowal the man was so foul in the estimation of sir harry that it was a stain to be in his presence and this was the man whom he as a father was implored to help to save in order that at some future time his daughter might become the reprobates wife  papa say that you will help me repeated emily clinging to him and looking up into his face  he could not say that he would help her and yet he longed to say some word that might comfort her you have been greatly shaken by all this dearest  shaken yes in one sense i have been shaken i dont know quite what you mean i shall never be shaken in the other way  you have been distressed  yes distressed  and indeed so have we all he continued i think it will be best to leave this for a while  for how long papa  we need not quite fix that i was thinking of going to naples for the winter he was silent waiting for her approbation but she expressed none it is not long since you said how much you would like to spend a winter in naples  she still paused but it was but for a moment at that time papa i was not engaged did she mean to tell him that because of this fatal promise which she had made she never meant to stir from her home till she should be allowed to go with that wretch as her husband that because of this promise which could never be fulfilled everything should come to an end with her papa she said that would not be the way to try to save him to go away and leave him among those who prey upon himunless indeed he might go too  what with us  with you and mamma why not you know what i have promised you can trust me  it is a thing absolutely not to be thought of he said and then he left her what was he to do he could take her abroad no doubt but were he to do so in her present humour she would of course relapse into that cold silent unloving undutiful obedience which had been so distressing to him she had made a great request to him and he had not absolutely refused it but the more he thought of it the more distasteful did it become to him you cannot touch pitch and not be defiled and the stain of this pitch was so very black he could pay money if that would soothe her he could pay money even if the man should not accept the offer made to him should she demand it of him and if the man would reform himself and come out through the fire really purified might it not be possible that at some long future time emily should become his wife or if some sort of half promise such as this were made to emily would not that soften her for the time and induce her to go abroad with a spirit capable of satisfaction if not of pleasure if this could be brought about then time might do the rest it would have been a delight to him to see his daughter married early even though his own home might have been made desolate but now he would be content if he thought he could look forward to some future settlement in life that might become her rank and fortune  emily when her father left her was aware that she had received no reply to her request which she was entitled to regard as encouraging but she thought that she had broken the ice and that her father would by degrees become accustomed to her plan if she could only get him to say that he would watch over the unhappy one she herself would not be unhappy it was not to be expected that she should be allowed to give her own aid at first to the work but she had her scheme his debts must be paid and an income provided for him and duties too must be given to him why should he not live at scarrowby and manage the property there and then at length he would be welcomed to humblethwaite when her own work might begin neither for him nor for her must there be any living again in london until this task should have been completed that any trouble could be too great any outlay of money too vast for so divine a purpose did not occur to her was not this man the heir to her fathers title and was he not the owner of her own heart then she knelt down and prayed that the almighty father would accomplish this good work for herand yet not for her but for him not that she might be happy in her love but that he might be as a brand saved from the burning not only hereafter but here also in the sight of men alas dearest no not so could it be done not at thy instance though thy prayers be as pure as the songs of angelsbut certainly at his if only he could be taught to know that the treasure so desirable in thy sight so inestimable to thee were a boon worthy of his acceptance     chapter xviii  good advice   two or three days after the little request made by cousin george to mrs morton the altringhams came suddenly to town george received a note from lady altringham addressed to him at his club      we are going through to the draytons in hampshire it    is a new freak four or five horses are to be sold and    gustavus thinks of buying the lot if you are in town    come to us you must not think that we are slack about you    because gustavus would have nothing to do with the money    he will be at home tomorrow till eleven i shall not go    out till two we leave on thursdayyours a a   this letter he received on the wednesday up to that hour he had done nothing since his interview with mr hart nor during those few days did he hear from that gentleman or from captain stubber or from mr boltby he had written to sir harry refusing sir harrys generous offer and subsequently to that had made up his mind to accept itand had asked as the reader knows for mrs mortons assistance but the making up of george hotspurs mind was nothing it was unmade again that day after dinner as he thought of all the glories of humblethwaite and scarrowby combined any one knowing him would have been sure that he would do nothing till he should be further driven now there had come upon the scene in london one who could drive him  he went to the earls house just at eleven not wishing to seem to avoid the earl but still desirous of seeing as little of his friend on that occasion as possible he found lord altringham standing in his wifes morningroom how are you old fellow how do things go with the heiress he was in excellent humour and said nothing about the refused request i must be off you do what my lady advises you may be sure that she knows a deal more about it than you or i then he went wishing george success in his usual friendly genial way which as george knew meant very little  with lady altringham the case was different she was in earnest about it it was to her a matter of real moment that this great heiress should marry one of her own set and a man who wanted money so badly as did poor george and she liked work of that kind georges matrimonial prospects were more interesting to her than her husbands stables she was very soon in the thick of it all asking questions and finding out how the land lay she knew that george would lie but that was to be expected from a man in his position she knew also that she could with fair accuracy extract the truth from his lies  pay all your debts and give you five hundred pounds a year for his life  the lawyer has offered that said george sadly  then you may be sure continued lady altringham that the young lady is in earnest you have not accepted it  oh dear no i wrote to sir harry quite angrily i told him i wanted my cousins hand  and what next  i have heard nothing further from anybody  lady altringham sat and thought are these people in london bothering you george explained that he had been bothered a good deal but not for the last four or five days can they put you in prison or anything of that kind  george was not quite sure whether they might or might not have some such power he had a dreadful weight on his mind of which he could say nothing to lady altringham even she would be repelled from him were she to know of that evenings work between him and messrs walker and bullbean he said at last that he did not think they could arrest him but that he was not quite sure  you must do something to let her know that you are as much in earnest as she is  exactly  it is no use writing because she wouldnt get your letters  she wouldnt have a chance  and if i understand her she would not do anything secretly  i am afraid not said george  you will live perhaps to be glad that it is so when girls come out to meet their lovers clandestinely before marriage they get so fond of the excitement that they sometimes go on doing it afterwards  she is asasas sure to go the right side of the post as any girl in the world  no doubt so much the better for you when those girls do catch the disease they always have it very badly they mean only to have one affair and naturally want to make the most of it well now what i would do is this run down to humblethwaite  to humblethwaite  yes i dont suppose you are going to be afraid of anybody knock at the door and send your card to sir harry drive into the stableyard so that everybody about the place may know that you are there and then ask to see the baronet  he wouldnt see me  then ask to see lady elizabeth  she wouldnt be allowed to see me  then leave a letter and say that youll wait for an answer write to miss hotspur whatever you like to say in the way of a loveletter and put it under cover to sir harryopen  shell never get it  i dont suppose she will not but what she mayonly that isnt the first object but this will come of it shell know that youve been there that cant be kept from her you may be sure that she was very firm in sticking to you when he offered to pay all that money to get rid of you shell remain firm if shes made to know that you are the same dont let her love die out for want of notice  i wont  if they take her abroad go after them stick to it and youll wear them out if she helps you and if she knows that you are sticking to it shell do the same for honour when she begins to be a little pale and to walk out at nights and to cough in the morning theyll be tired out and send for dr george hotspur thats the way it will go if you play your game well  cousin george was lost in admiration at the wisdom and generalship of this great counsellor and promised implicit obedience the countess went on to explain that it might be expedient to postpone this movement for a week or two you should leave just a little interval because you cannot always be doing something for some days after his return her father wont cease to abuse you which will keep you well in her mind when those men begin to attack you again so as to make london too hot then run down to humblethwaite dont hide your light under a bushel let the people down there know all about it  george hotspur swore eternal gratitude and implicit obedience and went back to his club  mr hart and captain stubber did not give him much rest from mr boltby he received no further communication for the present mr boltby thought it well to leave him in the hands of mr hart and captain stubber mr boltby indeed did not as yet know of mr bullbeans story although certain hints had reached him which had as he thought justified him in adding the title of cardsharper to those other titles with which he had decorated his clients cousins name had he known the entire walker story he would probably have thought that cousin george might have been bought at a considerably cheaper price than that fixed in the baronets offer which was still in force but then mr hart had his little doubts also and his difficulties he too could perceive that were he to make this last little work of captain hotspurs common property in the market it might so far sink captain hotspurs condition and value in the world that nobody would think it worth his while to pay captain hotspurs debts at present there was a proposition from an old gentleman possessed of enormous wealth to pay all captain hotspurs debts three months ago mr hart would willingly have sold every scrap of the captains paper in his possession for the half of the sum inscribed on it the whole sum was now promised and would undoubtedly be paid if the captain could be worked upon to do as mr boltby desired but if the gentlemen employed on this delicate business were to blow upon the captain too severely mr boltby would have no such absolute necessity to purchase the captain the captain would sink to zero and not need purchasing mr walker must have back his moneyor so much of it as mr hart might permit him to take that probably might be managed and the captain must be thoroughly frightened and must be made to write the letter which mr boltby desired mr hart understood his work very wellso it is hoped does the reader  captain stubber was in these days a thorn in our heros side but mr hart was a scourge of scorpions mr hart never ceased to talk of mr walker and of the determination of walker and bullbean to go before a magistrate if restitution were not made cousin george of course denied the foul play but admitted that he would repay the money if he had it there should be no difficulty about the money mr hart assured him if he would only write that letter to mr boltby in fact if he would write that letter to mr boltby he should be made shquare all round so mr hart was pleased to express himself but if this were not done and done at once mr hart swore by his god that captain oshspur should be sold up root and branch without another days mercy the choice was between five hundred pounds a year in any of the capitals of europe and that without a debtor penal servitude that was the pleasant form in which mr hart put the matter to his young friend  cousin george drank a good deal of curaçoa and doubted between lady altringham and mr hart he knew that he had not told everything to the countess excellent as was her scheme perfect as was her wisdom her advice was so far more dangerous than the jews that it was given somewhat in the dark the jew knew pretty well everything the jew was interested of course and therefore his advice must also be regarded with suspicion at last when mr hart and captain stubber between them had made london too hot to hold him he started for humblethwaitenot without leaving a note for dear mr hart in which he explained to that gentleman that he was going to westmoreland suddenly with a purpose that would he trusted very speedily enable him to pay every shilling that he owed  yesh said mr hart and if he aint quick he shall come back with a andcuff on  captain hotspur could not very well escape mr hart he started by the nighttrain for penrith and before doing so prepared a short letter for miss hotspur which as instructed he put open under an envelope addressed to the baronet there should be nothing clandestine nothing dishonourable oh dear no he quite taught himself to believe that he would have hated anything dishonourable or clandestine his letter was as follows      dearest emilyafter what has passed between us i cannot    bear not to attempt to see you or to write to you so    i shall go down and take this letter with me of course    i shall not take any steps of which sir harry might    disapprove i wrote to him two or three weeks ago telling    him what i proposed and i thought that he would have    answered me as i have not heard from him i shall take    this with me to humblethwaite and shall hope though i do    not know whether i may dare to expect to see the girl i    love better than all the worldalways your own     george hotspur   even this was not composed by himself for cousin george though he could often talk wellor at least sufficiently well for the purposes which he had on handwas not good with his pen on such an occasion as this lady altringham had sent him by post a rough copy of what he had better say and he had copied her ladyships words verbatim there is no matter of doubt at all but that on all such subjects an average woman can write a better letter than an average man and cousin george was therefore right to obtain assistance from his female friends  he slept at penrith till nearly noon then breakfasted and started with posthorses for humblethwaite he felt that everybody knew what he was about and was almost ashamed of being seen nevertheless he obeyed his instructions he had himself driven up through the lodges and across the park into the large stableyard of the hall lady altringham had quite understood that more people must see and hear him in this way than if he merely rang at the front door and were from thence dismissed the grooms and the coachman saw him as did also three or four of the maids who were in the habit of watching to see that the grooms and coachman did their work he had brought with him a travellingbagnot expecting to be asked to stay and dine but thinking it well to be prepared this however he left in the fly as he walked round to the halldoor the footman was already there when he appeared as word had gone through the house that mr george had arrived was sir harry at home yes sir harry was at homeand then george found himself in a small parlour or bookroom or subsidiary library which he had very rarely known to be used but there was a fire in the room and he stood before it twiddling his hat  in a quarter of an hour the door was opened and the servant came in with a tray and wine and sandwiches george felt it to be an inappropriate welcome but still after a fashion it was a welcome  is sir harry in the house he asked  yes mr hotspur  does he know that i am here  yes mr hotspur i think he does  then it occurred to cousin george that perhaps he might bribe the servant and he put his hand into his pocket but before he had communicated the two halfcrowns it struck him that there was no possible request which he could make to the man in reference to which a bribe would be serviceable  just ask them to look to the horses he said i dont know whether they were taken out  the horses is feeding mr hotspur said the man  every word the man spoke was gravely spoken and george understood perfectly that he was held to have done a very wicked thing in coming to humblethwaite nevertheless there was a decanter full of sherry which as far as it went was an emblem of kindness nobody should say that he was unwilling to accept kindness at his cousins hands and he helped himself liberally before he was interrupted again he had filled his glass four times  but in truth it needed something to support him for a whole hour after the servants disappearance he was left alone there were books in the roomhundreds of them but in such circumstances who could read certainly not cousin george to whom books at no time gave much comfort twice and thrice he stepped towards the bell intending to ring it and ask again for sir harry but twice and thrice he paused in his position he was bound not to give offence to sir harry at last the door was opened and with silent step and grave demeanour and solemn countenance lady elizabeth walked into the room we are very sorry that you should have been kept so long waiting captain hotspur she said     chapter xix  the new smithy   sir harry was sitting alone in the library when the tidings were brought to him that george hotspur had reached humblethwaite with a pair of posthorses from penrith the old butler cloudesdale brought him the news and cloudesdale whispered it into his ears with solemn sorrow cloudesdale was well aware that cousin george was no credit to the house of humblethwaite and much about the same time the information was brought to lady elizabeth by her housekeeper and to emily by her own maid it was by cloudesdales orders that george was shown into the small room near the hall and he told sir harry what he had done in a funereal whisper lady altringham had been quite right in her method of ensuring the general delivery of the information about the house  emily flew at once to her mother george is here she said mrs quick the housekeeper was at that moment leaving the room  so quick tells me what can have brought him my dear  why should he not come mamma  because your papa will not make him welcome to the house oh dearhe knows that what are we to do in a few minutes mrs quick came back again sir harry would be much obliged if her ladyship would go to him then it was that the sandwiches and sherry were ordered it was a compromise on the part of lady elizabeth between emilys prayer that some welcome might be shown and sir harrys presumed determination that the banished man should continue to be regarded as banished take him some kind of refreshment quicka glass of wine or something you know then mrs quick had cut the sandwiches with her own hand and cloudesdale had given the sherry he aint eaten much but hes made it up with the wine said cloudesdale when the tray was brought back again  lady elizabeth went down to her husband and there was a consultation sir harry was quite clear that he would not now on this day admit cousin george as a guest into his house nor would he see him to that conclusion he came after his wife had been with him some time he would not see him there at humblethwaite if george had anything to say that could not be said in a letter a meeting might be arranged elsewhere sir harry confessed however that he could not see that good results could come from any meeting whatsoever the truth is that i dont want to have anything more to do with him said sir harry that was all very well but as emilys wants in this respect were at variance with her fathers there was a difficulty lady elizabeth pleaded that some kind of civility at least some mitigation of opposition should be shown for emilys sake at last she was commissioned to go to cousin george to send him away from the house and if necessary to make an appointment between him and sir harry at the crown at penrith for the morrow nothing on earth should induce sir harry to see his cousin anywhere on his own premises as for any meeting between cousin george and emily that was of course out of the questionand he must go from humblethwaite such were the instructions with which lady elizabeth descended to the little room  cousin george came forward with the pleasantest smile to take lady elizabeth by the hand he was considerably relieved when he saw lady elizabeth because of her he was not afraid i do not at all mind waiting he said how is sir harry  quite well  and yourself  pretty well thank you  and emily  lady elizabeth knew that in answering him she ought to call her own daughter miss hotspur but she lacked the courage emily is well too sir harry has thought it best that i should come to you and explain that just at present he cannot ask you to humblethwaite  i did not expect it  and he had rather not see you himselfat least not here lady elizabeth had not been instructed to propose a meeting she had been told rather to avoid it if possible but like some other undiplomatic ambassadors in her desire to be civil she ran at once to the extremity of the permitted concessions if you have anything to say to sir harry  i have lady elizabeth a great deal  and if you could write it  i am so bad at writing  then sir harry will go over and see you tomorrow at penrith  that will be so very troublesome to him  you need not regard that at what hour shall he come  cousin george was profuse in declaring that he would be at his cousins disposal at any hour sir harry might select from six in the morning throughout the day and night but might he not say a word to emily at this proposition lady elizabeth shook her head vigorously it was quite out of the question circumstanced as they all were at present sir harry would not think of such a thing and then it would do no good lady elizabeth did not believe that emily herself would wish it at any rate there need be no further talk about it as any such interview was at present quite impossible by all which arguments and refusals and the tone in which they were pronounced cousin george was taught to perceive that at any rate in the mind of lady elizabeth the process of parental yielding had already commenced  on all such occasions interviews are bad the teller of this story ventures to take the opportunity of recommending parents in such cases always to refuse interviews not only between the young lady and the lover who is to be excluded but also between themselves and the lover the vacillating toneeven when the resolve to suppress vacillation has been most determinedis perceived and understood and at once utilized by the least argumentative of lovers even by lovers who are obtuse the word never may be so pronounced as to make the young ladys twenty thousand pounds full present value for ten in the lovers pocket there should be no arguments no letters no interviews and the young ladys love should be starved by the absence of all other mention of the name and by the imperturbable good humour on all other matters of those with whom she comes in contact in her own domestic circle if it be worth anything it wont be starved but if starving to death be possible that is the way to starve it lady elizabeth was a bad ambassador and cousin george when he took his leave promising to be ready to meet sir harry at twelve on the morrow could almost comfort himself with a prospect of success he might be successful if only he could stave off the walker and bullbean portion of mr harts persecution for he understood that the success of his views at humblethwaite must postpone the payment by sir harry of those moneys for which mr hart and captain stubber were so unreasonably greedy he would have dared to defy the greed but for the walker and bullbean portion of the affair sir harry already knew that he was in debt to these men already knew with fair accuracy the amount of those debts hart and stubber could not make him worse in sir harrys eyes than he was already unless the walker and bullbean story should be told with the purpose of destroying him how he did hate walker and bullbean and the memory of that eveningand yet the money which now enabled him to drink champagne at the penrith crown was poor mr walkers money as he was driven back to penrith he thought of all this for some moments sadly and at others almost with triumph might not a letter to mr hart with perhaps a word of truth in it do some good that evening after his champagne he wrote a letter      dear mr hartthings are going uncommon well here only    i hope you will do nothing to disturb just at present    it must come off if a little time is given and then    every shilling will be paid a few pounds more or less    wont make any difference do arrange this and youll    find ill never forget how kind you have been ive been    at humblethwaite today and things are going quite    smooth     yours most sincerely     george hotspur     dont mention walkers name and everything shall be    settled just as you shall fix     the crown penrith thursday   the moment the letter was written he rang the bell and gave it to the waiter such was the valour of drink operating on him now as it had done when he wrote that other letter to sir harry the drink made him brave to write and to make attempts and to dare consequences but even whilst brave with drink he knew that the mornings prudence would refuse its assent to such courage and therefore to save himself from the effects of the mornings cowardice he put the letter at once out of his own power of control after this fashion were arranged most of cousin georges affairs before dinner on that day the evening of which he had passed with mr walker he had resolved that certain hints given to him by mr bullbean should be of no avail to himnot to that had he yet descended nor would he so descendbut with his brandy after dinner divine courage had come and success had attended the brave as soon as he was awake on that morning after writing to mr hart he rang his bell to inquire whether that letter which he had given to the waiter at twelve oclock last night were still in the house it was too late the letter in which so imprudent a mention had been made of mr walkers name was already in the post never mind said cousin george to himself none but the brave deserve the fair then he turned round for another nap it was not much past nine and sir harry would not be there before twelve  in the mean time there had been hope also and doubt also at humblethwaite sir harry was not surprised and hardly disappointed when he was told that he was to go to penrith to see his cousin the offer had been made by himself and he was sure that he would not escape with less and when emily was told by her mother of the arrangement she saw in it a way to the fulfilment of the prayer which she had made to her father she would say nothing to him that evening leaving to him the opportunity of speaking to her should he choose to do so but on the following morning she would repeat her prayer on that evening not a word was said about george while sir harry and lady elizabeth were together with their daughter emily had made her plan and she clung to it her father was very gentle with her sitting close to her as she played some pieces of music to him in the evening caressing her and looking lovingly into her eyes as he bade god bless her when she left him for the night but he had determined to say nothing to encourage her he was still minded that there could be no such encouragement but he doubtedin his heart of hearts he doubted he would still have bought off cousin george by the sacrifice of half his property and yet he doubted after all there would be some consolation in that binding together of the name and the property  what will you say to him lady elizabeth asked her husband that night  tell him to go away  nothing more than that  what more is there to say if he be willing to be bought i will buy him i will pay his debts and give him an income  you think then there can be no hope  hopefor whom  for emily  i hope to preserve herfrom ascoundrel and yet he had thought of the consolation  emily was very persistent in carrying out her plan prayers at humblethwaite were always read with admirable punctuality at a quarterpast nine so that breakfast might be commenced at halfpast sir harry every weekday was in his own room for threequarters of an hour before prayers all this was like clockwork at humblethwaite there would always be some man or men with sir harry during these threequarters of an houra tenant a gamekeeper a groom a gardener or a bailiff but emily calculated that if she made her appearance and held her ground the tenant or the bailiff would give way and that thus she would ensure a private interview with her father were she to wait till after breakfast this would be difficult a very few minutes after the halfhour she knocked at the door and was admitted the village blacksmith was then suggesting a new smithy  papa said emily if you would allow me half a minute  the village blacksmith and the bailiff who was also present withdrew bowing to emily who gave to each of them a smile and a nod they were her old familiar friends and they looked kindly at her she was to be their future lady but was it not all important that their future lord should be a hotspur  sir harry had thought it not improbable that his daughter would come to him but would have preferred to avoid the interview if possible here it was however and could not be avoided  papa she said kissing him you are going to penrith today  yes my dear  to see cousin george  yes emily  will you remember what we were saying the other daywhat i said  i will endeavour to do my duty as best i may said sir harry after a pause  i am sure you will papaand so do i i do endeavour to do my duty will you not try to help him  certainly i will try to help him for your sake rather than for his own if i can help him with money by paying his debts and giving him means to live i will do so  papa that is not what i mean  what else can i do  save him from the evil of his ways  i will try i wouldif i knew howeven if only for the names sake  for my sake also papa papa let us do it together you and i and mamma let him come here  it is impossible  let him come here she said as though disregarding his refusal you need not be afraid of me i know how much there is to do that will be very hard in doing before anyany other arrangement can be talked about  i am not afraid of you my child  let him come then  noit would do no good do you think he would live here quietly  try him  what would people say  never mind what people would say he is our cousin he is your heir he is the person whom i love best in all the world have you not a right to have him here if you wish it i know what you are thinking of but papa there can never be anybody elsenever  emily you will kill me i think  dear papa let us see if we cannot try and oh papa pray pray let me see him when she went away the bailiff and the blacksmith returned but sir harrys power of resistance was gone so that he succumbed to the new smithy without a word     chapter xx  cousin georges success   thoughts crowded quick into the mind of sir harry hotspur as he had himself driven over to penrith it was a dull dreary day in november and he took the close carriage the distance was about ten miles and he had therefore something above an hour for thinking when men think much they can rarely decide the affairs as to which a man has once acknowledged to himself that he may be either wise or foolish prudent or imprudent are seldom matters on which he can by any amount of thought bring himself to a purpose which to his own eyes shall be clearly correct when he can decide without thinking then he can decide without a doubt and with perfect satisfaction but in this matter sir harry thought much there had been various times at which he was quite sure that it was his duty to repudiate this cousin utterly there had never been a time at which he had been willing to accept him nevertheless at this moment with all his struggles of thought he could not resolve was his higher duty due to his daughter or to his familyand through his family to his country which as he believed owed its security and glory to the maintenance of its aristocracy would he be justifiedjustified in any degreein subjecting his child to danger in the hope that his name and family pride might be maintained might he take his own desires in that direction as any makeweight towards a compliance with his girls strong wishes grounded as they were on quite other reasons mr boltby had been very eager in telling him that he ought to have nothing to say to this cousin had loaded the cousins name with every imaginable evil epithet and of mr boltbys truth and honesty there could be no doubt but then mr boltby had certainly exceeded his duty and was of course disposed by his professional view of the matter to think any step the wisest which would tend to save the property from dangerous hands sir harry felt that there were things to be saved of more value than the propertythe family the title perhaps that reprobate cousin himself and then above all his child he did believe that his child would not smile for him again unless he would consent to make some effort in favour of her lover  doubtless the man was very bad sir harry was sick at heart as he thought of the evil nature of the young mans vices of a man debauched in his life extravagant with his money even of a gambler a drunkard one fond of low men and of low womenof one even such as this there might be hope and the vicious man if he will give up his vices may still be loved and at last respected but of a liar a swindler one mean as well as vicious what hope could there be it was essential to sir harry that the husband of his daughter should at any rate be a gentleman the mans blood indeed was good and blood will show at last let the mud be ever so deep so said sir harry to himself and emily would consent that the man should be tried by what severest fire might be kindled for the trying of him if there were any gold there it might be possible to send the dross adrift and to get the gold without alloy could lady altringham have read sir harrys mind as his carriage was pulled up just at twelve oclock at the door of the penrith crown she would have been stronger than ever in her belief that young lovers if they be firm can always conquer opposing parents  but alas alas there was no gold with this dross and in that matter of blood as to which sir harrys ideas were so strong and indeed so noble he entertained but a muddled theory noblesse oblige high position will demand and will often exact high work but that rule holds as good with a buonaparte as with a bourbon with a cromwell as with a stewart and succeeds as often and fails as often with the low born as with the high and good blood too will have its effectphysical for the most partand will produce bottom lasting courage that capacity of carrying on through the mud to which sir harry was wont to allude but good blood will bring no man back to honesty the two things together no doubt assist in producing the highest order of selfdenying man  when sir harry got out of his carriage he had not yet made up his mind the waiter had been told that he was expected and showed him up at once into the large sittingroom looking out into the street which cousin george had bespoke for the occasion he had had a smaller room himself but had been smoking there and at this moment in that room there was a decanter and a wineglass on the chiffonier in one corner he had heard the bustle of the arrival and had at once gone into the saloon prepared for the reception of the great man i am so sorry to give you this trouble said cousin george coming forward to greet his cousin sir harry could not refuse his cousins hand though he would willingly have done so had it been possible i should not mind the trouble he said if it were of any use i fear it can be of none  i hope you will not be prejudiced against me sir harry  i trust that i am not prejudiced against any one what is it that you wish me to do  i want permission to go to humblethwaite as a suitor for your daughters hand so far cousin george had prepared his speech beforehand  and what have you to recommend you to a father for such permission do you not know sir that when a gentleman proposes to a lady it is his duty to show that he is in a condition fit for the position which he seeks that in character in means in rank in conduct he is at least her equal  as for our rank sir harry it is the same  and for your means you know that my daughter is my heiress  i do but it is not that that has brought me to her of course i have nothing but then you know though she will inherit the estates i must inherit  if you please sir we will not go into all that again said sir harry interrupting him i explained to you before sir that i would have admitted your future rank as a counterpoise to her fortune if i could have trusted your character i cannot trust it i do not know why you should thrust upon me the necessity of saying all this again as i believe that you are in pecuniary distress i made you an offer which i thought to be liberal  it was liberal but it did not suit me to accept it george had an inkling of what would pass within sir harrys bosom as to the acceptance or rejection of that offer i wrote to you declining it and as i have received no answer i thought that i would just run down what was i to do  do how can i tell pay your debts the money was offered you  i cannot give up my cousin has she been allowed to receive the letter which i left for her yesterday  now sir harry had doubted much in his own mind as to the letter during that mornings interview it had still been in his own possession as he was preparing to leave the house he had made up his mind that she should have it and lady elizabeth had been commissioned to give it her not without instruction and explanation her father would not keep it from her because he trusted her implicitly but she was to understand that it could mean nothing to her and that the letter must not of course be answered  it does not matter whether she did or did not said sir harry i ask you again whether you will accept the offer made you by mr boltby and give me your written promise not to renew this suit  i cannot do that sir harry  sir harry did not know how to proceed with the interview as he had come there some proposition must be made by himself had he intended to be altogether obstinate he should have remained at humblethwaite and kept his cousin altogether out of the house and now his daughters prayers were ringing in his ears dear papa let us see if we cannot try and then again that assurance which she had made him so solemnly papa there never can be anybody else if the black sheep could be washed white the good of such washing would on every side be so great he would have to blushlet the washing be ever so perfecthe must always blush in having such a soninlaw but he had been forced to acknowledge to himself of late that there was infinitely more of trouble and shame in this world than of joy or honour was it not in itself a disgrace that a hotspur should do such things as this cousin had done and a disgrace also that his daughter should have loved a man so unfit to be her lover and then from day to day and from hour to hour he remembered that these ills were added to the death of that son who had he lived would have been such a glory to him more of trouble and disgrace was it not all trouble and disgrace he would have wished that the day might come for him to go away and leave it all were it not that for one placed as he was placed his own life would not see the end of these troubles he must endeavour to provide that everything should not go to utter ruin as soon as he should have taken his departure  he walked about the room again trying to think or perhaps all thinking was over with him now and he was resolving in his own mind how best he might begin to yield he must obey his daughter he could not break the heart of the only child that was left to him he had no delight in the world other than what came to him reflected back from her he felt now as though he was simply a steward endeavouring on her behalf to manage things to the best advantage but still only a steward and as such only a servant who could not at last decide on the mode of management to be adopted he could endeavour to persuade but she must decide now his daughter had decided and he must begin this task so utterly distasteful to him of endeavouring to wash the blackamoor white  what are you willing to do he asked  how to do sir harry  you have led a bad life  i suppose i have sir harry  how will you show yourself willing to reform it  only pay my debts and set me up with ready money and ill go along as slick as grease thus would cousin george have answered the question had he spoken his mind freely but he knew that he might not be so explicit he must promise much but of course in making his promise he must arrange about his debts ill do almost anything you like only try me of course it would be so much easier if those debts were paid off ill give up races altogether if you mean that sir harry indeed im ready to give up anything  will you give up london  london in simple truth george did not quite understand the proposition  yes will you leave london will you go and live at scarrowby and learn to look after the farm and the place  georges face fellhis face being less used to lying than his tongue but his tongue lied at once oh yes certainly if you wish it i should rather like a life of that sort for how long would it be  for two years said sir harry grimly  cousin george in truth did not understand he thought that he was to take his bride with him when he went to scarrowby perhaps emily would not like it he said  it is what she desires you do not suppose that she knows so little of your past life as to be willing to trust herself into your hands at once she is attached to you  and so am i to her on my honour i am im sure you dont doubt that  sir harry doubted every word that fell from his cousins mouth but still he persevered he could perceive though he could not analyse and there was hardly a tone which poor cousin george used which did not discourage the baronet still he persevered he must persevere now even if it were only to prove to emily how much of basest clay and how little of gold there was in this image  she is attached to you he continued and you bear our name and will be the head of our family if you will submit yourself to a reformed life and will prove that you are fit for her it may be possible that after years she should be your wife  after years sir harry  yes sirafter years do you suppose that the happiness of such an one as she can be trusted to such keeping as yours without a trial of you you will find that she has no such hope herself  oh of course what she likes  i will pay your debts on condition that mr boltby is satisfied that he has the entire list of them  george as he heard this at once determined that he must persuade mr hart to include mr walkers little account in that due to himself it was only a matter of a few hundreds and might surely be arranged when so much real money would be passing from hand to hand  i will pay everything you shall then go down to scarrowby and the house shall be prepared for you  it wasnt supposed george thought that he was absolutely to live in solitary confinement at scarrowby he might have a friend or two and then the station was very near  you are fond of shooting and you will have plenty of it there we will get you made a magistrate for the county and there is much to do in looking after the property sir harry became almost goodhumoured in his tone as he described the kind of life which he intended that the blackamoor should live we will come to you for a month each year and then you can come to us for a while  when shall it begin asked cousin george as soon as the baronet paused this was a question difficult to be answered in fact the arrangement must be commenced at once sir harry knew very well that having so far yielded he must take his cousin back with him to humblethwaite he must keep his cousin now in his possession till all those debts should be paid and till the house at scarrowby should be prepared and he must trust to his daughters prudence and high sense of right not to treat her lover with too tender an acknowledgment of her love till he should have been made to pass through the fire of reform  you had better get ready and come back to humblethwaite with me now said sir harry  within five minutes after that there was bustling about the passages and hall of the crown hotel everybody in the house from the august landlord down to the humble stableboy knew that there had been a reconciliation between sir harry and his cousin and that the cousin was to be made welcome to all the good the gods could give while cousin george was packing his things sir harry called for the bill and paid itwithout looking at it because he would not examine how the blackamoor had lived while he was still a blackamoor  i wonder whether he observed the brandy thought cousin george to himself     chapter xxi  emily hotspurs sermon   the greater portion of the journey back to humblethwaite was passed in silence sir harry had undertaken an experiment in which he had no faith himself and was sad at heart cousin george was cowed half afraid and yet half triumphant could it be possible that he should pull through after all some things had gone so well with him his lady friends had been so true to him lady altringham and then mrs mortonhow good they had been dear lucy he would never forget her and emily was such a brick he was going to see his emily and that would be so jolly nevertheless he did acknowledge to himself that an emily prepared to assist her father in sending her lover through the fire of reform would not be altogether so jolly as the emily who had leaned against him on the bridge at airey force while his arm had been tightly clasped round her waist he was alive to the fact that romance must give place to business  when they had entered the parkgates sir harry spoke you must understand georgehe had not called him george before since the engagement had been made known to himthat you cannot yet be admitted here as my daughters accepted suitor as might have been the case had your past life been different  i see all that said cousin george  it is right that i should tell you so but i trust implicitly to emilys high sense of duty and propriety and now that you are here george i trust that it may be for your advantage and for ours  then he pressed his cousins hand if not with affection at least with sincerity  im sure it is to be all right now said george calculating whether he would be able to escape to london for a few days so that he might be able to arrange that little matter with mr hart they couldnt suppose that he would be able to leave london for two years without a days notice  sir harry got out of the carriage at the front door and desired cousin george to follow him into the house he turned at once into the small room where george had drunk the sherry and desired that lady elizabeth might be sent to him  my dear said he i have brought george back with me we will do the best that we can mrs quick will have a room for him you had better tell emily and let her come to me for a moment before she sees her cousin this was all said in georges hearing and then sir harry went leaving his cousin in the hands of lady elizabeth  i am glad to see you back again george she said with a melancholy voice  cousin george smiled and said that it would be all right  i am sure i hope so for my girls sake but there must be a great change george  no end of a change said cousin george who was not in the least afraid of lady elizabeth  many things of moment had to be done in the house that day before dinner in the first place there was a long interview between the father and daughter for a few minutes perhaps he was really happy when she was kneeling with her arms upon his knees thanking him for what he had done while tears of joy were streaming down her cheeks he would not bring himself to say a word of caution to her would it not be to paint the snow white to caution her as to her conduct  i have done as you bade me in everything he said i have proposed to him that he should go to scarrowby it may be that it will be your home for a while dear  she thanked him and kissed him again and again she would be so good she would do all she could to deserve his kindness and as for georgepray papa dont think that i suppose that it can be all done quite at once nevertheless it was in that direction that her thoughts erred it did seem to her that the hard part of the work was already done and that now the pleasant paths of virtue were to be trod with happy and persistent feet  you had better see him in your mothers presence dearest before dinner and then the awkwardness will be less afterwards  she kissed him again and ran from his room up to her mothers apartment taking some back stairs well known to herself lest she should by chance meet her lover after some undue and unprepared fashion and there she could sit down and think of it all she would be very discreet he should be made to understand at once that the purgation must be thorough the reform complete she would acknowledge her love to himher great and abiding love but of lovers tenderness there could be but littlealmost nonetill the fire had done its work and the gold should have been separated from the dross she had had her way so far and they should find that she had deserved it  before dinner sir harry wrote a letter to his lawyer the mailcart passed through the village on its way to penrith late in the evening and there was time for him to save the post he thought it incumbent on him to let mr boltby know that he had changed his mind and though the writing of the letter was not an agreeable task he did it at once he said nothing to mr boltby directly about his daughter but he made it known to that gentleman that cousin george was at present a guest at humblethwaite and that he intended to pay all the debts without entering into any other specific engagements would mr boltby have the goodness to make out a schedule of the debts captain hotspur should be instructed to give mr boltby at once all the necessary information by letter then sir harry went on to say that perhaps the opinions formed in reference to captain hotspur had been too severe he was ashamed of himself as he wrote these words but still they were written if the blackamoor was to be washed white the washing must be carried out at all times at all seasons and in every possible manner till the world should begin to see that the blackness was going out of the skin  cousin george was summoned to meet the girl who loved him in her mothers morningroom before they dressed for dinner he did not know at all in what way to conduct himself he had not given a moments thought to it till the difficulty flashed upon him as she entered the apartment but she had considered it all she came up to him quickly and gave him her lips to kiss standing there in her mothers presence  george she said dear george i am so glad that you are here  it was the first and it should be the lasttill the fire had done its work till the fire should at least have done so much of its work as to make the remainder easy and fairly sure he had little to say for himself but muttered something about his being the happiest fellow in the world it was a position in which a man could hardly behave well and neither the mother nor the daughter expected much from him a man cannot bear himself gracefully under the weight of a pardon as a woman may do a man chooses generally that it shall be assumed by those with whom he is closely connected that he has done and is doing no wrong and when wronged he professes to forgive and to forget in silence to a woman the act of forgiveness either accepted or bestowed is itself a pleasure a few words were then spoken mostly by lady elizabeth and the three separated to prepare for dinner  the next day passed over them at humblethwaite hall very quietly but with some mild satisfaction sir harry told his cousin of the letter to his lawyer and desired george to make out and send by that days post such a schedule as might be possible on the spur of the moment  hadnt i better run up and see mr boltby said cousin george  but to this sir harry was opposed let any calls for money reach them there whatever the calls might be he at any rate could pay them cousin george repeated his suggestion but acquiesced when sir harry frowned and showed his displeasure he did make out a schedule and did write a letter to mr boltby  i think my debt to mr hart was put down as £3250 he wrote but i believe i should have added another £350 for a transaction as to which i fancy he does not hold my note of hand but the money is due  he was fool enough to think that mr walkers claim might be liquidated after this fashion in the afternoon they rode togetherthe father the daughter and the blackamoor and much was told to cousin george as to the nature of the property the names of the tenants were mentioned and the boundaries of the farms were pointed out to him he was thinking all the time whether mr hart would spare him  but emily hotspur though she had been thus reticent and quiet in her joy though she was resolved to be discreet and knew that there were circumstances in her engagement which would for a while deter her from being with her accepted lover as other girls are with theirs did not mean to estrange herself from her cousin george if she were to do so how was she to assist and take as she hoped to do the first part in that task of refining the gold on which they were all now intent she was to correspond with him when he was at scarrowby such was her present programme and sir harry had made no objection when she declared her purpose of course they must understand each other and have communion together on the third day therefore it was arranged they two should walk without other company about the place she must show him her own gardens which were at some distance from the house if the truth be told it must be owned that george somewhat dreaded the afternoons amusement but had she demanded of him to sit down to listen to her while she read to him a sermon he would not have refused  to be didactic and at the same time demonstrative of affection is difficult even with mothers towards their children though with them the assumption of authority creates no sense of injury emily specially desired to point out to the erring one the paths of virtue and yet to do so without being oppressive  it is so nice to have you here george she said  yes indeed isnt it he was walking beside her and as yet they were within view of the house  papa has been so good isnt he good  indeed he is the best man i know out said george thinking that his gratitude would have been stronger had the baronet given him the money and allowed him to go up to london to settle his own debts  and mamma has been so kind mamma is very fond of you i am sure she would do anything for you  and you said george looking into her face  ias for me george it is a matter of course now you do not want to be told again what is and ever must be my first interest in the world  i do not care how often you tell me  but you know it dont you  i know what you said at the waterfall emily  what i said then i said for always you may be sure of that i told mamma so and papa if they had not wanted me to love you they should not have asked you to come here i do love you and i hope that some day i may be your wife  she was not leaning on his arm but as she spoke she stopped and looked stedfastly into his face he put out his hand as though to take hers but she shook her head refusing it no george come on i want to talk to you a great deal i want to say ever so muchnow today i hope that some day i may be your wife if i am not i shall never be any mans wife  what does some day mean emily  ever so longyears perhaps  but why a fellow has to be consulted you know as well as yourself what is the use of waiting i know sir harry thinks i have been very fond of pleasure how can i better show him how willing i am to give it up than by marrying and settling down at once i dont see whats to be got by waiting  of course she must tell him the truth she had no idea of keeping back the truth she loved him with all her heart and was resolved to marry him but the dross must first be purged from the gold of course you know george that papa has made objections  i know he did but that is over now i am to go and live at scarrowby at once and have the shooting he cant want me to remain there all by myself  but he does and so do i  why  in order that he might be made clean by the fire of solitude and the hammer of hard work she could not quite say this to him you know george your life has been one of pleasure  i was in the armyfor some years  but you left it and you took to going to races and they say that you gambled and are in debt and you have been reckless is not that true george  it is true  and should you wonder that papa should be afraid to trust his only child and all his property to one whowho knows that he has been reckless but if you can show for a year or two that you can give up all that  wouldnt it be all given up if we were married  indeed i hope so i should break my heart otherwise but can you wonder that papa should wish for some delay and some proof  two years  is that much if i find you doing what he wishes these two years will be so happy to me we shall come and see you and you will come here i have never liked scarrowby because it is not pretty as this place is but oh how i shall like to go there now and when you are here papa will get to be so fond of you you will be like a real son to him only you must be steady  steady by jove yes a fellow will have to be steady at scarrowby the perfume of the cleanliness of the life proposed to him was not sweet to his nostrils  she did not like this but she knew that she could not have everything at once you must know she said that there is a bargain between me and papa i told him that i should tell you everything  yes i ought to be told everything  it is he that shall fix the day he is to do so much that he has a right to that i shall never press him and you must not  oh but i shall  it will be of no use and george i wont let you i shall scold you if you do when he thinks that you have learned how to manage the property and that your mind is set upon that kind of work and that there are no more racesmind and no betting thenthen he will consent and i will tell you something more if you would like to hear it  something pleasant is it  when he does and tells me that he is not afraid to give me to you i shall be the happiest girl in all england is that pleasantno george no i will not have it  not give me one kiss  i gave you one when you came to show you that in truth i loved you i will give you another when papa says that everything is right  not till then  no george not till then but i shall love you just the same i cannot love you better than i do  he had nothing for it but to submit and was obliged to be content during the remainder of their long walk with talking of his future life at scarrowby it was clearly her idea that he should be headfarmer headsteward headaccountant and general workman for the whole place when he talked about the game she brought him back to the ploughso at least he declared to himself and he could elicit no sympathy from her when he reminded her that the nearest meet of hounds was twenty miles and more from scarrowby you can think of other things for a while she said he was obliged to say that he would but it did seem to him that scarrowby was a sort of penal servitude to which he was about to be sent with his own concurrence the scent of the cleanliness was odious to him  i dont know what i shall do there of an evening he said  read she answered there are lots of books and you can always have the magazines i will send them to you it was a very dreary prospect of life for him but he could not tell her that it would be absolutely unendurable  when their walk was overa walk which she never could forget however long might be her life so earnest had been her purposehe was left alone and took another stroll by himself how would it suit him was it possible could the event come off might it not have been better for him had he allowed his other loving friend to prepare for him the letter to the baronet in which sir harrys munificent offer would have been accepted let us do him the justice to remember that he was quite incapable of understanding the misery the utter ruin which that letter would have entailed upon her who loved him so well he knew nothing of such sufferings as would have been hersas must be hers for had she not already fallen haplessly into the pit when she had once allowed herself to fix her heart upon a thing so base as this it might have been better he thought if that letter had been written a dim dull idea came upon him that he was not fit to be this girls husband he could not find his joys where she would find hers no doubt it would be a grand thing to own humblethwaite and scarrowby at some future time but sir harry might live for these twenty years and while sir harry lived he must be a slave and then he thought that upon the whole he liked lucy morton better than emily hotspur he could say what he chose to lucy and smoke in her presence own that he was fond of drink and obtain some sympathy for his book on the derby he began to feel already that he did not like sermons from the girl of his heart  but he had chosen this side now and he must go on with the game it seemed certain to him that his debts would at any rate be paid he was not at all certain how matters might go in reference to mr walker but if matters came to the worst the baronet would probably be willing to buy him off again with the promised income nevertheless he was not comfortable and certainly did not shine at sir harrys table why she has loved him what she has seen in him i cannot tell said sir harry to his wife that night  we must presume sir harry did not know how it is that the birds pair     chapter xxii  george hotspur yields   on the morning of cousin georges fourth day at humblethwaite there came a letter for sir harry the post reached the hall about an hour before the time at which the family met for prayers and the letters were taken into sir harrys room the special letter of which mention is here made shall be given to the reader entire       lincolns inn fields    24th nov 186     my dear sir harry hotspuri have received your letter    in reference to captain hotspurs debts and have also    received a letter from him and a list of what he says he    owes of course there can be no difficulty in paying all    debts which he acknowledges if you think proper to do so    as far as i am able to judge at present the amount would    be between twentyfive and thirty thousand pounds i    should say nearer the former than the latter sum did    i not know that the amount in such matters always goes    on increasing you must also understand that i cannot    guarantee the correctness of this statement     but i feel myself bound in my duty to go further    than this even though it may be at the risk of your    displeasure i presume from what you tell me that you are    contemplating a marriage between george hotspur and your    daughter and i now repeat to you in the most solemn    words that i can use my assurance that the marriage is    one which you should not countenance captain hotspur is    not fit to marry your daughter   when sir harry had read so far he had become very angry but his anger was now directed against his lawyer had he not told mr boltby that he had changed his mind and what business had the lawyer to interfere with him further but he read the letter on to its bitter end      since you were in london the following facts have become    known to me on the second of last month mr george    hotspur met two men named walker and bullbean in the    lodgings of the former at about nine in the evening    and remained there during the greater part of the night    playing cards bullbean is a man well known to the police    as a cardsharper he once moved in the world as a    gentleman his trade is now to tout and find prey for    gamblers walker is a young man in a low rank of life who    had some money george hotspur on that night won between    three and four hundred pounds of walkers money and    bullbean over and above this got for himself some    considerable amount of plunder walker is now prepared    and very urgent to bring the circumstances of this case    before a magistrate having found out or been informed    that some practice of cheating was used against him and    bullbean is ready to give evidence as to george hotspurs    foul play they have hitherto been restrained by hart the    jew whom you met hart fears that were the whole thing    made public his bills would not be taken up by you     i think that i know all this to be true if you conceive    that i am acting in a manner inimical to your family you    had better come up to london and put yourself into the    hands of some other lawyer if you can still trust me i    will do the best i can for you i should recommend you to    bring captain hotspur with youif he will come     i grieve to write as i have done but it seems to me that    no sacrifice is too great to make with the object of    averting the fate to which as i fear miss hotspur is    bringing herselfmy dear sir harry hotspur i am very    faithfully yours     john boltby   it was a terrible letter gradually as he read it and reread it there came upon sir harry the feeling that he might owe that he did owe that he certainly would owe to mr boltby a very heavy debt of gratitude gradually the thin glazing of hope with which he had managed to daub over and partly to hide his own settled convictions as to his cousins character fell away and he saw the man as he had seen him during his interview with captain stubber and mr hart it must be so let the consequences be what they might his daughter must be told were she to be killed by the telling it would be better than that she should be handed over to such a man as this the misfortune which had come upon them might be the death of him and of herbut better that than the other he sat in his chair till the gong sounded through the house for prayers then he rang his bell and sent in word to lady elizabeth that she should read them in his absence when they were over word was brought that he would breakfast alone in his own room on receiving that message both his wife and daughter went to him but as yet he could tell them nothing tidings had come which would make it necessary that he should go at once to london as soon as breakfast should be over he would see george hotspur they both knew from the tone in which the name was pronounced that the tidings were of their nature bad and that they had reference to the sins of their guest  you had better read that letter he said as soon as george was in the room as he spoke his face was towards the fire and in that position he remained the letter had been in his hand and he only half turned round to give it george read the letter slowly and when he had got through it only half understanding the words but still knowing well the charge which it contained stood silent utterly conquered i suppose it is true said sir harry in a low voice facing his enemy  i did win some money said cousin george  and you cheated  oh dear nonothing of the sort  but his confession was written in his face and was heard in his voice and peeped out through every motion of his limbs he was a cur and denied the accusation in a currish manner hardly intended to create belief  he must be paid back his money said sir harry  i had promised that said cousin george  has it been your practice sir when gambling to pay back money that you have won you are a scoundrela heartless scoundrelto try and make your way into my house when i had made such liberal offers to buy your absence to this cousin george made no sort of answer the game was up and had he not already told himself that it was a game that he should never have attempted to play we will leave this house if you please both of us at eleven we will go to town together the carriage will be ready at eleven you had better see to the packing of your things with the servant  shall i not say a word of adieu to lady elizabeth  no sir you shall never speak to a female in my house again  the two were driven over to penrith together and went up to london in the same carriage sir harry paying for all expenses without a word sir harry before he left his house saw his wife for a moment but he did not see his daughter tell her said he that it must bemust be all over the decision was told to emily but she simply refused to accept it it shall not be so said she flashing out lady elizabeth endeavoured to show her that her father had done all he could to further her viewshad been ready to sacrifice to her all his own wishes and convictions  why is he so changed he has heard of some new debt of course there are debts we did not suppose that it could be done all at once and so easily she refused to be comforted and refused to believe she sat alone weeping in her own room and swore when her mother came to her that no consideration no tidings as to georges past misconduct should induce her to break her faith to the man to whom her word had been givenmy word and papas and yours said emily pleading her cause with majesty through her tears  on the day but one following there came a letter from sir harry to lady elizabeth very short but telling her the whole truth he has cheated like a common low swindler as he is with studied tricks at cards robbing a poor man altogether beneath him in station of hundreds of pounds there is no doubt about it it is uncertain even yet whether he will not be tried before a jury he hardly even denies it a creature viler more cowardly worse the mind of man cannot conceive my brokenhearted dearest best darling must be told all this tell her that i know what she will suffer tell her that i shall be as crushed by it as she but anything is better than degradation such as this tell her specially that i have not decided without absolute knowledge emily was told the letter was read to her and by her till she knew it almost by heart there came upon her a wan look of abject agony that seemed to rob her at once of her youth and beauty but even now she would not yield she did not longer affect to disbelieve the tidings but said that no man let him do what he might could be too far gone for repentance and forgiveness she would wait she had talked of waiting two years she would be content to wait ten what though he had cheated at cards had she not once told her mother that should it turn out that he had been a murderer then she would become a murderers wife she did not know that cheating at cards was worse than betting at horseraces it was all badvery bad it was the kind of life into which men were led by the fault of those who should have taught them better no she would not marry him without her fathers leave but she would never own that her engagement was broken let them affix what most opprobrious name to him they might choose to her cardsharpers seemed to be no worse than gamblers she was quite sure that christ had come to save men who cheat at cards as well as others  as sir harry and his cousin entered the london station late at nightit was past midnightsir harry bade his companion meet him the next morning at mr boltbys chambers at eleven cousin george had had ample time for meditation and had considered that it might be best for him to cut up a little rough  mr boltby is my enemy he said and i dont know what i am to get by going there  if you dont sir ill not pay one shilling for you  i have your promise sir harry  if you are not there at the time i fix i will pay nothing and the name may go to the dogs  then they both went to the station hotelnot together but the younger following the elders feetand slept for the last time in their lives under one roof  cousin george did not show himself at mr boltbys being still in his bed at the station hotel at the time named but at three oclock he was with mrs morton  for the present we will go back to sir harry he was at the lawyers chambers at the time named and mr boltby smiled when told of the summons which had been given to cousin george by this time sir harry had acknowledged his gratitude to mr boltby over and over again and mr boltby perhaps having no daughter thought that the evil had been cured he was almost inclined to be jocular and did laugh at sir harry in a mild way when told of the threat  we must pay his debts sir harry i think  i dont see it at all i would rather face everything and i told him that i would pay nothing  ah but you had told him that you would and then those cormorants have been told so also we had better build a bridge of gold for a falling enemy stick to your former proposition without any reference to a legacy and make him write the letter my clerk shall find him tomorrow  sir harry at last gave way the lucky walker received back his full money bullbeans wages of iniquity and all and sir harry returned to humblethwaite  cousin george was sitting in mrs mortons room with a very bad headache five days after his arrival in london and she was reading over a manuscript which she had just written that will do i think she said  just the thing said he without raising his head  will you copy it now george  not just now i am so seedy ill take it and do it at the club  no i will not have that the draft would certainly be left out on the club table and you would go to billiards and the letter never would be written  ill come back and do it after dinner  i shall be at the theatre then and i wont have you here in my absence rouse yourself and do it now dont be such a poor thing  thats all very well lucy but if you had a sick headache you wouldnt like to have to write a dd letter like that  then she rose up to scold him being determined that the letter should be written then and there why what a coward you are what a feckless useless creature do you think that i have never to go for hours on the stage with the gas in a blaze around me and my head ready to split and what is this a paper to write that will take you ten minutes the truth is you dont like to give up the girl could she believe it of him after knowing him so well could she think that there was so much of good in him  you say that to annoy me you know that i never cared for her  you would marry her now if they would let you  no by george ive had enough of that youre wide awake enough to understand lucy that a fellow situated as i am over head and ears in debt and heir to an old title should struggle to keep the things together families and names dont matter much i suppose but after all one does care for them but ive had enough of that as for cousin emily you know lucy i never loved any woman but you in my life  he was a brute unredeemed by any one manly gift idle selfindulgent false and without a principle she was a woman greatly gifted with many virtues capable of selfsacrifice industrious affectionate and loving truth if not always true herself and yet such a word as that from this brute sufficed to please her for the moment she got up and kissed his forehead and dropped for him some strong spirit in a glass which she mixed with water and cooled his brow with eaudecologne try to write it dearest it should be written at once if it is to be written then he turned himself wearily to her writingdesk and copied the words which she had prepared for him  the letter was addressed to mr boltby and purported to be a renunciation of all claim to miss hotspurs hand on the understanding that his debts were paid for him to the extent of £25000 and that an allowance were made to him of £500 a year settled on him as an annuity for life as long as he should live out of england mr boltby had given him to understand that this clause would not be exacted unless circumstances should arise which should make sir harry think it imperative upon him to demand its execution the discretion must be left absolute with sir harry but as mr boltby said captain hotspur could trust sir harrys word and his honour  if im to be made to go abroad what the devil are you to do he had said to mrs morton  there need be no circumstances said mrs morton to make it necessary  of course captain hotspur accepted the terms on her advice he had obeyed lady altringham and had tried to obey emily and would now obey mrs morton because mrs morton was the nearest to him  the letter which he copied was a wellwritten letter put together with much taste so that the ignoble compact to which it gave assent should seem to be as little ignoble as might be possible i entered into the arrangement the letter said in its last paragraph because i thought it right to endeavour to keep the property and the title together but i am aware now that my position in regard to my debts was of a nature that should have deterred me from the attempt as i have failed i sincerely hope that my cousin may be made happy by some such splendid alliance as she is fully entitled to expect he did not understand all that the words conveyed but yet he questioned them he did not perceive that they were intended to imply that the writer had never for a moment loved the girl whom he had proposed to marry nevertheless they did convey to him dimly some idea that they might givenot pain for as to that he would have been indifferentbut offence will there be any good in all that he asked  certainly said she you dont mean to whine and talk of your broken heart  oh dear no nothing of that sort  this is the manly way to put it regarding the matter simply as an affair of business  i believe it is said he and then having picked himself up somewhat by the aid of a glass of sherry he continued to copy the letter and to direct it  i will keep the rough draft said mrs morton  and i must go now i suppose he said  you can stay here and see me eat my dinner if you like i shall not ask you to share it because it consists of two small mutton chops and one wouldnt keep me up through lady teazle  ive a good mind to come and see you said he  then youd better go and eat your own dinner at once  i dont care about my dinner i should have a bit of supper afterwards  then she preached to him a sermon not quite such a one as emily hotspur had preached but much more practical and with less reticence if he went on living as he was living now he would come to grief he was drinking every day and would some day find that he could not do so with impunity did he know what delirium tremens was did he want to go to the devil altogether had he any hope as to his future life  yes said he i hope to make you my wife she tossed her head and told him that with all the will in the world to sacrifice herself such sacrifice could do him no good if he persisted in making himself a drunkard but i have been so tried these last two months if you only knew what mr boltby and captain stubber and sir harry and mr hart were altogether oh my g but he did not say a word about messrs walker and bullbean the poor woman who was helping him knew nothing of walker and bullbean let us hope that she may remain in that ignorance  cousin george before he left her swore that he would amend his mode of life but he did not go to see lady teazle that night there were plenty of men now back in town ready to play pool at the club     chapter xxiii  i shall never be married   sir harry hotspur returned to humblethwaite before cousin georges letter was written though when he did return all the terms had been arranged and a portion of the money paid perhaps it would have been better that he should have waited and taken the letter with him in his pocket but in truth he was so wretched that he could not wait the thing was fixed and done and he could but hurry home to hide his face among his own people he felt that the glory of his house was gone from him he would sit by the hour together thinking of the boy who had died he had almost on occasions allowed himself to forget his boy while hoping that his name and wide domains might be kept together by the girl that was left to him he was beginning to understand now that she was already but little better than a wreck indeed was not everything shipwreck around him was he not going to pieces on the rocks did not the lesson of every hour seem to tell him that throughout his long life he had thought too much of his house and his name  it would have been better that he should have waited till the letter was in his pocket before he returned home because when he reached humblethwaite the last argument was wanting to him to prove to emily that her hope was vain even after his arrival when the full story was told to her she held out in her resolve she accepted the truth of that scene at walkers rooms she acknowledged that her lover had cheated the wretched man at cards after that all other iniquities were of course as nothing there was a completeness in that of which she did not fail to accept and to use the benefit when she had once taken it as true that her lover had robbed his inferior by foul play at cards there could be no good in alluding to this or that lie in counting up this or that disreputable debt in alluding to habits of brandydrinking or even in soiling her pure mind with any word as to mrs morton it was granted that he was as vile as sin could make him had not her saviour come exactly for such as this one because of his great love for those who were vile and should not her human love for one enable her to do that which his great heavenly love did always for all men every reader will know how easily answerable was the argument most readers will also know how hard it is to win by attacking the reason when the heart is the fortress that is in question she had accepted his guilt and why tell her of it any further did she not pine over his guilt and weep for it day and night and pray that he might yet be made white as snow but guilty as he was a poor piece of broken vilest clay without the properties even which are useful to the potter he was as dear to her as when she had leaned against him believing him to be a pillar of gold set about with onyx stones jaspers and rubies there was but one sin on his part which could divide them if indeed he should cease to love her then there would be an end to it it would have been better that sir harry should have remained in london till he could have returned with georges autograph letter in his pocket  you must have the letter in his own handwriting mr boltby had said cunningly only you must return it to me  sir harry had understood and had promised that the letter should be returned when it had been used for the cruel purpose for which it was to be sent to humblethwaite for all sir harrys own purposes mr boltbys statements would have quite sufficed  she was told that her lover would renounce her but she would not believe what she was told of course he would accept the payment of his debts of course he would take an income when offered to him what else was he to do how was he to live decently without an income all these evils had happened to him because he had been expected to live as a gentleman without proper means in fact he was the person who had been most injured her father in his complete in his almost abject tenderness towards her could not say rough words in answer to all these arguments he could only repeat his assertion over and over again that the man was utterly unworthy of her and must be discarded it was all as nothing the man must discard himself  he is false as hell said sir harry  and am i to be as false as hell also will you love me better when i have consented to be untrue and even that would be a lie i do love him i must love him i may be more wicked than he is because i do so but i do  poor lady elizabeth in these days was worse than useless her daughter was so strong that her weakness was as the weakness of water she was driven hither and thither in a way that she herself felt to be disgraceful when her husband told her that the cousin as matter of course could never be seen again she assented when emily implored her to act as mediator with her father on behalf of the wicked cousin she again assented and then when she was alone with sir harry she did not dare to do as she had promised  i do think it will kill her she said to sir harry  we must all die but we need not die disgraced he said  it was a most solemn answer and told the thoughts which had been dwelling in his mind his son had gone from him and now it might be that his daughter must go too because she could not survive the disappointment of her young love he had learned to think that it might be so as he looked at her great grave eyes and her pale cheeks and her sorrowladen mouth it might be so but better that for them all than that she should be contaminated by the touch of a thing so vile as this cousin she was pure as snow clear as a star lovely as the opening rosebud as she was let her go to her graveif it need be so for himself he could die tooor even live if it were required of him other fathers since jephtha and agamemnon have recognised it as true that heaven has demanded from them their daughters  the letter came and was read and reread by sir harry before he showed it to his child he took it also to his wife and explained it to her in all its points it has more craft said he than i gave him credit for  i dont suppose he ever cared for her said lady elizabeth  nor for any human being that ever livedsave himself i wonder whether he got boltby to write it for him  surely mr boltby wouldnt have done that  i dont know i think he would do anything to rid us from what he believed to have been our danger i dont think it was in george hotspur to write such a letter out of his own head  but does it signify  not in the least it is his own handwriting and his signature whoever formed the words it is the same thing it was needed only to prove to her that he had not even the merit of being true to her  for a while sir harry thought that he would entrust to his wife the duty of showing the letter to emily he would so willingly have escaped the task himself but as he considered the matter he feared that lady elizabeth might lack the firmness to explain the matter fully to the poor girl the daughter would be so much stronger than the mother and thus the thing that must be done would not be effected at last on the evening of the day on which the letter had reached him he sent for her and read it to her she heard it without a word then he put it into her hands and she read the sentences herself slowly one after another endeavouring as she did so to find arguments by which she might stave off the conclusion to which she knew that her father would attempt to bring her  it must be all over now said he at last  she did not answer him but gazed into his face with such a look of woe that his heart was melted she had found no argument there had not been in the whole letter one word of love for her  my darling will it not be better that we should meet the blow  i have met it all along some day perhaps he might be different  in what way dearest he does not even profess to hope so himself  that gentleman in london papa would have paid nothing for him unless he wrote like this he had to do it papa you had better just leave me to myself i will not trouble you by mentioning his name  but emily  well papa  mamma and i cannot bear that you should suffer alone  i must suffer and silence is the easiest i will go now and think about it dear papa i know that you have always done everything for the best  he did not see her again that evening her mother was with her in her own room and of course they were talking about cousin george for hours together it could not be avoided in spite of what emily had herself said of the expediency of silence but she did not once allude to the possibility of a future marriage as the man was so dear to her and as he bore their name and as he must inherit her fathers title could not some almost superhuman exertion be made for his salvation surely so much as that might be done if they all made it the work of their lives  it must be the work of my life mamma she said  lady elizabeth forbore from telling her that there was no side on which she could approach him the poor girl herself however must have felt that it was so as she thought of it all she reminded herself that though they were separated miles asunder still she could pray for him we need not doubt this at leastthat to him who utters them prayers of intercession are of avail  on the following morning she was at breakfast and both her father and mother remarked that something had been changed in her dress the father only knew that it was so but the mother could have told of every ribbon that had been dropped and every ornament that had been laid aside emily hotspur had lived a while if not among the gayest of the gay at least among the brightest of the bright in outside garniture and having been asked to consult no questions of expense had taught herself to dress as do the gay and bright and rich even when george had come on his last wretched visit to humblethwaite when she had known that he had been brought there as a blackamoor perhaps just capable of being washed white she had not thought it necessary to lessen the gauds of her attire though she was saddened in her joy by the knowledge of the mans faults she was still the rich daughter of a very wealthy man and engaged to marry the future inheritor of all that wealth and riches there was then no reason why she should lower her flag one inch before the world but now all was changed with her during the night she had thought of her apparel and of what use it might be during her future life she would never more go bright again unless some miracle might prevail and he still might be to her that which she had painted him neither father nor mother as she kissed them both said a word as to her appearance they must take her away from humblethwaite change the scene try to interest her in new pursuits that was what they had determined to attempt for the present they would let her put on what clothes she pleased and make no remark  early in the day she went out by herself it was now december but the weather was fine and dry and she was for two hours alone rambling through the park she had made her attempt in life and had failed she owned her failure to herself absolutely the image had no gold in itnone as yet but it was not as other images which as they are made so must they remain to the end the divine spirit which might from the first have breathed into this clay some particle of its own worth was still efficacious to bestow the gift prayer should not be wanting but the thing as it now was she saw in all its impurity he had never loved her had he loved her he would not have written words such as those she had read he had pretended to love her in order that he might have money that his debts might be paid that he might not be ruined he hoped he said in his letter he hoped that his cousin might be made happy by a splendid alliance she remembered well the abominable heartless words and this was the man who had pledged her to truth and firmness and whose own truth and firmness she had never doubted for a moment even when acknowledging to herself the necessity of her pledge to him he had never loved her and though she did not say so did not think so she felt that of all his sins that sin was the one which could not be forgiven  what should she now do with herselfhow bear herself at this present moment of her life she did not tell herself now that she would die though as she looked forward into life all was so dreary to her that she would fain have known that death would give an escape but there were duties for her still to do during that winter ramble she owned to herself for the first time that her father had been right in his judgment respecting their cousin and that she by her pertinacity had driven her father on till on her account he had been forced into conduct which was distasteful to him she must own to her father that he had been right that the man though she dearly loved him still was of such nature that it would be quite unfit that she should marry him there might still be the miracle her prayers were still her own to give of them she would say nothing to her father she would simply confess to him that he had been right and then beg of him to pardon her the trouble she had caused him  papa she said to him the following morning may i come to you she came in and on this occasion sat down at his right hand of course you have been right papa she said  we have both been right dearest i hope  no papa i have been wrong i thought i knew him and i did not i thought when you told me that he was so bad that you were believing false people and papa i know now that i should not have loved him as i didso quickly like that  nobody has blamed you for a moment nobody has thought of blaming you  i blame myself enough i can tell you that i feel as though i had in a way destroyed myself  do not say that my darling  you will let me speak now will you not papa i wish to tell you everything that you may understand all that i feel i shall never get over it  you will dearest you will indeed  never perhaps i shall live on but i feel that it has killed me for this world i dont know how a girl is to get over it when she has said that she has loved any one if they are married then she does not want to get over it but if they are notif he deserts her or is unworthy or bothwhat can she do then but just go on thinking of it tillshe dies  sir harry used with her all the old accustomed arguments to drive such thoughts out of her head he told her how good was god to his creatures and specially how good in curing by the soft hand of time such wounds as those from which she was suffering she should retrick her beams and once more flame in the forehead of the morning sky if only she would help the work of time by her own endeavours fight against the feeling emily and try to conquer it and it will be conquered  but papa i do not wish to conquer it i should not tell you of all this only for one thing  what thing dearest  i am not like other girls who can just leave themselves alone and be of no trouble you told me that if i outlived you  the property will be yours certainly of course it was my hopeand isthat all that shall be settled by your marriage before my death the trouble and labour is more than a woman should be called on to support alone  just so and it is because you are thinking of all this that i feel it right to tell you papa i shall never be married  we will leave that for the present emily  very well only if it would make a change in your will you should make it you will have to be here papa after i am goneprobably  no no no  but if it were not so i should not know what to do that is all papa only thisthat i beg your pardon for all the trouble i have caused you then she knelt before him and he kissed her head and blessed her and wept over her  there was nothing more heard from cousin george at humblethwaite and nothing more heard of him for a long time mr boltby did pay his debts having some terribly hard struggles with mr hart and captain stubber before the liquidations were satisfactorily effected it was very hard to make mr hart and captain stubber understand that the baronet was paying these debts simply because he had said that he would pay them once before under other circumstances and that no other cause for their actual payment now existed but the debts were paid down to the last farthing of which mr boltby could have credible tidings pay everything sir harry had said i have promised it whereby he was alluding to the promise which he had made to his daughter everything was paid and cousin george was able to walk in and out of his club a free manand at times almost happywith an annuity of five hundred pounds a year nothing more was said to him as to the necessity of expatriation     chapter xxiv  the end   among playgoing folk in the following april there was a great deal of talk about the marriage of that very favourite actress mrs morton she appeared in the playbills as mrs george hotspur late mrs morton very many spoke of her familiarly who knew her only on the stageas is the custom of men in speaking of actressesand perhaps some few of these who spoke of her did know her personally poor lucy said one middleaged gentleman over fifty who spent four nights of every week at one theatre or another when she was little more than a child they married her to that reprobate morton since that she has managed to keep her head above water by hard work and now she has gone and married another worse than the first  she is older now and will be able to manage george said another  manage him if anybody can manage to keep him out of debt or from drink either ill eat him  but he must be sir george when old sir harry dies said he who was defending the prudence of the marriage  yes and wont have a penny will it help her to be able to put lady hotspur on the bills not in the least and the women cant forgive her and visit her she has not been good enough for that a grand old family has been disgraced and a good actress destroyed thats my idea of this marriage  i thought georgy was going to marry his cousinthat awfully proud minx said one young fellow  when it came to the scratch she would not have him said another but there had been promises and so to make it all square sir harry paid his debts  i dont believe a bit about his debts being paid said the middleaged gentleman who was fond of going to the theatre  yes george hotspur was married and as far as any love went with him had married the woman he liked best though the actress was worlds too good for him there was not about her that air of cleanliness and almost severe purity which had so distressed him while he had been forced to move in the atmosphere of his cousin after the copying of the letter and the settlement of the bills mrs morton had found no difficulty in arranging matters as she pleased she had known the man perhaps better than any one else had known him and yet she thought it best to marry him we must not inquire into her motives though we may pity her fate  she did not intend however to yield herself as an easy prey to his selfishness she had also her ideas of reforming him and ideas which as they were much less grand might possibly be more serviceable than those which for a while had filled the mind and heart of emily hotspur george she said one day to him what do you mean to do this was before the marriage was fixedwhen nothing more was fixed than that idea of marriage which had long existed between them  of course we shall be spliced now said he  and if so what then i shall keep to the stage of course  we couldnt do with the £500 a year i suppose any how  not very well im afraid seeing that as a habit you eat and drink more than that yourself but with all that i can do there must be a change i tell you for your own sake as well as for mine unless you can drop drinking we had better give it up even yet after that for a month or two under her auspices he did drop itor at least so far dropped it as to induce her to run the risk in april they were married and she must be added to the list of women who have sacrificed themselves on behalf of men whom they have known to be worthless we need not pursue his career further but we may be sure that though she watched him very closely and used a power over him of which he was afraid still he went gradually from bad to worse and was found at last to be utterly past redemption he was one who in early life had never known what it was to take delight in postponing himself to another and now there was no spark in him of love or gratitude by which fire could be kindled or warmth created it had come to that with himthat to eat and to drink was all that was left to him and it was coming to that too that the latter of these two pleasant recreations would soon be all that he had within his power of enjoyment there are such men and of all human beings they are the most to be pitied they have intellects they do think the hours with them are terribly longand they have no hope  the hotspurs of humblethwaite remained at home till christmas was passed and then at once started for rome sir harry and lady elizabeth both felt that it must be infinitely better for their girl to be away and then there came the doctors slow advice there was nothing radically amiss with miss hotspur the doctor said but it would be better for her to be taken elsewhere she knowing how her father loved his home and the people around him begged that she might be allowed to stay nothing ailed her she said save only that ache at the heart which no journey to rome could cure whats the use of it papa she said you are unhappy because im altered would you wish me not to be altered after what has passed of course i am altered let us take it as it is and not think about it she had adopted certain practices in life however which sir harry was determined to check at any rate for the time she spent her days among the poor and when not with them she was at church and there was always some dreary book in her hands when they were together in the drawingroom after dinner of churchgoing and visiting the poor and of good books sir harry approved thoroughly but even of good things such as these there may be too much so sir harry and lady elizabeth got a courier who spoke all languages and a footman who spoke german and two maids of whom one pretended to speak french and had trunks packed without number and started for rome all that wealth could do was done but let the horseman be ever so rich or the horsemans daughter and the stud be ever so good it is seldom they can ride fast enough to shake off their cares  in rome they remained till april and while they were there the name of cousin george was never once mentioned in the hearing of sir harry between the mother and daughter no doubt there was speech concerning him but to emilys mind he was always present he was to her as a thing abominable and yet necessarily tied to her by bonds which she could never burst asunder she felt like some poor princess in a tale married to an ogre from whom there was no escape she had given herself up to one utterly worthless and she knew it but yet she had given herself and could not revoke the gift there was indeed still left to her that possibility of a miracle but of that she whispered nothing even to her mother if there were to be a miracle it must be of god and at gods throne she made her whispers in these days she was taken about from sight to sight with apparent willingness she saw churches pictures statues and ruins and seemed to take an interest in them she was introduced to the pope and allowed herself to be apparelled in her very best for that august occasion but nevertheless the tenor of her way and the fashions of her life as was her daily dress were grey and sad and solemn she lived as one who knew that the backbone of her life was broken early in april they left rome and went north to the italian lakes and settled themselves for a while at lugano and here the news reached them of the marriage of george hotspur  lady elizabeth read the marriage among the advertisements in the times and at once took it to sir harry withdrawing the paper from the room in a manner which made emily sure that there was something in it which she was not intended to see but sir harry thought that the news should be told to her and he himself told it  already married she said and who is the lady  you had better not ask my dear  why not ask i may at any rate know her name  mrs morton she was a widowand an actress  oh yes i know said emily blushing for in those days in which it had been sought to wean her from george hotspur a word or two about this lady had been said to her by lady elizabeth under the instructions of sir harry and there was no more said on that occasion on that day and on the following her father observed no change in her and the mother spoke nothing of her fears but on the next morning lady elizabeth said that she was not as she had been she is thinking of him stillalways she whispered to her husband he made no reply but sat alone out in the garden with his newspaper before him reading nothing but cursing that cousin of his in his heart  there could be no miracle now for her even the thought of that was gone the man who had made her believe that he loved her only in the last autumnthough indeed it seemed to her that years had rolled over since and made her old wornout and wearywho had asked for and obtained the one gift she had to give the bestowal of her very self who had made her in her baby folly believe that he was almost divine whereas he was hardly human in his lownessthis man whom she still loved in a way which she could not herself understand loving and despising him utterly at the same timewas now the husband of another woman even he she had felt would have thought something of her but she had been nothing to him but the means of escape from disreputable difficulties she could not sustain her contempt for herself as she remembered this and yet she showed but little of it in her outward manner  ill go when you like papa she said when the days of may had come but id sooner stay here a little longer if you wouldnt mind there was no talk of going home it was only a question whether they should go further north to lucerne before the warm weather came  of course we will remain why not said sir harry mamma and i like lugano amazingly poor sir harry as though he could have liked any place except humblethwaite  our story is over now they did remain till the scorching july sun had passed over their heads and august was upon them and thenthey had buried her in the small protestant cemetery at lugano and sir harry hotspur was without a child and without an heir  he returned home in the early autumn a grey wornout tottering old man with large eyes full of sorrow and a thin mouth that was seldom opened to utter a word in these days i think he recurred to his early sorrow and thought almost more of his son than of his daughter but he had instant pressing energy left to him for one deed were he to die now without a further will humblethwaite and scarrowby would go to the wretch who had destroyed him what was the title to him now or even the name his wifes nephew was an earl with an enormous rentroll something so large that humblethwaite and scarrowby to him would be little more than additional labour but to this young man humblethwaite and scarrowby were left and the glories of the house of hotspur were at an end  and so the story of the house of humblethwaite has been told    london r clay sons and taylor printers bread street hill
