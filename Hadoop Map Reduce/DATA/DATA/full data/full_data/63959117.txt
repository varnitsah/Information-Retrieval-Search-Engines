note  the purpose of the added matter in this edition of the waverley novelsa reprint of the magnum opus of 18291832is to give to the stories their historical setting by stating the circumstances in which they were composed and made their first appearance  sir walters own delightful introductions written hastily as lockhart says and with a failing memory have occasionally been corrected by lockhart himself his life of scott must always be our first and best source but fragments of information may be gleaned from sir walters unpublished correspondence  the editor owes to the kindness of mrs maxwell scott permission to examine the twentyfour large volumes of letters to sir walter and some other manuscripts which are preserved at abbotsford these yield but little of contemporary criticism or remark as is natural for scott shared his secret with few and most topics were more grateful to him than his own writings lockhart left little for his successors to do and the more any one studies the abbotsford manuscripts the more must he admire the industry and tact of scotts biographer  the editor has also put together some examples of contemporary published criticism which it is now not uninteresting to glance over in selecting these he has been aided by the kindness of mrs ogilbie from the abbotsford manuscripts and other sources he has added notes on points which have become obscure by lapse of time he has especially to thank for their courteous and ready assistance lady napier and ettrick who lent him sir walters letters to her kinswoman the marchioness of abercorn mr david douglas the editor and publisher of scotts journal who has generously given the help of his antiquarian knowledge and mr david macritchie who permitted him to use the corrected proofs of redgauntlet  andrew lang     advertisement to the waverley novels  it has been the occasional occupation of the author of waverley for several years past to revise and correct the voluminous series of novels which pass under that name in order that if they should ever appear as his avowed productions he might render them in some degree deserving of a continuance of the public favour with which they have been honoured ever since their first appearance for a long period however it seemed likely that the improved and illustrated edition which he meditated would be a posthumous publication but the course of the events which occasioned the disclosure of the authors name having in a great measure restored to him a sort of parental control over these works he is naturally induced to give them to the press in a corrected and he hopes an improved form while life and health permit the task of revising and illustrating them such being his purpose it is necessary to say a few words on the plan of the proposed edition  in stating it to be revised and corrected it is not to be inferred that any attempt is made to alter the tenor of the stories the character of the actors or the spirit of the dialogue there is no doubt ample room for emendation in all these pointsbut where the tree falls it must lie any attempt to obviate criticism however just by altering a work already in the hands of the public is generally unsuccessful in the most improbable fiction the reader still desires some air of vraisemblance and does not relish that the incidents of a tale familiar to him should be altered to suit the taste of critics or the caprice of the author himself this process of feeling is so natural that it may be observed even in children who cannot endure that a nursery story should be repeated to them differently from the manner in which it was first told  but without altering in the slightest degree either the story or the mode of telling it the author has taken this opportunity to correct errors of the press and slips of the pen that such should exist cannot be wondered at when it is considered that the publishers found it their interest to hurry through the press a succession of the early editions of the various novels and that the author had not the usual opportunity of revision it is hoped that the present edition will be found free from errors of that accidental kind  the author has also ventured to make some emendations of a different character which without being such apparent deviations from the original stories as to disturb the readers old associations will he thinks add something to the spirit of the dialogue narrative or description these consist in occasional pruning where the language is redundant compression where the style is loose infusion of vigour where it is languid the exchange of less forcible for more appropriate epithetsslight alterations in short like the last touches of an artist which contribute to heighten and finish the picture though an inexperienced eye can hardly detect in what they consist  the general preface to the new edition and the introductory notices to each separate work will contain an account of such circumstances attending the first publication of the novels and tales as may appear interesting in themselves or proper to be communicated to the public the author also proposes to publish on this occasion the various legends family traditions or obscure historical facts which have formed the groundwork of these novels and to give some account of the places where the scenes are laid when these are altogether or in part real as well as a statement of particular incidents founded on fact together with a more copious glossary and notes explanatory of the ancient customs and popular superstitions referred to in the romances  upon the whole it is hoped that the waverley novels in their new dress will not be found to have lost any part of their attractions in consequence of receiving illustrations by the author and undergoing his careful revision  abbotsford january 1829     general preface to the waverley novels  and must i ravel out my weavedup follies richard ii act iv  having undertaken to give an introductory account of the compositions which are here offered to the public with notes and illustrations the author under whose name they are now for the first time collected feels that he has the delicate task of speaking more of himself and his personal concerns than may perhaps be either graceful or prudent in this particular he runs the risk of presenting himself to the public in the relation that the dumb wife in the jestbook held to her husband when having spent half of his fortune to obtain the cure of her imperfection he was willing to have bestowed the other half to restore her to her former condition but this is a risk inseparable from the task which the author has undertaken and he can only promise to be as little of an egotist as the situation will permit it is perhaps an indifferent sign of a disposition to keep his word that having introduced himself in the third person singular he proceeds in the second paragraph to make use of the first but it appears to him that the seeming modesty connected with the former mode of writing is overbalanced by the inconvenience of stiffness and affectation which attends it during a narrative of some length and which may be observed less or more in every work in which the third person is used from the commentaries of caesar to the autobiography of alexander the corrector  i must refer to a very early period of my life were i to point out my first achievements as a taleteller but i believe some of my old schoolfellows can still bear witness that i had a distinguished character for that talent at a time when the applause of my companions was my recompense for the disgraces and punishments which the future romancewriter incurred for being idle himself and keeping others idle during hours that should have been employed on our tasks the chief enjoyment of my holidays was to escape with a chosen friend who had the same taste with myself and alternately to recite to each other such wild adventures as we were able to devise we told each in turn interminable tales of knighterrantry and battles and enchantments which were continued from one day to another as opportunity offered without our ever thinking of bringing them to a conclusion as we observed a strict secrecy on the subject of this intercourse it acquired all the character of a concealed pleasure and we used to select for the scenes of our indulgence long walks through the solitary and romantic environs of arthurs seat salisbury crags braid hills and similar places in the vicinity of edinburgh and the recollection of those holidays still forms an oasis in the pilgrimage which i have to look back upon i have only to add that my friend still lives a prosperous gentleman but too much occupied with graver business to thank me for indicating him more plainly as a confidant of my childish mystery  when boyhood advancing into youth required more serious studies and graver cares a long illness threw me back on the kingdom of fiction as if it were by a species of fatality my indisposition arose in part at least from my having broken a bloodvessel and motion and speech were for a long time pronounced positively dangerous for several weeks i was confined strictly to my bed during which time i was not allowed to speak above a whisper to eat more than a spoonful or two of boiled rice or to have more covering than one thin counterpane when the reader is informed that i was at this time a growing youth with the spirits appetite and impatience of fifteen and suffered of course greatly under this severe regimen which the repeated return of my disorder rendered indispensable he will not be surprised that i was abandoned to my own discretion so far as reading my almost sole amusement was concerned and still less so that i abused the indulgence which left my time so much at my own disposal  there was at this time a circulating library in edinburgh founded i believe by the celebrated allan ramsay which besides containing a most respectable collection of books of every description was as might have been expected peculiarly rich in works of fiction it exhibited specimens of every kind from the romances of chivalry and the ponderous folios of cyrus and cassandra down to the most approved works of later times i was plunged into this great ocean of reading without compass or pilot and unless when some one had the charity to play at chess with me i was allowed to do nothing save read from morning to night i was in kindness and pity which was perhaps erroneous however natural permitted to select my subjects of study at my own pleasure upon the same principle that the humours of children are indulged to keep them out of mischief as my taste and appetite were gratified in nothing else i indemnified myself by becoming a glutton of books accordingly i believe i read almost all the romances old plays and epic poetry in that formidable collection and no doubt was unconsciously amassing materials for the task in which it has been my lot to be so much employed  at the same time i did not in all respects abuse the license permitted me familiar acquaintance with the specious miracles of fiction brought with it some degree of satiety and i began by degrees to seek in histories memoirs voyages and travels and the like events nearly as wonderful as those which were the work of imagination with the additional advantage that they were at least in a great measure true the lapse of nearly two years during which i was left to the exercise of my own free will was followed by a temporary residence in the country where i was again very lonely but for the amusement which i derived from a good though oldfashioned library the vague and wild use which i made of this advantage i cannot describe better than by referring my reader to the desultory studies of waverley in a similar situation the passages concerning whose course of reading were imitated from recollections of my own it must be understood that the resemblance extends no farther  time as it glided on brought the blessings of confirmed health and personal strength to a degree which had never been expected or hoped for the severe studies necessary to render me fit for my profession occupied the greater part of my time and the society of my friends and companions who were about to enter life along with me filled up the interval with the usual amusements of young men i was in a situation which rendered serious labour indispensable for neither possessing on the one hand any of those peculiar advantages which are supposed to favour a hasty advance in the profession of the law nor being on the other hand exposed to unusual obstacles to interrupt my progress i might reasonably expect to succeed according to the greater or less degree of trouble which i should take to qualify myself as a pleader  it makes no part of the present story to detail how the success of a few ballads had the effect of changing all the purpose and tenor of my life and of converting a painstaking lawyer of some years standing into a follower of literature it is enough to say that i had assumed the latter character for several years before i seriously thought of attempting a work of imagination in prose although one or two of my poetical attempts did not differ from romances otherwise than by being written in verse but yet i may observe that about this time now alas thirty years since i had nourished the ambitious desire of composing a tale of chivalry which was to be in the style of the castle of otranto with plenty of border characters and supernatural incident having found unexpectedly a chapter of this intended work among some old papers i have subjoined it to this introductory essay thinking some readers may account as curious the first attempts at romantic composition by an author who has since written so much in that department footnote see appendix no i and those who complain not unreasonably of the profusion of the tales which have followed waverley may bless their stars at the narrow escape they have made by the commencement of the inundation which had so nearly taken place in the first year of the century being postponed for fifteen years later  this particular subject was never resumed but i did not abandon the idea of fictitious composition in prose though i determined to give another turn to the style of the work  my early recollections of the highland scenery and customs made so favourable an impression in the poem called the lady of the lake that i was induced to think of attempting something of the same kind in prose i had been a good deal in the highlands at a time when they were much less accessible and much less visited than they have been of late years and was acquainted with many of the old warriors of 1745 who were like most veterans easily induced to fight their battles over again for the benefit of a willing listener like myself it naturally occurred to me that the ancient traditions and high spirit of a people who living in a civilised age and country retained so strong a tincture of manners belonging to an early period of society must afford a subject favourable for romance if it should not prove a curious tale marred in the telling  it was with some idea of this kind that about the year 1805 i threw together about onethird part of the first volume of waverley it was advertised to be published by the late mr john ballantyne bookseller in edinburgh under the name of waverley or tis fifty years sincea title afterwards altered to tis sixty years since that the actual date of publication might be made to correspond with the period in which the scene was laid having proceeded as far i think as the seventh chapter i showed my work to a critical friend whose opinion was unfavourable and having then some poetical reputation i was unwilling to risk the loss of it by attempting a new style of composition i therefore threw aside the work i had commenced without either reluctance or remonstrance i ought to add that though my ingenious friends sentence was afterwards reversed on an appeal to the public it cannot be considered as any imputation on his good taste for the specimen subjected to his criticism did not extend beyond the departure of the hero for scotland and consequently had not entered upon the part of the story which was finally found most interesting  be that as it may this portion of the manuscript was laid aside in the drawers of an old writingdesk which on my first coming to reside at abbotsford in 1811 was placed in a lumber garret and entirely forgotten thus though i sometimes among other literary avocations turned my thoughts to the continuation of the romance which i had commenced yet as i could not find what i had already written after searching such repositories as were within my reach and was too indolent to attempt to write it anew from memory i as often laid aside all thoughts of that nature  two circumstances in particular recalled my recollection of the mislaid manuscript the first was the extended and wellmerited fame of miss edgeworth whose irish characters have gone so far to make the english familiar with the character of their gay and kindhearted neighbours of ireland that she may be truly said to have done more towards completing the union than perhaps all the legislative enactments by which it has been followed up  without being so presumptuous as to hope to emulate the rich humour pathetic tenderness and admirable tact which pervade the works of my accomplished friend i felt that something might be attempted for my own country of the same kind with that which miss edgeworth so fortunately achieved for irelandsomething which might introduce her natives to those of the sister kingdom in a more favourable light than they had been placed hitherto and tend to procure sympathy for their virtues and indulgence for their foibles i thought also that much of what i wanted in talent might be made up by the intimate acquaintance with the subject which i could lay claim to possess as having travelled through most parts of scotland both highland and lowland having been familiar with the elder as well as more modern race and having had from my infancy free and unrestrained communication with all ranks of my countrymen from the scottish peer to the scottish ploughman such ideas often occurred to me and constituted an ambitious branch of my theory however far short i may have fallen of it in practice  but it was not only the triumphs of miss edgeworth which worked in me emulation and disturbed my indolence i chanced actually to engage in a work which formed a sort of essay piece and gave me hope that i might in time become free of the craft of romancewriting and be esteemed a tolerable workman  in the year 180708 i undertook at the request of john murray esq of albemarle street to arrange for publication some posthumous productions of the late mr joseph strutt distinguished as an artist and an antiquary amongst which was an unfinished romance entitled queenhoo hall the scene of the tale was laid in the reign of henry vi and the work was written to illustrate the manners customs and language of the people of england during that period the extensive acquaintance which mr strutt had acquired with such subjects in compiling his laborious horda angelcynnan his regal and ecclesiastical antiquities and his essay on the sports and pastimes of the people of england had rendered him familiar with all the antiquarian lore necessary for the purpose of composing the projected romance and although the manuscript bore the marks of hurry and incoherence natural to the first rough draught of the author it evinced in my opinion considerable powers of imagination  as the work was unfinished i deemed it my duty as editor to supply such a hasty and inartificial conclusion as could be shaped out from the story of which mr strutt had laid the foundation this concluding chapter footnote see appendix no ii is also added to the present introduction for the reason already mentioned regarding the preceding fragment it was a step in my advance towards romantic composition and to preserve the traces of these is in a great measure the object of this essay  queenhoo hall was not however very successful i thought i was aware of the reason and supposed that by rendering his language too ancient and displaying his antiquarian knowledge too liberally the ingenious author had raised up an obstacle to his own success every work designed for mere amusement must be expressed in language easily comprehended and when as is sometimes the case in queenhoo hall the author addresses himself exclusively to the antiquary he must be content to be dismissed by the general reader with the criticism of mungo in the padlock on the mauritanian music what signifies me hear if me no understand  i conceived it possible to avoid this error and by rendering a similar work more light and obvious to general comprehension to escape the rock on which my predecessor was shipwrecked  but i was on the other hand so far discouraged by the indifferent reception of mr strutts romance as to become satisfied that the manners of the middle ages did not possess the interest which i had conceived and was led to form the opinion that a romance founded on a highland story and more modern events would have a better chance of popularity than a tale of chivalry  my thoughts therefore returned more than once to the tale which i had actually commenced and accident at length threw the lost sheets in my way  i happened to want some fishingtackle for the use of a guest when it occurred to me to search the old writingdesk already mentioned in which i used to keep articles of that nature  i got access to it with some difficulty and in looking for lines and flies the longlost manuscript presented itself  i immediately set to work to complete it according to my original purpose  and here i must frankly confess that the mode in which i conducted the story scarcely deserved the success which the romance afterwards attained  the tale of waverley was put together with so little care that i cannot boast of having sketched any distinct plan of the work the whole adventures of waverley in his movements up and down the country with the highland cateran bean lean are managed without much skill it suited best however the road i wanted to travel and permitted me to introduce some descriptions of scenery and manners to which the reality gave an interest which the powers of the author might have otherwise failed to attain for them and though i have been in other instances a sinner in this sort i do not recollect any of these novels in which i have transgressed so widely as in the first of the series  among other unfounded reports it has been said that the copyright of waverley was during the books progress through the press offered for sale to various booksellers in london at a very inconsiderable price this was not the case messrs constable and cadell who published the work were the only persons acquainted with the contents of the publication and they offered a large sum for it while in the course of printing which however was declined the author not choosing to part with the copyright  the origin of the story of waverley and the particular facts on which it is founded are given in the separate introduction prefixed to that romance in this edition and require no notice in this place  waverley was published in 1814 and as the titlepage was without the name of the author the work was left to win its way in the world without any of the usual recommendations its progress was for some time slow but after the first two or three months its popularity had increased in a degree which must have satisfied the expectations of the author had these been far more sanguine than he ever entertained  great anxiety was expressed to learn the name of the author but on this no authentic information could be attained my original motive for publishing the work anonymously was the consciousness that it was an experiment on the public taste which might very probably fail and therefore there was no occasion to take on myself the personal risk of discomfiture for this purpose considerable precautions were used to preserve secrecy my old friend and schoolfellow mr james ballantyne who printed these novels had the exclusive task of corresponding with the author who thus had not only the advantage of his professional talents but also of his critical abilities the original manuscript or as it is technically called copy was transcribed under mr ballantynes eye by confidential persons nor was there an instance of treachery during the many years in which these precautions were resorted to although various individuals were employed at different times double proofsheets were regularly printed off one was forwarded to the author by mr ballantyne and the alterations which it received were by his own hand copied upon the other proofsheet for the use of the printers so that even the corrected proofs of the author were never seen in the printing office and thus the curiosity of such eager inquirers as made the most minute investigation was entirely at fault  but although the cause of concealing the authors name in the first instance when the reception of waverley was doubtful was natural enough it is more difficult it may be thought to account for the same desire for secrecy during the subsequent editions to the amount of betwixt eleven and twelve thousand copies which followed each other close and proved the success of the work i am sorry i can give little satisfaction to queries on this subject i have already stated elsewhere that i can render little better reason for choosing to remain anonymous than by saying with shylock that such was my humour it will be observed that i had not the usual stimulus for desiring personal reputation the desire namely to float amidst the conversation of men of literary fame whether merited or undeserved i had already as much as might have contented a mind more ambitious than mine and in entering into this new contest for reputation i might be said rather to endanger what i had than to have any considerable chance of acquiring more i was affected too by none of those motives which at an earlier period of life would doubtless have operated upon me my friendships were formed my place in society fixed my life had attained its middle course my condition in society was higher perhaps than i deserved certainly as high as i wished and there was scarce any degree of literary success which could have greatly altered or improved my personal condition  i was not therefore touched by the spur of ambition usually stimulating on such occasions and yet i ought to stand exculpated from the charge of ungracious or unbecoming indifference to public applause i did not the less feel gratitude for the public favour although i did not proclaim it as the lover who wears his mistresss favour in his bosom is as proud though not so vain of possessing it as another who displays the token of her grace upon his bonnet far from such an ungracious state of mind i have seldom felt more satisfaction than when returning from a pleasure voyage i found waverley in the zenith of popularity and public curiosity in full cry after the name of the author the knowledge that i had the public approbation was like having the property of a hidden treasure not less gratifying to the owner than if all the world knew that it was his own another advantage was connected with the secrecy which i observed i could appear or retreat from the stage at pleasure without attracting any personal notice or attention other than what might be founded on suspicion only in my own person also as a successful author in another department of literature i might have been charged with too frequent intrusions on the public patience but the author of waverley was in this respect as impassible to the critic as the ghost of hamlet to the partisan of marcellus perhaps the curiosity of the public irritated by the existence of a secret and kept afloat by the discussions which took place on the subject from time to time went a good way to maintain an unabated interest in these frequent publications there was a mystery concerning the author which each new novel was expected to assist in unravelling although it might in other respects rank lower than its predecessors  i may perhaps be thought guilty of affectation should i allege as one reason of my silence a secret dislike to enter on personal discussions concerning my own literary labours it is in every case a dangerous intercourse for an author to be dwelling continually among those who make his writings a frequent and familiar subject of conversation but who must necessarily be partial judges of works composed in their own society the habits of selfimportance which are thus acquired by authors are highly injurious to a wellregulated mind for the cup of flattery if it does not like that of circe reduce men to the level of beasts is sure if eagerly drained to bring the best and the ablest down to that of fools this risk was in some degree prevented by the mask which i wore and my own stores of selfconceit were left to their natural course without being enhanced by the partiality of friends or adulation of flatterers  if i am asked further reasons for the conduct i have long observed i can only resort to the explanation supplied by a critic as friendly as he is intelligent namely that the mental organisation of the novelist must be characterised to speak craniologically by an extraordinary development of the passion for delitescency i the rather suspect some natural disposition of this kind for from the instant i perceived the extreme curiosity manifested on the subject i felt a secret satisfaction in baffling it for which when its unimportance is considered i do not well know how to account  my desire to remain concealed in the character of the author of these novels subjected me occasionally to awkward embarrassments as it sometimes happened that those who were sufficiently intimate with me would put the question in direct terms in this case only one of three courses could be followed either i must have surrendered my secret or have returned an equivocating answer or finally must have stoutly and boldly denied the fact the first was a sacrifice which i conceive no one had a right to force from me since i alone was concerned in the matter the alternative of rendering a doubtful answer must have left me open to the degrading suspicion that i was not unwilling to assume the merit if there was any which i dared not absolutely lay claim to or those who might think more justly of me must have received such an equivocal answer as an indirect avowal i therefore considered myself entitled like an accused person put upon trial to refuse giving my own evidence to my own conviction and flatly to deny all that could not be proved against me at the same time i usually qualified my denial by stating that had i been the author of these works i would have felt myself quite entitled to protect my secret by refusing my own evidence when it was asked for to accomplish a discovery of what i desired to conceal  the real truth is that i never expected or hoped to disguise my connection with these novels from any one who lived on terms of intimacy with me the number of coincidences which necessarily existed between narratives recounted modes of expression and opinions broached in these tales and such as were used by their author in the intercourse of private life must have been far too great to permit any of my familiar acquaintances to doubt the identity betwixt their friend and the author of waverley and i believe they were all morally convinced of it but while i was myself silent their belief could not weigh much more with the world than that of others their opinions and reasoning were liable to be taxed with partiality or confronted with opposing arguments and opinions and the question was not so much whether i should be generally acknowledged to be the author in spite of my own denial as whether even my own avowal of the works if such should be made would be sufficient to put me in undisputed possession of that character  i have been often asked concerning supposed cases in which i was said to have been placed on the verge of discovery but as i maintained my point with the composure of a lawyer of thirty years standing i never recollect being in pain or confusion on the subject in captain medwyns conversations of lord byron the reporter states himself to have asked my noble and highly gifted friend if he was certain about these novels being sir walter scotts to which lord byron replied scott as much as owned himself the author of waverley to me in murrays shop i was talking to him about that novel and lamented that its author had not carried back the story nearer to the time of the revolution scott entirely off his guard replied ay i might have done so but there he stopped it was in vain to attempt to correct himself he looked confused and relieved his embarrassment by a precipitate retreat i have no recollection whatever of this scene taking place and i should have thought that i was more likely to have laughed than to appear confused for i certainly never hoped to impose upon lord byron in a case of the kind and from the manner in which he uniformly expressed himself i knew his opinion was entirely formed and that any disclamations of mine would only have savoured of affectation i do not mean to insinuate that the incident did not happen but only that it could hardly have occurred exactly under the circumstances narrated without my recollecting something positive on the subject in another part of the same volume lord byron is reported to have expressed a supposition that the cause of my not avowing myself the author of waverley may have been some surmise that the reigning family would have been displeased with the work i can only say it is the last apprehension i should have entertained as indeed the inscription to these volumes sufficiently proves the sufferers of that melancholy period have during the last and present reign been honoured both with the sympathy and protection of the reigning family whose magnanimity can well pardon a sigh from others and bestow one themselves to the memory of brave opponents who did nothing in hate but all in honour  while those who were in habitual intercourse with the real author had little hesitation in assigning the literary property to him others and those critics of no mean rank employed themselves in investigating with persevering patience any characteristic features which might seem to betray the origin of these novels amongst these one gentleman equally remarkable for the kind and liberal tone of his criticism the acuteness of his reasoning and the very gentlemanlike manner in which he conducted his inquiries displayed not only powers of accurate investigation but a temper of mind deserving to be employed on a subject of much greater importance and i have no doubt made converts to his opinion of almost all who thought the point worthy of consideration footnote letters on the author of waverly rodwell and martin london 1822 of those letters and other attempts of the same kind the author could not complain though his incognito was endangered he had challenged the public to a game at bopeep and if he was discovered in his hidinghole he must submit to the shame of detection  various reports were of course circulated in various ways some founded on an inaccurate rehearsal of what may have been partly real some on circumstances having no concern whatever with the subject and others on the invention of some importunate persons who might perhaps imagine that the readiest mode of forcing the author to disclose himself was to assign some dishonourable and discreditable cause for his silence  it may be easily supposed that this sort of inquisition was treated with contempt by the person whom it principally regarded as among all the rumours that were current there was only one and that as unfounded as the others which had nevertheless some alliance to probability and indeed might have proved in some degree true  i allude to a report which ascribed a great part or the whole of these novels to the late thomas scott esq of the 70th regiment then stationed in canada those who remember that gentleman will readily grant that with general talents at least equal to those of his elder brother he added a power of social humour and a deep insight into human character which rendered him an universally delightful member of society and that the habit of composition alone was wanting to render him equally successful as a writer the author of waverley was so persuaded of the truth of this that he warmly pressed his brother to make such an experiment and willingly undertook all the trouble of correcting and superintending the press mr thomas scott seemed at first very well disposed to embrace the proposal and had even fixed on a subject and a hero the latter was a person well known to both of us in our boyish years from having displayed some strong traits of character mr t scott had determined to represent his youthful acquaintance as emigrating to america and encountering the dangers and hardships of the new world with the same dauntless spirit which he had displayed when a boy in his native country mr scott would probably have been highly successful being familiarly acquainted with the manners of the native indians of the old french settlers in canada and of the brules or woodsmen and having the power of observing with accuracy what i have no doubt he could have sketched with force and expression in short the author believes his brother would have made himself distinguished in that striking field in which since that period mr cooper has achieved so many triumphs but mr t scott was already affected by bad health which wholly unfitted him for literary labour even if he could have reconciled his patience to the task he never i believe wrote a single line of the projected work and i only have the melancholy pleasure of preserving in the appendix footnote see appendix no iii the simple anecdote on which he proposed to found it  to this i may add i can easily conceive that there may have been circumstances which gave a colour to the general report of my brother being interested in these works and in particular that it might derive strength from my having occasion to remit to him in consequence of certain family transactions some considerable sums of money about that period to which it is to be added that if any person chanced to evince particular curiosity on such a subject my brother was likely enough to divert himself with practising on their credulity  it may be mentioned that while the paternity of these novels was from time to time warmly disputed in britain the foreign booksellers expressed no hesitation on the matter but affixed my name to the whole of the novels and to some besides to which i had no claim  the volumes therefore to which the present pages form a preface are entirely the composition of the author by whom they are now acknowledged with the exception always of avowed quotations and such unpremeditated and involuntary plagiarisms as can scarce be guarded against by any one who has read and written a great deal the original manuscripts are all in existence and entirely written horresco referens in the authors own hand excepting during the years 1818 and 1819 when being affected with severe illness he was obliged to employ the assistance of a friendly amanuensis  the number of persons to whom the secret was necessarily entrusted or communicated by chance amounted i should think to twenty at least to whom i am greatly obliged for the fidelity with which they observed their trust until the derangement of the affairs of my publishers messrs constable and co and the exposure of their account books which was the necessary consequence rendered secrecy no longer possible the particulars attending the avowal have been laid before the public in the introduction to the chronicles of the canongate  the preliminary advertisement has given a sketch of the purpose of this edition i have some reason to fear that the notes which accompany the tales as now published may be thought too miscellaneous and too egotistical it maybe some apology for this that the publication was intended to be posthumous and still more that old men may be permitted to speak long because they cannot in the course of nature have long time to speak in preparing the present edition i have done all that i can do to explain the nature of my materials and the use i have made of them nor is it probable that i shall again revise or even read these tales i was therefore desirous rather to exceed in the portion of new and explanatory matter which is added to this edition than that the reader should have reason to complain that the information communicated was of a general and merely nominal character it remains to be tried whether the public like a child to whom a watch is shown will after having been satiated with looking at the outside acquire some new interest in the object when it is opened and the internal machinery displayed to them  that waverly and its successors have had their day of favour and popularity must be admitted with sincere gratitude and the author has studied with the prudence of a beauty whose reign has been rather long to supply by the assistance of art the charms which novelty no longer affords the publishers have endeavoured to gratify the honourable partiality of the public for the encouragement of british art by illustrating this edition with designs by the most eminent living artists footnote the illustrations here referred to were made for the edition of 1829  to my distinguished countryman david wilkie to edwin landseer who has exercised his talents so much on scottish subjects and scenery to messrs leslie and newton my thanks are due from a friend as well as an author nor am i less obliged to messrs cooper kidd and other artists of distinction to whom i am less personally known for the ready zeal with which they have devoted their talents to the same purpose  farther explanation respecting the edition is the business of the publishers not of the author and here therefore the latter has accomplished his task of introduction and explanation if like a spoiled child he has sometimes abused or trifled with the indulgence of the public he feels himself entitled to full belief when he exculpates himself from the charge of having been at any time insensible of their kindness  abbotsford 1st january 1829     appendix no i  fragment of a romance which was to have been entitled  thomas the rhymer   it is not to be supposed that these fragments are given as possessing any intrinsic value of themselves but there may be some curiosity attached to them as to the first etchings of a plate which are accounted interesting by those who have in any degree been interested in the more finished works of the artist       chapter i  the sun was nearly set behind the distant mountains of liddesdale when a few of the scattered and terrified inhabitants of the village of hersildoun which had four days before been burned by a predatory band of english borderers were now busied in repairing their ruined dwellings one high tower in the centre of the village alone exhibited no appearance of devastation it was surrounded with court walls and the outer gate was barred and bolted the bushes and brambles which grew around and had even insinuated their branches beneath the gate plainly showed that it must have been many years since it had been opened while the cottages around lay in smoking ruins this pile deserted and desolate as it seemed to be had suffered nothing from the violence of the invaders and the wretched beings who were endeavouring to repair their miserable huts against nightfall seemed to neglect the preferable shelter which it might have afforded them without the necessity of labour  before the day had quite gone down a knight richly armed and mounted upon an ambling hackney rode slowly into the village his attendants were a lady apparently young and beautiful who rode by his side upon a dappled palfrey his squire who carried his helmet and lance and led his battlehorse a noble steed richly caparisoned a page and four yeomen bearing bows and quivers short swords and targets of a span breadth completed his equipage which though small denoted him to be a man of high rank  he stopped and addressed several of the inhabitants whom curiosity had withdrawn from their labour to gaze at him but at the sound of his voice and still more on perceiving the st georges cross in the caps of his followers they fled with a loud cry that the southrons were returned the knight endeavoured to expostulate with the fugitives who were chiefly aged men women and children but their dread of the english name accelerated their flight and in a few minutes excepting the knight and his attendants the place was deserted by all he paced through the village to seek a shelter for the night and despairing to find one either in the inaccessible tower or the plundered huts of the peasantry he directed his course to the left hand where he spied a small decent habitation apparently the abode of a man considerably above the common rank after much knocking the proprietor at length showed himself at the window and speaking in the english dialect with great signs of apprehension demanded their business the warrior replied that his quality was an english knight and baron and that he was travelling to the court of the king of scotland on affairs of consequence to both kingdoms  pardon my hesitation noble sir knight said the old man as he unbolted and unbarred his doors  pardon my hesitation but we are here exposed to too many intrusions to admit of our exercising unlimited and unsuspicious hospitality what i have is yours and god send your mission may bring back peace and the good days of our old queen margaret  amen worthy franklin quoth the knightdid you know her  i came to this country in her train said the franklin and the care of some of her jointure lands which she devolved on me occasioned my settling here  and how do you being an englishman said the knight protect your life and property here when one of your nation cannot obtain a single nights lodging or a draught of water were he thirsty  marry noble sir answered the franklin use as they say will make a man live in a lions den and as i settled here in a quiet time and have never given cause of offence i am respected by my neighbours and even as you see by our forayers from england  i rejoice to hear it and accept your hospitality isabella my love our worthy host will provide you a bed my daughter good franklin is ill at ease we will occupy your house till the scottish king shall return from his northern expedition meanwhile call me lord lacy of chester  the attendants of the baron assisted by the franklin were now busied in disposing of the horses and arranging the table for some refreshment for lord lacy and his fair companion while they sat down to it they were attended by their host and his daughter whom custom did not permit to eat in their presence and who afterwards withdrew to an outer chamber where the squire and page both young men of noble birth partook of supper and were accommodated with beds the yeomen after doing honour to the rustic cheer of queen margarets bailiff withdrew to the stable and each beside his favourite horse snored away the fatigues of their journey early on the following morning the travellers were roused by a thundering knocking at the door of the house accompanied with many demands for instant admission in the roughest tone the squire and page of lord lacy after buckling on their arms were about to sally out to chastise these intruders when the old host after looking out at a private casement contrived for reconnoitring his visitors entreated them with great signs of terror to be quiet if they did not mean that all in the house should be murdered he then hastened to the apartment of lord lacy whom he met dressed in a long furred gown and the knightly cap called a mortier irritated at the noise and demanding to know the cause which had disturbed the repose of the household  noble sir said the franklin one of the most formidable and bloody of the scottish border riders is at hand he is never seen added he faltering with terror so far from the hills but with some bad purpose and the power of accomplishing it so hold yourself to your guard for  a loud crash here announced that the door was broken down and the knight just descended the stair in time to prevent bloodshed betwixt his attendants and the intruders they were three in number their chief was tall bony and athletic his spare and muscular frame as well as the hardness of his features marked the course of his life to have been fatiguing and perilous the effect of his appearance was aggravated by his dress which consisted of a jack or jacket composed of thick buff leather on which small plates of iron of a lozenge form were stitched in such a manner as to overlap each other and form a coat of mail which swayed with every motion of the wearers body this defensive armour covered a doublet of coarse gray cloth and the borderer had a few halfrusted plates of steel on his shoulders a twoedged sword with a dagger hanging beside it in a buff belt a helmet with a few iron bars to cover the face instead of a visor and a lance of tremendous and uncommon length completed his appointments the looks of the man were as wild and rude as his attire his keen black eyes never rested one moment fixed upon a single object but constantly traversed all around as if they ever sought some danger to oppose some plunder to seize or some insult to revenge the latter seemed to be his present object for regardless of the dignified presence of lord lacy he uttered the most incoherent threats against the owner of the house and his guests  we shall seeay marry shall weif an english hound is to harbour and reset the southrons here thank the abbot of melrose and the good knight of coldingnow that have so long kept me from your skirts but those days are gone by st mary and you shall find it  it is probable the enraged borderer would not have long continued to vent his rage in empty menaces had not the entrance of the four yeomen with their bows bent convinced him that the force was not at this moment on his own side  lord lacy now advanced towards him you intrude upon my privacy soldier withdraw yourself and your followers there is peace betwixt our nations or my servants should chastise thy presumption  such peace as ye give such shall you have answered the mosstrooper first pointing with his lance towards the burned village and then almost instantly levelling it against lord lacy the squire drew his sword and severed at one blow the steel head from the truncheon of the spear  arthur fitzherbert said the baron that stroke has deferred thy knighthood for one year never must that squire wear the spurs whose unbridled impetuosity can draw unbidden his sword in the presence of his master go hence and think on what i have said  the squire left the chamber abashed  it were vain continued lord lacy to expect that courtesy from a mountain churl which even my own followers can forget yet before thou drawest thy brand for the intruder laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword thou wilt do well to reflect that i came with a safeconduct from thy king and have no time to waste in brawls with such as thou  from my kingfrom my king reechoed the mountaineer i care not that rotten truncheon striking the shattered spear furiously on the ground for the king of fife and lothian but habby of cessford will be here belive and we shall soon know if he will permit an english churl to occupy his hostelry  having uttered these words accompanied with a lowering glance from under his shaggy black eyebrows he turned on his heel and left the house with his two followers they mounted their horses which they had tied to an outer fence and vanished in an instant  who is this discourteous ruffian said lord lacy to the franklin who had stood in the most violent agitation during this whole scene  his name noble lord is adam kerr of the moat but he is commonly called by his companions the black rider of cheviot i fear i fear he comes hither for no good but if the lord of cessford be near he will not dare offer any unprovoked outrage  i have heard of that chief said the baron let me know when he approaches and do thou rodulph to the eldest yeoman keep a strict watch adelbert to the page attend to arm me the page bowed and the baron withdrew to the chamber of the lady isabella to explain the cause of the disturbance  no more of the proposed tale was ever written but the authors purpose was that it should turn upon a fine legend of superstition which is current in the part of the borders where he had his residence where in the reign of alexander iii of scotland that renowned person thomas of hersildoune called the rhymer actually flourished this personage the merlin of scotland and to whom some of the adventures which the british bards assigned to merlin caledonius or the wild have been transferred by tradition was as is well known a magician as well as a poet and prophet he is alleged still to live in the land of faery and is expected to return at some great convulsion of society in which he is to act a distinguished parta tradition common to all nations as the belief of the mahomedans respecting their twelfth imaum demonstrates  now it chanced many years since that there lived on the borders a jolly rattling horsecowper who was remarkable for a reckless and fearless temper which made him much admired and a little dreaded amongst his neighbours one moonlight night as he rode over bowden moor on the west side of the eildon hills the scene of thomas the rhymers prophecies and often mentioned in his story having a brace of horses along with him which he had not been able to dispose of he met a man of venerable appearance and singularly antique dress who to his great surprise asked the price of his horses and began to chaffer with him on the subject to canobie dickfor so shall we call our border dealera chap was a chap and he would have sold a liaise to the devil himself without minding his cloven hoof and would have probably cheated old nick into the bargain the stranger paid the price they agreed on and all that puzzled dick in the transaction was that the gild which he received was in unicorns bonnetpieces and other ancient coins which would have been invaluable to collectors but were rather troublesome in modern currency  it was gold however and therefore dick contrived to get better value for the coin than he perhaps gave to his customer by the command of so good a merchant he brought horses to the same slot more than once the purchaser only stipulating that he should always come by night and alone i do not know whether it was from mere curiosity or whether some hope of gain mixed with it but after dick had sold several horses in this way he began to complain that drybargains were unlucky and to hint that since his chap must live in the neighbourhood he ought in the courtesy of dealing to treat him to half a mutchkin  you may see my dwelling if you will said the stranger but if you lose courage at what you see there you will rue it all your life  dicken however laughed the warning to scorn and having alighted to secure his horse he followed the stranger up a narrow footpath which led them up the hills to the singular eminence stuck betwixt the most southern and the centre peaks and called from its resemblance to such an animal in its form the lucken hare at the foot of this eminence which is almost as famous for witch meetings as the neighbouring windmill of kippilaw dick was somewhat startled to observe that his conductor entered the hillside by a passage or cavern of which he himself though well acquainted with the spot had never seen or heard  you may still return said his guide looking ominously back upon him but dick scorned to show the white feather and on they went they entered a very long range of stables in every stall stood a coalblack horse by every horse lay a knight in coalblack armour with a drawn sword in his hand but all were as silent hoof and limb as if they had been cut out of marble a great number of torches lent a gloomy lustre to the hall which like those of the caliph vathek was of large dimensions at the upper end however they at length arrived where a sword and horn lay on an antique table  he that shall sound that horn and draw that sword said the stranger who now intimated that he was the famous thomas of hersildoune shall if his heart fail him not be king over all broad britain so speaks the tongue that cannot lie but all depends on courage and much on your taking the sword or the horn first dick was much disposed to take the sword but his bold spirit was quailed by the supernatural terrors of the hall and he thought to unsheathe the sword first might be construed into defiance and give offence to the powers of the mountain he took the bugle with a trembling hand and a feeble note but loud enough to produce a terrible answer thunder rolled in stunning peals through the immense hall horses and men started to life the steeds snorted stamped grinned their bits and tossed on high their heads the warriors sprung to their feet clashed their armour and brandished their swords dicks terror was extreme at seeing the whole army which had been so lately silent as the grave in uproar and about to rush on him he dropped the horn and made a feeble attempt to seize the enchanted sword but at the same moment a voice pronounced aloud the mysterious words  woe to the coward that ever he was born who did not draw the sword before he blew the horn  at the same time a whirlwind of irresistible fury howled through the long hall bore the unfortunate horsejockey clear out of the mouth of the cavern and precipitated him over a steep bank of loose stones where the shepherds found him the next morning with just breath sufficient to tell his fearful tale after concluding which he expired  this legend with several variations is found in many parts of scotland and england the scene is sometimes laid in some favourite glen of the highlands sometimes in the deep coalmines of northumberland and cumberland which rim so far beneath the ocean it is also to be found in reginald scotts book on witchcraft which was written in the sixteenth century it would be in vain to ask what was the original of the tradition the choice between the horn and sword may perhaps include as a moral that it is foolhardy to awaken danger before we have arms in our hands to resist it  although admitting of much poetical ornament it is clear that this legend would have formed but an unhappy foundation for a prose story and must have degenerated into a mere fairy tale dr john leyden has beautifully introduced the tradition in his scenes of infancy           mysterious rhymer doomed by fates decree           still to revisit eildons fated tree           where oft the swain at dawn of hallowday           hears thy fleet barb with wild impatience neigh           say who is he with summons long and high           shall bid the charmed sleep of ages fly           roll the long sound through eildons caverns vast           while each dark warrior

occurred among other disjecta membra it seems to be an attempt at a tale of a different description from the last but was almost instantly abandoned the introduction points out the time of the composition to have been about the end of the eighteenth century     the lord of ennerdale  in a fragment of a letter from john b esq of that ilk to william g frse   fill a bumper said the knight the ladies may spare us a little longer fill a bumper to the archduke charles  the company did due honour to the toast of their landlord  the success of the archduke said the muddy vicar will tend to further our negotiation at paris and if  pardon the interruption doctor quoth a thin emaciated figure with somewhat of a foreign accent but why should you connect those events unless to hope that the bravery and victories of our allies may supersede the necessity of a degrading treaty  we begin to feel monsieur labbe answered the vicar with some asperity that a continental war entered into for the defence of an ally who was unwilling to defend himself and for the restoration of a royal family nobility and priesthood who tamely abandoned their own rights is a burden too much even for the resources of this country  and was the war then on the part of great britain rejoined the abbe a gratuitous exertion of generosity was there no fear of the widewasting spirit of innovation which had gone abroad did not the laity tremble for their property the clergy for their religion and every loyal heart for the constitution was it not thought necessary to destroy the building which was on fire ere the conflagration spread around the vicinity  yet if upon trial said the doctor the walls were found to resist our utmost efforts i see no great prudence in persevering in our labour amid the smouldering ruins  what doctor said the baronet must i call to your recollection your own sermon on the late general fast did you not encourage us to hope that the lord of hosts would go forth with our armies and that our enemies who blasphemed him should be put to shame  it may please a kind father to chasten even his beloved children answered the vicar  i think said a gentleman near the foot of the table that the covenanters made some apology of the same kind for the failure of their prophecies at the battle of danbar when their mutinous preachers compelled the prudent lesley to go down against the philistines in gilgal  the vicar fixed a scrutinizing and not a very complacent eye upon this intruder he was a young man of mean stature and rather a reserved appearance early and severe study had quenched in his features the gaiety peculiar to his age and impressed upon them a premature cast of thoughtfulness his eve had however retained its fire and his gesture its animation had he remained silent he would have been long unnoticed but when he spoke there was something in his manner which arrested attention  who is this young man said the vicar in a low voice to his neighbour  a scotchman called maxwell on a visit to sir henry was the answer  i thought so from his accent and his manner said the vicar it may be here observed that the northern english retain rather more of the ancient hereditary aversion to their neighbors than their countrymen of the south the interference of other disputants each of whom urged his opinion with all the vehemence of wine and politics rendered the summons to the drawingroom agreeable to the more sober part of the company  the company dispersed by degrees and at length the vicar and the young scotchman alone remained besides the baronet his lady daughters and myself the clergyman had not it would seem forgot the observation which ranked him with the false prophets of dunbar for he addressed mr maxwell upon the first opportunity  hem i think sir you mentioned something about the civil wars of last century you must be deeply skilled in them indeed if you can draw any parallel betwixt those and the present evil daysdavs which i am ready to maintain are the most gloomy that ever darkened the prospects of britain  god forbid doctor that i should draw a comparison between the present times and those you mention i am too sensible of the advantages we enjoy over our ancestors faction and ambition have introduced division among us but we are still free from the guilt of civil bloodshed and from all the evils which flow from it our foes sir are not those of our own household and while we continue united and firm from the attacks of a foreign enemy however artful or however inveterate we have i hope little to dread  have you found anything curious mr maxwell among the dusty papers said sir henry who seemed to dread a revival of political discussion  my investigation amongst them led to reflections which i have just now hinted said maxwell and i think they are pretty strongly exemplified by a story which i have been endeavouring to arrange from some of your family manuscripts  you are welcome to make what use of them you please said sir henry they have been undisturbed for many a day and i have often wished for some person as well skilled as you in these old pothooks to tell me their meaning  those i just mentioned answered maxwell relate to a piece of private history savouring not a little of the marvellous and intimately connected with your family if it is agreeable i can read to you the anecdotes in the modern shape into which i have been endeavouring to throw them and you can then judge of the value of the originals  there was something in this proposal agreeable to all parties sir henry had family pride which prepared him to take an interest in whatever related to his ancestors the ladies had dipped deeply into the fashionable reading of the present day lady ratcliff and her fair daughters had climbed every pass viewed every pineshrouded ruin heard every groan and lifted every trapdoor in company with the noted heroine of udolpho they had been heard however to observe that the famous incident of the black veil singularly resembled the ancient apologue of the mountain in labour so that they were unquestionably critics as well as admirers besides all this they had valorously mounted en croupe behind the ghostly horseman of prague through all his seven translators and followed the footsteps of moor through the forest of bohemia moreover it was even hinted but this was a greater mystery than all the rest that a certain performance called the monk in three neat volumes had been seen by a prying eye in the righthand drawer of the indian cabinet of lady ratcliffs dressingroom thus predisposed for wonders and signs lady ratcliff and her nymphs drew their chairs round a large blazing woodfire and arranged themselves to listen to the tale to that fire i also approached moved thereunto partly by the inclemency of the season and partly that my deafness which you know cousin i acquired during my campaign under prince charles edward might be no obstacle to the gratification of my curiosity which was awakened by what had any reference to the fate of such faithful followers of royalty as you well know the house of ratcliff have ever been to this

garbonete von enlen daughter of our journalist to a relation in england from whom she implored assistance after some general account of the purpose of the voyage and of the engagement her narrative proceeds thus  the noise of the cannon had hardly ceased before the sounds of a language to me but half known and the confusion on board our vessel informed me that the captors had boarded us and taken possession of our vessel i went on deck where the first spectacle that met my eyes was a young man mate of our vessel who though disfigured and covered with blood was loaded with irons and whom they were forcing over the side of the vessel into a boat the two principal persons among our enemies appeared to be a man of a tall thin figure with a highcrowned hat and long neck band and shortcropped head of hair accompanied by a bluff openlooking elderly man in a naval uniform yarely yarely pull away my hearts said the latter and the boat bearing the unlucky young man soon carried

received a livery coat and a small pension for their attendance on such solemn occasions appeared in cassocks of blue bearing upon their arms the cognizance of the house of boteler as a badge of their adherence they were the tallest men of their hands that the neighbouring villages could supply with every man his good buckler on his shoulder and a bright burnished broadsword dangling from his leathern belt on this occasion they acted as rangers for beating up the thickets and rousing the game these attendants filled up the court of the castle spacious as it was on the green without you might have seen the motley assemblage of peasantry convened by report of the splendid hunting including most of our old acquaintances from tewin as well as the jolly partakers of good cheer at hob filchers gregory the jester it may well be guessed had no great mind to exhibit himself in public after his recent disaster but oswald the steward a great formalist in whatever concerned the public exhibition of his masters household state had positively enjoined his attendance what quoth he shall the house of the brave lord boteler or such a brave day as this be without a fool certes the good lord st clere and his fair lady sister might think our housekeeping as niggardly as that of their churlish kinsman at gay bowers who sent his fathers jester to the hospital sold the poor sots bells for hawkjesses and made a nightcap of his longeared bonnet and sirrah let me see thee fool handsomelyspeak squibs and crackers instead of that dry barren musty gibing which thou hast used of late or by the bones the porter shall have thee to his lodge and cob thee with thine own wooden sword till thy skin is as motley as thy doublet  to this stern injunction gregory made no reply any more than to the courteous offer of old albert drawslot the chief parkkeeper who proposed to blow vinegar in his nose to sharpen his wit as he had done that blessed morning to bragger the old hound whose scent was failing there was indeed little time for reply for the bugles after a lively flourish were now silent and peretto with his two attendant minstrels stepping beneath the windows of the strangers

day                gentle lords and ladies gay   by the time this lay was finished lord boteler with his daughter and kinsman fitzallen of harden and other noble guests had mounted their palfreys and the hunt set forward in due order the huntsmen having carefully observed the traces of a large stag on the preceding evening were able without loss of time to conduct the company by the marks which they had made upon the trees to the side of the thicket in which by the report of drawslot he had harboured all night the horsemen spreading themselves along the side of the cover waited until the keeper entered leading his bandog a large bloodhound tied in a leam or band from which he takes his name  but it befell this a hart of the second year which was in the same cover with the proper object of their pursuit chanced to be unharboured first and broke cover very near where the lady emma and her brother were stationed an inexperienced varlet who was nearer to them instantly unloosed two tall greyhounds who sprung after the fugitive with all the fleetness of the north wind gregory restored a little to spirits by the enlivening scene around him followed encouraging the hounds with a loud tayouttailliershors in modern phrase tallyhofor which he had the hearty curses of the huntsman as well as of the baron who entered into the spirit of the chase with all the juvenile ardour of twenty may the foul fiend booted and spurred ride down his bawling throat with a scythe at his girdle quoth albert drawslot here have i been telling him that all the marks were those of a buck of the first head and he has hollowed the hounds upon a velvetheaded knobbler by saint hubert if i break not his pate with my crossbow may i never cast off hound more but to it my lords and masters the noble beast is here yet and thank the saints we have enough of hounds  the cover being now thoroughly beat by the attendants the stag was compelled to abandon it and trust to his speed for his safety three greyhounds were slipped upon him whom he threw out after running a couple of miles by entering an extensive furzy brake which extended along the side of a hill the horsemen soon came up and casting off a sufficient number of slowhounds sent them with the prickers into the cover in order to chive the game from his strength this object being accomplished afforded another severe chase of several miles in a direction almost circular during which the poor animal tried every wile to get rid of his persecutors he crossed and traversed all such dusty paths as were likely to retain the least scent of his footsteps he laid himself close to the ground drawing his feet under his belly and clapping his nose close to the earth lest he should be betrayed to the hounds by his breath and hoofs  when all was in vain and he found the hounds coming fast in upon him his own strength failing his mouth embossed with foam and the tears dropping from his eyes he turned in despair upon his pursuers who then stood at gaze making an hideous clamour and awaiting their twofooted auxiliaries of these it chanced that the lady eleanor taking more pleasure in the sport than matilda and being a less burden to her palfrey than the lord boteler was the first who arrived at the spot and taking a crossbow from an attendant discharged a bolt at the stag when the infuriated animal felt himself wounded he pushed franticly towards her from whom he had received the shaft and lady eleanor might have had occasion to repent of her enterprise had not young fitzallen who had kept near her during the whole day at that instant galloped briskly in and ere the stag could change his object of assault despatched him with his short huntingsword  albert drawslot who had just come up in terror for the young ladys safety broke out into loud encomiums upon fitzallens strength and gallantry   by r lady said he taking off his cap and wiping his sunburnt face with his sleeve well struck and in good time but now boys doff your bonnets and sound the mort  the sportsmen then sounded a treble mort and set up a general whoop which mingled with the yelping of the dogs made the welkin ring again the huntsman then offered his knife to lord boteler that he might take the say of the deer but the baron courteously insisted upon fitzallen going through that ceremony the lady matilda was now come up with most of the attendants and the interest of the chase being ended it excited some surprise that neither st clere nor his sister made their appearance the lord boteler commanded the horns again to sound the recheat in hopes to call in the stragglers and said to fitzallen methinks st clere so distinguished for service in war should have been more forward in the chase  i trow said peter lanaret i know the reason of the noble lords absence for when that mooncalf gregory hallooed the dogs upon the knobbler and galloped like a green hilding as he is after them i saw the lady emmas palfrey follow apace after that varlet who should be trashed for overrunning and i think her noble brother has followed her lest she should come to harm but here by the rood is gregory to answer for himself  at this moment gregory entered the circle which had been formed round the deer out of breath and his face covered with blood he kept for some time uttering inarticulate cries of harrow and wellaway and other exclamations of distress and terror pointing all the while to a thicket at some distance from the spot where the deer had been killed  by my honour said the baron i would gladly know who has dared to array the poor knave thus and i trust he should dearly aby his outrecuidance were he the best save one in england  gregory who had now found more breath cried help an ye be men save lady emma and her brother whom they are murdering in brockenhurst thicket  this put all in motion lord boteler hastily commanded a small party of his men to abide for the defence of the ladies while he himself fitzallen and the rest made what speed they could towards the thicket guided by gregory who for that purpose was mounted behind fabian pushing through a narrow path the first object they encountered was a man of small stature lying on the ground mastered and almost strangled by two dogs which were instantly recognized to be those that had accompanied gregory a little farther was an open space where lay three bodies of dead or wounded men beside these was lady emma apparently lifeless her brother and a young forester bending over and endeavouring to recover her by employing the usual remedies this was soon accomplished while lord boteler astonished at such a scene anxiously inquired at st clere the meaning of what he saw and whether more danger was to be expected  for the present i trust not said the young warrior who they now observed was slightly wounded but i pray you of your nobleness let the woods here be searched for we were assaulted by four of these base assassins and i see three only on the sward  the attendants now brought forward the person whom they had rescued from the dogs and henry with disgust shame and astonishment recognized his kinsman gaston st clere this discovery he communicated in a whisper to lord boteler who commanded the prisoner to be conveyed to queenhoo hall and closely guarded meanwhile he anxiously inquired of young st clere about his wound a scratch a trifle cried henry i am in less haste to bind it than to introduce to you one without whose aid that of the leech would have come too late where is he where is my brave deliverer  here most noble lord said gregory sliding from his palfrey and stepping forward ready to receive the guerdon which your bounty would heap on him  truly friend gregory answered the young warrior thou shalt not be forgotten for thou didst run speedily and roar manfully for aid without which i think verily we had not received it but the brave forester who came to my rescue when these three ruffians had nigh overpowered me where is he  every one looked around but though all had seen him on entering the thicket he was not now to be found they could only conjecture that he had retired during the confusion occasioned by the detention of gaston  seek not for him said the lady emma who had now in some degree recovered her composure he will not be found of mortal unless at his own season  the baron convinced from this answer that her terror had for the time somewhat disturbed her reason forebore to question her and matilda and eleanor to whom a message had been despatched with the result of this strange adventure arriving they took the lady emma between them and all in a body returned to the castle  the distance was however considerable and before reaching it they had another alarm the prickers who rode foremost in the troop halted and announced to the lord boteler that they perceived advancing towards them a body of armed men the followers of the baron were numerous but they were arrayed for the chase not for battle and it was with great pleasure that he discerned on the pennon of the advancing body of menatarms instead of the cognizance of gaston as he had some reason to expect the friendly bearings of fitzosborne of diggswell the same young lord who was present at the maygames with fitzallen of marden the knight himself advanced sheathed in armour and without raising his visor informed lord boteler that having heard of a base attempt made upon a part of his train by ruffianly assassins he had mounted and armed a small party of his retainers to escort them to queenhoo hall having received and accepted an invitation to attend them thither they prosecuted their journey in confidence and security and arrived safe at home without any further accident      chapter v  investigation of the adventure of the huntinga discovery gregorys manhoodfate of gaston st clereconclusion  so soon as they arrived at the princely mansion of boteler the lady emma craved permission to retire to her chamber that she might compose her spirits after the terror she had undergone henry st clere in a few words proceeded to explain the adventure to the curious audience i had no sooner seen my sisters palfrey in spite of her endeavours to the contrary entering with spirit into the chase set on foot by the worshipful gregory than i rode after to give her assistance so long was the chase that when the greyhounds pulled down the knobbler we were out of hearing of your bugles and having rewarded and coupled the dogs i gave them to be led by the jester and we wandered in quest of our company whom it would seem the sport had led in a different direction at length passing through the thicket where you found us i was surprised by a crossbow bolt whizzing past mine head i drew my sword and rushed into the thicket but was instantly assailed by two ruffians while other two made towards my sister and gregory the poor knave fled crying for help pursued by my false kinsman now your prisoner and the designs of the other on my poor emma murderous no doubt were prevented by the sudden apparition of a brave woodsman who after a short encounter stretched the miscreant at his feet and came to my assistance i was already slightly wounded and nearly overlaid with odds the combat lasted some time for the caitiffs were both well armed strong and desperate at length however we had each mastered our antagonist when your retinue my lord boteler arrived to my relief so ends in my story but on my knighthood i would give an earls ransom for an opportunity of thanking the gallant forester by whose aid i live to tell it  fear not said lord boteler he shall be found if this or the four adjacent counties hold him and now lord fitzosborne will be pleased to doff the armour he has so kindly assumed for our sakes and we will all bowne ourselves for the banquet  when the hour of dinner approached the lady matilda and her cousin visited the chamber of the fair darcy they found her in a composed but melancholy posture she turned the discourse upon the misfortunes of her life and hinted that having recovered her brother and seeing him look forward to the society of one who would amply repay to him the loss of hers she had thoughts of dedicating her remaining life to heaven by whose providential interference it had been so often preserved  matilda coloured deeply at something in this speech and her cousin inveighed loudly against emmas resolution ah my dear lady eleanor replied she i have today witnessed what i cannot but judge a supernatural visitation and to what end can it call me but to give myself to the altar that peasant who guided me to baddow through the park of danbury the same who appeared before me at different times and in different forms during that eventful journeythat youth whose features are imprinted on my memory is the very individual forester who this day rescued us in the forest i cannot be mistaken and connecting these marvellous appearances with the spectre which i saw while at gay bowers i cannot resist the conviction that heaven has permitted my guardian angel to assume mortal shape for my relief and protection  the fair cousins after exchanging looks which implied a fear that her mind was wandering answered her in soothing terms and finally prevailed upon her to accompany them to the banquetinghall here the first person they encountered was the baron fitzosborne of diggswell now divested of his armour at the sight of whom the lady emma changed colour and exclaiming it is the same sunk senseless into the arms of matilda  she is bewildered by the terrors of the day said eleanor and we have done ill in obliging her to descend  and i said fitzosborne have done madly in presenting before her one whose presence must recall moments the most alarming in her life  while the ladies supported emma from the hall lord boteler and st clere requested an explanation from fitzosborne of the words he had used  trust me gentle lords said the baron of diggswell ye shall have what ye demand when i learn that lady emma darcy has not suffered from my imprudence  at this moment lady matilda returning said that her fair friend on her recovery had calmly and deliberately insisted that she had seen fitzosborne before in the most dangerous crisis of her life  i dread said she her disordered mind connects all that her eye beholds with the terrible passages that she has witnessed  nay said fitzosborne if noble st clere can pardon the unauthorized interest which with the purest and most honourable intentions i have taken in his sisters fate it is easy for me to explain this mysterious impression  he proceeded to say that happening to be in the hostelry called the griffin near baddow while upon a journey in that country he had met with the old nurse of the lady emma darcy who being just expelled front gay bowers was in the height of her grief and indignation and made loud and public proclamation of lady emmas wrongs from the description she gave of the beauty of her fosterchild as well as from the spirit of chivalry fitzosborne became interested in her fate this interest was deeply enhanced when by a bribe to old gaunt the reve he procured a view of the lady emma as she walked near the castle of gay bowers the aged churl refused to give him access to the castle yet dropped some hints as if he thought the lady in danger and wished she were well out of it his master he said had heard she had a brother in life and since that deprived him of all chance of gaining her domains by purchase he in short gaunt wished they were safely separated if any injury quoth he should happen to the damsel here it were ill for us all i tried by an innocent stratagem to frighten her from the castle by introducing a figure through a trapdoor and warning her as if by a voice from the dead to retreat from thence but the giglet is wilful and is running upon her fate  finding gaunt although covetous and communicative too faithful a servant to his wicked master to take any active steps against his commands fitzosborne applied himself to old ursely whom he found more tractable through her he learned the dreadful plot gaston had laid to rid himself of his kinswoman and resolved to effect her deliverance but aware of the delicacy of emmas situation he charged ursely to conceal from her the interest he took in her distress resolving to watch over her in disguise until he saw her in a place of safety hence the appearance he made before her in various dresses during her journey in the course of which he was never far distant and he had always four stout yeomen within hearing of his bugle had assistance been necessary when she was placed in safety at the lodge it was fitzosbornes intention to have prevailed upon his sisters to visit and take her under their protection but he found them absent from diggswell having gone to attend an aged relation who lay dangerously ill in a distant county they did not return until the day before the maygames and the other events followed too rapidly to permit fitzosborne to lay any plan for introducing them to lady emma darcy on the day of the chase he resolved to preserve his romantic disguise and attend the lady emma as a forester partly to have the pleasure of being near her and partly to judge whether according to an idle report in the country she favoured his friend and comrade fitzallen of marden this last motive it may easily be believed he did not declare to the company after the skirmish with the ruffians he waited till the baron and the hunters arrived and then still doubting the further designs of gaston hastened to his castle to arm the band which had escorted them to queenhoo hall  fitzosbornes story being finished he received the thanks of all the company particularly of st clere who felt deeply the respectful delicacy with which he had conducted himself towards his sister the lady was carefully informed of her obligations to him and it is left to the welljudging reader whether even the raillery of lady eleanor made her regret that heaven had only employed natural means for her security and that the guardian angel was converted into a handsome gallant and enamoured knight  the joy of the company in the hall extended itself to the buttery where gregory the jester narrated such feats of arms done by himself in the fray of the morning as might have shamed bevis and guy of warwick he was according to his narrative singled out for destruction by the gigantic baron himself while he abandoned to meaner hands the destruction of st clere and fitzosborne  but certes said he the foul paynim met his match for ever as he foined at me with his brand i parried his blows with my bauble and closing with him upon the third veny threw him to the ground and made him cryrecreant to an unarmed man  tush man said drawslot thou forgettest thy best auxiliaries the good greyhounds help and holdfast i warrant thee that when the humpbacked baron caught thee by the cowl which he hath almost torn off thou hadst been in a fair plight had they not remembered an old friend and come in to the rescue why man i found them fastened on him myself and there was odd staving and stickling to make them ware haunch their mouths were full of the flex for i pulled a piece of the garment from their jaws i warrant thee that when they brought him to ground thou fledst like a frighted pricket  and as for gregorys gigantic paynim said fabian why he lies yonder in the guardroom the very size shape and colour of a spider in a yewhedge  it is false said gregory colbrand the dane was a dwarf to him  it is as true returned fabian as that the tasker is to be married on tuesday to pretty margery gregory thy sheet hath brought them between a pair of blankets  i care no more for such a gillflirt said the jester than i do for thy leasings marry thou hopomythumb happy wouldst thou be could thy head reach the captive barons girdle  by the mass said peter lanaret i will have one peep at this burly gallant and leaving the buttery he went to the guardroom where gaston st clere was confined a manatarms who kept sentinel on the strong studded door of the apartment said he believed he slept for that after raging stamping and uttering the most horrid imprecations he had been of late perfectly still the falconer gently drew back a sliding board of a foot square towards the top of the door which covered a hole of the same size strongly latticed through which the warder without opening the door could look in upon his prisoner from this aperture he beheld the wretched gaston suspended by the neck by his own girdle to an iron ring in the side of his prison he had clambered to it by means of the table on which his food had been placed and in the agonies of shame and disappointed malice had adopted this mode of ridding himself of a wretched life he was found yet warm but totally lifeless a proper account of the manner of his death was drawn up and certified he was buried that evening in the chapel of the castle out of respect to his high birth and the chaplain of fitzallen of marden who said the service upon the occasion preached the next sunday an excellent sermon upon the text radix malorum est cupiditas which we have here transcribed                   here the manuscript from which we have painfully transcribed and frequently as it were translated this tale for the readers edification is so indistinct and defaced that excepting certain howbeits nathlesses lo yes etc we can pick out little that is intelligible saving that avarice is defined a likourishness of heart after earthly things  a little farther there seems to have been a gay account of margerys wedding with ralph the tasker the running at the quintain and other rural games practised on the occasion there are also fragments of a mock sermon preached by gregory upon that occasion as for example  mv dear cursed caitiffs there was once a king and he wedded a young old queen and she had a child and this child was sent to solomon the sage praying he would give it the same blessing which he got from the witch of endor when she bit him by the heel hereof speaks the worthy dr radigundus potator why should not mass be said for all the roasted shoe souls served up in the kings dish on saturday for true it is that saint peter asked father adam as they journeyed to camelot an high great and doubtful question adam adam why eatedst thou the apple without paring  this tirade of gibberish is literally taken or selected from a mock discourse pronounced by a professed jester which occurs in an ancient manuscript in the advocates library the same from which the late ingenious mr weber published the curious comic romance of the limiting of the hare it was introduced in compliance with mr strutts plan of rendering his tale an illustration of ancient manners a similar burlesque sermon is pronounced by the fool in sir david lindesays satire of the three estates the nonsense and vulgar burlesque of that composition illustrate the ground of sir andrew aguecheeks eulogy on the exploits of the jester in twelfth night who reserving his sharper jests for sir toby had doubtless enough of the jargon of his calling to captivate the imbecility of his brother knight who is made to exclaim in sooth thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou spokest of pigrogremitus and of the vapours passing the equinoctials of quenbus t was very good i faith it is entertaining to find commentators seeking to discover some meaning in the professional jargon of such a passage as this  with much goodly gibberish to the same effect which display of gregorys ready wit not only threw the whole company into convulsions of laughter but made such an impression on rose the potters daughter that it was thought it would be the jesters own fault if jack was long without his jill much pithy matter concerning the bringing the bride to bed the loosing the bridegrooms points the scramble which ensued for them and the casting of the stocking is also omitted from its obscurity  the following song which has been since borrowed by the worshipful author of the famous history of fryar bacon has been with difficulty deciphered it seems to have been sung on occasion of carrying home the bride   bridal song  to the tune of i have been a fiddler etc      and did you not hear of a mirth befell            the morrow after a weddingday           and carrying a bride at home to dwell           and away to tewin away away            the quintain was set and the garlands were made           t is pity old customs should ever decay           and woe be to him that was horsed on a jade           for he carried no credit away away            we met a consort of fiddlededees           we set them a cockhorse and made them play           the winning of bullen and upseyfires           and away to tewin away away            there was neer a lad in all the parish

was persuaded that the ground looked blue           and i dare boldly be sworn on a book           such smiths as he there s but a few            a posset was made and the women did sip           and simpering said they could eat no more           full many a maiden was laid on the lip           ill say no more but give oer give oer  but what our fair readers will chiefly regret is the loss of three declarations of love the first by st clore to matilda which with the ladys answer occupies fifteen closely written pages of manuscript that of fitzosborne to emma is not much shorter but the amours of fitzallen and eleanor being of a less romantic cast are closed in three pages only the three noble couples were married in queenhoo hall upon the same day being the twentieth sunday after easter there is a prolix account of the marriagefeast of which we can pick out the names of a few dishes such as peterel crane sturgeon swan etc with a profusion of wildfowl and venison we also see that a suitable song was produced by peretto on the occasion and that the bishop who blessed the bridal beds which received the happy couples was no niggard of his holy water bestowing half a gallon upon each of the couches we regret we cannot give these curiosities to the reader in detail but we hope to expose the manuscript to abler antiquaries so soon as it shall be framed and glazed by the ingenious artist who rendered that service to mr irelands shakspeare manuscripts and so being unable to lay aside the style to which our pen is habituated gentle reader we bid thee heartily farewell     no iii  anecdote of school days  upon which mr thomas scott proposed to found a tale of fiction  it is well known in the south that there is little or no boxing at the scottish schools about forty or fifty years ago however a far more dangerous mode of fighting in parties or factions was permitted in the streets of edinburgh to the great disgrace of the police and danger of the parties concerned these parties were generally formed from the quarters of the town in which the combatants resided those of a particular square or district fighting against those of an adjoining one hence it happened that the children of the higher classes were often pitted against those of the lower each taking their side according to the residence of their friends so far as i recollect however it was unmingled either with feelings of democracy or aristocracy or indeed with malice or illwill of any kind towards the opposite party in fact it was only a rough mode of play such contests were however maintained with great vigour with stones and sticks and fisticuffs when one party dared to charge and the other stood their ground of course mischief sometimes happened boys are said to have been killed at these bickers as they were called and serious accidents certainly took place as many contemporaries can bear witness  the authors father residing in george square in the southern side of edinburgh the boys belonging to that family with others in the square were arranged into a sort of company to which a lady of distinction presented a handsome set of colours now this company or regiment as a matter of course was engaged in weekly warfare with the boys inhabiting the crosscauseway bristo street the potter rowin short the neighbouring suburbs these last were chiefly of the lower rank but hardy loons who threw stones to a hairsbreadth and were very rugged antagonists at close quarters the skirmish sometimes lasted for a whole evening until one party or the other was victorious when if ours were successful we drove the enemy to their quarters and were usually chased back by the reinforcement of bigger lads who came to their assistance if on the contrary we were pursued as was often the case into the precincts of our square we were in our turn supported by our elder brothers domestic servants and similar auxiliaries  it followed from our frequent opposition to each other that though not knowing the names of our enemies we were yet well acquainted with their appearance and had nicknames for the most remarkable of them one very active and spirited boy might be considered as the principal leader in the cohort of the suburbs he was i suppose thirteen or fourteen years old finely made tall blueeyed with long fair hair the very picture of a youthful goth this lad was always first in the charge and last in the retreatthe achilles at once and ajax of the crosscauseway he was too formidable to us not to have a cognomen and like that of a knight of old it was taken from the most remarkable part of his dress being a pair of old green livery breeches which was the principal part of his clothing for like pentapolin according to don quixotes account greenbreeks as we called him always entered the battle with bare arms legs and feet  it fell that once upon a time when the combat was at the thickest this plebeian champion headed a sudden charge so rapid and furious that all fled before him he was several paces before his comrades and had actually laid his hands on the patrician standard when one of our party whom some misjudging friend had intrusted with a couteau de chasse or hanger inspired with a zeal for the honour of the corps worthy of major sturgeon himself struck poor greenbreeks over the head with strength sufficient to cut him down when this was seen the casualty was so far beyond what had ever taken place before that both parties fled different ways leaving poor greenbreeks with his bright hair plentifully dabbled in blood to the care of the watchman who honest man took care not to know who had done the mischief the bloody hanger was flung into one of the meadow ditches and solemn secrecy was sworn on all hands but the remorse and terror of the actor were beyond all bounds and his apprehensions of the most dreadful character the wounded hero was for a few days in the infirmary the case being only a trifling one but though inquiry was strongly pressed on him no argument could make him indicate the person from whom he had received the wound though he must have been perfectly well known to him when he recovered and was dismissed the author and his brothers opened a communication with him through the medium of a popular gingerbread baker of whom both parties were customers in order to tender a subsidy in name of smartmoney the sum would excite ridicule were i to name it but sure i am that the pockets of the noted greenbreeks never held as much money of his own he declined the remittance saying that he would not sell his blood but at the same time reprobated the idea of being an informer which he said was clam ie base or mean with much urgency he accepted a pound of snuff for the use of some old womanaunt grandmother or the likewith whom he lived we did not become friends for the bickers were more agreeable to both parties than any more pacific amusement but we conducted them ever after under mutual assurances of the highest consideration for each other  such was the hero whom mr thomas scott proposed to carry to canada and involve in adventures with the natives and colonists of that country perhaps the youthful generosity of the lad will not seem so great in the eyes of others as to those whom it was the means of screening from severe rebuke and punishment but it seemed to those concerned to argue a nobleness of sentiment far beyond the pitch of most minds and however obscurely the lad who showed such a frame of noble spirit may have lived or died i cannot help being of opinion that if fortune had placed him in circumstances calling for gallantry or generosity the man would have fulfilled the promises of the boy long afterwards when the story was told to my father he censured us severely for not telling the truth at the time that he might have attempted to be of use to the young man in entering on life but our alarms for the consequences of the drawn sword and the wound inflicted with such a weapon were far too predominant at the time for such a pitch of generosity  perhaps i ought not to have inserted this schoolboy tale but besides the strong impression made by the incident at the time the whole accompaniments of the story are matters to me of solemn and sad recollection of all the little band who were concerned in those juvenile sports or brawls i can scarce recollect a single survivor some left the ranks of mimic war to die in the active service of their country many sought distant lands to return no more others dispersed in different paths of life my dim eyes now seek for in vain of five brothers all healthy and promising in a degree far beyond one whose infancy was visited by personal infirmity and whose health after this period seemed long very precarious i am nevertheless the only survivor the best loved and the best deserving to be loved who had destined this incident to be the foundation of literary composition died before his day in a distant and foreign land and trifles assume an importance not their own when connected with those who have been loved and lost     waverley  or  t is sixty years since    under which king bezonian speak or die henry iv part ii     editors introduction to waverley  what is the value of a reputation that probably will not last above one or two generations sir walter scott once asked ballantyne two generations according to the usual reckoning have passed t is sixty years since the wondrous potentate of wordsworths sonnet died yet the reputation on which he set so little store survives a constant tide of new editions of his novels flows from the press his plots give materials for operas and plays he has been criticised praised condemned but his romances endure amid the changes of taste remaining the delight of mankind while new schools and little masters of fiction come and go  scott himself believed that even great works usually suffer periods of temporary occultation his own no doubt have not always been in their primitive vogue even at first english readers complained of the difficulty caused by his scotch and now many make his i dialect an excuse for not reading books which their taste debauched by thirdrate fiction is incapable of enjoying but scott has never disappeared in one of those irregular changes of public opinion remarked on by his friend lady louisa stuart in 1821 she informed him that she had tried the experiment of reading mackenzies man of feeling aloud nobody cried and at some of the touches i used to think so exquisite they laughedabbotsford manuscriptshis correspondent requested scott to write something on such variations of taste which actually seem to be in the air and epidemic for they affect as she remarked young people who have not heard the criticisms of their elderssee scotts reply with the anecdote about mrs aphra behns novels lockhart vi 406 edition of 1839thus rousseaus nouvelle heloise once so fascinating to girls and reputed so dangerous had become tedious to the young lady louisa says even in 1821 but to the young if they have any fancy and intelligence scott is not tedious even now and probably his most devoted readers are boys girls and men of matured appreciation and considerable knowledge of literature the unformed and the cultivated tastes are still at one about scott he holds us yet with his unpremeditated art his natural qualities of friendliness of humour of sympathy even the carelessness with which his earliest and his kindest criticsellis erskine and lady louisa stuartreproached him has not succeeded in killing his work and diminishing his renown  it is style as critics remind us it is perfection of form no doubt that secure the permanence of literature but scott did not overstate his own defects when he wrote in his journal april 22 1826 a solecism in point of composition like a scotch word is indifferent to me i never learned grammar    i believe the bailiff in the goodnatured man is not far wrong when he says one man has one way of expressing himself and another another and that is all the difference between them the difference between scott and thackeray or flaubert among good writers and a crowd of selfconscious and mannered stylists among writers not so very good is essential about shakspeare it was said that he never blotted a line the observation is almost literally true about sir walter the pages of his manuscript novels show scarcely a retouch or an erasure whether in the waverley fragment of 1805 or the unpublished siege of malta of 1832  a history of scotts manuscripts with good facsimiles will be found in the catalogue of the scott exhibition edinburgh 1872  the handwriting becomes closer and smaller from thirtyeight lines to the page in waverley he advances to between fifty and sixty in ivanhoe the few alterations are usually additions for example a fresh pedantry of the baron of bradwardines is occasionally set down on the opposite page nothing can be less like the method of flaubert or the method of mr ruskin who tells us that a sentence of modern painters was often written four or five tunes over in my own hand and tried in every word for perhaps an hourperhaps a forenoonbefore it was passed for the printer each writer has his method scott was no stipples or niggler but as we shall see later he often altered much in his proofsheets  while speaking of correction it may be noted that scott in his advertisement prefixed to the issue of 1829 speaks of changes made in that collected edition in waverley these emendations are very rare and are unimportant a few callidae juncturae are added a very few lines are deleted the postscript of the first edition did not contain the anecdote about the hidingplace of the manuscript among the fishing tackle the first line of flora macdonalds battlesong chapter xxii originally ran mist darkens the mountain night darkens the vale in place of there is mist on the mountain and mist on the vale for the rest as scott says where the tree falls it must lie  as long as he was understood he was almost reckless of wellconstructed sentences of the one best word for his meaning of rounded periods this indifference is not to be praised but it is only a proof of his greatness that his style never distinguished and often lax has not impaired the vitality of his prose the heart which beats in his works the knowledge of human nature the dramatic vigour of his character the nobility of his whole being win the day against the looseness of his manner the negligence of his composition against the haste of fatigue which set him as lady louisa stuart often told him on huddling up a conclusion anyhow and so kicking the book out of his way in this matter of denouements he certainly was no more careful than shakspeare or moliere  the permanence of sir walters romances is proved as we said by their survival among all the changes of fashion in the art of fiction when he took up his pen to begin waverley fiction had not absorbed as it does today almost all the best imaginative energy of english or foreign writers now we hear of art on every side and every novelist must give the world his opinion about schools and methods scott on the other hand lived in the greatest poetical ago since that of elizabeth poetry or the drama in which to be sure few succeeded occupied wordsworth byron coleridge shelley crabbe campbell and keats then as joanna baillie hyperbolically declared the scotch novels put poetry out of fashion  abbotsford manuscripts hogg averred that nobody either read or wrote poetry after sir walter took to prose  till they appeared novels seem to have been left to readers like the plaintive ladysmaid whom scott met at dalkeith when he beheld the fair one descend from the carriage with three halfbound volumes of a novel in her hand mr morritt writing to scott in march 1815 hopes he will restore pure narrative to the dignity from which it gradually slipped before it dwindled into a manufactory for the circulating library waverley he asserted would prevail over people otherwise averse to bluebacked volumes thus it was an unconsidered art which scott took up and revived half a century had passed since fielding gave us in tom jones his own and very different picture of life in the fortyfiveof life with all the romance of the race to derby cut down to a sentence or two since the age of the great english novelists richardson and fielding and miss burney the art of fiction had been spasmodically alive in the hands of mrs radcliffe had been sentimental with henry mackenzie and now was all but moribund save for the humorous irish sketches of miss edgeworth as scott always insisted it was mainly the extended and wellmerited fame of miss edgeworth which induced him to try his hand on a novel containing pictures of scottish life and character nothing was more remarkable in his own novels than the blending of close and humorous observation of common life with pleasure in adventurous narratives about what is not so and was not so and heaven forbid that it ever should be so as the girl says in the nursery tale through his whole life he remained the dreamer of dreams and teller of wild legends who had held the lads of the high school entranced round luckie browns fireside and had fleeted the summer days in interchange of romances with a schoolboy friend mr irving among the hills that girdle edinburgh he ever had a passion for knights and ladies and dragons and giants and god only knows he says how delighted i was to find myself in such society but with all this delight his imagination had other pleasures than the fantastic the humours and passions of ordinary existence were as clearly visible to him as the battles the castles and the giants true he was more fastidious in his choice of novels of real life than in his romantic reading the whole jemmy and jessamy tribe i abhorred he said and it required the art of burney or the feeling of mackenzie to fix my attention upon a domestic tale but when the domestic tale was good and true no man appreciated it more than he none has more vigorously applauded miss austen than scott and it was thus that as the author of waverley he addressed miss edgeworth through james ballantyne if i could but hit it miss edgeworths wonderful power of vivifying all her persons and making there live as beings in your mind i should not be afraid often ballantyne goes on has the author of waverley used such language to me and i knew that i gratified him most when i could say positively this is equal to miss edgeworth  thus scotts own taste was catholic and in this he was particularly unlike the modern novelists who proclaim from both sides of the atlantic that only in their own methods and in sharing their own exclusive tastes is literary salvation the prince of romance was no onesided romanticiste his ear was open to all fiction good in its kind his generosity made him think miss edgeworths persons more alive than his own to his own romances he preferred mrs shelleys frankenstein  scott reviewed frankenstein in 1818 mr shelley had sent it with a brief note it which he said that it was the work of a friend and that he had only seen it through the press sir walter passed the hook on to mr murritt who in reply gave scott a brief and not very accurate history of shelley sir walter then wrote a most favourable review of frankenstein in blackwoods magazine observing that it was attributed to mr percy bysshe shelley a soninlaw of mr godwin mrs shelley presently wrote thanking him for the review and assuring him that it was her own work scott had apparently taken shellers disclaimer as an innocent evasion it was an age of literary superscheries abbotsford manuscripts  as a critic of course he was mistaken but his was the generous error of the heart and it is the heart in walter scott even more than the brain that lends its own vitality to his creations equipped as he was with a taste truly catholic capable in old age of admiring pelham he had the power to do what he calls the big bowwow strain yet he was not as in his modesty he supposed denied the exquisite torch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment  the letter of rose bradwardine to waverley is alone enough to disprove scotts disparagement of himself his belief that he had been denied exquisiteness of touch nothing human is more delicate nothing should be more delicately handled than the first love of a girl what the analytical modern novelist would pass over and dissect and place beneath his microscope till a student of any manliness blushes with shame and annoyance scott suffers rose bradwardine to reveal with a sensitive shyness but scott of course had even less in common with the peeper and botanizer on maidens hearts than with the wildest romanticist he considered that a want of story is always fatal to a book the first reading and it is well if it gets a chance of a second from him pride and prejudice got a chance of three readings at least this generous universality of taste in addition to all his other qualities of humour and poetry enabled scott to raise the novel from its decadence and to make the dry bones of history live again in his tales with charles edward at holyrood as mr senior wrote in the quarterly review we are in the lofty region of romance in any other hands than those of sir walter scott the language and conduct of those great people would have been as dignified as their situations we should have heard nothing of the hero in his new costume majoring afore the muckle pierglass of his arrest by the hint of the candlestick of his examination by the wellpowdered major melville or of his fears of being informed against by mrs nosebag in short while the leading persons and events are as remote from ordinary life as the inventions of scudery the picture of human nature is as faithful as could have been given by fielding or le sage though this criticism has not the advantage of being new it is true and when we have added that scotts novels are the novels of the poet who next to shakspeare knew mankind most widely and well we have the secret of his triumph  for the first time in literature it was a poet who held the pen of the romancer in prose fielding richardson de foe miss rurnev were none of them made by the gods poetical scott himself with his habitual generosity would have hailed his own predecessor in mrs radcliffe the praise may be claimed for mrs radcliffe of having been the first to introduce into her prose fictions a beautiful and fanciful tone of natural description and impressive narrative which had hitherto been exclusively applied to poetry    mrs radcliffe has a title to be considered the first poetess of romantic fiction when guy mannering appeared wordsworth sneered at it as a work of the radcliffe school the slight difference produced by the introduction of humour could scarcely be visible to wordsworth but scott would not have been hurt by his judgment he had the literary courage to recognize merit even when obscured by extravagance and to applaud that in which people of culture could find neither excellence nor charm like thackeray he had been thrilled by vivaidi in the inquisition and he was not the man to hide his gratitude because his author was now out of fashion  thus we see that scott when he began waverley in 1805 brought to his labour no hardandfast theory of the art of fiction but a kindly readiness to be pleased and to find good in everything he brought his wide knowledge of contemporary scottish life from the peer to the ploughman he brought his welldigested wealth of antiquarian lore and the poetic skill which had just been busied with the lay of the last minstrel and was still to be occupied ere he finished his interrupted novel with marmion the lady of the lake rokeby and the lord of the isles the comparative failure of the lastnamed no doubt strengthened his determination to try prose romance he had never cared mach for his own poems he says byron had outdone him in popularity and the musethe good demon who once deserted herrickcame now less eagerly to his call it is curiously difficult to disentangle the statements about the composition of waverley our first authority of course is scotts own account given in the general preface to the edition of 1829 lockhart however remarks on the haste with which sir walter wrote the introductions to the magnum opus and the lapse of fifteen years the effects of disease and his habitual carelessness about his own works and mode of working may certainly to some extent have clouded his memory about the year 1805 as he says he threw together about one third part of the first volume of waverley it was advertised to be published he goes on by ballantvne with the second title t is fifty years since this obviously would have made 1755 the date of the events just as the title t is sixty years since in 1814 brought the date of the events to 1754 by inspecting the watermark of the paper lockhart discovered that 1805 was the period in which the first few chapters were composed the rest of the paper was marked 1814 scott next observes that the unfavourable opinion of a critical friend on the first seven chapters induced him to lay the manuscript aside who was this friend lockhart thinks it was erskine it is certain from a letter of ballantynes at abbotsforda letter printed by lockhart september 15 1810that ballantyne in 1810 saw at least the earlier portions of waverley and it is clear enough that he had seen none of it before if any friend did read it in 1805 it cannot have been ballantyne and may have been erskine but none of the paper bears a watermark between 1805 and 1813 so scott must merely have taken it up in 1810 as it had been for five years now scott says that the success of the lady of the lake with its highland pictures induced him to attempt something of the same sort in prose this as lockhart notes cannot refer to 1805 as the lady of the lake did not appear till 1810 but the good fortune of the lady may very well have induced him in 1810 to reconsider his highland prose romance in 1808 as appears from an undated letter to surtees of mainsforth abbotsford manuscripts he was contemplating a poem on that wandering knight so fair charles edward and on the adventures of his flight on lochiel flora macdonald the kennedys and the rest earlier still on june 9 1806 scott wrote to lady abercorn that he had a great work in contemplation a highland romance of love magic and war the lady of the lake took the place of that poem in his century of inventions and stimulated by the popularity of his highland romance in verse he disinterred the last seven chapters of waverley from their five years of repose very probably as he himself hints the exercise of fitting a conclusion to strutts queenloo hall may have helped to bring his fancy back to his own halfforgotten story of waverley in 1811 scott went to abbotsford and there as he tells us he lost sight of his waverley fragment  often looked for it was never found till the accident of a search for fishingtackle led him to discover it in the drawer of an old bureau in a lumbergarret this cabinet afterwards came into the possession of mr william laidlaw scotts friend and amanuensis and it is still the editor understands in the hands of miss laidlaw the fishingtackle miss laidlaw tells the editor mainly red hackles tied on hair not gut still occupies the drawer except a few flies which were given as relics to the late mr thomas tod stoddart in 1813 then volume i of waverley was finished then scott undertook some articles for constable and laid the novel aside the printing at last must have been very speedy dining in edinburgh in june 1814 lockhart saw the hand of walter scott busy at its task page after page is finished and thrown on the heap of manuscripts and still it goes on unwearied the book was published on july 7 the press hardly keeping up with the activity of the author scott had written two volumes in three summer weeks and the printers had not shown less activity while binders and stitchers must have worked extra tides  waverley was published without the authors name scotts reasons for being anonymous have been stated by himself it was his humourthat is the best of the reasons and the secret gave him a great deal of amusement the ballantynes of course knew it from the first so did mr morritt lady louisa stuart and lord and lady montague and others were gradually admitted in an undated letter probably of november 1816 scott says to the marchioness of abercorn a most intimate friend i cannot even conjecture whom you mean by mr mackenzie as author of the antiquary i should think my excellent old friend mr harry mackenzie author of the man of feeling etc was too much advanced in years and plugged in business to amuse himself by writing novels and besides the style in no degree resembles his lady abercorn meant young harry mackenzie not the patriarch i am told one of the english reviews gives these works by name and upon alleged authority to george forbes sir williams brother so they take them off my hands i dont care who they turn to for i am really tired of an imputation which i am under the necessity of confuting at every corner tom will soon be home from canada as the death of my elder brother has left him a little money he may answer for himself but i hardly suspect him unless much changed to be possessed of the perseverance necessary to write nine volumes scott elsewhere rather encouraged the notion that his brother thomas was the author and tried to make him exert himself and enter the field as a rival gossip also assigned the scotch novels to jeffrey to mrs thomas scott aided by her husband and sir walter to a dr greenfield a clergyman and to many others sir walter humorously suggested george cranstoun as the real offender after the secret was publicly confessed lady louisa stuart reminded scott of all the amusement it had given them old mortality had been pronounced too good for scott and free from his wearisome descriptions of scenery clever people had detected several separate hands in old mortality as in the iliad all this was diverting moreover scott was in some degree protected from the bores who pester a successful author he could deny the facts very stoutly though always as he insists with the reservation implied in alleging that if he had been the author he would still have declined to confess in the notes to later novels we shall see some of his great denials  the reception of waverley was enthusiastic large editions were sold in edinburgh and when scott returned from his cruise in the northern islands he found society ringing with his unacknowledged triumph byron especially proclaimed his pleasure in waverley it may be curious to recall some of the published reviews of the moment probably no author ever lived so indifferent to published criticism as scott miss edgeworth in one of her letters reminds him how they had both agreed that writers who cared for the dignity and serenity of their characters should abstain from that authors banestuff as to the herd of critics scott wrote to miss seward after publishing the lay many of those gentlemen appear to me to be a set of tinkers who unable to make pots and pans set up for menders of them it is probable therefore that he was quite unconcerned about the few remarks which mr gifford in the quarterly review vol xl 1814 interspersed among a multitude of extracts in a notice of waverley manufactured with scissors and paste the quarterly recognized a scotch castle rackrent but in a much higher strain the tale was admitted to possess all the accuracy of history and all the vivacity of romance scotts second novel guy mannering was attacked with some viciousness in the periodical of which he was practically the founder and already the critic was anxious to repeat what scott talking of popes censors calls the cuckoo cry of written out the notice of waverley in the edinburgh review by mr jeffrey was not so slight and so unworthy of the topic the novel was declared and not unjustly to be very hastily and in many places very unskilfully written the scotch was decried as unintelligible dialect by the very reviewer who had accused marmion of not being scotch enough but the edinburgh applauded the extraordinary fidelity and felicity with which all the inferior agents in the story are represented fastidious readers might find callum beg and mrs nosebag and the cumberland peasants coarse and disgusting said the reviewer who must have had in his imagination readers extremely superfine he objected to the earlier chapters as uninteresting andwith justiceto the passages where the author speaks in the smart and flippant style of modern makers of paragraphs these form a strange and humiliating contrast with the force and freedom of his manner when engaged in those dramatic and picturesque representations to which his genius so decidedly inclines he spoke severely of the places where scott explains the circumstances of waverleys adventures before he reaches edinburgh and scott himself in his essay on mrs radcliffe regrets that explanatory chapters had ever been invented the reviewer broadly hints his belief that scott is the author and on the whole except for a cautious lack of enthusiasm the notice is fair and kindly the monthly review differed not much from the blue and yellow the edinburgh review  it is not one of the least merits of this very uncommon production that all the subordinate characters are touched with the same discriminating force which so strongly marks their principals and that in this manner almost every variety of station and interest such as existed at the period under review is successively brought before the mind of the reader in colours vivid as the original  a few oversights we think we have detected in the conduct of the story which ought not to remain unnoticed for example the age of stanley and lady emily does not seem well to accord with the circumstances of their union as related in the commencement of the work and we are not quite satisfied that edward should have been so easily reconciled to the barbarous and stubborn prejudices which precluded even the office of intercession for his gallant friend and companioninarms  the pieces of poetry which are not very profusely scattered through these volumes can scarcely fail to be ascribed to mr scott whatever may be judged of the body of the work in point of comparative merit we should class them neither with the highest nor with the meanest effusions of his lyric minstrelsy  lord byrons grandmothers review the british was also friendly and sagacious in its elderly way  we request permission therefore to introduce waverley a publication which has already excited considerable interest in the sister kingdom to the literary world on this side the tweed  a very short time has elapsed since this publication made its appearance in edinburgh and though it came into the world in the modest garb of anonymous obscurity the northern literati are unanimous we understand in ascribing part of it at least to the pen of w scott  we are unwilling to consider this publication in the light of a common novel whose fate it is to be devoured with rapidity for a day and afterwards forgotten forever but as a vehicle of curious and accurate information upon a subject which must at all times demand our attentionthe history and manners of a very large and renowned portion of the inhabitants of these islands we would recommend this tale as faithfully embodying the lives the manners and the opinions of this departed race and as affording those features of ancient days which no man probably besides its author has had the means to collect the desire to preserve or the power to portray  although there are characters sufficient to awaken the attention and to diversify the scenes yet they are not in sufficient number to perplex the memory or to confuse the incidents their spirit is well kept up till the very last and they relieve one another with so much art that the reader will not find himself wearied even with the pedantic jargon of the old baron of bradwardine  of waverley himself we shall say but little as his character is far too common to need a comment we can only say that his wanderings are not gratuitous nor is he wavering and indecisive only because the author chooses to make him so every feature in his character is formed by education and it is to this first source that we are constantly referred for a just and sufficient cause of all the wandering passions as they arise in his mind  the secondary personages are drawn with much spirit and fidelity and with a very striking knowledge of the peculiarities of the scotch temper and disposition the incidents are all founded on fact and the historical parts are related with much accuracy the livelier scenes which are displayed are of the most amusing species because they flow so naturally from the personages before us that the characters not the author appear to speak a strong vein of very original humour marks the whole in most instances it is indeed of a local and particular nature but in many cases it assumes a more general appearance  of the more serious portions we can speak with unqualified approbation the very few pathetic scenes which occur are short dignifed and affecting the lovescenes are sufficiently contracted to produce that very uncommon sensation in the minda wish that they were longer  the religious opinions expressed in the course of the tale are few but of those few we fully approve  the humorous and happy adaptation of legal terns shows no moderate acquaintance with the arcana of the law and a perpetual allusion to the english and latin classics no common share of scholarship and taste  the scots magazine illustrated the admirable unanimity of reviewers when they are unanimous the antijacobin objected that no chateaumargaux sent in the wood from bordeaux to dundee in 1713 could have been drinkable in 1741 claret twoandthirty years old it almost gives us the gripes to think of it indeed sir walter as lochhart assures us was so far from being a judge of claret that he could not tell when it was corked one or two points equally important amused the reviewer who like most of his class detected the hand of scott there was hardly a possibility as mr morritt told sir walter that the poems in waverley could fail to suggest their author no man who ever heard you tell a story over a table but must recognize you at once to his praise of waverley mr morritt hardly added any adverse criticism beyond doubting the merit of the early chapters and denouncing the word sombre as one which had lately kept bad company among the slipshod english of the sentimental school scott in defence informed mr morritt that he had left the story to flag in the first volume on purpose    i wished with what success heaven knows to avoid the ordinary error of novelists whose first volume is usually their best  it must be admitted that if scott wished to make waverley flag in the beginning he succeeded extremely welltoo well for many modern readers accustomed to a leap into the midst of the story these introductory chapters he observes in a note on the fifth of them have been a good deal censured as tedious and unnecessary yet there are circumstances recorded in them which the author has not been able to persuade himself to retract or cancel these circumstances are probably the studies of waverley his romantic readings which are really autobiographic scott was apparently seriously of opinion that the mental discipline of a proper classical education would have been better for himself than his own delightfully desultory studies ballantyne could not see what waverleys reading had to do with his adventures and character scott persisted in being of another mind he himself writing to morritt calls his hero a sneaking piece of imbecility but he probably started with loftier intentions of psychological analysis than he fulfilled he knew and often said in private letters as in published works that he was no hand at a respectable hero borderers buccaneers robber and humorsome people like dugald dalgetty and bailie nicol jarvie and macwheeble whom he said he preferred to any person in waverley were the characters he delighted in we may readily believe that shakspeare too preferred jacques and the fat knight to orlando or the favoured lover of anne page your hero is a difficult person to make humanunless indeed he has the defects of pendennis or tom jones but it is likely enough that the waverley whom scott had in his mind in 1805 was hardly the waverley of 1813 his early english chapters are much in the ordinary vein of novels as they were then written in those chapters come the asides by the author which the edinburgh review condemned but there remains the kindly honourable sir everard while the calm atmosphere of english meadows and the plump charms of miss cecilia stubbs are intended as foils to the hills of the north the shy refinement of rose and the heroic heart of flora macivor scott wished to show the remote extremes of civilization and mental habit coexisting in the same island of scotland and england yet we regret such passages as craving pardon for my heroics which i am unable in certain cases to resist giving way to and so forth scott was no thackeray no fielding and failed chiefly in waverley when he attempted the mood of banter which one of his daughters a lady of beatrices mind never got from me he observes  in any serious attempt to criticise waverley as a whole it is not easy to say whether we should try to put ourselves at the point of view of its first readers or whether we should look at it from the vantageground of today in 1811 the dead world of clannish localty was fresh in many memories scotts own usher had often spoken with a person who had seen cromwell enter edinburgh after dunbar he himself knew heroes of the fortyfive and his friend lady louisa stuart had been well acquainted with miss walkinshaw sister of the mistress of charles edward to his generation those things were personal memories which to us seem as distant as the reign of menkara they could not but be carried off their feet by such pictures of a past still so near them nor had they other great novelists to weaken the force of scotts impressions they had not to compare him with the melancholy mirth of thackeray and the charm the magic of his style balzac was of the future of the future was the scott of francethe boyish the witty the rapid the brilliant the inexhaustible dumas scotts generation had no scruples abort realism listened to no sermons on the glory of the commonplace like dr johnson they admired a book which was amusing as a fairytale but we are overwhelmed with a wealth of comparisons and deafened by a multitude of homilies on fiction and distracted like the people in the erybyggja saga by the strange rising and setting and the wild orbits of new weirdmoons of romance before we can make up our minds on scott we have to remember or forget the scornful patronage of one critic the oversubtlety and exaggerations of another the more than papal infallibility of a third perhaps the best critic would be an intelligent schoolboy with a generous heart and an unspoiled imagination as his remarks are not accessible as we must try to judge waverley like readers inured to much fiction and much criticism we must confess no doubt that the commencement has the faults which the first reviewers detected and it which scott acknowledged he is decidedly slow in getting to business as they say he began with more of conscious ethical purpose than he went on and his banter is poor but when once we enter the village of tullyveolan the magician finds his wand each picture of place or person tellsthe old butler the daft davie gellatley the solemn and chivalrous baron the pretty natural girl the various lairds the factor macwheebleall at once become living people and friends whom we can never lose the creative fire of shakspeare lives again the highlandersevan dhu donald bean lean his charming daughter callum beg and all the restare as natural as the lowlanders in fergus and flora we feel indeed at first that the author has left his experience behind and is giving us creatures of fancy but they too become human and naturalfergus in his moods of anger ambition and final courageous resignation flora in her grief as for waverley his creator was no doubt too hard on him among the brave we hear that he was one of the bravest though scott always wrote his battlepieces in a manner to suggest no discomfort and does not give us particular details of waverleys prowess he has spirit enough this sneaking piece of imbecility as he shows in his quarrel with fergus on the march to derby waverley that creature of romance considered as a lover is really not romantic enough he loved rose because she loved himwhich is confessed to be unheroic behaviour scott in waverley certainly does not linger over lovescenes with mr ruskin we may say let it not be thought for an instant that the slight and sometimes scornful glance with which scott passes over scenes which a novelist of our own day would have analyzed with the airs of a philosopher and painted with the curiosity of a gossip indicates any absence in his heart of sympathy with the great and sacred elements of personal happiness but his mind entertained other themes of interest loyalty patriotism piety on the other hand it is necessary to differ from mr ruskin when he says that scott never knew lamor che move l sol e l altre stelle he whose heart was broken for two years and retained the crack till his dying day he who when old and tired and near his death was yet moved by the memory of the name which thirty years before he had cut in runic characters on the turf at the castlegate of st andrew knew love too well to write of it much or to speak of it at all he had won his ideal as alone the ideal can be won he never lost her she was with him always because she had been unattainable there are few he says who have not at one period of life broken ties of love and friendship secret disappointments of the heart to mourn overand we know no book which recalls the memory of them more severely than julia de roubigne he could not be very eager to recall them he who had so bitterly endured them and because he had known and always knew lamor che move l sol e laltre stelle a seal was on his lips a silence broken only by a caress of di vernons  this apology we may make if an apology be needed for what modern readers may think the meagreness of the lovepassages in scott he does not deal in embraces and effusions his taste is too manly he does not dwell much on love because like the shepherd in theocritus he has found him an inhabitant of the rocks moreover when scott began novelwriting he was as old as thackeray when thackeray said that while at work on a lovescene he blushed so that you would think he was going into an apoplexy waverley stands by its pictures of manners of character by its humour and its tenderness by its manly criticism of life by its touches of poetry so various so inspired as in davie gellatley with his songs and charles edward in the gallant hour of holyrood and flora with her high selfless hopes and broken heart and the beloved baron bearing his lot with a goodhumoured though serious composure to be sure we may say with virgilius maro fuimus troes and there s the end of an auld sang but houses and families and men have a stood lang eneugh when they have stood till they fall with honour  waverley ends like a fairytale while real life ever ends like a northern saga but among the good things that make life bearable such fairytales are not the least precious and not the least enduring     introduction   the plan of this edition leads me to insert in this place some account of the incidents on which the novel of waverley is founded they have been already given to the public by my late lamented friend william erskine esq afterwards lord kinneder when reviewing the tales of my landlord for the quarterly review in 1817 the particulars were derived by the critic from the authors information afterwards they were published in the preface to the chronicles of the canongate they are now inserted in their proper place  the mutual protection afforded by waverley and talbot to each other upon which the whole plot depends is founded upon one of those anecdotes which soften the features even of civil war and as it is equally honourable to the memory of both parties we have no hesitation to give their names at length when the highlanders on the morning of the battle of preston 1745 made their memorable attack on sir john copes army a battery of four fieldpieces was stormed and carried by the camerons and the stewarts of appine the late alexander stewart of invernahylewas one of the foremost in the charge and observing an officer of the kings forces who scorning to join the flight of all around remained with his sword in his hand as if determined to the very last to defend the post assigned to him the highland gentleman commanded him to surrender and received for reply a thrust which he caught in his target the officer was now defenceless and the battleaxe of a gigantic highlander the miller of invernahyles mill was uplifted to dash his brains out when mr stewart with difficulty prevailed on him to yield he took charge of his enemys property protected his person and finally obtained him liberty on his parole the officer proved to be colonel whitefoord an ayrshire gentleman of high character and influence and warmly attached to the house of hanover yet such was the confidence existing between these two honourable men though of different political principles that while the civil war was raging and straggling officers from the highland army were executed without mercy invernahyle hesitated not to pay his late captive a visit as he returned to the highlands to raise fresh recruits on which occasion he spent a day or two in ayrshire among colonel whitefoords whig friends as pleasantly and as goodhumouredly as if all had been at peace around him  after the battle of culloden had ruined the hopes of charles edward and dispersed his proscribed adherents it was colonel whitefoords turn to strain every nerve to obtain mr stewarts pardon he went to the lord justice clerk to the lord advocate and to all the officers of state and each application was answered by the production of a list in which invernahyle as the good old gentleman was wont to express it appeared marked with the sign of the beast as a subject unfit for favour or pardon  at length colonel whitefoord applied to the duke of cumberland in person from him also he received a positive refusal he then limited his request for the present to a protection for stewarts house wife children and property this was also refused by the duke on which colonel whitefoord taking his commission from his bosom laid it on the table before his royal highness with much emotion and asked permission to retire from the service of a sovereign who did not know how to spare a vanquished enemy the duke was struck and even affected he bade the colonel take up his commission and granted the protection he required it was issued just in time to save the house corn and cattle at invernahyle from the troops who were engaged in laying waste what it was the fashion to call the country of the enemy a small encampment of soldiers was formed on invernahyles property which they spared while plundering the country around and searching in every direction for the leaders of the insurrection and for stewart in particular he was much nearer them than they suspected for hidden in a cave like the baron of bradwardine he lay for many days so near the english sentinels that he could hear their musterroll called his food was brought to him by one of his daughters a child of eight years old whom mrs stewart was under the necessity of entrusting with this commission for her own motions and those of all her elder inmates were closely watched with ingenuity beyond her years the child used to stray about among the soldiers who were rather kind to her and thus seize the moment when she was unobserved and steal into the thicket when she deposited whatever small store of provisions she had in charge at some marked spot where her father might find it invernahyle supported life for several weeks by means of these precarious supplies and as he had been wounded in the battle of culloden the hardships which he endured were aggravated by great bodily pain after the soldiers had removed their quarters he had another remarkable escape  as he now ventured to his own house at night and left it in the morning he was espied during the dawn by a party of the enemy who fired at and pursued him the fugitive being fortunate enough to escape their search they returned to the house and charged the family with harbouring one of the proscribed traitors an old woman had presence of mind enough to maintain that the man they had seen was the shepherd why did he not stop when we called to him said the soldier he is as deaf poor man as a peatstack answered the readywitted domestic let him be sent for directly the real shepherd accordingly was brought from the hill and as there was time to tutor him by the way he was as deaf when he made his appearance as was necessary to sustain his character invernahyle was afterwards pardoned under the act of indemnity  the author knew him well and has often heard these circumstances from his own mouth he was a noble specimen of the old highlander far descended gallant courteous and brave even to chivalry he had been out i believe in 1715 and 1745 was an active partaker in all the stirring scenes which passed in the highlands betwixt these memorable eras and i have heard was remarkable among other exploits for having fought a duel with the broadsword with the celebrated rob roy macgregor at the clachan of balquidder  invernahyle chanced to be in edinburgh when paul jones came into the firth of forth and though then an old man i saw him in arms and heard him exult to use his own words in the prospect of drawing his claymore once more before he died in fact on that memorable occasion when the capital of scotland was menaced by three trifling sloops or brigs scarce fit to have sacked a fishing village he was the only man who seemed to propose a plan of resistance he offered to the magistrates if broadswords and dirks could be obtained to find as many highlanders among the lower classes as would cut off any boats crew who might be sent into a town full of narrow and winding passages in which they were like to disperse in quest of plunder i know not if his plan was attended to i rather think it seemed too hazardous to the constituted authorities who might not even at that time desire to see arms in highland hands a steady and powerful west wind settled the matter by sweeping paul jones and his vessels out of the firth  if there is something degrading in this recollection it is not unpleasant to compare it with those of the last war when edinburgh besides regular forces and militia furnished a volunteer brigade of cavalry infantry and artillery to the amount of six thousand men and upwards which was in readiness to meet and repel a force of a far more formidable description than was commanded by the adventurous american time and circumstances change the character of nations and the fate of cities and it is some pride to a scotchman to reflect that the independent and manly character of a country willing to entrust its own protection to the arms of its children after having been obscured for half a century has during the course of his own lifetime recovered its lustre  other illustrations of waverley will be found in the notes at the foot of the pages to which they belong those which appeared too long to be so placed are given at the end of the chapters to which they severally relate footnote in this edition at the end of the several volumes     preface to the third edition   to this slight attempt at a sketch of ancient scottish manners the public have been more favourable than the author durst have hoped or expected he has heard with a mixture of satisfaction and humility his work ascribed to more than one respectable name considerations which seem weighty in his particular situation prevent his releasing those gentlemen from suspicion by placing his own name in the titlepage so that for the present at least it must remain uncertain whether waverley be the work of a poet or a critic a lawyer or a clergyman or whether the writer to use mrs malaprops phrase be like cerberus three gentlemen at once the author as he is unconscious of anything in the work itself except perhaps its frivolity which prevents its finding an acknowledged father leaves it to the candour of the public to choose among the many circumstances peculiar to different situations in life such as may induce him to suppress his name on the present occasion he may be a writer new to publication and unwilling to avow a character to which he is unaccustomed or he may be a hackneyed author who is ashamed of too frequent appearance and employs this mystery as the heroine of the old comedy used her mask to attract the attention of those to whom her face had become too familiar he may be a man of a grave profession to whom the reputation of being a novelwriter might be prejudicial or he may be a man of fashion to whom writing of any kind might appear pedantic he may be too young to assume the character of an author or so old as to make it advisable to lay it aside  the author of waverley has heard it objected to this novel that in the character of callum beg and in the account given by the baron of bradwardine of the petty trespasses of the highlanders upon trifling articles of property he has borne hard and unjustly so upon their national character nothing could be farther from his wish or intention the character of callum beg is that of a spirit naturally turned to daring evil and determined by the circumstances of his situation to a particular species of mischief those who have perused the curious letters from the highlands published about 1726 will find instances of such atrocious characters which fell under the writers own observation though it would be most unjust to consider such villains as representatives of the highlanders of that period any more than the murderers of marr and williamson can be supposed to represent the english of the present day as for the plunder supposed to have been picked up by some of the insurgents in 1745 it must be remembered that although the way of that unfortunate little army was neither marked by devastation nor bloodshed but on the contrary was orderly and quiet in a most wonderful degree yet no army marches through a country in a hostile manner without committing some depredations and several to the extent and of the nature jocularly imputed to them by the baron were really laid to the charge of the highland insurgents for which many traditions and particularly one respecting the knight of the mirror may be quoted as good evidence footnote a homely metrical narrative of the events of the period which contains some striking particulars and is still a great favourite with the lower classes gives a very correct statement of the behaviour of the mountaineers respecting this same military license and as the verses are little known and contain some good sense we venture to insert them       the authors address to all in general       now gentle readers i have let you ken     my very thoughts from

face       waverley  or  tis sixty years since  volume i     chapter i  introductory   the title of this work has not been chosen without the grave and solid deliberation which matters of importance demand from the prudent even its first or general denomination was the result of no common research or selection although according to the example of my predecessors i had only to seize upon the most sounding and euphonic surname that english history or topography affords and elect it at once as the title of my work and the name of my hero but alas what could my readers have expected from the chivalrous epithets of howard mordaunt mortimer or stanley or from the softer and more sentimental sounds of belmour belville belfield and belgrave but pages of inanity similar to those which have been so christened for half a century past i must modestly admit i am too diffident of my own merit to place it in unnecessary opposition to preconceived associations i have therefore like a maiden knight with his white shield assumed for my hero waverley an uncontaminated name bearing with its sound little of good or evil excepting what the reader shall hereafter be pleased to affix to it but my second or supplemental title was a matter of much more difficult election since that short as it is may be held as pledging the author to some special mode of laying his scene drawing his characters and managing his adventures had i for example announced in my frontispiece waverley a tale of other days must not every novelreader have anticipated a castle scarce less than that of udolpho of which the eastern wing had long been uninhabited and the keys either lost or consigned to the care of some aged butler or housekeeper whose trembling steps about the middle of the second volume were doomed to guide the hero or heroine to the ruinous precincts would not the owl have shrieked and the cricket cried in my very titlepage and could it have been possible for me with a moderate attention to decorum to introduce any scene more lively than might be produced by the jocularity of a clownish but faithful valet or the garrulous narrative of the heroines filledechambre when rehearsing the stories of blood and horror which she had heard in the servants hall again had my title borne waverley a romance from the german what head so obtuse as not to image forth a profligate abbot an oppressive duke a secret and mysterious association of rosycrucians and illuminati with all their properties of black cowls caverns daggers electrical machines trapdoors and darklanterns or if i had rather chosen to call my work a sentimental tale would it not have been a sufficient presage of a heroine with a profusion of auburn hair and a harp the soft solace of her solitary hours which she fortunately finds always the means of transporting from castle to cottage although she herself be sometimes obliged to jump out of a twopairofstairs window and is more than once bewildered on her journey alone and on foot without any guide but a blowzy peasant girl whose jargon she hardly can understand or again if my waverley had been entitled a tale of the times wouldst thou not gentle reader have demanded from me a dashing sketch of the fashionable world a few anecdotes of private scandal thinly veiled and if lusciously painted so much the better a heroine from grosvenor square and a hero from the barouche club or the fourinhand with a set of subordinate characters from the elegantes of queen anne street east or the dashing heroes of the bowstreet office i could proceed in proving the importance of a titlepage and displaying at the same time my own intimate knowledge of the particular ingredients necessary to the composition of romances and novels of various descriptionsbut it is enough and i scorn to tyrannise longer over the impatience of my reader who is doubtless already anxious to know the choice made by an author so profoundly versed in the different branches of his art  by fixing then the date of my story sixty years before this present 1st november 1805 i would have my readers understand that they will meet in the following pages neither a romance of chivalry nor a tale of modern manners that my hero will neither have iron on his shoulders as of yore nor on the heels of his boots as is the present fashion of bond street and that my damsels will neither be clothed in purple and in pall like the lady alice of an old ballad nor reduced to the primitive nakedness of a modern fashionable at a rout from this my choice of an era the understanding critic may farther presage that the object of my tale is more a description of men than manners a tale of manners to be interesting must either refer to antiquity so great as to have become venerable or it must bear a vivid reflection of those scenes which are passing daily before our eyes and are interesting from their novelty thus the coatofmail of our ancestors and the triplefurred pelisse of our modern beaux may though for very different reasons be equally fit for the array of a fictitious character but who meaning the costume of his hero to be impressive would willingly attire him in the court dress of george the seconds reign with its no collar large sleeves and low pocketholes the same may be urged with equal truth of the gothic hall which with its darkened and tinted windows its elevated and gloomy roof and massive oaken table garnished with boarshead and rosemary pheasants and peacocks cranes and cygnets has an excellent effect in fictitious description much may also be gained by a lively display of a modern fete such as we have daily recorded in that part of a newspaper entitled the mirror of fashion if we contrast these or either of them with the splendid formality of an entertainment given sixty years since and thus it will be readily seen how much the painter of antique or of fashionable manners gains over him who delineates those of the last generation  considering the disadvantages inseparable from this part of my subject i must be understood to have resolved to avoid them as much as possible by throwing the force of my narrative upon the characters and passions of the actorsthose passions common to men in all stages of society and which have alike agitated the human heart whether it throbbed under the steel corslet of the fifteenth century the brocaded coat of the eighteenth or the blue frock and white dimity waistcoat of the present day footnote alas that attire respectable and gentlemanlike in 1805 or thereabouts is now as antiquated as the author of waverley has himself become since that period the reader of fashion will please to fill up the costume with an embroidered waistcoat of purple velvet or silk and a coat of whatever colour he pleases upon these passions it is no doubt true that the state of manners and laws casts a necessary colouring but the bearings to use the language of heraldry remain the same though the tincture may be not only different but opposed in strong contradistinction the wrath of our ancestors for example was coloured gules it broke forth in acts of open and sanguinary violence against the objects of its fury our malignant feelings which must seek gratification through more indirect channels and undermine the obstacles which they cannot openly bear down may be rather said to be tinctured sable but the deepruling impulse is the same in both cases and the proud peer who can now only ruin his neighbour according to law by protracted suits is the genuine descendant of the baron who wrapped the castle of his competitor in flames and knocked him on the head as he endeavoured to escape from the conflagration it is from the great book of nature the same through a thousand editions whether of blackletter or wirewove and hotpressed that i have venturously essayed to read a chapter to the public some favourable opportunities of contrast have been afforded me by the state of society in the northern part of the island at the period of my history and may serve at once to vary and to illustrate the moral lessons which i would willingly consider as the most important part of my plan although i am sensible how short these will fall of their aim if i shall be found unable to mix them with amusementa task not quite so easy in this critical generation as it was sixty years since     chapter ii  waverleyhonoura retrospect   it is then sixty years since edward waverley the hero of the following pages took leave of his family to join the regiment of dragoons in which he had lately obtained a commission it was a melancholy day at waverleyhonour when the young officer parted with sir everard the affectionate old uncle to whose title and estate he was presumptive heir  a difference in political opinions had early separated the baronet from his younger brother richard waverley the father of our hero sir everard had inherited from his sires the whole train of tory or highchurch predilections and prejudices which had distinguished the house of waverley since the great civil war richard on the contrary who was ten years younger beheld himself born to the fortune of a second brother and anticipated neither dignity nor entertainment in sustaining the character of will wimble he saw early that to succeed in the race of life it was necessary he should carry as little weight as possible painters talk of the difficulty of expressing the existence of compound passions in the same features at the same moment it would be no less difficult for the moralist to analyse the mixed motives which unite to form the impulse of our actions richard waverley read and satisfied himself from history and sound argument that in the words of the old song  passive obedience was a jest and pshaw was nonresistance  yet reason would have probably been unable to combat and remove hereditary prejudice could richard have anticipated that his elder brother sir everard taking to heart an early disappointment would have remained a bachelor at seventytwo the prospect of succession however remote might in that case have led him to endure dragging through the greater part of his life as master richard at the hall the baronets brother in the hope that ere its conclusion he should be distinguished as sir richard waverley of waverleyhonour successor to a princely estate and to extended political connections as head of the county interest in the shire where it lay  but this was a consummation of things not to be expected at richards outset when sir everard was in the prime of life and certain to be an acceptable suitor in almost any family whether wealth or beauty should be the object of his pursuit and when indeed his speedy marriage was a report which regularly amused the neighbourhood once a year his younger brother saw no practicable road to independence save that of relying upon his own exertions and adopting a political creed more consonant both to reason and his own interest than the hereditary faith of sir everard in highchurch and in the house of stuart he therefore read his recantation at the beginning of his career and entered life as an avowed whig and friend of the hanover succession  the ministry of george the firsts time were prudently anxious to diminish the phalanx of opposition the tory nobility depending for their reflected lustre upon the sunshine of a court had for some time been gradually reconciling themselves to the new dynasty but the wealthy country gentlemen of england a rank which retained with much of ancient manners and primitive integrity a great proportion of obstinate and unyielding prejudice stood aloof in haughty and sullen opposition and cast many a look of mingled regret and hope to bois le due avignon and italy footnote where the chevalier st george or as he was termed the old pretender held his exiled court as his situation compelled him to shift his place of residence the accession of the near relation of one of those steady and inflexible opponents was considered as a means of bringing over more converts and therefore richard waverley met with a share of ministerial favour more than proportioned to his talents or his political importance it was however discovered that he had respectable talents for public business and the first admittance to the ministers levee being negotiated his success became rapid sir everard learned from the public newsletter first that richard waverley esquire was returned for the ministerial borough of barterfaith next that richard waverley esquire had taken a distinguished part in the debate upon the excise bill in the support of government and lastly that richard waverley esquire had been honoured with a seat at one of those boards where the pleasure of serving the country is combined with other important gratifications which to render them the more acceptable occur regularly once a quarter  although these events followed each other so closely that the sagacity of the editor of a modern newspaper would have presaged the two last even while he announced the first yet they came upon sir everard gradually and drop by drop as it were distilled through the cool and procrastinating alembic of dyers weekly letter footnote see note i  for it may be observed in passing that instead of those mailcoaches by means of which every mechanic at his sixpenny club may nightly learn from twenty contradictory channels the yesterdays news of the capital a weekly post brought in those days to waverleyhonour a weekly intelligencer which after it had gratified sir everards curiosity his sisters and that of his aged butler was regularly transferred from the hall to the rectory from the rectory to squire stubbss at the grange from the squire to the baronets steward at his neat white house on the heath from the steward to the bailiff and from him through a huge circle of honest dames and gaffers by whose hard and horny hands it was generally worn to pieces in about a month after its arrival  this slow succession of intelligence was of some advantage to richard waverley in the case before us for had the sum total of his enormities reached the ears of sir everard at once there can be no doubt that the new commissioner would have had little reason to pique himself on the success of his politics the baronet although the mildest of human beings was not without sensitive points in his character his brothers conduct had wounded these deeply the waverley estate was fettered by no entail for it had never entered into the head of any of its former possessors that one of their progeny could be guilty of the atrocities laid by dyers letter to the door of richard and if it had the marriage of the proprietor might have been fatal to a collateral heir these various ideas floated through the brain of sir everard without however producing any determined conclusion  he examined the tree of his genealogy which emblazoned with many an emblematic mark of honour and heroic achievement hung upon the wellvarnished wainscot of his hall the nearest descendants of sir hildebrand waverley failing those of his eldest son wilfred of whom sir everard and his brother were the only representatives were as this honoured register informed him and indeed as he himself well knew the waverleys of highley park com hants   with whom the main branch or rather stock of the house had renounced all connection since the great lawsuit in 1670  this degenerate scion had committed a farther offence against the head and source of their gentility by the intermarriage of their representative with judith heiress of oliver bradshawe of highley park whose arms the same with those of bradshawe the  regicide they had quartered with the ancient coat of waverley these offences however had vanished from sir everards recollection in the heat of his resentment and had lawyer clippurse for whom his groom was despatched express arrived but an hour earlier he might have had the benefit of drawing a new settlement of the lordship and manor of waverleyhonour with all its dependencies but an hour of cool reflection is a great matter when employed in weighing the comparative evil of two measures to neither of which we are internally partial lawyer clippurse found his patron involved in a deep study which he was too respectful to disturb otherwise than by producing his paper and leathern inkcase as prepared to minute his honours commands even this slight manoeuvre was embarrassing to sir everard who felt it as a reproach to his indecision he looked at the attorney with some desire to issue his fiat when the sun emerging from behind a cloud poured at once its chequered light through the stained window of the gloomy cabinet in which they were seated the baronets eye as he raised it to the splendour fell right upon the central scutcheon inpressed with the same device which his ancestor was said to have borne in the field of hastingsthree ermines passant argent in a field azure with its appropriate motto sans tache may our name rather perish exclaimed sir everard than that ancient and loyal symbol should be blended with the dishonoured insignia of a traitorous roundhead  all this was the effect of the glimpse of a sunbeam just sufficient to light lawyer clippurse to mend his pen the pen was mended in vain the attorney was dismissed with directions to hold himself in readiness on the first summons  the apparition of lawyer clippurse at the hall occasioned much speculation in that portion of the world to which waverleyhonour formed the centre but the more judicious politicians of this microcosm augured yet worse consequences to richard waverley from a movement which shortly followed his apostasy this was no less than an excursion of the baronet in his coachandsix with four attendants in rich liveries to make a visit of some duration to a noble peer on the confines of the shire of untainted descent steady tory principles and the happy father of six unmarried and accomplished daughters  sir everards reception in this family was as it may be easily conceived sufficiently favourable but of the six young ladies his taste unfortunately determined him in favour of lady emily the youngest who received his attentions with an embarrassment which showed at once that she durst not decline them and that they afforded her anything but pleasure  sir everard could not but perceive something uncommon in the restrained emotions which the young lady testified at the advances he hazarded but assured by the prudent countess that they were the natural effects of a retired education the sacrifice might have been completed as doubtless has happened in many similar instances had it not been for the courage of an elder sister who revealed to the wealthy suitor that lady emilys affections were fixed upon a young soldier of fortune a near relation of her own  sir everard manifested great emotion on receiving this intelligence which was confirmed to him in a private interview by the young lady herself although under the most dreadful apprehensions of her fathers indignation  honour and generosity were hereditary attributes of the house of waverley with a grace and delicacy worthy the hero of a romance sir everard withdrew his claim to the hand of lady emily he had even before leaving blandeville castle the address to extort from her father a consent to her union with the object of her choice what arguments he used on this point cannot exactly be known for sir everard was never supposed strong in the powers of persuasion but the young officer immediately after this transaction rose in the army with a rapidity far surpassing the usual pace of unpatronised professional merit although to outward appearance that was all he had to depend upon  the shock which sir everard encountered upon this occasion although diminished by the consciousness of having acted virtuously and generously had its effect upon his future life his resolution of marriage had been adopted in a fit of indignation the labour of courtship did not quite suit the dignified indolence of his habits he had but just escaped the risk of marrying a woman who could never love him and his pride could not be greatly flattered by the termination of his amour even if his heart had not suffered the result of the whole matter was his return to waverleyhonour without any transfer of his affections notwithstanding the sighs and languishments of the fair telltale who had revealed in mere sisterly affection the secret of lady emilys attachment and in despite of the nods winks and innuendos of the officious lady mother and the grave eulogiums which the earl pronounced successively on the prudence and good sense and admirable dispositions of his first second third fourth and fifth daughters  the memory of his unsuccessful amour was with sir everard as with many more of his temper at once shy proud sensitive and indolent a beacon against exposing himself to similar mortification pain and fruitless exertion for the time to come he continued to live at waverleyhonour in the style of an old english gentleman of an ancient descent and opulent fortune his sister miss rachel waverley presided at his table and they became by degrees an old bachelor and an ancient maiden lady the gentlest and kindest of the votaries of celibacy  the vehemence of sir everards resentment against his brother was but shortlived yet his dislike to the whig and the placeman though unable to stimulate him to resume any active measures prejudicial to richards interest in the succession to the family estate continued to maintain the coldness between them richard knew enough of the world and of his brothers temper to believe that by any illconsidered or precipitate advances on his part he might turn passive dislike into a more active principle it was accident therefore which at length occasioned a renewal of their intercourse richard had married a young woman of rank by whose family interest and private fortune he hoped to advance his career in her right he became possessor of a manor of some value at the distance of a few miles from waverleyhonour  little edward the hero of our tale then in his fifth year was their only child it chanced that the infant with his maid had strayed one morning to a miles distance from the avenue of brerewood lodge his fathers seat their attention was attracted by a carriage drawn by six stately longtailed black horses and with as much carving and gilding as would have done honour to my lord mayors it was waiting for the owner who was at a little distance inspecting the progress of a halfbuilt farmhouse i know not whether the boys nurse had been a welshor a scotchwoman or in what manner he associated a shield emblazoned with three ermines with the idea of personal property but he no sooner beheld this family emblem than he stoutly determined on vindicating his right to the splendid vehicle on which it was displayed the baronet arrived while the boys maid was in vain endeavouring to make him desist from his determination to appropriate the gilded coachandsix the rencontre was at a happy moment for edward as his uncle had been just eyeing wistfully with something of a feeling like envy the chubby boys of the stout yeoman whose mansion was building by his direction in the roundfaced rosy cherub before him bearing his eye and his name and vindicating a hereditary title to his family affection and patronage by means of a tie which sir everard held as sacred as either garter or bluemantle providence seemed to have granted to him the very object best calculated to fill up the void in his hopes and affections sir everard returned to waverleyhall upon a led horse which was kept in readiness for him while the child and his attendant were sent home in the carriage to brerewood lodge with such a message as opened to richard waverley a door of reconciliation with his elder brother  their intercourse however though thus renewed continued to be rather formal and civil than partaking of brotherly cordiality yet it was sufficient to the wishes of both parties sir everard obtained in the frequent society of his little nephew something on which his hereditary pride might found the anticipated pleasure of a continuation of his lineage and where his kind and gentle affections could at the same time fully exercise themselves for richard waverley he beheld in the growing attachment between the uncle and nephew the means of securing his sons if not his own succession to the hereditary estate which he felt would be rather endangered than promoted by any attempt on his own part towards a closer intimacy with a man of sir everards habits and opinions  thus by a sort of tacit compromise little edward was permitted to pass the greater part of the year at the hall and appeared to stand in the same intimate relation to both families although their mutual intercourse was otherwise limited to formal messages and more formal visits the education of the youth was regulated alternately by the taste and opinions of his uncle and of his father but more of this in a subsequent chapter     chapter iii  education   the education of our hero edward waverley was of a nature somewhat desultory in infancy his health suffered or was supposed to suffer which is quite the same thing by the air of london as soon therefore as official duties attendance on parliament or the prosecution of any of his plans of interest or ambition called his father to town which was his usual residence for eight months in the year edward was transferred to waverleyhonour and experienced a total change of instructors and of lessons as well as of residence this might have been remedied had his father placed him under the superintendence of a permanent tutor but he considered that one of his choosing would probably have been unacceptable at waverleyhonour and that such a selection as sir everard might have made were the matter left to him would have burdened him with a disagreeable inmate if not a political spy in his family he therefore prevailed upon his private secretary a young man of taste and accomplishments to bestow an hour or two on edwards education while at brerewood lodge and left his uncle answerable for his improvement in literature while an inmate at the hall this was in some degree respectably provided for sir everards chaplain an oxonian who had lost his fellowship for declining to take the oaths at the accession of george i was not only an excellent classical scholar but reasonably skilled in science and master of most modern languages he was however old and indulgent and the recurring interregnum during which edward was entirely freed from his discipline occasioned such a relaxation of authority that the youth was permitted in a great measure to learn as he pleased what he pleased and when he pleased this slackness of rule might have been ruinous to a boy of slow understanding who feeling labour in the acquisition of knowledge would have altogether neglected it save for the command of a taskmaster and it might have proved equally dangerous to a youth whose animal spirits were more powerful than his imagination or his feelings and whom the irresistible influence of alma would have engaged in fieldsports from morning till night but the character of edward waverley was remote from either of these his powers of apprehension were so uncommonly quick as almost to resemble intuition and the chief care of his preceptor was to prevent him as a sportsman would phrase it from overrunning his gamethat is from acquiring his knowledge in a slight flimsy and inadequate manner and here the instructor had to combat another propensity too often united with brilliancy of fancy and vivacity of talentthat indolence namely of disposition which can only be stirred by some strong motive of gratification and which renounces study as soon as curiosity is gratified the pleasure of conquering the first difficulties exhausted and the novelty of pursuit at an end edward would throw himself with spirit upon any classical author of which his preceptor proposed the perusal make himself master of the style so far as to understand the story and if that pleased or interested him he finished the volume but it was in vain to attempt fixing his attention on critical distinctions of philology upon the difference of idiom the beauty of felicitous expression or the artificial combinations of syntax i can read and understand a latin author said young edward with the selfconfidence and rash reasoning of fifteen and scaliger or bentley could not do much more alas while he was thus permitted to read only for the gratification of his amusement he foresaw not that he was losing for ever the opportunity of acquiring habits of firm and assiduous application of gaining the art of controlling directing and concentrating the powers of his mind for earnest investigationan art far more essential than even that intimate acquaintance with classical learning which is the primary object of study  i am aware i may be here reminded of the necessity of rendering instruction agreeable to youth and of tassos infusion of honey into the medicine prepared for a child but an age in which children are taught the driest doctrines by the insinuating method of instructive games has little reason to dread the consequences of study being rendered too serious or severe the history of england is now reduced to a game at cards the problems of mathematics to puzzles and riddles and the doctrines of arithmetic may we are assured be sufficiently acquired by spending a few hours a week at a new and complicated edition of the royal game of the goose there wants but one step further and the creed and ten commandments may be taught in the same manner without the necessity of the grave face deliberate tone of recital and devout attention hitherto exacted from the wellgoverned childhood of this realm it may in the meantime be subject of serious consideration whether those who are accustomed only to acquire instruction through the medium of amusement may not be brought to reject that which approaches under the aspect of study whether those who learn history by the cards may not be led to prefer the means to the end and whether were we to teach religion in the way of sport our pupils may not thereby be gradually induced to make sport of their religion to our young hero who was permitted to seek his instruction only according to the bent of his own mind and who of consequence only sought it so long as it afforded him amusement the indulgence of his tutors was attended with evil consequences which long continued to influence his character happiness and utility  edwards power of imagination and love of literature although the former was vivid and the latter ardent were so far from affording a remedy to this peculiar evil that they rather inflamed and increased its violence the library at waverleyhonour a large gothic room with double arches and a gallery contained such a miscellaneous and extensive collection of volumes as had been assembled together during the course of two hundred years by a family which had been always wealthy and inclined of course as a mark of splendour to furnish their shelves with the current literature of the day without much scrutiny or nicety of discrimination throughout this ample realm edward was permitted to roam at large his tutor had his own studies and church politics and controversial divinity together with a love of learned ease though they did not withdraw his attention at stated times from the progress of his patrons presumptive heir induced him readily to grasp at any apology for not extending a strict and regulated survey towards his general studies sir everard had never been himself a student and like his sister miss rachel waverley he held the common doctrine that idleness is incompatible with reading of any kind and that the mere tracing the alphabetical characters with the eye is in itself a useful and meritorious task without scrupulously considering what ideas or doctrines they may happen to convey with a desire of amusement therefore which better discipline might soon have converted into a thirst for knowledge young waverley drove through the sea of books like a vessel without a pilot or a rudder nothing perhaps increases by indulgence more than a desultory habit of reading especially under such opportunities of gratifying it i believe one reason why such numerous instances of erudition occur among the lower ranks is that with the same powers of mind the poor student is limited to a narrow circle for indulging his passion for books and must necessarily make himself master of the few he possesses ere he can acquire more edward on the contrary like the epicure who only deigned to take a single morsel from the sunny side of a peach read no volume a moment after it ceased to excite his curiosity or interest and it necessarily happened that the habit of seeking only this sort of gratification rendered it daily more difficult of attainment till the passion for reading like other strong appetites produced by indulgence a sort of satiety  ere he attained this indifference however he had read and stored in a memory of uncommon tenacity much curious though illarranged and miscellaneous information in english literature he was master of shakespeare and milton of our earlier dramatic authors of many picturesque and interesting passages from our old historical chronicles and was particularly well acquainted with spenser drayton and other poets who have exercised themselves on romantic fiction of all themes the most fascinating to a youthful imagination before the passions have roused themselves and demand poetry of a more sentimental description in this respect his acquaintance with italian opened him yet a wider range he had perused the numerous romantic poems which from the days of pulci have been a favourite exercise of the wits of italy and had sought gratification in the numerous collections of novelle which were brought forth by the genius of that elegant though luxurious nation in emulation of the decameron in classical literature waverley had made the usual progress and read the usual authors and the french had afforded him an almost exhaustless collection of memoirs scarcely more faithful than romances and of romances so well written as hardly to be distinguished from memoirs the splendid pages of froissart with his heartstirring and eyedazzling descriptions of war and of tournaments were among his chief favourites and from those of brantome and de la noue he learned to compare the wild and loose yet superstitious character of the nobles of the league with the stern rigid and sometimes turbulent disposition of the huguenot party the spanish had contributed to his stock of chivalrous and romantic lore the earlier literature of the northern nations did not escape the study of one who read rather to awaken the imagination than to benefit the understanding and yet knowing much that is known but to few edward waverley might justly be considered as ignorant since he knew little of what adds dignity to man and qualifies him to support and adorn an elevated situation in society  the occasional attention of his parents might indeed have been of service to prevent the dissipation of mind incidental to such a desultory course of reading but his mother died in the seventh year after the reconciliation between the brothers and richard waverley himself who after this event resided more constantly in london was too much interested in his own plans of wealth and ambition to notice more respecting edward than that he was of a very bookish turn and probably destined to be a bishop if he could have discovered and analysed his sons waking dreams he would have formed a very different conclusion     chapter iv  castlebuilding   i have already hinted that the dainty squeamish and fastidious taste acquired by a surfeit of idle reading had not only rendered our hero unfit for serious and sober study but had even disgusted him in some degree with that in which he had hitherto indulged  he was in his sixteenth year when his habits of abstraction and love of solitude became so much marked as to excite sir everards affectionate apprehension he tried to counterbalance these propensities by engaging his nephew in fieldsports which had been the chief pleasure of his own youthful days but although edward eagerly carried the gun for one season yet when practice had given him some dexterity the pastime ceased to afford him amusement  in the succeeding spring the perusal of old isaac waltons fascinating volume determined edward to become a brother of the angle but of all diversions which ingenuity ever devised for the relief of idleness fishing is the worst qualified to amuse a man who is at once indolent and impatient and our heros rod was speedily flung aside society and example which more than any other motives master and sway the natural bent of our passions might have had their usual effect upon the youthful visionary but the neighbourhood was thinly inhabited and the homebred young squires whom it afforded were not of a class fit to form edwards usual companions far less to excite him to emulation in the practice of those pastimes which composed the serious business of their lives  there were a few other youths of better education and a more liberal character but from their society also our hero was in some degree excluded sir everard had upon the death of queen anne resigned his seat in parliament and as his age increased and the number of his contemporaries diminished had gradually withdrawn himself from society so that when upon any particular occasion edward mingled with accomplished and welleducated young men of his own rank and expectations he felt an inferiority in their company not so much from deficiency of information as from the want of the skill to command and to arrange that which he possessed a deep and increasing sensibility added to this dislike of society the idea of having committed the slightest solecism in politeness whether real or imaginary was agony to him for perhaps even guilt itself does not impose upon some minds so keen a sense of shame and remorse as a modest sensitive and inexperienced youth feels from the consciousness of having neglected etiquette or excited ridicule where we are not at ease we cannot be happy and therefore it is not surprising that edward waverley supposed that he disliked and was unfitted for society merely because he had not yet acquired the habit of living in it with ease and comfort and of reciprocally giving and receiving pleasure  the hours he spent with his uncle and aunt were exhausted in listening to the oftrepeated tale of narrative old age yet even there his imagination the predominant faculty of his mind was frequently excited family tradition and genealogical history upon which much of sir everards discourse turned is the very reverse of amber which itself a valuable substance usually includes flies straws and other trifles whereas these studies being themselves very insignificant and trifling do nevertheless serve to perpetuate a great deal of what is rare and valuable in ancient manners and to record many curious and minute facts which could have been preserved and conveyed through no other medium if therefore edward waverley yawned at times over the dry deduction of his line of ancestors with their various intermarriages and inwardly deprecated the remorseless and protracted accuracy with which the worthy sir everard rehearsed the various degrees of propinquity between the house of waverleyhonour and the doughty barons knights and squires to whom they stood allied if notwithstanding his obligations to the three ermines passant he sometimes cursed in his heart the jargon of heraldry its griffins its moldwarps its wyverns and its dragons with all the bitterness of hotspur himself there were moments when these communications interested his fancy and rewarded his attention  the deeds of wilibert of waverley in the holy land his long absence and perilous adventures his supposed death and his return on the evening when the betrothed of his heart had wedded the hero who had protected her from insult and oppression during his absence the generosity with which the crusader relinquished his claims and sought in a neighbouring cloister that peace which passeth not away footnote see note 2to these and similar tales he would hearken till his heart glowed and his eye glistened nor was he less affected when his aunt mrs rachel narrated the sufferings and fortitude of lady alice waverley during the great civil war the benevolent features of the venerable spinster kindled into more majestic expression as she told how charles had after the field of worcester found a days refuge at waverleyhonour and how when a troop of cavalry were approaching to search the mansion lady alice dismissed her youngest son with a handful of domestics charging them to make good with their lives an hours diversion that the king might have that space for escape and god help her would mrs rachel continue fixing her eyes upon the heroines portrait as she spoke full dearly did she purchase the safety of her prince with the life of her darling child they brought him here a prisoner mortally wounded and you may trace the drops of his blood from the great hall door along the little gallery and up to the saloon where they laid him down to die at his mothers feet but there was comfort exchanged between them for he knew from the glance of his mothers eye that the purpose of his desperate defence was attained ah i remember she continued i remember well to have seen one that knew and loved him miss lucy saint aubin lived and died a maid for his sake though one of the most beautiful and wealthy matches in this country all the world ran after her but she wore widows mourning all her life for poor william for they were betrothed though not married and died ini cannot think of the date but i remember in the november of that very year when she found herself sinking she desired to be brought to waverleyhonour once more and visited all the places where she had been with my granduncle and caused the carpets to be raised that she might trace the impression of his blood and if tears could have washed it out it had not been there now for there was not a dry eye in the house you would have thought edward that the very trees mourned for her for their leaves dropt around her without a gust of wind and indeed she looked like one that would never see them green again  from such legends our hero would steal away to indulge the fancies they excited in the corner of the large and sombre library with no other light than was afforded by the decaying brands on its ponderous and ample hearth he would exercise for hours that internal sorcery by which past or imaginary events are presented in action as it were to the eye of the muser then arose in long and fair array the splendour of the bridal feast at waverleycastle the tall and emaciated form of its real lord as he stood in his pilgrims weeds an unnoticed spectator of the festivities of his supposed heir and intended bride the electrical shock occasioned by the discovery the springing of the vassals to arms the astonishment of the bridegroom the terror and confusion of the bride the agony with which wilibert observed that her heart as well as consent was in these nuptials the air of dignity yet of deep feeling with which he flung down the halfdrawn sword and turned away for ever from the house of his ancestors then would he change the scene and fancy would at his wish represent aunt rachels tragedy he saw the lady waverley seated in her bower her ear strained to every sound her heart throbbing with double agony now listening to the decaying echo of the hoofs of the kings horse and when that had died away hearing in every breeze that shook the trees of the park the noise of the remote skirmish a distant sound is heard like the rushing of a swoln stream it comes nearer and edward can plainly distinguish the galloping of horses the cries and shouts of men with straggling pistolshots between rolling forwards to the hall the lady starts upa terrified menial rushes inbut why pursue such a description  as living in this ideal world became daily more delectable to our hero interruption was disagreeable in proportion the extensive domain that surrounded the hall which far exceeding the dimensions of a park was usually termed waverleychase had originally been forest ground and still though broken by extensive glades in which the young deer were sporting retained its pristine and savage character it was traversed by broad avenues in many places half grown up with brushwood where the beauties of former days used to take their stand to see the stag coursed with greyhounds or to gain an aim at him with the crossbow in one spot distinguished by a mossgrown gothic monument which retained the name of queens standing elizabeth herself was said to have pierced seven bucks with her own arrows this was a very favourite haunt of waverley at other times with his gun and his spaniel which served as an apology to others and with a book in his pocket which perhaps served as an apology to himself he used to pursue one of these long avenues which after an ascending sweep of four miles gradually narrowed into a rude and contracted path through the cliffy and woody pass called mirkwood dingle and opened suddenly upon a deep dark and small lake named from the same cause mirkwoodmere there stood in former times a solitary tower upon a rock almost surrounded by the water which had acquired the name of the strength of waverley because in perilous times it had often been the refuge of the family there in the wars of york and lancaster the last adherents of the red rose who dared to maintain her cause carried on a harassing and predatory warfare till the stronghold was reduced by the celebrated richard of gloucester here too a party of cavaliers long maintained themselves under nigel waverley elder brother of that william whose fate aunt rachel commemorated through these scenes it was that edward loved to chew the cud of sweet and bitter fancy and like a child among his toys culled and arranged from the splendid yet useless imagery and emblems with which his imagination was stored visions as brilliant and as fading as those of an evening sky the effect of this indulgence upon his temper and character will appear in the next chapter     chapter v  choice of a profession   from the minuteness with which i have traced waverleys pursuits and the bias which these unavoidably communicated to his imagination the reader may perhaps anticipate in the following tale an imitation of the romance of cervantes but he will do my prudence injustice in the supposition my intention is not to follow the steps of that inimitable author in describing such total perversion of intellect as misconstrues the objects actually presented to the senses but that more common aberration from sound judgment which apprehends occurrences indeed in their reality but communicates to them a tincture of its own romantic tone and colouring so far was edward waverley from expecting general sympathy with his own feelings or concluding that the present state of things was calculated to exhibit the reality of those visions in which he loved to indulge that he dreaded nothing more than the detection of such sentiments as were dictated by his musings he neither had nor wished to have a confidant with whom to communicate his reveries and so sensible was he of the ridicule attached to them that had he been to choose between any punishment short of ignominy and the necessity of giving a cold and composed account of the ideal world in which he lived the better part of his days i think he would not have hesitated to prefer the former infliction this secrecy became doubly precious as he felt in advancing life the influence of the awakening passions female forms of exquisite grace and beauty began to mingle in his mental adventures nor was he long without looking abroad to compare the creatures of his own imagination with the females of actual life  the list of the beauties who displayed their hebdomadal finery at the parish church of waverley was neither numerous nor select by far the most passable was miss sissly or as she rather chose to be called miss cecilia stubbs daughter of squire stubbs at the grange i know not whether it was by the merest accident in the world a phrase which from female lips does not always exclude malice prepense or whether it was from a conformity of taste that miss cecilia more than once crossed edward in his favourite walks through waverleychase he had not as yet assumed courage to accost her on these occasions but the meeting was not without its effect a romantic lover is a strange idolater who sometimes cares not out of what log he frames the object of his adoration at least if nature has given that object any passable proportion of personal charms he can easily play the jeweller and dervise in the oriental tale footnote see hoppners tale of the seven lovers and supply her richly out of the stores of his own imagination with supernatural beauty and all the properties of intellectual wealth  but ere the charms of miss cecilia stubbs had erected her into a positive goddess or elevated her at least to a level with the saint her namesake mrs rachel waverley gained some intimation which determined her to prevent the approaching apotheosis even the most simple and unsuspicious of the female sex have god bless them an instinctive sharpness of perception in such matters which sometimes goes the length of observing partialities that never existed but rarely misses to detect such as pass actually under their observation mrs rachel applied herself with great prudence not to combat but to elude the approaching danger and suggested to her brother the necessity that the heir of his house should see something more of the world than was consistent with constant residence at waverleyhonour  sir everard would not at first listen to a proposal which went to separate his nephew from him edward was a little bookish he admitted but youth he had always heard was the season for learning and no doubt when his rage for letters was abated and his head fully stocked with knowledge his nephew would take to fieldsports and country business he had often he said himself regretted that he had not spent some time in study during his youth he would neither have shot nor hunted with less skill and he might have made the roof of saint stephens echo to longer orations than were comprised in those zealous noes with which when a member of the house during godolphins administration he encountered every measure of government  aunt rachels anxiety however lent her address to carry her point every representative of their house had visited foreign parts or served his country in the army before he settled for life at waverleyhonour and she appealed for the truth of her assertion to the genealogical pedigree an authority which sir everard was never known to contradict in short a proposal was made to mr richard waverley that his son should travel under the direction of his present tutor mr pembroke with a suitable allowance from the baronets liberality the father himself saw no objection to this overture but upon mentioning it casually at the table of the minister the great man looked grave the reason was explained in private the unhappy turn of sir everards politics the minister observed was such as would render it highly improper that a young gentleman of such hopeful prospects should travel on the continent with a tutor doubtless of his uncles choosing and directing his course by his instructions what might mr edward waverleys society be at paris what at rome where all manner of snares were spread by the pretender and his sonsthese were points for mr waverley to consider this he could himself say that he knew his majesty had such a just sense of mr richard waverleys merits that if his son adopted the army for a few years a troop he believed might be reckoned upon in one of the dragoon regiments lately returned from flanders  a hint thus conveyed and enforced was not to be neglected with impunity and richard waverley though with great dread of shocking his brothers prejudices deemed he could not avoid accepting the commission thus offered him for his son the truth is he calculated much and justly upon sir everards fondness for edward which made him unlikely to resent any step that he might take in due submission to parental authority two letters announced this determination to the baronet and his nephew the latter barely communicated the fact and pointed out the necessary preparations for joining his regiment to his brother richard was more diffuse and circuitous he coincided with him in the most flattering manner in the propriety of his sons seeing a little more of the world and was even humble in expressions of gratitude for his proposed assistance was however deeply concerned that it was now unfortunately not in edwards power exactly to comply with the plan which had been chalked out by his best friend and benefactor he himself had thought with pain on the boys inactivity at an age when all his ancestors had borne arms even royalty itself had deigned to inquire whether young waverley was not now in flanders at an age when his grandfather was already bleeding for his king in the great civil war this was accompanied by an offer of a troop of horse what could he do there was no time to consult his brothers inclinations even if he could have conceived there might be objections on his part to his nephews following the glorious career of his predecessors and in short that edward was now the intermediate steps of cornet and lieutenant being overleapt with great agility captain waverley of gardiners regiment of dragoons which he must join in their quarters at dundee in scotland in the course of a month  sir everard waverley received this intimation with a mixture of feelings at the period of the hanoverian succession he had withdrawn from parliament and his conduct in the memorable year 1715 had not been altogether unsuspected there were reports of private musters of tenants and horses in waverleychase by moonlight and of cases of carbines and pistols purchased in holland and addressed to the baronet but intercepted by the vigilance of a riding officer of the excise who was afterwards tossed in a blanket on a moonless night by an association of stout yeomen for his officiousness nay it was even said that at the arrest of sir william wyndham the leader of the tory party a letter from sir everard was found in the pocket of his nightgown but there was no overt act which an attainder could be founded on and government contented with suppressing the insurrection of 1715 felt it neither prudent nor safe to push their vengeance farther than against those unfortunate gentlemen who actually took up arms  nor did sir everards apprehensions of personal consequences seem to correspond with the reports spread among his whig neighbours it was well known that he had supplied with money several of the distressed northumbrians and scotchmen who after being made prisoners at preston in lancashire were imprisoned in newgate and the marshalsea and it was his solicitor and ordinary counsel who conducted the defence of some of these unfortunate gentlemen at their trial it was generally supposed however that had ministers possessed any real proof of sir everards accession to the rebellion he either would not have ventured thus to brave the existing government or at least would not have done so with impunity the feelings which then dictated his proceedings were those of a young man and at an agitating period since that time sir everards jacobitism had been gradually decaying like a fire which burns out for want of fuel his tory and highchurch principles were kept up by some occasional exercise at elections and quartersessions but those respecting hereditary right were fallen into a sort of abeyance yet it jarred severely upon his feelings that his nephew should go into the army under the brunswick dynasty and the more so as independent of his high and conscientious ideas of paternal authority it was impossible or at least highly imprudent to interfere authoritatively to prevent it this suppressed vexation gave rise to many poohs and pshaws which were placed to the account of an incipient fit of gout until having sent for the army list the worthy baronet consoled himself with reckoning the descendants of the houses of genuine loyalty mordaunts granvilles and stanleys whose names were to be found in that military record and calling up all his feelings of family grandeur and warlike glory he concluded with logic something like falstaffs that when war was at hand although it were shame to be on any side but one it were worse shame to be idle than to be on the worst side though blacker than usurpation could make it as for aunt rachel her scheme had not exactly terminated according to her wishes but she was under the necessity of submitting to circumstances and her mortification was diverted by the employment she found in fitting out her nephew for the campaign and greatly consoled by the prospect of beholding him blaze in complete uniform edward waverley himself received with animated and undefined surprise this most unexpected intelligence it was as a fine old poem expresses it like a fire to heather set that covers a solitary hill with smoke and illumines it at the same time with dusky fire his tutor or i should say mr pembroke for he scarce assumed the name of tutor picked up about edwards room some fragments of irregular verse which he appeared to have composed under the influence of the agitating feelings occasioned by this sudden page being turned up to him in the book of life the doctor who was a believer in all poetry which was composed by his friends and written out in fair straight lines with a capital at the beginning of each communicated this treasure to aunt rachel who with her spectacles dimmed with tears transferred them to her commonplace book among choice receipts for cookery and medicine favourite texts and portions from highchurch divines and a few songs amatory and jacobitical which she had carolled in her younger days from whence her nephews poetical tentamina were extracted when the volume itself with other authentic records of the waverley family were exposed to the inspection of the unworthy editor of this memorable history if they afford the reader no higher amusement they will serve at least better than narrative of any kind to acquaint him with the wild and irregular spirit of our hero  late when the autumn evening fell on mirkwoodmeres romantic dell the lake returnd in chastend

prose as perhaps these verses intimate less decidedly the transient idea of miss cecilia stubbs passed from captain waverleys heart amid the turmoil which his new destinies excited she appeared indeed in full splendour in her fathers pew upon the sunday when he attended service for the last time at the old parish church upon which occasion at the request of his uncle and aunt rachel he was induced nothing both if the truth must be told to present himself in full uniform  there is no better antidote against entertaining too high an opinion of others than having an excellent one of ourselves at the very same time miss stubbs had indeed summoned up every assistance which art could afford to beauty but alas hoop patches frizzled locks and a new mantua of genuine french silk were lost upon a young officer of dragoons who wore for the first time his goldlaced hat jackboots and broadsword i know not whether like the champion of an old ballad         his heart was all on honour bent        he could not stoop to love        no lady in the land had power        his frozen heart to move  or whether the deep and flaming bars of embroidered gold which now fenced his breast defied the artillery of cecilias eyes but every arrow was launched at him in vain      yet did i mark where cupids shaft did light     it lighted not on little western flower     but on bold yeoman flower of all the west     hight jonas culbertfield the stewards son   craving pardon for my heroics which i am unable in certain cases to resist giving way to it is a melancholy fact that my history must here take leave of the fair cecilia who like many a daughter of eve after the departure of edward and the dissipation of certain idle visions which she had adopted quietly contented herself with a pisaller and gave her hand at the distance of six months to the aforesaid jonas son of the baronets steward and heir no unfertile prospect to a stewards fortune besides the snug probability of succeeding to his fathers office all these advantages moved squire stubbs as much as the ruddy brown and manly form of the suitor influenced his daughter to abate somewhat in the article of their gentry and so the match was concluded none seemed more gratified than aunt rachel who had hitherto looked rather askance upon the presumptuous damsel as much so peradventure as her nature would permit but who on the first appearance of the newmarried pair at church honoured the bride with a smile and a profound curtsy in presence of the rector the curate the clerk and the whole congregation of the united parishes of waverley cum beverley  i beg pardon once and for all of those readers who take up novels merely for amusement for plaguing them so long with oldfashioned politics and whig and tory and hanoverians and jacobites the truth is i cannot promise them that this story shall be intelligible not to say probable without it my plan requires that i should explain the motives on which its action proceeded and these motives necessarily arose from the feelings prejudices and parties of the times i do not invite my fair readers whose sex and impatience give them the greatest right to complain of these circumstances into a flying chariot drawn by hippogriffs or moved by enchantment mine is a humble english postchaise drawn upon four wheels and keeping his majestys highway such as dislike the vehicle may leave it at the next halt and wait for the conveyance of prince husseins tapestry or malek the weavers flying sentrybox those who are contented to remain with me will be occasionally exposed to the dulness inseparable from heavy roads steep hills sloughs and other terrestrial retardations but with tolerable horses and a civil driver as the advertisements have it i engage to get as soon as possible into a more picturesque and romantic country if my passengers incline to have some patience with me during my first stages footnote these introductory chapters have been a good deal censured as tedious and unnecessary yet there are circumstances recorded in them which the author has not been able to persuade himself to retrench or cancel     chapter iv  the adieus of waverley   it was upon the evening of this memorable sunday that sir everard entered the library where he narrowly missed surprising our young hero as he went through the guards of the broadsword with the ancient weapon of old sir hildebrand which being preserved as an heirloom usually hung over the chimney in the library beneath a picture of the knight and his horse where the features were almost entirely hidden by the knights profusion of curled hair and the bucephalus which he bestrode concealed by the voluminous robes of the bath with which he was decorated sir everard entered and after a glance at the picture and another at his nephew began a little speech which however soon dropt into the natural simplicity of his common manner agitated upon the present occasion by no common feeling nephew he said and then as mending his phrase my dear edward it is gods will and also the will of your father whom under god it is your duty to obey that you should leave us to take up the profession of arms in which so many of your ancestors have been distinguished i have made such arrangements as will enable you to take the field as their descendant and as the probable heir of the house of waverley and sir in the field of battle you will remember what name you bear and edward my dear boy remember also that you are the last of that race and the only hope of its revival depends upon you therefore as far as duty and honour will permit avoid dangeri mean unnecessary dangerand keep no company with rakes gamblers and whigs of whom it is to be feared there are but too many in the service into which you are going your colonel as i am informed is an excellent manfor a presbyterian but you will remember your duty to god the church of england and the this breach ought to have been supplied according to the rubric with the word king but as unfortunately that word conveyed a double and embarrassing sense one meaning de facto and the other de jure the knight filled up the blank otherwisethe church of england and all constituted authorities then not trusting himself with any further oratory he carried his nephew to his stables to see the horses destined for his campaign two were black the regimental colour superb chargers both the other three were stout active hacks designed for the road or for his domestics of whom two were to attend him from the hall an additional groom if necessary might be picked up in scotland  you will depart with but a small retinue quoth the baronet compared to sir hildebrand when he mustered before the gate of the hall a larger body of horse than your whole regiment consists of i could have wished that these twenty young fellows from my estate who have enlisted in your troop had been to march with you on your journey to scotland it would have been something at least but i am told their attendance would be thought unusual in these days when every new and foolish fashion is introduced to break the natural dependence of the people upon their landlords  sir everard had done his best to correct this unnatural disposition of the times for he had brightened the chain of attachment between the recruits and their young captain not only by a copious repast of beef and ale by way of parting feast but by such a pecuniary donation to each individual as tended rather to improve the conviviality than the discipline of their march after inspecting the cavalry sir everard again conducted his nephew to the library where he produced a letter carefully folded surrounded by a little stripe of floxsilk according to ancient form and sealed with an accurate impression of the waverley coatofarms it was addressed with great formality to cosmo comyne bradwardine esq of bradwardine at his principal mansion of tullyveolan in perthshire north britain theseby the hands of captain edward waverley nephew of sir everard waverley of waverleyhonour bart  the gentleman to whom this enormous greeting was addressed of whom we shall have more to say in the sequel had been in arms for the exiled family of stuart in the year 1715 and was made prisoner at preston in lancashire he was of a very ancient family and somewhat embarrassed fortune a scholar according to the scholarship of scotchmen that is his learning was more diffuse than accurate and he was rather a reader than a grammarian of his zeal for the classic authors he is said to have given an uncommon instance on the road between preston and london he made his escape from his guards but being afterwards found loitering near the place where they had lodged the former night he was recognised and again arrested his companions and even his escort were surprised at his infatuation and could not help inquiring why being once at liberty he had not made the best of his way to a place of safety to which he replied that he had intended to do so but in good faith he had returned to seek his titus livius which he had forgot in the hurry of his escape footnote see note 3 the simplicity of this anecdote struck the gentleman who as we before observed had managed the defence of some of those unfortunate persons at the expense of sir everard and perhaps some others of the party he was besides himself a special admirer of the old patavinian and though probably his own zeal might not have carried him such extravagant lengths even to recover the edition of sweynheim and pannartz supposed to be the princeps he did not the less estimate the devotion of the north briton and in consequence exerted himself to so much purpose to remove and soften evidence detect legal flaws et cetera that he accomplished the final discharge and deliverance of cosmo comyne bradwardine from certain very awkward consequences of a plea before our sovereign lord the king in westminster  the baron of bradwardine for he was generally so called in scotland although his intimates from his place of residence used to denominate him tullyveolan or more familiarly tully no sooner stood rectus in curia than he posted down to pay his respects and make his acknowledgments at waverleyhonour a congenial passion for fieldsports and a general coincidence in political opinions cemented his friendship with sir everard notwithstanding the difference of their habits and studies in other particulars and having spent several weeks at waverleyhonour the baron departed with many expressions of regard warmly pressing the baronet to return his visit and partake of the diversion of grouseshooting upon his moors in perthshire next season shortly after mr bradwardine remitted from scotland a sum in reimbursement of expenses incurred in the kings high court of westminster which although not quite so formidable when reduced to the english denomination had in its original form of scotch pounds shillings and pence such a formidable effect upon the frame of duncan macwheeble the lairds confidential factor baronbailie and man of resource that he had a fit of the cholic which lasted for five days occasioned he said solely and utterly by becoming the unhappy instrument of conveying such a serious sum of money out of his native country into the hands of the false english but patriotism as it is the fairest so it is often the most suspicious mask of other feelings and many who knew bailie macwheeble concluded that his professions of regret were not altogether disinterested and that he would have grudged the moneys paid to the loons at westminster much less had they not come from bradwardine estate a fund which he considered as more particularly his own but the bailie protested he was absolutely disinterested  woe woe for scotland not a whit for me  the laird was only rejoiced that his worthy friend sir everard waverley of waverleyhonour was reimbursed of the expenditure which he had outlaid on account of the house of bradwardine it concerned he said the credit of his own family and of the kingdom of scotland at large that these disbursements should be repaid forthwith and if delayed it would be a matter of national reproach sir everard accustomed to treat much larger sums with indifference received the remittance of l294 13s 6d without being aware that the payment was an international concern and indeed would probably have forgot the circumstance altogether if bailie macwheeble had thought of comforting his cholic by intercepting the subsidy a yearly intercourse took place of a short letter and a hamper or a cask or two between waverleyhonour and tullyveolan the english exports consisting of mighty cheeses and mightier ale pheasants and venison and the scottish returns being vested in grouse white hares pickled salmon and usquebaugh all which were meant sent and received as pledges of constant friendship and amity between two important houses it followed as a matter of course that the heirapparent of waverleyhonour could not with propriety visit scotland without being furnished with credentials to the baron of bradwardine  when this matter was explained and settled mr pembroke expressed his wish to take a private and particular leave of his dear pupil the good mans exhortations to edward to preserve an unblemished life and morals to hold fast the principles of the christian religion and to eschew the profane company of scoffers and latitudinarians too much abounding in the army were not unmingled with his political prejudices it had pleased heaven he said to place scotland doubtless for the sins of their ancestors in 1642 in a more deplorable state of darkness than even this unhappy kingdom of england here at least although the candlestick of the church of england had been in some degree removed from its place it yet afforded a glimmering light there was a hierarchy though schismatical and fallen from the principles maintained by those great fathers of the church sancroft and his brethren there was a liturgy though woefully perverted in some of the principal petitions but in scotland it was utter darkness and excepting a sorrowful scattered and persecuted remnant the pulpits were abandoned to presbyterians and he feared to sectaries of every description it should be his duty to fortify his dear pupil to resist such unhallowed and pernicious doctrines in church and state as must necessarily be forced at times upon his unwilling ears  here he produced two immense folded packets which appeared each to contain a whole ream of closely written manuscript they had been the labour of the worthy mans whole life and never were labour and zeal more absurdly wasted he had at one time gone to london with the intention of giving them to the world by the medium of a bookseller in little britain well known to deal in such commodities and to whom he was instructed to address himself in a particular phrase and with a certain sign which it seems passed at that time current among the initiated jacobites the moment mr pembroke had uttered the shibboleth with the appropriate gesture the bibliopolist greeted him notwithstanding every disclamation by the title of doctor and conveying him into his back shop after inspecting every possible and impossible place of concealment he commenced eh doctorwellall under

rome it must be rome will do it at lastthe church must light its candle at the old lampehwhat cautious i like you the better but no fear here mr pembroke with some difficulty stopt a torrent of interrogations eked out with signs nods and winks and having at length convinced the bookseller that he did him too much honour in supposing him an emissary of exiled royalty he explained his actual business  the man of books with a much more composed air proceeded to examine the manuscripts the title of the first was a dissent from dissenters or the comprehension confuted showing the impossibility of any composition between the church and puritans presbyterians or sectaries of any description illustrated from the scriptures the fathers of the church and the soundest controversial divines to this work the bookseller positively demurred well meant he said and learned doubtless but the time had gone by printed on smallpica it would run to eight hundred pages and could never pay

uncivil the last time i mounted in old palace yardall whigs and roundheads every man of them williamites and hanover rats  the next day mr pembroke again called on the publisher but found tom alibis advice had determined him against undertaking the work not but what i would go towhat was i going to say to the plantations for the church with pleasurebut dear doctor i have a wife and family but to show my zeal ill recommend the job to my neighbour trimmelhe is a bachelor and leaving off business so a voyage in a western barge would not inconvenience him but mr trimmel was also obdurate and mr pembroke fortunately perchance for himself was compelled to return to waverleyhonour with his treatise in vindication of the real fundamental principles of church and state safely packed in his saddlebags  as the public were thus likely to be deprived of the benefit arising from his lucubrations by the selfish cowardice of the trade mr pembroke resolved to make two copies of these tremendous manuscripts for the use of his pupil he felt that he had been indolent as a tutor and besides his conscience checked him for complying with the request of mr richard waverley that he would impress no sentiments upon edwards mind inconsistent with the present settlement in church and state but now thought he i may without breach of my word since he is no longer under my tuition afford the youth the means of judging for himself and have only to dread his reproaches for so long concealing the light which the perusal will flash upon his mind while he thus indulged the reveries of an author and a politician his darling proselyte seeing nothing very inviting in the title of the tracts and appalled by the bulk and compact lines of the manuscript quietly consigned them to a corner of his travelling trunk  aunt rachels farewell was brief and affectionate she only cautioned her dear edward whom she probably deemed somewhat susceptible against the fascination of scottish beauty she allowed that the northern part of the island contained some ancient families but they were all whigs and presbyterians except the highlanders and respecting them she must needs say there could be no great delicacy among the ladies where the gentlemens usual attire was as she had been assured to say the least very singular and not at all decorous she concluded her farewell with a kind and moving benediction and gave the young officer as a pledge of her regard a valuable diamond ring often worn by the male sex at that time and a purse of broad goldpieces which also were more common sixty years since than they have been of late     chapter vii  a horsequarter in scotland   the next morning amid varied feelings the chief of which was a predominant anxious and even solemn impression that he was now in a great measure abandoned to his own guidance and direction edward waverley departed from the hall amid the blessings and tears of all the old domestics and the inhabitants of the village mingled with some sly petitions for sergeantcies and corporalships and so forth on the part of those who professed that they never thoft to ha seen jacob and giles and jonathan go off for soldiers save to attend his honour as in duty bound edward as in duty bound extricated himself from the supplicants with the pledge of fewer promises than might have been expected from a young man so little accustomed to the world after a short visit to london he proceeded on horseback then the general mode of travelling to edinburgh and from thence to dundee a seaport on the eastern coast of angusshire where his regiment was then quartered  he now entered upon a new world where for a time all was beautiful because all was new colonel gardiner the commanding officer of the regiment was himself a study for a romantic and at the same time an inquisitive youth in person he was tall handsome and active though somewhat advanced in life in his early years he had been what is called by manner of palliative a very gay young man and strange stories were circulated about his sudden conversion from doubt if not infidelity to a serious and even enthusiastic turn of mind it was whispered that a supernatural communication of a nature obvious even to the exterior senses had produced this wonderful change and though some mentioned the proselyte as an enthusiast none hinted at his being a hypocrite this singular and mystical circumstance gave colonel gardiner a peculiar and solemn interest in the eyes of the young soldier footnote see note 5 it may be easily imagined that the officers of a regiment commanded by so respectable a person composed a society more sedate and orderly than a military mess always exhibits and that waverley escaped some temptations to which he might otherwise have been exposed  meanwhile his military education proceeded already a good horseman he was now initiated into the arts of the manege which when carried to perfection almost realise the fable of the centaur the guidance of the horse appearing to proceed from the riders mere volition rather than from the use of any external and apparent signal of motion he received also instructions in his field duty but i must own that when his first ardour was past his progress fell short in the latter particular of what he wished and expected the duty of an officer the most imposing of all others to the inexperienced mind because accompanied with so much outward pomp and circumstance is in its essence a very dry and abstract task depending chiefly upon arithmetical combinations requiring much attention and a cool and reasoning head to bring them into action our hero was liable to fits of absence in which his blunders excited some mirth and called down some reproof this circumstance impressed him with a painful sense of inferiority in those qualities which appeared most to deserve and obtain regard in his new profession he asked himself in vain why his eye could not judge of distance or space so well as those of his companions why his head was not always successful in disentangling the various partial movements necessary to execute a particular evolution and why his memory so alert upon most occasions did not correctly retain technical phrases and minute points of etiquette or field discipline waverley was naturally modest and therefore did not fall into the egregious mistake of supposing such minuter rules of military duty beneath his notice or conceiting himself to be born a general because he made an indifferent subaltern the truth was that the vague and unsatisfactory course of reading which he had pursued working upon a temper naturally retired and abstracted had given him that wavering and unsettled habit of mind which is most averse to study and riveted attention time in the mean while hung heavy on his hands the gentry of the neighbourhood were disaffected and showed little hospitality to the military guests and the people of the town chiefly engaged in mercantile pursuits were not such as waverley chose to associate with the arrival of summer and a curiosity to know something more of scotland than he could see in a ride from his quarters determined him to request leave of absence for a few weeks he resolved first to visit his uncles ancient friend and correspondent with the purpose of extending or shortening the time of his residence according to circumstances he travelled of course on horseback and with a single attendant and passed his first night at a miserable inn where the landlady had neither shoes nor stockings and the landlord who called himself a gentleman was disposed to be rude to his guest because he had not bespoke the pleasure of his society to supper footnote see note 6 the next day traversing an open and uninclosed country edward gradually approached the highlands of perthshire which at first had appeared a blue outline in the horizon but now swelled into huge gigantic masses which frowned defiance over the more level country that lay beneath them near the bottom of this stupendous barrier but still in the lowland country dwelt cosmo comyne bradwardine of bradwardine and if greyhaired eld can be in aught believed there had dwelt his ancestors with all their heritage since the days of the gracious king duncan     chapter viii  a scottish manorhouse sixty years since   it was about noon when captain waverley entered the straggling village or rather hamlet of tullyveolan close to which was situated the mansion of the proprietor the houses seemed miserable in the extreme especially to an eye accustomed to the smiling neatness of english cottages they stood without any respect for regularity on each side of a straggling kind of unpaved street where children almost in a primitive state of nakedness lay sprawling as if to be crushed by the hoofs of the first passing horse occasionally indeed when such a consummation seemed inevitable a watchful old grandam with her close cap distaff and spindle rushed like a sibyl in frenzy out of one of these miserable cells dashed into the middle of the path and snatching up her own charge from among the sunburnt loiterers saluted him with a sound cuff and transported him back to his dungeon the little whiteheaded varlet screaming all the while from the very top of his lungs a shrilly treble to the growling remonstrances of the enraged matron another part in this concert was sustained by the incessant yelping of a score of idle useless curs which followed snarling barking howling and snapping at the horses heels a nuisance at that time so common in scotland that a french tourist who like other travellers longed to find a good and rational reason for everything he saw has recorded as one of the memorabilia of caledonia that the state maintained in each village a relay of curs called collies whose duty it was to chase the chevaux de poste too starved and exhausted to move without such a stimulus from one hamlet to another till their annoying convoy drove them to the end of their stage the evil and remedy such as it is still existbut this is remote from our present purpose and is only thrown out for consideration of the collectors under mr dents dog bill  as waverley moved on here and there an old man bent as much by toil as years his eyes bleared with age and smoke tottered to the door of his hut to gaze on the dress of the stranger and the form and motions of the horses and then assembled with his neighbours in a little group at the smithy to discuss the probabilities of whence the stranger came and where he might be going three or four village girls returning from the well or brook with pitchers and pails upon their heads formed more pleasing objects and with their thin shortgowns and single petticoats bare arms legs and feet uncovered heads and braided hair somewhat resembled italian forms of landscape nor could a lover of the picturesque have challenged either the elegance of their costume or the symmetry of their shape although to say the truth a mere englishman in search of the comfortable a word peculiar to his native tongue might have wished the clothes less scanty the feet and legs somewhat protected from the weather the head and complexion shrouded from the sun or perhaps might even have thought the whole person and dress considerably improved by a plentiful application of spring water with a quantum sufficit of soap the whole scene was depressing for it argued at the first glance at least a stagnation of industry and perhaps of intellect even curiosity the busiest passion of the idle seemed of a listless cast in the village of tullyveolan the curs aforesaid alone showed any part of its activity with the villagers it was passive they stood and gazed at the handsome young officer and his attendant but without any of those quick motions and eager looks that indicate the earnestness with which those who live in monotonous ease at home look out for amusement abroad yet the physiognomy of the people when more closely examined was far from exhibiting the indifference of stupidity their features were rough but remarkably intelligent grave but the very reverse of stupid and from among the young women an artist might have chosen more than one model whose features and form resembled those of minerva the children also whose skins were burnt black and whose hair was bleached white by the influence of the sun had a look and manner of life and interest it seemed upon the whole as if poverty and indolence its too frequent companion were combining to depress the natural genius and acquired information of a hardy intelligent and reflecting peasantry  some such thoughts crossed waverleys mind as he paced his horse slowly through the rugged and flinty street of tullyveolan interrupted only in his meditations by the occasional caprioles which his charger exhibited at the reiterated assaults of those canine cossacks the collies before mentioned the village was more than half a mile long the cottages being irregularly divided from each other by gardens or yards as the inhabitants called them of different sizes where for it is sixty years since the now universal potato was unknown but which were stored with gigantic plants of kale or colewort encircled with groves of nettles and exhibited here and there a huge hemlock or the national thistle overshadowing a quarter of the petty inclosure the broken ground on which the village was built had never been levelled so that these inclosures presented declivities of every degree here rising like terraces there sinking like tanpits the drystone walls which fenced or seemed to fence for they were sorely breached these hanging gardens of tullyveolan were intersected by a narrow lane leading to the common field where the joint labour of the villagers cultivated alternate ridges and patches of rye oats barley and pease each of such minute extent that at a little distance the unprofitable variety of the surface resembled a tailors book of patterns in a few favoured instances there appeared behind the cottages a miserable wigwam compiled of earth loose stones and turf where the wealthy might perhaps shelter a starved cow or sorely galled horse but almost every hut was fenced in front by a huge black stack of turf on one side of the door while on the other the family dunghill ascended in noble emulation      about a bowshot from the end of the village appeared the inclosures proudly denominated the parks of tullyveolan being certain square fields surrounded and divided by stone walls five feet in height in the centre of the exterior barrier was the upper gate of the avenue opening under an archway battlemented on the top and adorned with two large weatherbeaten mutilated masses of upright stone which if the tradition of the hamlet could be trusted had once represented at least had been once designed to represent two rampant bears the supporters of the family of bradwardine this avenue was straight and of moderate length running between a double row of very ancient horsechestnuts planted alternately with sycamores which rose to such huge height and nourished so luxuriantly that their boughs completely overarched the broad road beneath beyond these venerable ranks and running parallel to them were two high walls of apparently the like antiquity overgrown with ivy honeysuckle and other climbing plants the avenue seemed very little trodden and chiefly by footpassengers so that being very broad and enjoying a constant shade it was clothed with grass of a deep and rich verdure excepting where a footpath worn by occasional passengers tracked with a natural sweep the way from the upper to the lower gate this nether portal like the former opened in front of a wall ornamented with some rude sculpture with battlements on the top over which were seen halfhidden by the trees of the avenue the high steep roofs and narrow gables of the mansion with lines indented into steps and corners decorated with small turrets one of the folding leaves of the lower gate was open and as the sun shone full into the court behind a long line of brilliancy was flung upon the aperture up the dark and gloomy avenue it was one of those effects which a painter loves to represent and mingled well with the struggling light which found its way between the boughs of the shady arch that vaulted the broad green alley  the solitude and repose of the whole scene seemed almost monastic and waverley who had given his horse to his servant on entering the first gate walked slowly down the avenue enjoying the grateful and cooling shade and so much pleased with the placid ideas of rest and seclusion excited by this confined and quiet scene that he forgot the misery and dirt of the hamlet he had left behind him the opening into the paved courtyard corresponded with the rest of the scene the house which seemed to consist of two or three high narrow and steeproofed buildings projecting from each other at right angles formed one side of the inclosure it had been built at a period when castles were no longer necessary and when the scottish architects had not yet acquired the art of designing a domestic residence the windows were numberless but very small the roof had some nondescript kind of projections called bartizans and displayed at each frequent angle a small turret rather resembling a pepperbox than a gothic watchtower neither did the front indicate absolute security from danger there were loopholes for musketry and iron stanchions on the lower windows probably to repel any roving band of gypsies or resist a predatory visit from the caterans of the neighbouring highlands stables and other offices occupied another side of the square the former were low vaults with narrow slits instead of windows resembling as edwards groom observed rather a prison for murderers and larceners and such like as are tried at sizes than a place for any christian cattle above these dungeonlooking stables were granaries called girnels and other offices to which there was access by outside stairs of heavy masonry two battlemented walls one of which faced the avenue and the other divided the court from the garden completed the inclosure  nor was the court without its ornaments in one corner was a tunbellied pigeonhouse of great size and rotundity resembling in figure and proportion the curious edifice called arthurs oven which would have turned the brains of all the antiquaries in england had not the worthy proprietor pulled it down for the sake of mending a neighbouring damdyke this dovecot or columbarium as the owner called it was no small resource to a scottish laird of that period whose scanty rents were eked out by the contributions levied upon the farms by these light foragers and the conscriptions exacted from the latter for the benefit of the table  another corner of the court displayed a fountain where a huge bear carved in stone predominated over a large stonebasin into which he disgorged the water this work of art was the wonder of the country ten miles round it must not be forgotten that all sorts of bears small and large demi or in full proportion were carved over the windows upon the ends of the gables terminated the spouts and supported the turrets with the ancient family motto beware the bear cut under each hyperborean form the court was spacious well paved and perfectly clean there being probably another entrance behind the stables for removing the litter everything around appeared solitary and would have been silent but for the continued plashing of the fountain and the whole scene still maintained the monastic illusion which the fancy of waverley had conjured up and here we beg permission to close a chapter of still life footnote see note 7     chapter ix  more of the manorhouse and its environs   after having satisfied his curiosity by gazing around him for a few minutes waverley applied himself to the massive knocker of the halldoor the architrave of which bore the date 1594 but no answer was returned though the peal resounded through a number of apartments and was echoed from the courtyard walls without the house startling the pigeons from the venerable rotunda which they occupied and alarming anew even the distant village curs which had retired to sleep upon their respective dunghills tired of the din which he created and the unprofitable responses which it excited waverley began to think that he had reached the castle of orgoglio as entered by the victorious prince arthur  when gan he loudly through the house to call but no man cared to answer to his cry there reignd a solemn silence over all nor voice was heard nor wight was seen in bower or hall  filled almost with expectation of beholding some old old man with beard as white as snow whom he might question concerning this deserted mansion our hero turned to a little oaken wicketdoor well clenched with ironnails which opened in the courtyard wall at its angle with the house it was only latched notwithstanding its fortified appearance and when opened admitted him into the garden which presented a pleasant scene footnote footnote at ravelston may be seen such a garden which the taste of the proprietor the authors friend and kinsman sir alexander keith knight mareschal has judiciously preserved that as well as the house is however of smaller dimensions than the baron of bradwardines mansion and garden are presumed to have been the southern side of the house clothed with fruittrees and having many evergreens trained upon its walls extended its irregular yet venerable front along a terrace partly paved partly gravelled partly bordered with flowers and choice shrubs this elevation descended by three several flights of steps placed in its centre and at the extremities into what might be called the garden proper and was fenced along the top by a stone parapet with a heavy balustrade ornamented from space to space with huge grotesque figures of animals seated upon their haunches among which the favourite bear was repeatedly introduced placed in the middle of the terrace between a sasheddoor opening from the house and the central flight of steps a huge animal of the same species supported on his head and forepaws a sundial of large circumference inscribed with more diagrams than edwards mathematics enabled him to decipher  the garden which seemed to be kept with great accuracy abounded in fruittrees and exhibited a profusion of flowers and evergreens cut into grotesque forms it was laid out in terraces which descended rank by rank from the western wall to a large brook which had a tranquil and smooth appearance where it served as a boundary to the garden but near the extremity leapt in tumult over a strong dam or wearhead the cause of its temporary tranquillity and there forming a cascade was overlooked by an octangular summerhouse with a gilded bear on the top by way of vane after this feat the brook assuming its natural rapid and fierce character escaped from the eye down a deep and wooded dell from the copse of which arose a massive but ruinous tower the former habitation of the barons of bradwardine the margin of the brook opposite to the garden displayed a narrow meadow or haugh as it was called which formed a small washinggreen the bank which retired behind it was covered by ancient trees  the scene though pleasing was not quite equal to the gardens of alcina yet wanted not the due donzellette garrule of that enchanted paradise for upon the green aforesaid two barelegged damsels each standing in a spacious tub performed with their feet the office of a patent washingmachine these did not however like the maidens of armida remain to greet with their harmony the approaching guest but alarmed at the appearance of a handsome stranger on the opposite side dropped their garments i should say garment to be quite correct over their limbs which their occupation exposed somewhat too freely and with a shrill exclamation of eh sirs uttered with an accent between modesty and coquetry sprung off like deer in different directions      waverley began to despair of gaining entrance into this solitary and seemingly enchanted mansion when a man advanced up one of the garden alleys where he still retained his station trusting this might be a gardener or some domestic belonging to the house edward descended the steps in order to meet him but as the figure approached and long before he could descry its features he was struck with the oddity of its appearance and gestures sometimes this mister wight held his hands clasped over his head like an indian jogue in the attitude of penance sometimes he swung them perpendicularly like a pendulum on each side and anon he slapped them swiftly and repeatedly across his breast like the substitute used by a hackneycoachman for his usual flogging exercise when his cattle are idle upon the stand in a clear frosty day his gait was as singular as his gestures for at times he hopped with great perseverance on the right foot then exchanged that supporter to advance in the same manner on the left and then putting his feet close together he hopped upon both at once his attire also was antiquated and extravagant it consisted in a sort of grey jerkin with scarlet cuffs and slashed sleeves showing a scarlet lining the other parts of the dress corresponded in colour not forgetting a pair of scarlet stockings and a scarlet bonnet proudly surmounted with a turkeys feather edward whom he did not seem to observe now perceived confirmation in his features of what the mien and gestures had already announced it was apparently neither idiocy nor insanity which gave that wild unsettled irregular expression to a face which naturally was rather handsome but something that resembled a compound of both where the simplicity of the fool was mixed with the extravagance of a crazed imagination he sung with great earnestness and not without some taste a fragment of an old scottish ditty      false love and hast thou playd me this     in summer among the flowers     i will repay thee back again     in winter among the showers     unless again again my love     unless you turn again     as you with other maidens rove     ill smile on other men  footnote this is a genuine ancient fragment with some alteration in the two last lines  here lifting up his eyes which had hitherto been fixed in observing how his feet kept time to the tune he beheld waverley and instantly doffed his cap with many grotesque signals of surprise respect and salutation edward though with little hope of receiving an answer to any constant question requested to know whether mr bradwardine were at home or where he could find any of the domestics the questioned party replied and like the witch of thalaba still his speech was song      the knights to the mountain     his bugle to wind     the ladys to greenwood     her garland to bind     the bower of burd ellen     has moss on the floor     that the step of lord william     be silent and sure  this conveyed no information and edward repeating his queries received a rapid answer in which from the haste and peculiarity of the dialect the word butler was alone intelligible waverley then requested to see the butler upon which the fellow with a knowing look and nod of intelligence made a signal to edward to follow and began to dance and caper down the alley up which he had made his approaches a strange guide this thought edward and not much unlike one of shakespeares roynish clowns i am not over prudent to trust to his pilotage but wiser men have been led by fools by this time he reached the bottom of the alley where turning short on a little parterre of flowers shrouded from the east and north by a close yew hedge he found an old man at work without his coat whose appearance hovered between that of an upper servant and gardener his red nose and ruffled shirt belonging to the former profession his hale and sunburnt visage with his green apron appearing to indicate  old adams likeness set to dress this garden  the major domo for such he was and indisputably the second officer of state in the barony nay as chief minister of the interior superior even to bailie macwheeble in his own department of the kitchen and cellarthe major domo laid down his spade slipped on his coat in haste and with a wrathful look at edwards guide probably excited by his having introduced a stranger while he was engaged in this laborious and as he might suppose it degrading office requested to know the gentlemans commands being informed that he wished to pay his respects to his master that his name was waverley and so forth the old mans countenance assumed a great deal of respectful importance he could take it upon his conscience to say his honour would have exceeding pleasure in seeing him would not mr waverley choose some refreshment after his journey his honour was with the folk who were getting doon the dark hag the twa gardener lads an emphasis on the word twa had been ordered to attend him and he had been just amusing himself in the mean time with dressing miss roses flowerbed that he might be near to receive his honours orders if need were he was very fond of a garden but had little time for such divertisements  he canna get it wrought in abune twa days in the week at no rate whatever said edwards fantastic conductor  a grim look from the butler chastised his interference and he commanded him by the name of davie gellatley in a tone which admitted no discussion to look for his honour at the dark hag and tell him there was a gentleman from the south had arrived at the ha  can this poor fellow deliver a letter asked edward  with all fidelity sir to any one whom he respects i would hardly trust him with a long message by word of mouththough he is more knave than fool  waverley delivered his credentials to mr gellatley who seemed to confirm the butlers last observation by twisting his features at him when he was looking another way into the resemblance of the grotesque face on the bole of a german tobacco pipe after which with an odd conge to waverley he danced off to discharge his errand  he is an innocent sir said the butler there is one such in almost every town in the country but ours is brought far ben footnote see note 8 he used to work a days turn weel enough but he helped miss rose when she was flemit with the laird of killancureits new english bull and since that time we ca him davie dolittle indeed we might ca him davie donaething for since he got that gay clothing to please his honour and my young mistress great folks will have their fancies he has done naething but dance up and down about the toun without doing a single turn unless trimming the lairds fishingwand or busking his flies or may be catching a dish of trouts at an orra time but here comes miss rose who i take burden upon me for her will be especial glad to see one of the house of waverley at her fathers mansion of tullyveolan  but rose bradwardine deserves better of her unworthy historian than to be introduced at the end of a chapter  in the mean while it may be noticed that waverley learned two things from this colloquy that in scotland a single house was called a town and a natural fool an innocent     chapter x  rose bradwardine and her father   miss bradwardine was but seventeen yet at the last races of the county town of upon her health being proposed among a round of beauties the laird of bumperquaigh permanent toastmaster and croupier of the bautherwhillery club not only said more to the pledge in a pint bumper of bourdeaux but ere pouring forth the libation denominated the divinity to whom it was dedicated the rose of tullyveolan upon which festive occasion three cheers were given by all the sitting members of that respectable society whose throats the wine had left capable of such exertion nay i am well assured that the sleeping partners of the company snorted applause and that although strong bumpers and weak brains had consigned two or three to the floor yet even these fallen as they were from their high estate and welteringi will carry the parody no fartheruttered divers inarticulate sounds intimating their assent to the motion  such unanimous applause could not be extorted but by acknowledged merit and rose bradwardine not only deserved it but also the approbation of much more rational persons than the bautherwhillery club could have mustered even before discussion of the first magnum she was indeed a very pretty girl of the scotch cast of beauty that is with a profusion of hair of paley gold and a skin like the snow of her own mountains in whiteness yet she had not a pallid or pensive cast of countenance her features as well as her temper had a lively expression her complexion though not florid was so pure as to seem transparent and the slightest emotion sent her whole blood at once to her face and neck her form though under the common size was remarkably elegant and her motions light easy and unembarrassed she came from another part of the garden to receive captain waverley with a manner that hovered between bashfulness and courtesy  the first greetings past edward learned from her that the dark hag which had somewhat puzzled him in the butlers account of his masters avocations had nothing to do either with a black cat or a broomstick but was simply a portion of oak copse which was to be felled that day she offered with diffident civility to show the stranger the way to the spot which it seems was not far distant but they were prevented by the appearance of the baron of bradwardine in person who summoned by david gellatley now appeared on hospitable thoughts intent clearing the ground at a prodigious rate with swift and long strides which reminded waverley of the sevenleague boots of the nursery fable he was a tall thin athletic figure old indeed and greyhaired but with every muscle rendered as tough as whipcord by constant exercise he was dressed carelessly and more like a frenchman than an englishman of the period while from his hard features and perpendicular rigidity of stature he bore some resemblance to a swiss officer of the guards who had resided some time at paris and caught the costume but not the ease or manner of its inhabitants the truth was that his language and habits were as heterogeneous as his external appearance  owing to his natural disposition to study or perhaps to a very general scottish fashion of giving young men of rank a legal education he had been bred with a view to the bar but the politics of his family precluding the hope of his rising in that profession mr bradwardine travelled with high reputation for several years and made some campaigns in foreign service after his demele with the law of high treason in 1715 he had lived in retirement conversing almost entirely with those of his own principles in the vicinage the pedantry of the lawyer superinduced upon the military pride of the soldier might remind a modern of the days of the zealous volunteer service when the bargown of our pleaders was often flung over a blazing uniform to this must be added the prejudices of ancient birth and jacobite politics greatly strengthened by habits of solitary and secluded authority which though exercised only within the bounds of his halfcultivated estate was there indisputable and undisputed for as he used to observe the lands of bradwardine tullyveolan and others had been erected into a free barony by a charter from david the first cum liberali potest habendi curias et justicias cum fossa et furca lie pit and gallows et saka et soka et thol et theam et infangthief et outfangthief sive handhabend sive bakbarand the peculiar meaning of all these cabalistical words few or none could explain but they implied upon the whole that the baron of bradwardine might in case of delinquency imprison try and execute his vassals at his pleasure like james the first however the present possessor of this authority was more pleased in talking about prerogative than in exercising it and excepting that he imprisoned two poachers in the dungeon of the old tower of tullyveolan where they were sorely frightened by ghosts and almost eaten by rats and that he set an old woman in the jougs or scottish pillory for saying there were mair fules in the lairds ha house than davie gellatley i do not learn that he was accused of abusing his high powers still however the conscious pride of possessing them gave additional importance to his language and deportment  at his first address to waverley it would seem that the hearty pleasure he felt to behold the nephew of his friend had somewhat discomposed the stiff and upright dignity of the baron of bradwardines demeanour for the tears stood in the old gentlemans eyes when having first shaken edward heartily by the hand in the english fashion he embraced him a la mode francoise and kissed him on both sides of his face while the hardness of his gripe and the quantity of scotch snuff which his accolade communicated called corresponding drops of moisture to the eyes of his guest  upon the honour of a gentleman he said but it makes me young again to see you here mr waverley a worthy scion of the old stock of waverleyhonourspes altera as maro hath itand you have the look of the old line captain waverley not so portly yet as my old friend sir everardmais cela viendra avec le tems as my dutch acquaintance baron kikkitbroeck said of the sagesse of madame son epouse and so ye

captain waverley or give you the epulae lautiores of waverleyhonour i say epulae rather than prandium because the latter phrase is popular epulae ad senatum prandium vero ad populum attinet says suetonius tranquillus but i trust ye will applaud my bourdeaux cest des deux oreilles as captain vinsauf used to say vinum primae notae the principal of saint andrews denominated it and once more captain waverley right glad am i that ye are here to drink the best my cellar can make forthcoming  this speech with the necessary interjectional answers continued from the lower alley where they met up to the door of the house where four or five servants in oldfashioned liveries headed by alexander saunderson the butler who now bore no token of the sable stains of the garden received them in grand costume  in an old hall hung round with pikes and with bows with old bucklers and corslets that had borne many shrewd blows  with much ceremony and still more real kindness the baron without stopping in any intermediate apartment conducted his guest through several into the great dining parlour wainscotted with black oak and hung round with the pictures of his ancestry where a table was set forth in form for six persons and an oldfashioned beaufet displayed all the ancient and massive plate of the bradwardine family a bell was now heard at the head of the avenue for an old man who acted as porter upon gala days had caught the alarm given by waverleys arrival and repairing to his post announced the arrival of other guests  these as the baron assured his young friend were very estimable persons there was the young laird of balmawhapple a falconer by surname of the house of glenfarquhar given right much to fieldsportsgaudet equis et canibusbut a very discreet young gentleman then there was the laird of killancureit who had devoted his leisure untill tillage and agriculture and boasted himself to be possessed of a bull of matchless merit brought from the county of devon the damnonia of the romans if we can trust robert of cirencester he is as ye may well suppose from such a tendency but of yeoman extractionservabit odorem testa diuand i believe between ourselves his grandsire was from the wrong side of the borderone bullsegg who came hither as a steward or bailiff or groundofficer or something in that department to the last girnigo of killancureit who died of an atrophy after his masters death sirye would hardly believe such a scandalbut this bullsegg being portly and comely of aspect intermarried with the lady dowager who was young and amorous and possessed himself of the estate which devolved on this unhappy woman by a settlement of her umwhile husband in direct contravention of an unrecorded taillie and to the prejudice of the disponers own flesh and blood in the person of his natural heir and seventh cousin girnigo of tipperhewit whose family was so reduced by the ensuing lawsuit that his representative is now serving as a private gentlemansentinel in the highland black watch but this gentleman mr bullsegg of killancureit that now is has good blood in his veins by the mother and grandmother who were both of the family of pickletillim and he is well liked and looked upon and knows his own place and god forbid captain waverley that we of irreproachable lineage should exult over him when it may be that in the eighth ninth or tenth generation his progeny may rank in a manner with the old gentry of the country rank and ancestry sir should be the last words in the mouths of us of unblemished racevix ea nostra voco as naso saith there is besides a clergyman of the true though suffering episcopal church of scotland footnote see note 9 he was a confessor in her cause after the year 1715 when a whiggish mob destroyed his meetinghouse tore his surplice and plundered his dwellinghouse of four silver spoons intromitting also with his mart and his mealark and with two barrels one of single and one of double ale besides three bottles of brandy my baronbailie and doer mr duncan macwheeble is the fourth on our list there is a question owing to the incertitude of ancient orthography whether he belongs to the clan of wheedle or of quibble but both have produced persons eminent in the law  as such he described them by person and name they enterd and dinner was served as they came     chapter xi  the banquet   the entertainment was ample and handsome according to the scotch ideas of the period and the guests did great honour to it the baron eat like a famished soldier the laird of balmawhapple like a sportsman bullsegg of killancureit like a farmer waverley himself like a traveller and bailie macwheeble like all four together though either out of more respect or in order to preserve that proper declination of person which showed a sense that he was in the presence of his patron he sat upon the edge of his chair placed at three feet distance from the table and achieved a communication with his plate by projecting his person towards it in a line which obliqued from the bottom of his spine so that the person who sat opposite to him could only see the foretop of his riding periwig  this stooping position might have been inconvenient to another person but long habit made it whether seated or walking perfectly easy to the worthy bailie in the latter posture it occasioned no doubt an unseemly projection of the person towards those who happened to walk behind but those being at all times his inferiors for mr macwheeble was very scrupulous in giving place to all others he cared very little what inference of contempt or slight regard they might derive from the circumstance hence when he waddled across the court to and from his old grey pony he somewhat resembled a turnspit walking upon its hind legs  the nonjuring clergyman was a pensive and interesting old man with much of the air of a sufferer for conscience sake he was one of those       who undeprived their benefice forsook  for this whim when the baron was out of hearing the bailie used sometimes gently to rally mr rubrick upbraiding him with the nicety of his scruples indeed it must be owned that he himself though at heart a keen partisan of the exiled family had kept pretty fair with all the different turns of state in his time so that davie gellatley once described him as a particularly good man who had a very quiet and peaceful conscience that never did him any harm  when the dinner was removed the baron announced the health of the king politely leaving to the consciences of his guests to drink to the sovereign de facto or de jure as their politics inclined the conversation now became general and shortly afterwards miss bradwardine who had done the honours with natural grace and simplicity retired and was soon followed by the clergyman among the rest of the party the wine which fully justified the encomiums of the landlord flowed freely round although waverley with some difficulty obtained the privilege of sometimes neglecting the glass at length as the evening grew more late the baron made a private signal to mr saunders saunderson or as he facetiously denominated him alexander ab alexandro who left the room with a nod and soon after returned his grave countenance mantling with a solemn and mysterious smile and placed before his master a small oaken casket mounted with brass ornaments of curious form the baron drawing out a private key unlocked the casket raised the lid and produced a golden goblet of a singular and antique appearance moulded into the shape of a rampant bear which the owner regarded with a look of mingled reverence pride and delight that irresistibly reminded waverley of ben jonsons tom otter with his bull horse and dog as that wag wittily denominated his chief carousing cups but mr bradwardine turning towards him with complacency requested him to observe this curious relic of the olden time  it represents he said the chosen crest of our family a bear as ye observe and rampant because a good herald will depict every animal in its noblest posture as a horse salient a greyhound currant and as may be inferred a ravenous animal in actu ferociori or in a voracious lacerating and devouring posture now sir we hold this most honourable achievement by the wappenbrief or concession of arms of frederick redbeard emperor of germany to my predecessor godmund bradwardine it being the crest of a gigantic dane whom he slew in the lists in the holy land on a quarrel touching the chastity of the emperors spouse or daughter tradition saith not precisely which and thus as virgilius hath it  mutemus clypeos danaumque insignia nobis aptemus  then for the cup captain waverley it was wrought by the command of saint duthac abbot of aberbrothock for behoof of another baron of the house of bradwardine who had valiantly defended the patrimony of that monastery against certain encroaching nobles it is properly termed the blessed bear of bradwardine though old doctor doubleit used jocosely to call it ursa major and was supposed in old and catholic times to be invested with certain properties of a mystical and supernatural quality and though i give not in to such anilia it is certain it has always been esteemed a solemn standard cup and heirloom of our house nor is it ever used but upon seasons of high festival and such i hold to be the arrival of the heir of sir everard under my roof and i devote this draught to the health and prosperity of the ancient and highlytobehonoured house of waverley  during this long harangue he carefully decanted a cobwebbed bottle of claret into the goblet which held nearly an english pint and at the conclusion delivering the bottle to the butler to be held carefully in the same angle with the horizon he devoutly quaffed off the contents of the blessed bear of bradwardine  edward with horror and alarm beheld the animal making his rounds and thought with great anxiety upon the appropriate motto beware the bear but at the same time plainly foresaw that as none of the guests scrupled to do him this extraordinary honour a refusal on his part to pledge their courtesy would be extremely ill received resolving therefore to submit to this last piece of tyranny and then to quit the table if possible and confiding in the strength of his constitution he did justice to the company in the contents of the blessed bear and felt less inconvenience from the draught than he could possibly have expected the others whose time had been more actively employed began to show symptoms of innovationthe good wine did its good office footnote southeys madoc the frost of etiquette and pride of birth began to give way before the genial blessings of this benign constellation and the formal appellatives with which the three dignitaries had hitherto addressed each other were now familiarly abbreviated into tully bally and killie when a few rounds had passed the two latter after whispering together craved permission a joyful hearing for edward to ask the gracecup this after some delay was at length produced and waverley concluded the orgies of bacchus were terminated for the evening he was never more mistaken in his life  as the guests had left their horses at the small inn or changehouse as it was called of the village the baron could not in politeness avoid walking with them up the avenue and waverley from the same motive and to enjoy after this feverish revel the cool summer evening attended the party but when they arrived at luckie maclearys the lairds of balmawhapple and killancureit declared their determination to acknowledge their sense of the hospitality of tullyveolan by partaking with their entertainer and his guest captain waverley what they technically called deoch an doruis a stirrupcup footnote 2 see note 10 to the honour of the barons rooftree  it must be noticed that the bailie knowing by experience that the days jovialty which had been hitherto sustained at the expense of his patron might terminate partly at his own had mounted his spavined grey pony and between gaiety of heart and alarm for being hooked into a reckoning spurred him into a hobbling canter a trot was out of the question and had already cleared the village the others entered the changehouse leading edward in unresisting submission for his landlord whispered him that to demur to such an overture would be construed into a high misdemeanour against the leges conviviales or regulations of genial compotation widow macleary seemed to have expected this visit as well she might for it was the usual consummation of merry bouts not only at tullyveolan but at most other gentlemens houses in scotland sixty years since the guests thereby at once acquitted themselves of their burden of gratitude for their entertainers kindness encouraged the trade of his changehouse did honour to the place which afforded harbour to their horses and indemnified themselves for the previous restraints imposed by private hospitality by spending what falstaff calls the sweet of the night in the genial license of a tavern  accordingly in full expectation of these distinguished guests luckie macleary had swept her house for the first time this fortnight tempered her turffire to such a heat as the season required in her damp hovel even at midsummer set forth her deal table newly washed propped its lame foot with a fragment of turf arranged four or five stools of huge and clumsy form upon the sites which best suited the inequalities of her clay floor and having moreover put on her clean toy rokelay and scarlet plaid gravely awaited the arrival of the company in full hope of custom and profit when they were seated under the sooty rafters of luckie maclearys only apartment thickly tapestried with cobwebs their hostess who had already taken her cue from the laird of balmawhapple appeared with a huge pewter measuringpot containing at least three english quarts familiarly denominated a tappit hen and which in the language of the hostess reamed ie mantled with excellent claret just drawn from the cask  it was soon plain that what crumbs of reason the bear had not devoured were to be picked up by the hen but the confusion which appeared to prevail favoured edwards resolution to evade the gaily circling glass the others began to talk thick and at once each performing his own part in the conversation without the least respect to his neighbour the baron of bradwardine sung french chansonsaboire and spouted pieces of latin killancureit talked in a steady unalterable dull key of topdressing and bottomdressing footnote this has been censured as an anachronism and it must be confessed that agriculture of this kind was unknown to the scotch sixty years since and yearolds and gimmers and dinmonts and stots and runts and kyloes and a proposed turnpikeact while balmawhapple in notes exalted above both extolled his horse his hawks and a greyhound called whistler in the middle of this din the baron repeatedly implored silence and when at length the instinct of polite discipline so far prevailed that for a moment he obtained it he hastened to beseech their attention unto a military ariette which was a particular favourite of the marechal duc de berwick then imitating as well as he could the manner and tone of a french musquetaire he immediately commenced      mon coeur volage dit elle       nest pas pour vous garcon     est pour un homme de guerre       qui a barbe au menton                  lon lon

what he called a dd good song composed by gibby gaethroughwit the piper of cupar and without wasting more time struck up      its up glenbarchans braes i gaed     and oer the bent of killiebraid     and mony a weary cast i made       to cuittle the moorfowls tail  footnote suum cuique this snatch of a ballad was composed by andrew macdonald the ingenious and unfortunate author of vimonda  the baron whose voice was drowned in the louder and more obstreperous strains of balmawhapple now dropped the competition but continued to hum lon lon laridon and to regard the successful candidate for the attention of the company with an eye of disdain while balmawhapple proceeded      if up a bonny blackcock should spring     to whistle him down wi a slug in his wing     and strap him on to my lunzie string     right seldom would i fail  after an ineffectual attempt to recover the second verse he sung the first over again and in prosecution of his triumph declared there was more sense in that than in all the derrydongs of france and fifeshire to the boot of it the baron only answered with a long pinch of snuff and a glance of infinite contempt but those noble allies the bear and the hen had emancipated the young laird from the habitual reverence in which he held bradwardine at other times he pronounced the claret shilpit and demanded brandy with great vociferation it was brought and now the demon of politics envied even the harmony arising from this dutch concert merely because there was not a wrathful note in the strange compound of sounds which it produced inspired by her the laird of balmawhapple now superior to the nods and winks with which the baron of bradwardine in delicacy to edward had hitherto checked his entering upon political discussion demanded a bumper with the lungs of a stentor to the little gentleman in black velvet who did such service in 1702 and may the white horse break his neck over a mound of his making  edward was not at that moment clearheaded enough to remember that king williams fall which occasioned his death was said to be owing to his horse stumbling at a molehill yet felt inclined to take umbrage at a toast which seemed from the glance of balmawhapples eye to have a peculiar and uncivil reference to the government which he served but ere he could interfere the baron of bradwardine had taken up the quarrel sir he said whatever my sentiments tanquam privatus may be in such matters i shall not tamely endure your saying anything that may impinge upon the honourable feelings of a gentleman under my roof sir if you have no respect for the laws of urbanity do ye not respect the military oath the sacramentum militare by which every officer is bound to the standards under which he is enrolled look at titus livius what he says of those roman soldiers who were so unhappy as exuere sacramentum to renounce their legionary oath but you are ignorant sir alike of ancient history and modern courtesy  not so ignorant as ye would pronounce me roared balmawhapple i ken weel that you mean the solemn league and covenant but if a the whigs in hell had taken the  here the baron and waverley both spoke at once the former calling out be silent sir ye not only show your ignorance but disgrace your native country before a stranger and an englishman and waverley at the same moment entreating mr bradwardine to permit him to reply to an affront which seemed levelled at him personally but the baron was exalted by wine wrath and scorn above all sublunary considerations  i crave you to be hushed captain waverley you are elsewhere peradventure sui jurisforisfamiliated that is and entitled it may be to think and resent for yourself but in my domain in this poor barony of bradwardine and under this roof which is quasi mine being held by tacit relocation by a tenant at will i am in loco parentis to you and bound to see you scathless and for you mr falconer of balmawhapple i warn ye let me see no more aberrations from the paths of good manners  and i tell you mr cosmo comyne bradwardine of bradwardine and tullyveolan retorted the sportsman in huge disdain that ill make a moorcock of the man that refuses my toast whether it be a cropeared english whig wi a black ribband at his lug or ane wha deserts his ain friends to claw favour wi the rats of hanover  in an instant both rapiers were brandished and some desperate passes exchanged balmawhapple was young stout and active but the baron infinitely more master of his weapon would like sir toby belch have tickled his opponent other gates than he did had he not been under the influence of ursa major  edward rushed forward to interfere between the combatants but the prostrate bulk of the laird of killancureit over which he stumbled intercepted his passage how killancureit happened to be in this recumbent posture at so interesting a moment was never accurately known some thought he was about to insconce himself under the table he himself alleged that he stumbled in the act of lifting a jointstool to prevent mischief by knocking down balmawhapple be that as it may if readier aid than either his or waverleys had not interposed there would certainly have been bloodshed but the wellknown clash of swords which was no stranger to her dwelling aroused luckie macleary as she sat quietly beyond the hallan or earthen partition of the cottage with eyes employed on bostons crook the lot while her ideas were engaged in summing up the reckoning she boldly rushed in with the shrill expostulation wad their honours slay ane another there and bring discredit on an honest widowwomans house when there was a the leeland in the country to fight upon a remonstrance which she seconded by flinging her plaid with great dexterity over the weapons of the combatants the servants by this time rushed in and being by great chance tolerably sober separated the incensed opponents with the assistance of edward and killancureit the latter led off balmawhapple cursing swearing and vowing revenge against every whig presbyterian and fanatic in england and scotland from johnogroats to the lands end and with difficulty got him to horse our hero with the assistance of saunders saunderson escorted the baron of bradwardine to his own dwelling but could not prevail upon him to retire to bed until he had made a long and learned apology for the events of the evening of which however there was not a word intelligible except something about the centaurs and the lapithae     chapter xii  repentance and a reconciliation   waverley was unaccustomed to the use of wine excepting with great temperance he slept therefore soundly till late in the succeeding morning and then awakened to a painful recollection of the scene of the preceding evening he had received a personal affronthe a gentleman a soldier and a waverley true the person who offered it was not at the time it was given possessed of the moderate share of sense which nature had allotted him true also in resenting this insult he would break the laws of heaven as well as of his country true in doing so he might take the life of a young man who perhaps respectably discharged the social duties and render his family miserable or he might lose his ownno pleasant alternative even to the bravest when it is debated coolly and in private  all this pressed on his mind yet the original statement recurred with the same irresistible force he had received a personal insult he was of the house of waverley and he bore a commission there was no alternative and he descended to the breakfast parlour with the intention of taking leave of the family and writing to one of his brother officers to meet him at the inn midway between tullyveolan and the town where they were quartered in order that he might convey such a message to the laird of balmawhapple as the circumstances seemed to demand he found miss bradwardine presiding over the tea and coffee the table loaded with warm bread both of flour oatmeal and barleymeal in the shape of loaves cakes biscuits and other varieties together with eggs reindeer ham mutton and beef ditto smoked salmon marmalade and all the other delicacies which induced even johnson himself to extol the luxury of a scotch breakfast above that of all other countries a mess of oatmeal porridge flanked by a silver jug which held an equal mixture of cream and buttermilk was placed for the barons share of this repast but rose observed he had walked out early in the morning after giving orders that his guest should not be disturbed  waverley sat down almost in silence and with an air of absence and abstraction which could not give miss bradwardine a favourable opinion of his talents for conversation he answered at random one or two observations which she ventured to make upon ordinary topics so that feeling herself almost repulsed in her efforts at entertaining him and secretly wondering that a scarlet coat should cover no better breeding she left him to his mental amusement of cursing doctor doubleits favourite constellation of ursa major as the cause of all the mischief which had already happened and was likely to ensue at once he started and his colour heightened as looking toward the window he beheld the baron and young balmawhapple pass arm in arm apparently in deep conversation and he hastily asked did mr falconer sleep here last night rose not much pleased with the abruptness of the first question which the young stranger had addressed to her answered drily in the negative and the conversation again sunk into silence  at this moment mr saunderson appeared with a message from his master requesting to speak with captain waverley in another apartment with a heart which beat a little quicker not indeed from fear but from uncertainty and anxiety edward obeyed the summons he found the two gentlemen standing together an air of complacent dignity on the brow of the baron while something like sullenness or shame or both blanked the bold visage of balmawhapple the former slipped his arm through that of the latter and thus seeming to walk with him while in reality he led him advanced to meet waverley and stopping in the midst of the apartment made in great state the following oration captain waverleymy young and esteemed friend mr falconer of balmawhapple has craved of my age and experience as of one not wholly unskilled in the dependencies and punctilios of the duello or monomachia to be his interlocutor in expressing to you the regret with which he calls to remembrance certain passages of our symposion last night which could not but be highly displeasing to you as serving for the time under this present existing government he craves you sir to drown in oblivion the memory of such solecisms against the laws of politeness as being what his better reason disavows and to receive the hand which he offers you in amity and i must needs assure you that nothing less than a sense of being dans son tort as a gallant french chevalier mons le bretailleur once said to me on such an occasion and an opinion also of your peculiar merit could have extorted such concessions for he and all his family are and have been time out of mind mavortia pectora as buchanan saith a bold and warlike sept or people  edward immediately and with natural politeness accepted the hand which balmawhapple or rather the baron in his character of mediator extended towards him it was impossible he said for him to remember what a gentleman expressed his wish he had not uttered and he willingly imputed what had passed to the exuberant festivity of the day  that is very handsomely said answered the baron for undoubtedly if a man be ebrius or intoxicated an incident which on solemn and festive occasions may and will take place in the life of a man of honour and if the same gentleman being fresh and sober recants the contumelies which he hath spoken in his liquor it must be held vinum locutum est the words cease to be his own yet would i not find this exculpation relevant in the case of one who was ebriosus or an habitual drunkard because if such a person choose to pass the greater part of his time in the predicament of intoxication he hath no title to be exeemed from the obligations of the code of politeness but should learn to deport himself peaceably and courteously when under influence of the vinous stimulus and now let us proceed to breakfast and think no more of this daft business  i must confess whatever inference may be drawn from the circumstance that edward after so satisfactory an explanation did much greater honour to the delicacies of miss bradwardines breakfasttable than his commencement had promised balmawhapple on the contrary seemed embarrassed and dejected and waverley now for the first time observed that his arm was in a sling which seemed to account for the awkward and embarrassed manner with which he had presented his hand to a question from miss bradwardine he muttered in answer something about his horse having fallen and seeming desirous to escape both from the subject and the company he arose as soon as breakfast was over made his bow to the party and declining the barons invitation to tarry till after dinner mounted his horse and returned to his own home  waverley now announced his purpose of leaving tullyveolan early enough after dinner to gain the stage at which he meant to sleep but the unaffected and deep mortification with which the goodnatured and affectionate old gentleman heard the proposal quite deprived him of courage to persist in it no sooner had he gained waverleys consent to lengthen his visit for a few days than he laboured to remove the grounds upon which he conceived he had meditated a more early retreat i would not have you opine captain waverley that i am by practice or precept an advocate of ebriety though it may be that in our festivity of last night some of our friends if not perchance altogether ebrii or drunken were to say the least ebrioli by which the ancients designed those who were fuddled or as your english vernacular and metaphorical phrase goes halfseasover not that i would so insinuate respecting you captain waverley who like a prudent youth did rather abstain from potation nor can it be truly said of myself who having assisted at the tables of many great generals and marechals at their solemn carousals have the art to carry my wine discreetly and did not during the whole evening as ye must have doubtless observed exceed the bounds of a modest hilarity  there was no refusing assent to a proposition so decidedly laid down by him who undoubtedly was the best judge although had edward formed his opinion from his own recollections he would have pronounced that the baron was not only ebriolus but verging to become ebrius or in plain english was incomparably the most drunk of the party except perhaps his antagonist the laird of balmawhapple however having received the expected or rather the required compliment on his sobriety the baron proceededno sir though i am myself of a strong temperament i abhor ebriety and detest those who swallow wine gulce causa for the oblectation of the gullet albeit i might deprecate the law of pittacus of mitylene who punished doubly a crime committed under the influence of liber pater nor would i utterly accede to the objurgation of the younger plinius in the fourteenth book of his historia naturalis no sir i distinguish i discriminate and approve of wine so far only as it maketh glad the face or in the language of flaccus recepto amico  thus terminated the apology which the baron of bradwardine thought it necessary to make for the superabundance of his hospitality and it may be easily believed that he was neither interrupted by dissent nor any expression of incredulity  he then invited his guest to a morning ride and ordered that davie gellatley should meet them at the dern path with ban and buscar for until the shooting season commence i would willingly show you some sport and we may god willing meet with a roe the roe captain waverley may be hunted at all times alike for never being in what is called pride of grease he is also never out of season though it be a truth that his venison is not equal to that of either the red or fallow deer footnote the learned in cookery dissent from the baron of bradwardine and hold the roe venison dry and indifferent food unless when dressed in soup and scotch collops but he will serve to show how my dogs run and therefore they shall attend us with david gellatley  waverley expressed his surprise that his friend davie was capable of such trust but the baron gave him to understand that this poor simpleton was neither fatuous nec naturaliter idiota as is expressed in the brieves of furiosity but simply a crackbrained knave who could execute very well any commission which jumped with his own humour and made his folly a plea for avoiding every other he has made an interest with us continued the baron by saving rose from a great danger with his own proper peril and the roguish loon must therefore eat of our bread and drink of our cup and do what he can or what he will which if the suspicions of saunderson and the bailie are well founded may perchance in his case be commensurate terms  miss bradwardine then gave waverley to understand that this poor simpleton was dotingly fond of music deeply affected by that which was melancholy and transported into extravagant gaiety by light and lively airs he had in this respect a prodigious memory stored with miscellaneous snatches and fragments of all tunes and songs which he sometimes applied with considerable address as the vehicles of remonstrance explanation or satire davie was much attached to the few who showed him kindness and both aware of any slight or ill usage which he happened to receive and sufficiently apt where he saw opportunity to revenge it the common people who often judge hardly of each other as well as of their betters although they had expressed great compassion for the poor innocent while suffered to wander in rags about the village no sooner beheld him decently clothed provided for and even a sort of favourite than they called up all the instances of sharpness and ingenuity in action and repartee which his annals afforded and charitably bottomed thereupon a hypothesis that david gellatley was no farther fool than was necessary to avoid hard labour this opinion was not better founded than that of the negroes who from the acute and mischievous pranks of the monkeys suppose that they have the gift of speech and only suppress their powers of elocution to escape being set to work but the hypothesis was entirely imaginary david gellatley was in good earnest the halfcrazed simpleton which he appeared and was incapable of any constant and steady exertion he had just so much solidity as kept on the windy side of insanity so much wild wit as saved him from the imputation of idiocy some dexterity in fieldsports in which we have known as great fools excel great kindness and humanity in the treatment of animals entrusted to him warm affections a prodigious memory and an ear for music  the stamping of horses was now heard in the court and davies voice singing to the two large deer greyhounds      hie away hie away     over bank and over brae     where the copsewood is the greenest     where the fountains glisten sheenest     where the ladyfern grows strongest     where the morning dew lies longest     where the blackcock sweetest sips it     where the fairy latest trips it     hie to haunts right seldom seen     lovely lonesome cool and green     over bank and over brae     hie away hie away   do the verses he sings asked waverley belong to old scottish poetry miss bradwardine  i believe not she replied this poor creature had a brother and heaven as if to compensate to the family davies deficiencies had given him what the hamlet thought uncommon talents an uncle contrived to educate him for the scottish kirk but he could not get preferment because he came from our ground he returned from college hopeless and brokenhearted and fell into a decline my father supported him till his death which happened before he was nineteen he played beautifully on the flute and was supposed to have a great turn for poetry he was affectionate and compassionate to his brother who followed him like his shadow and we think that from him davie gathered many fragments of songs and music unlike those of this country but if we ask him where he got such a fragment as he is now singing he either answers with wild and long fits of laughter or else breaks into tears of lamentation but was never heard to give any explanation or to mention his brothers name since his death  surely said edward who was readily interested by a tale bordering on the romantic surely more might be learned by more particular inquiry  perhaps so answered rose but my father will not permit any one to practise on his feelings on this subject  by this time the baron with the help of mr saunderson had indued a pair of jackboots of large dimensions and now invited our hero to follow him as he stalked clattering down the ample staircase tapping each huge balustrade as he passed with the   butt of his massive horsewhip and humming with the air of a chasseur of louis quatorze      pour la chasse ordonnee il faut preparer tout     ho la ho vite vite debout     chapter xiii  a more rational day than the last   the baron of bradwardine mounted on an active and wellmanaged horse and seated on a demipique saddle with deep housings to agree with his livery was no bad representative of the old school his lightcoloured embroidered coat and superbly barred waistcoat his brigadier wig surmounted by a small goldlaced cockedhat completed his personal costume but he was attended by two wellmounted servants on horseback armed with holsterpistols  in this guise he ambled forth over hill and valley the admiration of every farmyard which they passed in their progress till low down in a grassy vale they found david gellatley leading two very tall deer greyhounds and presiding over half a dozen curs and about as many barelegged and bareheaded boys who to procure the chosen distinction of attending on the chase had not failed to tickle his ears with the dulcet appellation of maister gellatley though probably all and each had hooted him on former occasions in the character of daft davie but this is no uncommon strain of flattery to persons in office nor altogether confined to the barelegged villagers of tullyveolan it was in fashion sixty years since is now and will be six hundred years hence if this admirable compound of folly and knavery called the world shall be then in existence  these gilliewetfoots as they were called were destined to beat the bushes which they performed with so much success that after half an hours search a roe was started coursed and killed the baron following on his white horse like earl percy of yore and magnanimously flaying and embowelling the slain animal which he observed was called by the french chasseurs faire la curee with his own baronial couteau de chasse after this ceremony he conducted his guest homeward by a pleasant and circuitous route commanding an extensive prospect of different villages and houses to each of which mr bradwardine attached some anecdote of history or genealogy told in language whimsical from prejudice and pedantry but often respectable for the good sense and honourable feelings which his narrative displayed and almost always curious if not valuable for the information they contained  the truth is the ride seemed agreeable to both gentlemen because they found amusement in each others conversation although their characters and habits of thinking were in many respects totally opposite edward we have informed the reader was warm in his feelings wild and romantic in his ideas and in his taste of reading with a strong disposition towards poetry mr bradwardine was the reverse of all this and piqued himself upon stalking through life with the same upright starched stoical gravity which distinguished his evening promenade upon the terrace of tullyveolan where for hours togetherthe very model of old hardyknute      stately steppd he east the wa     and stately steppd he west  as for literature he read the classic poets to be sure and the epithalamium of georgius buchanan and arthur johnstons psalms of a sunday and the deliciae poetarum scotorum and sir david lindsays works and barbours brace and blind harrys wallace and the gentle shepherd and the cherry and the slae  but though he thus far sacrificed his time to the muses he would if the truth must be spoken have been much better pleased had the pious or sapient apothegms as well as the historical narratives which these various works contained been presented to him in the form of simple prose and he sometimes could not refrain from expressing contempt of the vain and unprofitable art of poemmaking in which he saidthe only one who had excelled in his time was allan ramsay the periwigmaker  footnote the baron ought to have remembered that the joyous allan literally drew his blood from the house of the noble earl whom he terms      dalhousie of an old descent     my stoup my pride my ornament  but although edward and he differed toto coelo as the baron would have said upon this subject yet they met upon history as on a neutral ground in which each claimed an interest the baron indeed only cumbered his memory with matters of fact the cold dry hard outlines which history delineates edward on the contrary loved to fill up and round the sketch with the colouring of a warm and vivid imagination which gives light and life to the actors and speakers in the drama of past ages yet with tastes so opposite they contributed greatly to each others amusement mr bradwardines minute narratives and powerful memory supplied to waverley fresh subjects of the kind upon which his fancy loved to labour and opened to him a new mine of incident and of character and he repaid the pleasure thus communicated by an earnest attention valuable to all storytellers more especially to the baron who felt his habits of selfrespect flattered by it and sometimes also by reciprocal communications which interested mr bradwardine as confirming or illustrating his own favourite anecdotes besides mr bradwardine loved to talk of the scenes of his youth which had been spent in camps and foreign lands and had many interesting particulars to tell of the generals under whom he had served and the actions he had witnessed  both parties returned to tullyveolan in great goodhumour with each other waverley desirous of studying more attentively what he considered as a singular and interesting character gifted with a memory containing a curious register of ancient and modern anecdotes and bradwardine disposed to regard edward as puer or rather juvenis bonae spei et magnae indolis a youth devoid of that petulant volatility which is impatient of or vilipends the conversation and advice of his seniors from which he predicted great things of his future success and deportment in life there was no other guest except mr rubrick whose information and discourse as a clergyman and a scholar harmonised very well with that of the baron and his guest  shortly after dinner the baron as if to show that his temperance was not entirely theoretical proposed a visit to roses apartment or as he termed it her troisieme etage waverley was accordingly conducted through one or two of those long awkward passages with which ancient architects studied to puzzle the inhabitants of the houses which they planned at the end of which mr bradwardine began to ascend by two steps at once a very steep narrow and winding stair leaving mr rubrick and waverley to follow at more leisure while he should announce their approach to his daughter  after having climbed this perpendicular corkscrew until their brains were almost giddy they arrived in a little matted lobby which served as an anteroom to roses sanctum sanctorum and through which they entered her parlour it was a small but pleasant apartment opening to the south and hung with tapestry adorned besides with two pictures one of her mother in the dress of a shepherdess with a bellhoop the other of the baron in his tenth year in a blue coat embroidered waistcoat laced hat and bagwig with a bow in his hand edward could not help smiling at the costume and at the odd resemblance between the round smooth redcheeked staring visage in the portrait and the gaunt bearded holloweyed swarthy features which travelling fatigues of war and advanced age had bestowed on the original the baron joined in the laugh truly he saidthat picture was a womans fantasy of my good mothers a daughter of the laird of tulliellum captain waverley i indicated the house to you when we were on the top of the shinnyheuch it was burnt by the dutch auxiliaries brought in by the government in 1715 i never sate for my pourtraicture but once since that was painted and it was at the special and reiterated request of the marechal duke of berwick  the good old gentleman did not mention what mr rubrick afterwards told edward that the duke had done him this honour on account of his being the first to mount the breach of a fort in savoy during the memorable campaign of 1709 and his having there defended himself with his halfpike for nearly ten minutes before any support reached him to do the baron justice although sufficiently prone to dwell upon and even to exaggerate his family dignity and consequence he was too much a man of real courage ever to allude to such personal acts of merit as he had himself manifested  miss rose now appeared from the interior room of her apartment to welcome her father and his friends the little labours in which she had been employed obviously showed a natural taste which required only cultivation her father had taught her french and italian and a few of the ordinary authors in those languages ornamented her shelves he had endeavoured also to be her preceptor in music but as he began with the more abstruse doctrines of the science and was not perhaps master of them himself she had made no proficiency farther than to be able to accompany her voice with the harpsichord but even this was not very common in scotland at that period to make amends she sung with great taste and feeling and with a respect to the sense of what she uttered that might be proposed in example to ladies of much superior musical talent her natural good sense taught her that if as we are assured by high authority music be married to immortal verse they are very often divorced by the performer in a most shameful manner it was perhaps owing to this sensibility to poetry and power of combining its expression with those of the musical notes that her singing gave more pleasure to all the unlearned in music and even to many of the learned than could have been communicated by a much finer voice and more brilliant execution unguided by the same delicacy of feeling  a bartizan or projecting gallery before the windows of her parlour served to illustrate another of roses pursuits for it was crowded with flowers of different kinds which she had taken under her special protection a projecting turret gave access to this gothic balcony which commanded a most beautiful prospect the formal garden with its high bounding walls lay below contracted as it seemed to a mere parterre while the view extended beyond them down a wooded glen where the small river was sometimes visible sometimes hidden in copse the eye might be delayed by a desire to rest on the rocks which here and there rose from the dell with massive or spiry fronts or it might dwell on the noble though ruined tower which was here beheld in all its dignity frowning from a promontory over the river to the left were seen two or three cottages a part of the village the brow of the hill concealed the others the glen or dell was terminated by a sheet of water called loch veolan into which the brook discharged itself and which now glistened in the western sun the distant country seemed open and varied in surface though not wooded and there was nothing to interrupt the view until the scene was bounded by a ridge of distant and blue hills which formed the southern boundary of the strath or valley to this pleasant station miss bradwardine had ordered coffee  the view of the old tower or fortalice introduced some family anecdotes and tales of scottish chivalry which the baron told with great enthusiasm the projecting peak of an impending crag which rose near it had acquired the name of saint swithins chair it was the scene of a peculiar superstition of which mr rubrick mentioned some curious particulars which reminded waverley of a rhyme quoted by edgar in king lear and rose was called upon to sing a little legend in which they had been interwoven by some village poet      who noteless as the race from which he sprung     saved others names but left his own unsung  the sweetness of her voice and the simple beauty of her music gave all the advantage which the minstrel could have desired and which his poetry so much wanted i almost doubt if it can be read with patience destitute of these advantages although i conjecture the following copy to have been somewhat corrected by waverley to suit the taste of those who might not relish pure antiquity                saint swithins chair        on hallowmass eve ere ye boune ye to rest       ever beware that your couch be blessd       sign it with cross and sain it with bead       sing the ave and say the creed        for on hallowmass eve the nighthag will ride       and all her ninefold sweeping on by her side       whether the wind sing lowly or loud       sailing through moonshine or swathd in the cloud        the lady she sat in saint swithins chair       the dew of the night has dampd her hair       her cheek was pale but resolved and high       was the word of her lip and the glance of her eye        she mutterd the spell of swithin bold       when his naked foot traced the midnight wold       when he stoppd the hag as she rode the night       and bade her descend and her promise plight         he that dare sit on saint swithins chair        when the nighthag wings the troubled air        questions three when he speaks the spell        he may ask and she must tell         the baron has been with king robert his liege        these three long years in battle and siege        news are there none of his weal or his woe        and fain the lady his fate would know         she shudders and stops as the charm she speaks        is it the moody owl that shrieks        or is it that sound betwixt laughter and scream        the voice of the demon who haunts the stream         the moan of the wind sunk silent and low        and the roaring torrent had ceased to flow        the calm was more dreadful than raging storm        when the cold grey mist brought the ghastly form  i am sorry to disappoint the company especially captain waverley who listens with such laudable gravity it is but a fragment although i think there are other verses describing the return of the baron from the wars and how the lady was found claycold upon the grounsill ledge  it is one of those figments observed mr bradwardine with which the early history of distinguished families was deformed in the times of superstition as that of rome and other ancient nations had their prodigies sir the which you may read in ancient histories or in the little work compiled by julius obsequens and inscribed by the learned scheffer the editor to his patron benedictus skytte baron of dudershoff  my father has a strange defiance of the marvellous captain waverley observed rose and once stood firm when a whole synod of presbyterian divines were put to the rout by a sudden apparition of the foul fiend  waverley looked as if desirous to hear more  must i tell my story as well as sing my song wellonce upon a time there lived an old woman called janet gellatley who was suspected to be a witch on the infallible grounds that she was very old very ugly very poor and had two sons one of whom was a poet and the other a fool which visitation all the neighbourhood agreed had come upon her for the sin of witchcraft and she was imprisoned for a week in the steeple of the parish church and sparely supplied with food and not permitted to sleep until she herself became as much persuaded of her being a witch as her accusers and in this lucid and happy state of mind was brought forth to make a clean breast that is to make open confession of her sorceries before all the whig gentry and ministers in the vicinity who were no conjurors themselves my father went to see fair play between the witch and the clergy for the witch had been born on his estate and while the witch was confessing that the enemy appeared and made his addresses to her as a handsome black manwhich if you could have seen poor old bleareyed janet reflected little honour on apollyons tasteand while the auditors listened with astonished ears and the clerk recorded with a trembling hand she all of a sudden changed the low mumbling tone with which she spoke into a shrill yell and exclaimed look to yourselves look to yourselves i see the evil one sitting in the midst of ye the surprise was general and terror and flight its immediate consequences happy were those who were next the door and many were the disasters that befell hats bands cuffs and wigs before they could get out of the church where they left the obstinate prelatist to settle matters with the witch and her admirer at his own peril or pleasure  risu solvuntur tabulae said the baron when they recovered their panic trepidation they were too much ashamed to bring any wakening of the process against janet gellatley footnote see note 36  this anecdote led to a long discussion of           all those idle thoughts and fantasies          devices dreams opinions unsound          shows visions soothsays and prophecies          and all that feigned is as leasings tales and lies with such conversation and the romantic legends which it introduced closed our heros second evening in the house of tullyveolan     chapter xiv  a discoverywaverley becomes domesticated at tullyveolan   the next day edward arose betimes and in a morning walk around the house and its vicinity came suddenly upon a small court in front of the dogkennel where his friend davie was employed about his fourfooted charge one quick glance of his eye recognised waverley when instantly turning his back as if he had not observed him he began to sing part of an old ballad      young men will love thee more fair and more fast       heard ye so merry the little bird sing     old mens love the longest will last       and the throstlecocks head is under his wing      the young mans wrath is like light straw on fire       heard ye so merry the little bird sing     but like redhot steel is the old mans ire       and the throstlecocks head is under his wing      the young man will brawl at the evening board       heard ye so merry the little bird sing     but the old man will draw at the dawning the sword       and the throstlecocks head is under his wing  waverley could not avoid observing that davie laid something like a satirical emphasis on these lines he therefore approached and endeavoured by sundry queries to elicit from him what the innuendo might mean but davie had no mind to explain and had wit enough to make his folly cloak his knavery edward could collect nothing from him excepting that the laird of balmawhapple had gone home yesterday morning wi his boots fu o bluid in the garden however he met the old butler who no longer attempted to conceal that having been bred in the nursery line with sumack and co of newcastle he sometimes wrought a turn in the flowerborders to oblige the laird and miss rose by a series of queries edward at length discovered with a painful feeling of surprise and shame that balmawhapples submission and apology had been the consequence of a rencontre with the baron before his guest had quitted his pillow in which the younger combatant had been disarmed and wounded in the sword arm  greatly mortified at this information edward sought out his friendly host and anxiously expostulated with him upon the injustice he had done him in anticipating his meeting with mr falconer a circumstance which considering his youth and the profession of arms which he had just adopted was capable of being represented much to his prejudice the baron justified himself at greater length than i choose to repeat he urged that the quarrel was common to them and that balmawhapple could not by the code of honour evite giving satisfaction to both which he had done in his case by an honourable meeting and in that of edward by such a palinode as rendered the use of the sword unnecessary and which being made and accepted must necessarily sopite the whole affair  with this excuse or explanation waverley was silenced if not satisfied but he could not help testifying some displeasure against the blessed bear which had given rise to the quarrel nor refrain from hinting that the sanctified epithet was hardly appropriate the baron observed he could not deny that the bear though allowed by heralds as a most honourable ordinary had nevertheless somewhat fierce churlish and morose in his disposition as might be read in archibald simson pastor of dalkeiths hieroglyphica animalium and had thus been the type of many quarrels and dissensions which had occurred in the house of bradwardine of which he continued i might commemorate mine own unfortunate dissension with my third cousin by the mothers side sir hew halbert who was so unthinking as to deride my family name as if it had been quasi bearwarden a most uncivil jest since it not only insinuated that the founder of our house occupied such a mean situation as to be a custodier of wild beasts a charge which ye must have observed is only entrusted to the very basest plebeians but moreover seemed to infer that our coatarmour had not been achieved by honourable actions in war but bestowed by way of paranomasia or pun upon our family appellationa sort of bearing which the french call armoires parlantes the latins arma cantantia and your english authorities canting heraldry footnote see note 37 being indeed a species of emblazoning more befitting canters gaberlunzies and such like mendicants whose gibberish is formed upon playing upon the word than the noble honourable and useful science of heraldry which assigns armorial bearings as the reward of noble and generous actions and not to tickle the ear with vain quodlibets such as are found in jestbooks of his quarrel with sir hew he said nothing more than that it was settled in a fitting manner  having been so minute with respect to the diversions of tullyveolan on the first days of edwards arrival for the purpose of introducing its inmates to the readers acquaintance it becomes less necessary to trace the progress of his intercourse with the same accuracy it is probable that a young man accustomed to more cheerful society would have tired of the conversation of so violent an assertor of the boast of heraldry as the baron but edward found an agreeable variety in that of miss bradwardine who listened with eagerness to his remarks upon literature and showed great justness of taste in her answers the sweetness of her disposition had made her submit with complacency and even pleasure to the course of reading prescribed by her father although it not only comprehended several heavy folios of history but certain gigantic tomes in highchurch polemics in heraldry he was fortunately contented to give her only such a slight tincture as might be acquired by perusal of the two folio volumes of nisbet rose was indeed the very apple of her fathers eye her constant liveliness her attention to all those little observances most gratifying to those who would never think of exacting them her beauty in which he recalled the features of his beloved wife her unfeigned piety and the noble generosity of her disposition would have justified the affection of the most doting father      his anxiety on her behalf did not however seem to extend itself in that quarter where according to the general opinion it is most efficiently displayed in labouring namely to establish her in life either by a large dowry or a wealthy marriage by an old settlement almost all the landed estates of the baron went after his death to a distant relation and it was supposed that miss bradwardine would remain but slenderly provided for as the good gentlemans cash matters had been too long under the exclusive charge of bailie macwheeble to admit of any great expectations from his personal succession it is true the said bailie loved his patron and his patrons daughter next though at an incomparable distance to himself he thought it was possible to set aside the settlement on the male line and had actually procured an opinion to that effect and as he boasted without a fee from an eminent scottish counsel under whose notice he contrived to bring the point while consulting him regularly on some other business but the baron would not listen to such a proposal for an instant on the contrary he used to have a perverse pleasure in boasting that the barony of bradwardine was a male fief the first charter having been given at that early period when women were not deemed capable to hold a feudal grant because according to les coustusmes de normandie cest lhomme ki se bast et ki conseille or as is yet more ungallantly expressed by other authorities all of whose barbarous names he delighted to quote at full length because a woman could not serve the superior or feudal lord in war on account of the decorum of her sex nor assist him with advice because of her limited intellect nor keep his counsel owing to the infirmity of her disposition he would triumphantly ask how it would become a female and that female a bradwardine to be seen employed in servitio exuendi seu detrahendi caligas regis post battaliam that is in pulling off the kings boots after an engagement which was the feudal service by which he held the barony of bradwardine no he said beyond hesitation procul dubio many females as worthy as rose had been excluded in order to make way for my own succession and heaven forbid that i should do aught that might contravene the destination of my forefathers or impinge upon the right of my kinsman malcolm bradwardine of inchgrabbit an honourable though decayed branch of my own family  the bailie as prime minister having received this decisive communication from his sovereign durst not press his own opinion any farther but contented himself with deploring on all suitable occasions to saunderson the minister of the interior the lairds selfwilledness and with laying plans for uniting rose with the young laird of balmawhapple who had a fine estate only moderately burdened and was a faultless young gentleman being as sober as a saintif you keep brandy from him and him from brandyand who in brief had no imperfection but that of keeping light company at a time such as jinker the horsecouper and gibby gaethroughwit the piper o cupar o whilk follies mr saunderson hell mend hell mend pronounced the bailie  like sour ale in simmer added davie gellatley who happened to be nearer the conclave than they were aware of  miss bradwardine such as we have described her with all the simplicity and curiosity of a recluse attached herself to the opportunities of increasing her store of literature which edwards visit afforded her he sent for some of his books from his quarters and they opened to her sources of delight of which she had hitherto had no idea the best english poets of every description and other works on belleslettres made a part of this precious cargo her music even her flowers were neglected and saunders not only mourned over but began to mutiny against the labour for which he now scarce received thanks these new pleasures became gradually enhanced by sharing them with one of a kindred taste edwards readiness to comment to recite to explain difficult passages rendered his assistance invaluable and the wild romance of his spirit delighted a character too young and inexperienced to observe its deficiencies upon subjects which interested him and when quite at ease he possessed that flow of natural and somewhat florid eloquence which has been supposed as powerful even as figure fashion fame or fortune in winning the female heart there was therefore an increasing danger in this constant intercourse to poor roses peace of mind which was the more imminent as her father was greatly too much abstracted in his studies and wrapped up in his own dignity to dream of his daughters incurring it the daughters of the house of bradwardine were in his opinion like those of the house of bourbon or austria placed high above the clouds of passion which might obfuscate the intellects of meaner females they moved in another sphere were governed by other feelings and amenable to other rules than those of idle and fantastic affection in short he shut his eyes so resolutely to the natural consequences of edwards intimacy with miss bradwardine that the whole neighbourhood concluded that he had opened them to the advantages of a match between his daughter and the wealthy young englishman and pronounced him much less a fool than he had generally shown himself in cases where his own interest was concerned  if the baron however had really meditated such an alliance the indifference of waverley would have been an insuperable bar to his project our hero since mixing more freely with the world had learned to think with great shame and confusion upon his mental legend of saint cecilia and the vexation of these reflections was likely for some time at least to counterbalance the natural susceptibility of his disposition besides rose bradwardine beautiful and amiable as we have described her had not precisely the sort of beauty or merit which captivates a romantic imagination in early youth she was too frank too confiding too kind amiable qualities undoubtedly but destructive of the marvellous with which a youth of imagination delights to dress the empress of his affections was it possible to bow to tremble and to adore before the timid yet playful little girl who now asked edward to mend her pen now to construe a stanza in tasso and now how to spell a veryvery long word in her version of it all these incidents have their fascination on the mind at a certain period of life but not when a youth is entering it and rather looking out for some object whose affection may dignify him in his own eyes than stooping to one who looks up to him for such distinction hence though there can be no rule in so capricious a passion early love is frequently ambitious in choosing its object or which comes to the same selects her as in the case of saint cecilia aforesaid from a situation that gives fair scope for le beau ideal which the reality of intimate and familiar life rather tends to limit and impair i knew a very accomplished and sensible young man cured of a violent passion for a pretty woman whose talents were not equal to her face and figure by being permitted to bear her company for a whole afternoon thus it is certain that had edward enjoyed such an opportunity of conversing with miss stubbs aunt rachels precaution would have been unnecessary for he would as soon have fallen in love with the dairymaid and although miss bradwardine was a very different character it seems probable that the very intimacy of their intercourse prevented his feeling for her other sentiments than those of a brother for an amiable and accomplished sister while the sentiments of poor rose were gradually and without her being conscious assuming a shade of warmer affection  i ought to have said that edward when he sent to dundee for the books before mentioned had applied for and received permission extending his leave of absence but the letter of his commanding officer contained a friendly recommendation to him not to spend his time exclusively with persons who estimable as they might be in a general sense could not be supposed well affected to a government which they declined to acknowledge by taking the oath of allegiance the letter further insinuated though with great delicacy that although some family connections might be supposed to render it necessary for captain waverley to communicate with gentlemen who were in this unpleasant state of suspicion yet his fathers situation and wishes ought to prevent his prolonging those attentions into exclusive intimacy and it was intimated that while his political principles were endangered by communicating with laymen of this description he might also receive erroneous impressions in religion from the prelatic clergy who so perversely laboured to set up the royal prerogative in things sacred  this last insinuation probably induced waverley to set both down to the prejudices of his commanding officer he was sensible that mr bradwardine had acted with the most scrupulous delicacy in never entering upon any discussion that had the most remote tendency to bias his mind in political opinions although he was himself not only a decided partisan of the exiled family but had been trusted at different times with important commissions for their service sensible therefore that there was no risk of his being perverted from his allegiance edward felt as if he should do his uncles old friend injustice in removing from a house where he gave and received pleasure and amusement merely to gratify a prejudiced and illjudged suspicion he therefore wrote a very general answer assuring his commanding officer that his loyalty was not in the most distant danger of contamination and continued an honoured guest and inmate of the house of tullyveolan     chapter xv  a creagh and its consequences   when edward had been a guest at tullyveolan nearly six weeks he descried one morning as he took his usual walk before the breakfast hour signs of uncommon perturbation in the family four barelegged dairymaids with each an empty milkpail in her hand ran about with frantic gestures and uttering loud exclamations of surprise grief and resentment from their appearance a pagan might have conceived them a detachment of the celebrated belides just come from their baling penance as nothing was to be got from this distracted chorus excepting lord guide us and eh sirs ejaculations which threw no light upon the cause of their dismay waverley repaired to the forecourt as it was called where he beheld bailie macwheeble cantering his white pony down the avenue with all the speed it could muster he had arrived it would seem upon a hasty summons and was followed by half a score of peasants from the village who had no great difficulty in keeping pace with him  the bailie greatly too busy and too important to enter into explanations with edward summoned forth mr saunderson who appeared with a countenance in which dismay was mingled with solemnity and they immediately entered into close conference davie gellatley was also seen in the group idle as diogenes at sinope while his countrymen were preparing for a siege his spirits always rose with anything good or bad which occasioned tumult and he continued frisking hopping dancing and singing the burden of an old ballad      our gears a gane  until happening to pass too near the bailie he received an admonitory hint from his horsewhip which converted his songs into lamentation  passing from thence towards the garden waverley beheld the baron in person measuring and remeasuring with swift and tremendous strides the length of the terrace his countenance clouded with offended pride and indignation and the whole of his demeanour such as seemed to indicate that any inquiry concerning the cause of his discomposure would give pain at least if not offence waverley therefore glided into the house without addressing him and took his way to the breakfastparlour where he found his young friend rose who though she neither exhibited the resentment of her father the turbid importance of bailie macwheeble nor the despair of the handmaidens seemed vexed and thoughtful a single word explained the mystery your breakfast will be a disturbed one captain waverley a party of caterans have come down upon us last night and have driven off all our milch cows  a party of caterans  yes robbers from the neighbouring highlands we used to be quite free from them while we paid blackmail to fergus macivor vich ian vohr but my father thought it unworthy of his rank and birth to pay it any longer and so this disaster has happened it is not the value of the cattle captain waverley that vexes me but my father is so much hurt at the affront and is so bold and hot that i fear he will try to recover them by the strong hand and if he is not hurt himself he will hurt some of these wild people and then there will be no peace between them and us perhaps for our lifetime and we cannot defend ourselves as in old times for the government have taken all our arms and my dear father is so rasho what will become of ushere poor rose lost heart altogether and burst into a flood of tears  the baron entered at this moment and rebuked her with more asperity than waverley had ever heard him use to any one was it not a shame he said that she should exhibit herself before any gentleman in such a light as if she shed tears for a drove of horned nolt and milch kine like the daughter of a cheshire yeomancaptain waverley i must request your favourable construction of her grief which may or ought to proceed solely from seeing her fathers estate exposed to spulzie and depredation from common thieves and sorners while we are not allowed to keep half a score of muskets whether for defence or rescue  bailie macwheeble entered immediately afterwards and by his report of arms and ammunition confirmed this statement informing the baron in a melancholy voice that though the people would certainly obey his honours orders yet there was no chance of their following the gear to ony guid purpose in respect there were only his honours body servants who had swords and pistols and the depredators were twelve highlanders completely armed after the manner of their country having delivered this doleful annunciation he assumed a posture of silent dejection shaking his head slowly with the motion of a pendulum when it is ceasing to vibrate and then remained stationary his body stooping at a more acute angle than usual and the latter part of his person projecting in proportion  the baron meanwhile paced the room in silent indignation and at length fixing his eye upon an old portrait whose person was clad in armour and whose features glared grimly out of a huge bush of hair part of which descended from his head to his shoulders and part from his chin and upperlip to his breastplatethat gentleman captain waverley my grandsire he said with two hundred horsewhom he levied within his own bounds discomfited and put to the rout more than five hundred of these highland reivers who have been ever lapis offensionis et petra scandali a stumblingblock and a rock of offence to the lowland vicinagehe discomfited them i say when they had the temerity to descend to harry this country in the time of the civil dissensions in the year of grace sixteen hundred forty and two and now sir i his grandson am thus used at such unworthy hands  here there was an awful pause after which all the company as is usual in cases of difficulty began to give separate and inconsistent counsel alexander ab alexandro proposed they should send some one to compound with the caterans who would readily he said give up their prey for a dollar a head the bailie opined that this transaction would amount to theftboot or composition of felony and he recommended that some canny hand should be sent up to the glens to make the best bargain he could as it were for himself so that the laird might not be seen in such a transaction edward proposed to send off to the nearest garrison for a party of soldiers and a magistrates warrant and rose as far as she dared endeavoured to insinuate the course of paying the arrears of tribute money to fergus macivor vich ian vohr who they all knew could easily procure restoration of the cattle if he were properly propitiated  none of these proposals met the barons approbation the idea of composition direct or implied was absolutely ignominious that of waverley only showed that he did not understand the state of the country and of the political parties which divided it and standing matters as they did with fergus macivor vich ian vohr the baron would make no concession to him were it he said to procure restitution in integrum of every stirk and stot that the chief his forefathers and his clan had stolen since the days of malcolm canmore  in fact his voice was still for war and he proposed to send expresses to balmawhapple killancureit tulliellum and other lairds who were exposed to similar depredations inviting them to join in the pursuit and then sir shall these nebulones nequissimi as leslaeus calls them be brought to the fate of their predecessor cacus      elisos oculos et siccum sanguine guttur  the bailie who by no means relished these warlike counsels here pulled forth an immense watch of the colour and nearly of the size of a pewter warmingpan and observed it was now past noon and that the caterans had been seen in the pass of ballybrough soon after sunrise so that before the allied forces could assemble they and their prey would be far beyond the reach of the most active pursuit and sheltered in those pathless deserts where it was neither advisable to follow nor indeed possible to trace them  this proposition was undeniable the council therefore broke up without coming to any conclusion as has occurred to councils of more importance only it was determined that the bailie should send his own three milkcows down to the mains for the use of the barons family and brew small ale as a substitute for milk in his own to this arrangement which was suggested by saunderson the bailie readily assented both from habitual deference to the family and an internal consciousness that his courtesy would in some mode or other be repaid tenfold  the baron having also retired to give some necessary directions waverley seized the opportunity to ask whether this fergus with the unpronounceable name was the chief thieftaker of the district  thieftaker answered rose laughing he is a gentleman of great honour and consequence the chieftain of an independent branch of a powerful highland clan and is much respected both for his own power and that of his kith kin and allies  and what has he to do with the thieves then is he a magistrate or in the commission of the peace asked waverley  the commission of war rather if there be such a thing said rose for he is a very unquiet neighbour to his unfriends and keeps a greater following on foot than many that have thrice his estate as to his connection with the thieves that i cannot well explain but the boldest of them will never steal a hoof from any one that pays blackmail to vich lan vohr  and what is blackmail  a sort of protectionmoney that lowcountry gentlemen and heritors lying near the highlands pay to some highland chief that he may neither do them harm himself nor suffer it to be done to them by others and then if your cattle are stolen you have only to send him word and he will recover them or it may be he will drive away cows from some distant place where he has a quarrel and give them to you to make up your loss footnote see note 13  and is this sort of highland jonathan wild admitted into society and called a gentleman  so much so said rose that the quarrel between my father and fergus macivor began at a county meeting where he wanted to take precedence of all the lowland gentlemen then present only my father would not suffer it and then he upbraided my father that he was under his banner and paid him tribute and my father was in a towering passion for bailie macwheeble who manages such things his own way had contrived to keep this blackmail a secret from him and passed it in his account for cessmoney and they would have fought but fergus macivor said very gallantly he would never raise his hand against a grey head that was so much respected as my fatherso i wish i wish they had continued friends  and did you ever see this mr macivor if that be his name miss bradwardine  no that is not his name and he would consider master as a sort of affront only that you are an englishman and know no better but the lowlanders call him like other gentlemen by the name of his estate glennaquoich and the highlanders call him vich ian vohr that is the son of john the great and we upon the braes here call him by both names indifferently  i am afraid i shall never bring my english tongue to call him by either one or other  but he is a very polite handsome man continued rose and his sister flora is one of the most beautiful and accomplished young ladies in this country she was bred in a convent in france and was a great friend of mine before this unhappy dispute dear captain waverley try your influence with my father to make matters up i am sure this is but the beginning of our troubles for tullyveolan has never been a safe or quiet residence when we have been at feud with the highlanders when i was a girl about ten there was a skirmish fought between a party of twenty of them and my father and his servants behind the mains and the bullets broke several panes in the north windows they were so near three of the highlanders were killed and they brought them in wrapped in their plaids and laid them on the stone floor of the hall and next morning their wives and daughters came clapping their hands and crying the coronach and shrieking and carried away the dead bodies with the pipes playing before them i could not sleep for six weeks without starting and thinking i heard these terrible cries and saw the bodies lying on the steps all stiff and swathed up in their bloody tartans but since that time there came a party from the garrison at stirling with a warrant from the lord justice clerk or some such great man and took away all our arms and now how are we to protect ourselves if they come down in any strength  waverley could not help starting at a story which bore so much resemblance to one of his own daydreams here was a girl scarce seventeen the gentlest of her sex both in temper and appearance who had witnessed with her own eyes such a scene as he had used to conjure up in his imagination as only occurring in ancient times and spoke of it coolly as one very likely to recur he felt at once the impulse of curiosity and that slight sense of danger which only serves to heighten its interest he might have said with malvolio i do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me i am actually in the land of military and romantic adventures and it only remains to be seen what will be my own share in them  the whole circumstances now detailed concerning the state of the country seemed equally novel and extraordinary he had indeed often heard of highland thieves but had no idea of the systematic mode in which their depredations were conducted and that the practice was connived at and even encouraged by many of the highland chieftains who not only found the creaghs or forays useful for the purpose of training individuals of their clan to the practice of arms but also of maintaining a wholesome terror among their lowland neighbours and levying as we have seen a tribute from them under colour of protectionmoney  bailie macwheeble who soon afterwards entered expatiated still more at length upon the same topic this honest gentlemans conversation was so formed upon his professional practice that davie gellatley once said his discourse was like a charge of horning he assured our hero that from the maist ancient times of record the lawless thieves limmers and broken men of the highlands had been in fellowship together by reason of their surnames for the committing of divers thefts reifs and herships upon the honest men of the low country when they not only intromitted with their whole goods and gear corn cattle horse nolt sheep outsight and insight plenishing at their wicked pleasure but moreover made prisoners ransomed them or concussed them into giving borrows pledges to enter into captivity againall which was directly prohibited in divers parts of the statute book both by the act one thousand five hundred and sixtyseven and various others the whilk statutes with all that had followed and might follow thereupon were shamefully broken and vilipended by the said sorners limmers and broken men associated into fellowships for the aforesaid purposes of theft stouthreef fireraising murther raptus mulierum or forcible abduction of women and such like as aforesaid  it seemed like a dream to waverley that these deeds of violence should be familiar to mens minds and currently talked of as falling within the common order of things and happening daily in the immediate vicinity without his having crossed the seas and while he was yet in the otherwise wellordered island of great britain     chapter xvi  an unexpected ally appears   the baron returned at the dinnerhour and had in a great measure recovered his composure and goodhumour he not only confirmed the stories which edward had heard from rose and bailie macwheeble but added many anecdotes from his own experience concerning the state of the highlands and their inhabitants the chiefs he pronounced to be in general gentlemen of great honour and high pedigree whose word was accounted as a law by all those of their own sept or clan it did not indeed he said become them as had occurred in late instances to propone their prosapia a lineage which rested for the most part on the vain and fond rhymes of their seannachies or bhairds as aequiponderate with the evidence of ancient charters and royal grants of antiquity conferred upon distinguished houses in the low country by divers scottish monarchs nevertheless such was their outrecuidance and presumption as to undervalue those who possessed such evidents as if they held their lands in a sheeps skin  this by the way pretty well explained the cause of quarrel between the baron and his highland ally but he went on to state so many curious particulars concerning the manners customs and habits of this patriarchal race that edwards curiosity became highly interested and he inquired whether it was possible to make with safety an excursion into the neighbouring highlands whose dusky barrier of mountains had already excited his wish to penetrate beyond them the baron assured his guest that nothing would be more easy providing this quarrel were first made up since he could himself give him letters to many of the distinguished chiefs who would receive him with the utmost courtesy and hospitality  while they were on this topic the door suddenly opened and ushered by saunders saunderson a highlander fully armed and equipped entered the apartment had it not been that saunders acted the part of master of the ceremonies to this martial apparition without appearing to deviate from his usual composure and that neither mr bradwardine nor rose exhibited any emotion edward would certainly have thought the intrusion hostile as it was he started at the sight of what he had not yet happened to see a mountaineer in his full national costume the individual gael was a stout dark young man of low stature the ample folds of whose plaid added to the appearance of strength which his person exhibited the short kilt or petticoat showed his sinewy and cleanmade limbs the goatskin purse flanked by the usual defences a dirk and steelwrought pistol hung before him his bonnet had a short feather which indicated his claim to be treated as a duinhewassel or sort of gentleman a broadsword dangled by his side a target hung upon his shoulder and a long spanish fowlingpiece occupied one of his hands with the other hand he pulled off his bonnet and the baron who well knew their customs and the proper mode of addressing them immediately said with an air of dignity but without rising and much as edward thought in the manner of a prince receiving an embassy welcome evan dhu maccombich what news from fergus macivor vich lan vohr  fergus macivor vich lan vohr said the ambassador in good english greets you well baron of bradwardine and tullyveolan and is sorry there has been a thick cloud interposed between you and him which has kept you from seeing and considering the friendship and alliances that have been between your houses and forebears of old and he prays you that the cloud may pass away and that things may be as they have been heretofore between the clan ivor and the house of bradwardine when there was an egg between them for a flint and a knife for a sword and he expects you will also say you are sorry for the cloud and no man shall hereafter ask whether it descended from the bill to the valley or rose from the valley to the hill for they never struck with the scabbard who did not receive with the sword and woe to him who would lose his friend for the stormy cloud of a spring morning  to this the baron of bradwardine answered with suitable dignity that he knew the chief of clan ivor to be a wellwisher to the king and he was sorry there should have been a cloud between him and any gentleman of such sound principles for when folks are banding together feeble is he who hath no brother  this appearing perfectly satisfactory that the peace between these august persons might be duly solemnised the baron ordered a stoup of usquebaugh and filling a glass drank to the health and prosperity of macivor of glennaquoich upon which the celtic ambassador to requite his politeness turned down a mighty bumper of the same generous liquor seasoned with his good wishes to the house of bradwardine  having thus ratified the preliminaries of the general treaty of pacification the envoy retired to adjust with mr macwheeble some subordinate articles with which it was not thought necessary to trouble the baron these probably referred to the discontinuance of the subsidy and apparently the bailie found means to satisfy their ally without suffering his master to suppose that his dignity was compromised at least it is certain that after the plenipotentiaries had drunk a bottle of brandy in single drams which seemed to have no more effect upon such seasoned vessels than if it had been poured upon the two bears at the top of the avenue evan dhu maccombich having possessed himself of all the information which he could procure respecting the robbery of the preceding night declared his intention to set off immediately in pursuit of the cattle which he pronounced to be no that far off they have broken the bone he observed but they have had no time to suck the marrow  our hero who had attended evan dhu during his perquisitions was much struck with the ingenuity which he displayed in collecting information and the precise and pointed conclusions which he drew from it evan dhu on his part was obviously flattered with the attention of waverley the interest he seemed to take in his inquiries and his curiosity about the customs and scenery of the highlands without much ceremony he invited edward to accompany him on a short walk of ten or fifteen miles into the mountains and see the place where the cattle were conveyed to adding if it be as i suppose you never saw such a place in your life nor ever will unless you go with me or the like of me  our hero feeling his curiosity considerably excited by the idea of visiting the den of a highland cacus took however the precaution to inquire if his guide might be trusted he was assured that the invitation would on no account have been given had there been the least danger and that all he had to apprehend was a little fatigue and as evan proposed he should pass a day at his chieftains house in returning where he would be sure of good accommodation and an excellent welcome there seemed nothing very formidable in the task he undertook rose indeed turned pale when she heard of it but her father who loved the spirited curiosity of his young friend did not attempt to damp it by an alarm of danger which really did not exist and a knapsack with a few necessaries being bound on the shoulders of a sort of deputy gamekeeper our hero set forth with a fowlingpiece in his hand accompanied by his new friend evan dhu and followed by the gamekeeper aforesaid and by two wild highlanders the attendants of evan one of whom had upon his shoulder a hatchet at the end of a pole called a lochaberaxe footnote see note 14 and the other a long duckinggun evan upon edwards inquiry gave him to understand that this martial escort was by no means necessary as a guard but merely as he said drawing up and adjusting his plaid with an air of dignity that he might appear decently at tullyveolan and as vich ian vohrs fosterbrother ought to do ah said he if you saxon duinhewassel english gentleman saw but the chief with his tail on  with his tail on echoed edward in some surprise  yesthat is with all his usual followers when he visits those of the same rank there is he continued stopping and drawing himself proudly up while he counted upon his fingers the several officers of his chiefs retinue there is his hanchman or righthand man then his bard or poet then his bladier or orator to make harangues to the great folks whom he visits then his gillymore or armourbearer to carry his sword and target and his gun then his gillycasfliuch who carries him on his back through the sikes and brooks then his gillycomstrian to lead his horse by the bridle in steep and difficult paths then his gillytrushharnish to carry his knapsack and the piper and the pipers man and it may be a dozen young lads beside that have no business but are just boys of the belt to follow the laird and do his honours bidding  and does your chief regularly maintain all these men demanded waverley  all these replied evan ay and many a fair head beside that would not ken where to lay itself but for the mickle barn at glennaquoich  with similar tales of the grandeur of the chief in peace and war evan dhu beguiled the way till they approached more closely those huge mountains which edward had hitherto only seen at a distance it was towards evening as they entered one of the tremendous passes which afford communication between the high and low country the path which was extremely steep and rugged winded up a chasm between two tremendous rocks following the passage which a foaming stream that brawled far below appeared to have worn for itself in the course of ages a few slanting beams of the sun which was now setting reached the water in its darksome bed and showed it partially chafed by a hundred rocks and broken by a hundred falls the descent from the path to the stream was a mere precipice with here and there a projecting fragment of granite or a scathed tree which had warped its twisted roots into the fissures of the rock on the right hand the mountain rose above the path with almost equal inaccessibility but the hill on the opposite side displayed a shroud of copsewood with which some pines were intermingled  this said evan is the pass of ballybrough which was kept in former times by ten of the clan donnochie against a hundred of the lowcountry carles the graves of the slain are still to be seen in that little corrie or bottom on the opposite side of the burn if your eyes are good you may see the green specks among the heather see there is an earn which you southrons call an eagle you have no such birds as that in england he is going to fetch his supper from the laird of bradwardines braes but i ll send a slug after him  he fired his piece accordingly but missed the superb monarch of the feathered tribes who without noticing the attempt to annoy him continued his majestic flight to the southward a thousand birds of prey hawks kites carrioncrows and ravens disturbed from the lodgings which they had just taken up for the evening rose at the report of the gun and mingled their hoarse and discordant notes with the echoes which replied to it and with the roar of the mountain cataracts evan a little disconcerted at having missed his mark when he meant to have displayed peculiar dexterity covered his confusion by whistling part of a pibroch as he reloaded his piece and proceeded in silence up the pass  it issued in a narrow glen between two mountains both very lofty and covered with heath the brook continued to be their companion and they advanced up its mazes crossing them now and then on which occasions evan dhu uniformly offered the assistance of his attendants to carry over edward but our hero who had been always a tolerable pedestrian declined the accommodation and obviously rose in his guides opinion by showing that he did not fear wetting his feet indeed he was anxious so far as he could without affectation to remove the opinion which evan seemed to entertain of the effeminacy of the lowlanders and particularly of the english  through the gorge of this glen they found access to a black bog of tremendous extent full of large pitholes which they traversed with great difficulty and some danger by tracks which no one but a highlander could have followed the path itself or rather the portion of more solid ground on which the travellers half walked half waded was rough broken and in many places quaggy and unsound sometimes the ground was so completely unsafe that it was necessary to spring from one hillock to another the space between being incapable of bearing the human weight this was an easy matter to the highlanders who wore thinsoled brogues fit for the purpose and moved with a peculiar springing step but edward began to find the exercise to which he was unaccustomed more fatiguing than he expected the lingering twilight served to show them through this serbonian bog but deserted them almost totally at the bottom of a steep and very stony hill which it was the travellers next toilsome task to ascend the night however was pleasant and not dark and waverley calling up mental energy to support personal fatigue held on his march gallantly though envying in his heart his highland attendants who continued without a symptom of abated vigour the rapid and swinging pace or rather trot which according to his computation had already brought them fifteen miles upon their journey  after crossing this mountain and descending on the other side towards a thick wood evan dhu held some conference with his highland attendants in consequence of which edwards baggage was shifted from the shoulders of the gamekeeper to those of one of the gillies and the former was sent off with the other mountaineer in a direction different from that of the three remaining travellers on asking the meaning of this separation waverley was told that the lowlander must go to a hamlet about three miles off for the night for unless it was some very particular friend donald bean lean the worthy person whom they supposed to be possessed of the cattle did not much approve of strangers approaching his retreat this seemed reasonable and silenced a qualm of suspicion which came across edwards mind when he saw himself at such a place and such an hour deprived of his only lowland companion and evan immediately afterwards addedthat indeed he himself had better get forward and announce their approach to donald bean lean as the arrival of a sidier roy red soldier might otherwise be a disagreeable surprise and without waiting for an answer in jockey phrase he trotted out and putting himself to a very round pace was out of sight in an instant  waverley was now left to his own meditations for his attendant with the battleaxe spoke very little english they were traversing a thick and as it seemed an endless wood of pines and consequently the path was altogether indiscernible in the murky darkness which surrounded them the highlander however seemed to trace it by instinct without the hesitation of a moment and edward followed his footsteps as close as he could  after journeying a considerable time in silence he could not help asking was it far to the end of their journey  ta cove was tree four mile but as duinhewassel was a wee taiglit donald could tat is mightwouldshould send ta curragh  this conveyed no information the curragh which was promised might be a man a horse a cart or chaise and no more could be got from the man with the battleaxe but a repetition of aich ay ta curragh  but in a short time edward began to conceive his meaning when issuing from the wood he found himself on the banks of a large river or lake where his conductor gave him to understand they must sit down for a little while the moon which now began to rise showed obscurely the expanse of water which spread before them and the shapeless and indistinct forms of mountains with which it seemed to be surrounded the cool and yet mild air of the summer night refreshed waverley after his rapid and toilsome walk and the perfume which it wafted from the birch trees footnote it is not the weeping birch the most common species in the highlands but the woollyleaved lowland birch that is distinguished by this fragrance bathed in the evening dew was exquisitely fragrant  he had now time to give himself up to the full romance of his situation here he sate on the banks of an unknown lake under the guidance of a wild native whose language was unknown to him on a visit to the den of some renowned outlaw a second robin hood perhaps or adam o gordon and that at deep midnight through scenes of difficulty and toil separated from his attendant left by his guide what a variety of incidents for the exercise of a romantic imagination and all enhanced by the solemn feeling of uncertainty at least if not of danger the only circumstance which assorted ill with the rest was the cause of his journeythe barons milkcows this degrading incident he kept in the background  while wrapt in these dreams of imagination his companion gently touched him and pointing in a direction nearly straight across the lake said yons ta cove a small point of light was seen to twinkle in the direction in which he pointed and gradually increasing in size and lustre seemed to flicker like a meteor upon the verge of the horizon while edward watched this phenomenon the distant dash of oars was heard the measured sound approached near and more near and presently a loud whistle was heard in the same direction his friend with the battleaxe immediately whistled clear and shrill in reply to the signal and a boat manned with four or five highlanders pushed for a little inlet near which edward was sitting he advanced to meet them with his attendant was immediately assisted into the boat by the officious attention of two stout mountaineers and had no sooner seated himself than they resumed their oars and began to row across the lake with great rapidity     chapter xvii  the hold of a highland robber   the party preserved silence interrupted only by the monotonous and murmured chant of a gaelic song sung in a kind of low recitative by the steersman and by the dash of the oars which the notes seemed to regulate as they dipped to them in cadence the light which they now approached more nearly assumed a broader redder and more irregular splendour it appeared plainly to be a large fire but whether kindled upon an island or the mainland edward could not determine as he saw it the red glaring orb seemed to rest on the very surface of the lake itself and resembled the fiery vehicle in which the evil genius of an oriental tale traverses land and sea they approached nearer and the light of the fire sufficed to show that it was kindled at the bottom of a huge dark crag or rock rising abruptly from the very edge of the water its front changed by the reflection to dusky red formed a strange and even awful contrast to the banks around which were from time to time faintly and partially illuminated by pallid moonlight  the boat now neared the shore and edward could discover that this large fire amply supplied with branches of pinewood by two figures who in the red reflection of its light appeared like demons was kindled in the jaws of a lofty cavern into which an inlet from the lake seemed to advance and he conjectured which was indeed true that the fire had been lighted as a beacon to the boatmen on their return they rowed right for the mouth of the cave and then shifting their oars permitted the boat to enter in obedience to the impulse which it had received the skiff passed the little point or platform of rock on which the fire was blazing and running about two boats lengths farther stopped where the cavern for it was already arched overhead ascended from the water by five or six broad ledges of rock so easy and regular that they might be termed natural steps at this moment a quantity of water was suddenly flung upon the fire which sunk with a hissing noise and with it disappeared the light it had hitherto afforded four or five active arms lifted waverley out of the boat placed him on his feet and almost carried him into the recesses of the cave he made a few paces in darkness guided in this manner and advancing towards a hum of voices which seemed to sound from the centre of the rock at an acute turn donald bean lean and his whole establishment were before his eyes      the interior of the cave which here rose very high was illuminated by torches made of pinetree which emitted a bright and bickering light attended by a strong though not unpleasant odour their light was assisted by the red glare of a large charcoal fire round which were seated five or six armed highlanders while others were indistinctly seen couched on their plaids in the more remote recesses of the cavern in one large aperture which the robber facetiously called his spence or pantry there hung by the heels the carcasses of a sheep or ewe and two cows lately slaughtered the principal inhabitant of this singular mansion attended by evan dhu as master of the ceremonies came forward to meet his guest totally different in appearance and manner from what his imagination had anticipated the profession which he followed the wilderness in which he dwelt the wild warrior forms that surrounded him were all calculated to inspire terror from such accompaniments waverley prepared himself to meet a stern gigantic ferocious figure such as salvator would have chosen to be the central object of a group of banditti footnote see note 15  donald bean lean was the very reverse of all these he was thin in person and low in stature with light sandycoloured hair and small pale features from which he derived his agnomen of bean or white and although his form was light well proportioned and active he appeared on the whole rather a diminutive and insignificant figure he had served in some inferior capacity in the french army and in order to receive his english visitor in great form and probably meaning in his way to pay him a compliment he had laid aside the highland dress for the time to put on an old blue and red uniform and a feathered hat in which he was far from showing to advantage and indeed looked so incongruous compared with all around him that waverley would have been tempted to laugh had laughter been either civil or safe the robber received captain waverley with a profusion of french politeness and scottish hospitality seemed perfectly to know his name and connections and to be particularly acquainted with his uncles political principles on these he bestowed great applause to which waverley judged it prudent to make a very general reply  being placed at a convenient distance from the charcoal fire the heat of which the season rendered oppressive a strapping highland damsel placed before waverley evan and donald bean three cogues or wooden vessels composed of staves and hoops containing eanaruich footnote this was the regale presented by rob roy to the laird of tullibody a sort of strong soup made out of a particular part of the inside of the beeves after this refreshment which though coarse fatigue and hunger rendered palatable steaks roasted on the coals were supplied in liberal abundance and disappeared before evan dhu and their host with a promptitude that seemed like magic and astonished waverley who was much puzzled to reconcile their voracity with what he had heard of the abstemiousness of the highlanders he was ignorant that this abstinence was with the lower ranks wholly compulsory and that like some animals of prey those who practise it were usually gifted with the power of indemnifying themselves to good purpose when chance threw plenty in their way the whisky came forth in abundance to crown the cheer the highlanders drank it copiously and undiluted but edward having mixed a little with water did not find it so palatable as to invite him to repeat the draught their host bewailed himself exceedingly that he could offer him no wine had he but known fourandtwenty hours before he would have had some had it been within the circle of forty miles round him but no gentleman could do more to show his sense of the honour of a visit from another than to offer him the best cheer his house afforded where there are no bushes there can be no nuts and the way of those you live with is that you must follow  he went on regretting to evan dhu the death of an aged man donnacha an amrigh or duncan with the cap a gifted seer who foretold through the second sight visitors of every description who haunted their dwelling whether as friends or foes  is not his son malcolm taishatr a secondsighted person asked evan  nothing equal to his father replied donald bean he told us the other day we were to see a great gentleman riding on a horse and there came nobody that whole day but shemus beg the blind harper with his dog another time he advertised us of a wedding and behold it proved a funeral and on the creagh when he foretold to us we should bring home a hundred head of horned cattle we gripped nothing but a fat bailie of perth  from this discourse he passed to the political and military state of the country and waverley was astonished and even alarmed to find a person of this description so accurately acquainted with the strength of the various garrisons and regiments quartered north of the tay he even mentioned the exact number of recruits who had joined waverleys troop from his uncles estate and observed they were pretty men meaning not handsome but stout warlike fellows he put waverley in mind of one or two minute circumstances which had happened at a general review of the regiment which satisfied him that the robber had been an eyewitness of it and evan dhu having by this time retired from the conversation and wrapped himself up in his plaid to take some repose donald asked edward in a very significant manner whether he had nothing particular to say to him  waverley surprised and somewhat startled at this question from such a character answered he had no motive in visiting him but curiosity to see his extraordinary place of residence donald bean lean looked him steadily in the face for an instant and then said with a significant nod you might as well have confided in me i am as much worthy of trust as either the baron of bradwardine or vich ian vohr but you are equally welcome to my house  waverley felt an involuntary shudder creep over him at the mysterious language held by this outlawed and lawless bandit which in despite of his attempts to master it deprived him of the power to ask the meaning of his insinuations a heath pallet with the flowers stuck uppermost had been prepared for him in a recess of the cave and here covered with such spare plaids as could be mustered he lay for some time watching the motions of the other inhabitants of the cavern small parties of two or three entered or left the place without any other ceremony than a few words in gaelic to the principal outlaw and when he fell asleep to a tall highlander who acted as his lieutenant and seemed to keep watch during his repose those who entered seemed to have returned from some excursion of which they reported the success and went without farther ceremony to the larder where cutting with their dirks their rations from the carcasses which were there suspended they proceeded to broil and eat them at their own pleasure and leisure the liquor was under strict regulation being served out either by donald himself his lieutenant or the strapping highland girl aforesaid who was the only female that appeared the allowance of whisky however would have appeared prodigal to any but highlanders who living entirely in the open air and in a very moist climate can consume great quantities of ardent spirits without the usual baneful effects either upon the brain or constitution  at length the fluctuating groups began to swim before the eyes of our hero as they gradually closed nor did he reopen them till the morning sun was high on the lake without though there was but a faint and glimmering twilight in the recesses of uaimh an ri or the kings cavern as the abode of donald bean lean was proudly denominated     chapter xviii  waverley proceeds on his journey   when edward had collected his scattered recollection he was surprised to observe the cavern totally deserted having arisen and put his dress in some order he looked more accurately round him but all was still solitary if it had not been for the decayed brands of the fire now sunk into grey ashes and the remnants of the festival consisting of bones half burnt and half gnawed and an empty keg or two there remained no traces of donald and his band when waverley sallied forth to the entrance of the cave he perceived that the point of rock on which remained the marks of last nights beacon was accessible by a small path either natural or roughly hewn in the rock along the little inlet of water which ran a few yards up into the cavern where as in a wetdock the skiff which brought him there the night before was still lying moored when he reached the small projecting platform on which the beacon had been established he would have believed his further progress by land impossible only that it was scarce probable but what the inhabitants of the cavern had some mode of issuing from it otherwise than by the lake accordingly he soon observed three or four shelving steps or ledges of rock at the very extremity of the little platform and making use of them as a staircase he clambered by their means around the projecting shoulder of the crag on which the cavern opened and descending with some difficulty on the other side he gained the wild and precipitous shores of a highland loch about four miles in length and a mile and a half across surrounded by heathy and savage mountains on the crests of which the morning mist was still sleeping  looking back to the place from which he came he could not help admiring the address which had adopted a retreat of such seclusion and secrecy the rock round the shoulder of which he had turned by a few imperceptible notches that barely afforded place for the foot seemed in looking back upon it a huge precipice which barred all further passage by the shores of the lake in that direction there could be no possibility the breadth of the lake considered of descrying the entrance of the narrow and lowbrowed cave from the other side so that unless the retreat had been sought for with boats or disclosed by treachery it might be a safe and secret residence to its garrison as long as they were supplied with provisions having satisfied his curiosity in these particulars waverley looked around for evan dhu and his attendants who he rightly judged would be at no great distance whatever might have become of donald bean lean and his party whose mode of life was of course liable to sudden migrations of abode accordingly at the distance of about half a mile he beheld a highlander evan apparently angling in the lake with another attending him whom from the weapon which he shouldered he recognised for his friend with the battleaxe  much nearer to the mouth of the cave he heard the notes of a lively gaelic song guided by which in a sunny recess shaded by a glittering birchtree and carpeted with a bank of firm white sand he found the damsel of the cavern whose lay had already reached him busy to the best of her power in arranging to advantage a morning repast of milk eggs barleybread fresh butter and honeycomb the poor girl had already made a circuit of four miles that morning in search of the eggs of the meal which baked her cakes and of the other materials of the breakfast being all delicacies which she had to beg or borrow from distant cottagers the followers of donald bean lean used little food except the flesh of the animals which they drove away from the lowlands bread itself was a delicacy seldom thought of because hard to be obtained and all the domestic accommodations of milk poultry butter etc were out of the question in this scythian camp yet it must not be omitted that although alice had occupied a part of the morning in providing those accommodations for her guest which the cavern did not afford she had secured time also to arrange her own person in her best trim her finery was very simple a short russetcoloured jacket and a petticoat of scanty longitude was her whole dress but these were clean and neatly arranged a piece of scarlet embroidered cloth called the snood confined her hair which fell over it in a profusion of rich dark curls the scarlet plaid which formed part of her dress was laid aside that it might not impede her activity in attending the stranger i should forget alices proudest ornament were i to omit mentioning a pair of gold earrings and a golden rosary which her father for she was the daughter of donald bean lean had brought from france the plunder probably of some battle or storm  her form though rather large for her years was very well proportioned and her demeanour had a natural and rustic grace with nothing of the sheepishness of an ordinary peasant the smiles displaying a row of teeth of exquisite whiteness and the laughing eyes with which in dumb show she gave waverley that morning greeting which she wanted english words to express might have been interpreted by a coxcomb or perhaps by a young soldier who without being such was conscious of a handsome person as meant to convey more than the courtesy of an hostess nor do i take it upon me to say that the little wild mountaineer would have welcomed any staid old gentleman advanced in life the baron of bradwardine for example with the cheerful pains which she bestowed upon edwards accommodation she seemed eager to place him by the meal which she had so sedulously arranged and to which she now added a few bunches of cranberries gathered in an adjacent morass having had the satisfaction of seeing him seated at his breakfast she placed herself demurely upon a stone at a few yards distance and appeared to watch with great complacency for some opportunity of serving him  evan and his attendant now returned slowly along the beach the latter bearing a large salmontrout the produce of the mornings sport together with the anglingrod while evan strolled forward with an easy selfsatisfied and important gait towards the spot where waverley was so agreeably employed at the breakfasttable after morning greetings had passed on both sides and evan looking at waverley had said something in gaelic to alice which made her laugh yet colour up to her eyes through a complexion well enbrowned by sun and wind evan intimated his commands that the fish should be prepared for breakfast a spark from the lock of his pistol produced a light and a few withered fir branches were quickly in flame and as speedily reduced to hot embers on which the trout was broiled in large slices to crown the repast evan produced from the pocket of his short jerkin a large scallop shell and from under the folds of his plaid a rams horn full of whisky of this he took a copious dram observing he had already taken his morning with donald bean lean before his departure he offered the same cordial to alice and to edward which they both declined with the bounteous air of a lord evan then proffered the scallop to dugald mahony his attendant who without waiting to be asked a second time drank it off with great gusto evan then prepared to move towards the boat inviting waverley to attend him meanwhile alice had made up in a small basket what she thought worth removing and flinging her plaid around her she advanced up to edward and with the utmost simplicity taking hold of his hand offered her cheek to his salute dropping at the same time her little curtsy evan who was esteemed a wag among the mountain fair advanced as if to secure a similar favour but alice snatching up her basket escaped up the rocky bank as fleetly as a roe and turning round and laughing called something out to him in gaelic which he answered in the same tone and language then waving her hand to edward she resumed her road and was soon lost among the thickets though they continued for some time to hear her lively carol as she proceeded gaily on her solitary journey  they now again entered the gorge of the cavern and stepping into the boat the highlander pushed off and taking advantage of the morning breeze hoisted a clumsy sort of sail while evan assumed the helm directing their course as it appeared to waverley rather higher up the lake than towards the place of his embarkation on the preceding night as they glided along the silver mirror evan opened the conversation with a panegyric upon alice who he said was both canny and fendy and was to the boot of all that the best dancer of a strathspey in the whole strath edward assented to her praises so far as he understood them yet could not help regretting that she was condemned to such a perilous and dismal life  oich for that said evan there is nothing in perthshire that she need want if she ask her father to fetch it unless it be too hot or too heavy  but to be the daughter of a cattlestealera common thief common thiefno such thing donald bean lean never lifted less than a drove in his life  do you call him an uncommon thief then  no he that steals a cow from a poor widow or a stirk from a cotter is a thief he that lifts a drove from a sassenach laird is a gentlemandrover and besides to take a tree from the forest a salmon from the river a deer from the hill or a cow from a lowland strath is what no highlander need ever think shame upon  but what can this end in were he taken in such an appropriation  to be sure he would die for the law as many a pretty man has done before him  die for the law  ay that is with the law or by the law be strapped up on the kind gallows of crieff footnote see note 16 where his father died and his goodsire died and where i hope hell live to die himsell if hes not shot or slashed in a creagh  you hope such a death for your friend evan  and that do i een would you have me wish him to die on a bundle of wet straw in yon den of his like a mangy tyke  but what becomes of alice then  troth if such an accident were to happen as her father would not need her help ony langer i ken nought to hinder me to marry her mysell  gallantly resolved said edward but in the meanwhile evan what has your fatherinlaw that shall be if he have the good fortune to be hanged done with the barons cattle  oich answered evanthey were all trudging before your lad and allan kennedy before the sun blinked ower ben lawers this morning and theyll be in the pass of ballybrough by this time in their way back to the parks of tullyveolan all but two that were unhappily slaughtered before i got last night to uaimh an ri  and where are we going evan if i may be so bold as to ask said waverley  where would you be ganging but to the lairds ain house of glennaquoich ye would not think to be in his country without ganging to see him it would be as much as a mans lifes worth  and are we far from glennaquoich  but five bits of miles and vich ian vohr will meet us  in about half an hour they reached the upper end of the lake where after landing waverley the two highanders drew the boat into a little creek among thick flags and reeds where it lay perfectly concealed the oars they put in another place of concealment both for the use of donald bean lean probably when his occasions should next bring him to that place  the travellers followed for some time a delightful opening into the hills down which a little brook found its way to the lake when they had pursued their walk a short distance waverley renewed his questions about their host of the cavern  does he always reside in that cave  out no its past the skill of man to tell where hes to be found at a times theres not a dern nook or cove or corrie in the whole country that hes not acquainted with  and do others beside your master shelter him  my master my master is in heaven answered evan haughtily and then immediately assuming his usual civility of manner but you mean my chiefno he does not shelter donald bean lean nor any that are like him he only allows him with a smile wood and water  no great boon i should think evan when both seem to be very plenty  ah but ye dinna see through it when i say wood and water i mean the loch and the land and i fancy donald would be put till t if the laird were to look for him wi threescore men in the wood of kailychat yonder and if our boats with a score or twa mair were to come down the loch to uaimh an ri headed by mysell or ony other pretty man  but suppose a strong party came against him from the low country would not your chief defend him  na he would not ware the spark of a flint for himif they came with the law  and what must donald do then  he behoved to rid this country of himsell and fall back it may be over the mount upon letter scriven  and if he were pursued to that place  ise warrant he would go to his cousins at rannoch  well but if they followed him to rannoch  that quoth evan is beyond all belief and indeed to tell you the truth there durst not a lowlander in all scotland follow the fray a gunshot beyond ballybrough unless he had the help of the sidier dhu  whom do you call so  the sidier dhu the black soldier that is what they call the independent companies that were raised to keep peace and law in the highlands vich ian vohr commanded one of them for five years and i was sergeant mysell i shall warrant ye they call them sidier dhu because they wear the tartans as they call your menking georges mensidier roy or red soldiers  well but when you were in king georges pay evan you were surely king georges soldiers  troth and you must ask vich ian vohr about that for we are for his king and care not much which o them it is at ony rate nobody can say we are king georges men now when we have not seen his pay this twelvemonth  this last argument admitted of no reply nor did edward attempt any he rather chose to bring back the discourse to donald bean lean does donald confine himself to cattle or does he lift as you call it anything else that comes in his way  troth hes nae nice body and hell just tak onything but most readily cattle horse or live christians for sheep are slow of travel and inside plenishing is cumbrous to carry and not easy to put away for siller in this country  but does he carry off men and women  out ay did not ye hear him speak o the perth bailie it cost that body five hundred merks ere he got to the south of ballybrough and ance donald played a pretty sport footnote see note 17 there was to be a blythe bridal between the lady cramfeezer in the howe o the mearns she was the auld lairds widow and no sae young as she had been hersell and young gilliewhackit who had spent his heirship and movables like a gentleman at cockmatches bullbaitings horseraces and the like now donald bean lean being aware that the bridegroom was in request and wanting to cleik the cunzie that is to hook the siller he cannily carried off gilliewhackit ae night when he was riding dovering hame wi the malt rather abune the meal and with the help of his gillies he gat him into the hills with the speed of light and the first place he wakened in was the cove of uaimh an ri so there was old to do about ransoming the bridegroom for donald would not lower a farthing of a thousand punds  the devil  punds scottish ye shall understand and the lady had not the siller if she had pawned her gown and they applied to the governor o stirling castle and to the major o the black watch and the governor said it was ower far to the northward and out of his district and the major said his men were gane hame to the shearing and he would not call them out before the victual was got in for all the cramfeezers in christendom let alane the mearns for that it would prejudice the country and in the meanwhile yell no hinder gilliewhackit to take the smallpox there was not the doctor in perth or stirling would look near the poor lad and i cannot blame them for donald had been misguggled by ane of these doctors about paris and he swore he would fling the first into the loch that he catched beyond the pass however some cailliachs that is old women that were about donalds hand nursed gilliewhackit sae weel that between the free open air in the cove and the fresh whey deil an he did not recover maybe as weel as if he had been closed in a glazed chamber and a bed with curtains and fed with red wine and white meat and donald was sae vexed about it that when he was stout and weel he even sent him free home and said he would be pleased with onything they would like to gie him for the plague and trouble which he had about gilliewhackit to an unkennd degree and i cannot tell you precisely how they sorted but they agreed sae right that donald was invited to dance at the wedding in his highland trews and they said that there was never sae meikle siller clinked in his purse either before or since and to the boot of all that gilliewhackit said that be the evidence what it liked if he had the luck to be on donalds inquest he would bring him in guilty of nothing whatever unless it were wilful arson or murder under trust  with such bald and disjointed chat evan went on illustrating the existing state of the highlands more perhaps to the amusement of waverley than that of our readers at length after having marched over bank and brae moss and heather edward though not unacquainted with the scottish liberality in computing distance began to think that evans five miles were nearly doubled his observation on the large measure which the scottish allowed of their land in comparison to the computation of their money was readily answered by evan with the old jest the deil take them wha have the least pint stoup  footnote the scotch are liberal in computing their land and liquor the scottish pint corresponds to two english quarts as for their coin every one knows the couplet           how can the rogues pretend to sense          their pound is only twenty pence  and now the report of a gun was heard and a sportsman was seen with his dogs and attendant at the upper end of the glen shough said dugald mahony tats ta chief  it is not said evan imperiously do you think he would come to meet a sassenach duinhewassel in such a way as that  but as they approached a little nearer he said with an appearance of mortification and it is even he sure enough and he has not his tail on after all there is no living creature with him but callum beg  in fact fergus macivor of whom a frenchman might have said as truly as of any man in the highlands quil connoit bien ses gens had no idea of raising himself in the eyes of an english young man of fortune by appearing with a retinue of idle highlanders disproportioned to the occasion he was well aware that such an unnecessary attendance would seem to edward rather ludicrous than respectable and while few men were more attached to ideas of chieftainship and feudal power he was for that very reason cautious of exhibiting external marks of dignity unless at the time and in the manner when they were most likely to produce an imposing effect therefore although had he been to receive a brother chieftain he would probably have been attended by all that retinue which evan described with so much unction he judged it more respectable to advance to meet waverley with a single attendant a very handsome highland boy who carried his masters shootingpouch and his broadsword without which he seldom went abroad  when fergus and waverley met the latter was struck with the peculiar grace and dignity of the chieftains figure above the middle size and finely proportioned the highland dress which he wore in its simplest mode set off his person to great advantage he wore the trews or close trowsers made of tartan chequed scarlet and white in other particulars his dress strictly resembled evans excepting that he had no weapon save a dirk very richly mounted with silver his page as we have said carried his claymore and the fowlingpiece which he held in his hand seemed only designed for sport he had shot in the course of his walk some young wildducks as though close time was then unknown the broods of grouse were yet too young for the sportsman his countenance was decidedly scottish with all the peculiarities of the northern physiognomy but yet had so little of its harshness and exaggeration that it would have been pronounced in any country extremely handsome the martial air of the bonnet with a single eagles feather as a distinction added much to the manly appearance of his head which was besides ornamented with a far more natural and graceful cluster of close black curls than ever were exposed to sale in bond street  an air of openness and affability increased the favorable impression derived from this handsome and dignified exterior yet a skilful physiognomist would have been less satisfied with the countenance on the second than on the first view the eyebrow and upper lip bespoke something of the habit of peremptory command and decisive superiority even his courtesy though open frank and unconstrained seemed to indicate a sense of personal importance and upon any check or accidental excitation a sudden though transient lour of the eye showed a hasty haughty and vindictive temper not less to be dreaded because it seemed much under its owners command in short the countenance of the chieftain resembled a smiling summers day in which notwithstanding we are made sensible by certain though slight signs that it may thunder and lighten before the close of evening  it was not however upon their first meeting that edward had an opportunity of making these less favourable remarks the chief received him as a friend of the baron of bradwardine with the utmost expression of kindness and obligation for the visit upbraided him gently with choosing so rude an abode as he had done the night before and entered into a lively conversation with him about donald beans housekeeping but without the least hint as to his predatory habits or the immediate occasion of waverleys visit a topic which as the chief did not introduce it our hero also avoided while they walked merrily on towards the house of glennaquoich evan who now fell respectfully into the rear followed with callum beg and dugald mahony  we shall take the opportunity to introduce the reader to some particulars of fergus macivors character and history which were not completely known to waverley till after a connection which though arising from a circumstance so casual had for a length of time the deepest influence upon his character actions and prospects but this being an important subject must form the commencement of a new chapter     chapter xix  the chief and his mansion   the ingenious licentiate francisco de ubeda when he commenced his history of la picara justina diezwhich by the way is one of the most rare books of spanish literaturecomplained of his pen having caught up a hair and forthwith begins with more eloquence than common sense an affectionate expostulation with that useful implement upbraiding it with being the quill of a goosea bird inconstant by nature as frequenting the three elements of water earth and air indifferently and being of course to one thing constant never now i protest to thee gentle reader that i entirely dissent from francisco de ubeda in this matter and hold it the most useful quality of my pen that it can speedily change from grave to gay and from description and dialogue to narrative and character so that if my quill display no other properties of its mothergoose than her mutability truly i shall be well pleased and i conceive that you my worthy friend will have no occasion for discontent from the jargon therefore of the highland gillies i pass to the character of their chief it is an important examination and therefore like dogberry we must spare no wisdom  the ancestor of fergus macivor about three centuries before had set up a claim to be recognised as chief of the numerous and powerful clan to which he belonged the name of which it is unnecessary to mention being defeated by an opponent who had more justice or at least more force on his side he moved southwards with those who adhered to him in quest of new settlements like a second aeneas the state of the perthshire highlands favoured his purpose a great baron in that country had lately become traitor to the crown ian which was the name of our adventurer united himself with those who were commissioned by the king to chastise him and did such good service that he obtained a grant of the property upon which he and his posterity afterwards resided he followed the king also in war to the fertile regions of england where he employed his leisure hours so actively in raising subsidies among the boors of northumberland and durham that upon his return he was enabled to erect a stone tower or fortalice so much admired by his dependants and neighbours that he who had hitherto been called ian macivor or john the son of ivor was thereafter distinguished both in song and genealogy by the high title of ian nan chaistel or john of the tower the descendants of this worthy were so proud of him that the reigning chief always bore the patronymic title of vich ian vohr ie the son of john the great while the clan at large to distinguish them from that from which they had seceded were denominated sliochd nan ivor the race of ivor  the father of fergus the tenth in direct descent from john of the tower engaged heart and hand in the insurrection of 1715 and was forced to fly to france after the attempt of that year in favour of the stuarts had proved unsuccessful more fortunate than other fugitives he obtained employment in the french service and married a lady of rank in that kingdom by whom he had two children fergus and his sister flora the scottish estate had been forfeited and exposed to sale but was repurchased for a small price in the name of the young proprietor who in consequence came to reside upon his native domains footnote see note 18 it was soon perceived that he possessed a character of uncommon acuteness fire and ambition which as he became acquainted with the state of the country gradually assumed a mixed and peculiar tone that could only have been acquired sixty years since  had fergus macivor lived sixty years sooner than he did he would in all probability have wanted the polished manner and knowledge of the world which he now possessed and had he lived sixty years later his ambition and love of rule would have lacked the fuel which his situation now afforded he was indeed within his little circle as perfect a politician as castruccio castracani himself he applied himself with great earnestness to appease all the feuds and dissensions which often arose among other clans in his neighbourhood so that he became a frequent umpire in their quarrels his own patriarchal power he strengthened at every expense which his fortune would permit and indeed stretched his means to the uttermost to maintain the rude and plentiful hospitality which was the most valued attribute of a chieftain for the same reason he crowded his estate with a tenantry hardy indeed and fit for the purposes of war but greatly outnumbering what the soil was calculated to maintain these consisted chiefly of his own clan not one of whom he suffered to quit his lands if he could possibly prevent it but he maintained besides many adventurers from the mother sept who deserted a less warlike though more wealthy chief to do homage to fergus macivor other individuals too who had not even that apology were nevertheless received into his allegiance which indeed was refused to none who were like poins proper men of their hands and were willing to assume the name of macivor  he was enabled to discipline these forces from having obtained command of one of the independent companies raised by government to preserve the peace of the highlands while in this capacity he acted with vigour and spirit and preserved great order in the country under his charge he caused his vassals to enter by rotation into his company and serve for a certain space of time which gave them all in turn a general notion of military discipline in his campaigns against the banditti it was observed that he assumed and exercised to the utmost the discretionary power which while the law had no free course in the highlands was conceived to belong to the military parties who were called in to support it he acted for example with great and suspicious lenity to those freebooters who made restitution on his summons and offered personal submission to himself while he rigorously pursued apprehended and sacrificed to justice all such interlopers as dared to despise his admonitions or commands on the other hand if any officers of justice military parties or others presumed to pursue thieves or marauders through his territories and without applying for his consent and concurrence nothing was more certain than that they would meet with some notable foil or defeat upon which occasions fergus macivor was the first to condole with them and after gently blaming their rashness never failed deeply to lament the lawless state of the country these lamentations did not exclude suspicion and matters were so represented to government that our chieftain was deprived of his military command footnote see note 19  whatever fergus macivor felt on this occasion he had the art of entirely suppressing every appearance of discontent but in a short time the neighbouring country began to feel bad effects from his disgrace donald bean lean and others of his class whose depredations had hitherto been confined to other districts appeared from thenceforward to have made a settlement on this devoted border and their ravages were carried on with little opposition as the lowland gentry were chiefly jacobites and disarmed this forced many of the inhabitants into contracts of blackmail with fergus macivor which not only established him their protector and gave him great weight in all their consultations but moreover supplied funds for the waste of his feudal hospitality which the discontinuance of his pay might have otherwise essentially diminished  in following this course of conduct fergus had a further object than merely being the great man of his neighbourhood and ruling despotically over a small clan from his infancy upward he had devoted himself to the cause of the exiled family and had persuaded himself not only that their restoration to the crown of britain would be speedy but that those who assisted them would be raised to honour and rank it was with this view that he laboured to reconcile the highlanders among themselves and augmented his own force to the utmost to be prepared for the first favourable opportunity of rising with this purpose also he conciliated the favour of such lowland gentlemen in the vicinity as were friends to the good cause and for the same reason having incautiously quarrelled with mr bradwardine who notwithstanding his peculiarities was much respected in the country he took advantage of the foray of donald bean lean to solder up the dispute in the manner we have mentioned some indeed surmised that he caused the enterprise to be suggested to donald on purpose to pave the way to a reconciliation which supposing that to be the case cost the laird of bradwardine two good milch cows this zeal in their behalf the house of stuart repaid with a considerable share of their confidence an occasional supply of louisdor abundance of fair words and a parchment with a huge waxen seal appended purporting to be an earls patent granted by no less a person than james the third king of england and eighth king of scotland to his right feal trusty and wellbeloved fergus macivor of glennaquoich in the county of perth and kingdom of scotland  with this future coronet glittering before his eyes fergus plunged deeply into the correspondence and plots of that unhappy period and like all such active agents easily reconciled his conscience to going certain lengths in the service of his party from which honour and pride would have deterred him had his sole object been the direct advancement of his own personal interest with this insight into a bold ambitious and ardent yet artful and politic character we resume the broken thread of our narrative  the chief and his guest had by this time reached the house of glennaquoich which consisted of ian nan chaistels mansion a high rudelooking square tower with the addition of a lofted house that is a building of two stories constructed by ferguss grandfather when he returned from that memorable expedition well remembered by the western shires under the name of the highland host upon occasion of this crusade against the ayrshire whigs and covenanters the vich ian vohr of the time had probably been as successful as his predecessor was in harrying northumberland and therefore left to his posterity a rival edifice as a monument of his magnificence  around the house which stood on an eminence in the midst of a narrow highland valley there appeared none of that attention to convenience far less to ornament and decoration which usually surrounds a gentlemans habitation an inclosure or two divided by drystone walls were the only part of the domain that was fenced as to the rest the narrow slips of level ground which lay by the side of the brook exhibited a scanty crop of barley liable to constant depredations from the herds of wild ponies and black cattle that grazed upon the adjacent hills these ever and anon made an incursion upon the arable ground which was repelled by the loud uncouth and dissonant shouts of half a dozen highland swains all running as if they had been mad and every one hallooing a halfstarved dog to the rescue of the forage at a little distance up the glen was a small and stunted wood of birch the hills were high and heathy but without any variety of surface so that the whole view was wild and desolate rather than grand and solitary yet such as it was no genuine descendant of ian nan chaistel would have changed the domain for stow or blenheim  there was a sight however before the gate which perhaps would have afforded the first owner of blenheim more pleasure than the finest view in the domain assigned to him by the gratitude of his country this consisted of about a hundred highlanders in complete dress and arms at sight of whom the chieftain apologised to waverley in a sort of negligent manner he had forgot he said that he had ordered a few of his clan out for the purpose of seeing that they were in a fit condition to protect the country and prevent such accidents as he was sorry to learn had befallen the baron of bradwardine before they were dismissed perhaps captain waverley might choose to see them go through a part of their exercise  edward assented and the men executed with agility and precision some of the ordinary military movements they then practised individually at a mark and showed extraordinary dexterity in the management of the pistol and firelock they took aim standing sitting leaning or lying prostrate as they were commanded and always with effect upon the target next they paired off for the broadsword exercise and having manifested their individual skill and dexterity united in two bodies and exhibited a sort of mock encounter in which the charge the rally the flight the pursuit and all the current of a heady fight were exhibited to the sound of the great war bagpipe  on a signal made by the chief the skirmish was ended matches were then made for running wrestling leaping pitching the bar and other sports in which this feudal militia displayed incredible swiftness strength and agility and accomplished the purpose which their chieftain had at heart by impressing on waverley no light sense of their merit as soldiers and of the power of him who commanded them by his nod footnote see note 20  and what number of such gallant fellows have the happiness to call you leader asked waverley  in a good cause and under a chieftain whom they loved the race of ivor have seldom taken the field under five hundred claymores but you are aware captain waverley that the disarming act passed about twenty years ago prevents their being in the complete state of preparation as in former times and i keep no more of my clan under arms than may defend my own or my friends property when the country is troubled with such men as your last nights landlord and government which has removed other means of defence must connive at our protecting ourselves  but with your force you might soon destroy or put down such gangs as that of donald bean lean  yes doubtless and my reward would be a summons to deliver up to general blakeney at stirling the few broadswords they have left us there were little policy in that methinks but come captain the sound of the pipes informs me that dinner is prepared let me have the honour to show you into my rude mansion     chapter xx  a highland feast   ere waverley entered the banqueting hall he was offered the patriarchal refreshment of a bath for the feet which the sultry weather and the morasses he had traversed rendered highly acceptable he was not indeed so luxuriously attended upon this occasion as the heroic travellers in the odyssey the task of ablution and abstersion being performed not by a beautiful damsel trained  to chafe the limb and pour the fragrant oil  but by a smokedried skinny old highland woman who did not seem to think herself much honoured by the duty imposed upon her but muttered between her teeth our fathers herds did not feed so near together that i should do you this service a small donation however amply reconciled this ancient handmaiden to the supposed degradation and as edward proceeded to the hall she gave him her blessing in the gaelic proverb may the open hand be filled the fullest  the hall in which the feast was prepared occupied all the first story of lan nan chaistels original erection and a huge oaken table extended through its whole length the apparatus for dinner was simple even to rudeness and the company numerous even to crowding at the head of the table was the chief himself with edward and two or three highland visitors of neighbouring clans the elders of his own tribe wadsetters and tacksmen as they were called who occupied portions of his estate as mortgagers or lessees sat next in rank beneath them their sons and nephews and fosterbrethren then the officers of the chiefs household according to their order and lowest of all the tenants who actually cultivated the ground even beyond this long perspective edward might see upon the green to which a huge pair of folding doors opened a multitude of highlanders of a yet inferior description who nevertheless were considered as guests and had their share both of the countenance of the entertainer and of the cheer of the day in the distance and fluctuating round this extreme verge of the banquet was a changeful group of women ragged boys and girls beggars young and old large greyhounds and terriers and pointers and curs of low degree all of whom took some interest more or less immediate in the main action of the piece  this hospitality apparently unbounded had yet its line of economy some pains had been bestowed in dressing the dishes of fish game etc which were at the upper end of the table and immediately under the eye of the english stranger lower down stood immense clumsy joints of mutton and beef which but for the absence of pork footnote see note 21 abhorred in the highlands resembled the rude festivity of the banquet of penelopes suitors but the central dish was a yearling lamb called a hog in harst roasted whole it was set upon its legs with a bunch of parsley in its mouth and was probably exhibited in that form to gratify the pride of the cook who piqued himself more on the plenty than the elegance of his masters table the sides of this poor animal were fiercely attacked by the clansmen some with dirks others with the knives which were usually in the same sheath with the dagger so that it was soon rendered a mangled and rueful spectacle lower down still the victuals seemed of yet coarser quality though sufficiently abundant broth onions cheese and the fragments of the feast regaled the sons of ivor who feasted in the open air  the liquor was supplied in the same proportion and under similar regulations excellent claret and champagne were liberally distributed among the chiefs immediate neighbours whisky plain or diluted and strong beer refreshed those who sat near the lower end nor did this inequality of distribution appear to give the least offence every one present understood that his taste was to be formed according to the rank which he held at table and consequently the tacksmen and their dependants always professed the wine was too cold for their stomachs and called apparently out of choice for the liquor which was assigned to them from economy footnote see note 22 the bagpipers three in number screamed during the whole time of dinner a tremendous wartune and the echoing of the vaulted roof and clang of the celtic tongue produced such a babel of noises that waverley dreaded his ears would never recover it macivor indeed apologised for the confusion occasioned by so large a party and pleaded the necessity of his situation on which unlimited hospitality was imposed as a paramount duty these stout idle kinsmen of mine he said account my estate as held in trust for their support and i must find them beef and ale while the rogues will do nothing for themselves but practise the broadsword or wander about the hills shooting fishing hunting drinking and making love to the lasses of the strath but what can i do captain waverley everything will keep after its kind whether it be a hawk or a highlander edward made the expected answer in a compliment upon his possessing so many bold and attached followers  why yes replied the chief were i disposed like my father to put myself in the way of getting one blow on the head or two on the neck i believe the loons would stand by me but who thinks of that in the present day when the maxim is better an old woman with a purse in her hand than three men with belted brands then turning to the company he proposed the health of captain waverley a worthy friend of his kind neighbour and ally the baron of bradwardine  he is welcome hither said one of the elders if he come from cosmo comyne bradwardine  i say nay to that said an old man who apparently did not mean to pledge the toast i say nay to that while there is a green leaf in the forest there will be fraud in a comyne  there is nothing but honour in the baron of bradwardine answered another ancient and the guest that comes hither from him should be welcome though he came with blood on his hand unless it were blood of the race of ivor  the old man whose cup remained full replied there has been blood enough of the race of ivor on the hand of bradwardine  ah ballenkeiroch replied the first you think rather of the flash of the carbine at the mains of tullyveolan than the glance of the sword that fought for the cause at preston  and well i may answered ballenkeiroch the flash of the gun cost me a fairhaired son and the glance of the sword has done but little for king james  the chieftain in two words of french explained to waverley that the baron had shot this old mans son in a fray near tullyveolan about seven years before and then hastened to remove ballenkeirochs prejudice by informing him that waverley was an englishman unconnected by birth or alliance with the family of bradwardine upon which the old gentleman raised the hithertountasted cup and courteously drank to his health this ceremony being requited in kind the chieftain made a signal for the pipes to cease and said aloud where is the song hidden my friends that macmurrough cannot find it  macmurrough the family bhairdh an aged man immediately took the hint and began to chant with low and rapid utterance a profusion of celtic verses which were received by the audience with all the applause of enthusiasm as he advanced in his declamation his ardour seemed to increase he had at first spoken with his eyes fixed on the ground he now cast them around as if beseeching and anon as if commanding attention and his tones rose into wild and impassioned notes accompanied with appropriate gestures he seemed to edward who attended to him with much interest to recite many proper names to lament the dead to apostrophise the absent to exhort and entreat and animate those who were present waverley thought he even discerned his own name and was convinced his conjecture was right from the eyes of the company being at that moment turned towards him simultaneously the ardour of the poet appeared to communicate itself to the audience their wild and sunburnt countenances assumed a fiercer and more animated expression all bent forward towards the reciter many sprung up and waved their arms in ecstasy and some laid their hands on their swords when the song ceased there was a deep pause while the aroused feelings of the poet and of the hearers gradually subsided into their usual channel  the chieftain who during this scene had appeared rather to watch the emotions which were excited than to partake their high tone of enthusiasm filled with claret a small silver cup which stood by him give this he said to an attendant to macmurrough nan fonn ie of the songs and when he has drank the juice bid him keep for the sake of vich ian vohr the shell of the gourd which contained it the gift was received by macmurrough with profound gratitude he drank the wine and kissing the cup shrouded it with reverence in the plaid which was folded on his bosom he then burst forth into what edward justly supposed to be an extemporaneous effusion of thanks and praises of his chief it was received with applause but did not produce the effect of his first poem it was obvious however that the clan regarded the generosity of their chieftain with high approbation many approved gaelic toasts were then proposed of some of which the chieftain gave his guest the following versions  to him that will not turn his back on friend or foe to him that never forsook a comrade to him that never bought or sold justice hospitality to the exile and broken bones to the tyrant the lads with the kilts highlanders shoulder to shoulderwith many other pithy sentiments of the like nature  edward was particularly solicitous to know the meaning of that song which appeared to produce such effect upon the passions of the company and hinted his curiosity to his host as i observe said the chieftain that you have passed the bottle during the last three rounds i was about to propose to you to retire to my sisters teatable who can explain these things to you better than i can although i cannot stint my clan in the usual current of their festivity yet i neither am addicted myself to exceed in its amount nor do i added he smiling keep a bear to devour the intellects of such as can make good use of them  edward readily assented to this proposal and the chieftain saying a few words to those around him left the table followed by waverley as the door closed behind them edward heard vich ian vohrs health invoked with a wild and animated cheer that expressed the satisfaction of the guests and the depth of their devotion to his service     chapter xxi  the chieftains sister   the drawingroom of flora macivor was furnished in the plainest and most simple manner for at glennaquoich every other sort of expenditure was retrenched as much as possible for the purpose of maintaining in its full dignity the hospitality of the chieftain and retaining and multiplying the number of his dependants and adherents but there was no appearance of this parsimony in the dress of the lady herself which was in texture elegant and even rich and arranged in a manner which partook partly of the parisian fashion and partly of the more simple dress of the highlands blended together with great taste her hair was not disfigured by the art of the friseur but fell in jetty ringlets on her neck confined only by a circlet richly set with diamonds this peculiarity she adopted in compliance with the highland prejudices which could not endure that a womans head should be covered before wedlock  flora macivor bore a most striking resemblance to her brother fergus so much so that they might have played viola and sebastian with the same exquisite effect produced by the appearance of mrs henry siddons and her brother mr william murray in these characters they had the same antique and regular correctness of profile the same dark eyes eyelashes and eyebrows the same clearness of complexion excepting that ferguss was embrowned by exercise and floras possessed the utmost feminine delicacy but the haughty and somewhat stern regularity of ferguss features was beautifully softened in those of flora their voices were also similar in tone though differing in the key that of fergus especially while issuing orders to his followers during their military exercise reminded edward of a favourite passage in the description of emetrius    whose voice was heard around     loud as a trumpet with a silver sound that of flora on the contrary was soft and sweetan excellent thing in woman yet in urging any favourite topic which she often pursued with natural eloquence it possessed as well the tones which impress awe and conviction as those of persuasive insinuation the eager glance of the keen black eye which in the chieftain seemed impatient even of the material obstacles it encountered had in his sister acquired a gentle pensiveness his looks seemed to seek glory power all that could exalt him above others in the race of humanity while those of his sister as if she were already conscious of mental superiority seemed to pity rather than envy those who were struggling for any farther distinction her sentiments corresponded with the expression of her countenance early education had impressed upon her mind as well as on that of the chieftain the most devoted attachment to the exiled family of stuart she believed it the duty of her brother of his clan of every man in britain at whatever personal hazard to contribute to that restoration which the partisans of the chevalier st george had not ceased to hope for for this she was prepared to do all to suffer all to sacrifice all but her loyalty as it exceeded her brothers in fanaticism excelled it also in purity accustomed to petty intrigue and necessarily involved in a thousand paltry and selfish discussions ambitious also by nature his political faith was tinctured at least if not tainted by the views of interest and advancement so easily combined with it and at the moment he should unsheathe his claymore it might be difficult to say whether it would be most with the view of making james stuart a king or fergus macivor an earl this indeed was a mixture of feeling which he did not avow even to himself but it existed nevertheless in a powerful degree  in floras bosom on the contrary the zeal of loyalty burnt pure and unmixed with any selfish feeling she would have as soon made religion the mask of ambitious and interested views as have shrouded them under the opinions which she had been taught to think patriotism such instances of devotion were not uncommon among the followers of the unhappy race of stuart of which many memorable proofs will recur to the minds of most of my readers but peculiar attention on the part of the chevalier de st george and his princess to the parents of fergus and his sister and to themselves when orphans had riveted their faith fergus upon the death of his parents had been for some time a page of honour in the train of the chevaliers lady and from his beauty and sprightly temper was uniformly treated by her with the utmost distinction this was also extended to flora who was maintained for some time at a convent of the first order at the princesss expense and removed from thence into her own family where she spent nearly two years both brother and sister retained the deepest and most grateful sense of her kindness  having thus touched upon the leading principle of floras character i may dismiss the rest more slightly she was highly accomplished and had acquired those elegant manners to be expected from one who in early youth had been the companion of a princess yet she had not learned to substitute the gloss of politeness for the reality of feeling when settled in the lonely regions of glennaquoich she found that her resources in french english and italian literature were likely to be few and interrupted and in order to fill up the vacant time she bestowed a part of it upon the music and poetical traditions of the highlanders and began really to feel the pleasure in the pursuit which her brother whose perceptions of literary merit were more blunt rather affected for the sake of popularity than actually experienced her resolution was strengthened in these researches by the extreme delight which her inquiries seemed to afford those to whom she resorted for information  her love of her clan an attachment which was almost hereditary in her bosom was like her loyalty a more pure passion than that of her brother he was too thorough a politician regarded his patriarchal influence too much as the means of accomplishing his own aggrandisement that we should term him the model of a highland chieftain flora felt the same anxiety for cherishing and extending their patriarchal sway but it was with the generous desire of vindicating from poverty or at least from want and foreign oppression those whom her brother was by birth according to the notions of the time and country entitled to govern the savings of her income for she had a small pension from the princess sobieski were dedicated not to add to the comforts of the peasantry for that was a word which they neither knew nor apparently wished to know but to relieve their absolute necessities when in sickness or extreme old age at every other period they rather toiled to procure something which they might share with the chief as a proof of their attachment than expected other assistance from him save what was afforded by the rude hospitality of his castle and the general division and subdivision of his estate among them flora was so much beloved by them that when macmurrough composed a song in which he enumerated all the principal beauties of the district and intimated her superiority by concluding that the fairest apple hung on the highest bough he received in donatives from the individuals of the clan more seedbarley than would have sowed his highland parnassus the bards croft as it was called ten times over  from situation as well as choice miss macivors society was extremely limited her most intimate friend had been rose bradwardine to whom she was much attached and when seen together they would have afforded an artist two admirable subjects for the gay and the melancholy muse indeed rose was so tenderly watched by her father and her circle of wishes was so limited that none arose but what he was willing to gratify and scarce any which did not come within the compass of his power with flora it was otherwise while almost a girl she had undergone the most complete change of scene from gaiety and splendour to absolute solitude and comparative poverty and the ideas and wishes which she chiefly fostered respected great national events and changes not to be brought round without both hazard and bloodshed and therefore not to be thought of with levity her manner consequently was grave though she readily contributed her talents to the amusement of society and stood very high in the opinion of the old baron who used to sing along with her such french duets of lindor and cloris etc as were in fashion about the end of the reign of old louis le grand  it was generally believed though no one durst have hinted it to the baron of bradwardine that floras entreaties had no small share in allaying the wrath of fergus upon occasion of their quarrel she took her brother on the assailable side by dwelling first upon the barons age and then representing the injury which the cause might sustain and the damage which must arise to his own character in point of prudenceso necessary to a political agent if he persisted in carrying it to extremity otherwise it is probable it would have terminated in a duel both because the baron had on a former occasion shed blood of the clan though the matter had been timely accommodated and on account of his high reputation for address at his weapon which fergus almost condescended to envy for the same reason she had urged their reconciliation which the chieftain the more readily agreed to as it favoured some ulterior projects of his own  to this young lady now presiding at the female empire of the teatable fergus introduced captain waverley whom she received with the usual forms of politeness     chapter xxii  highland minstrelsy   when the first salutations had passed fergus said to his sister my dear flora before i return to the barbarous ritual of our forefathers i must tell you that captain waverley is a worshipper of the celtic muse not the less so perhaps that he does not understand a word of her language i have told him you are eminent as a translator of highland poetry and that macmurrough admires your version of his songs upon the same principle that captain waverley admires the originalbecause he does not comprehend them will you have the goodness to read or recite to our guest in english the extraordinary string of names which macmurrough has tacked together in gaelic my life to a moorfowls feather you are provided with a version for i know you are in all the bards councils and acquainted with his songs long before he rehearses them in the hall  how can you say so fergus you know how little these verses can possibly interest an english stranger even if i could translate them as you pretend  not less than they interest me lady fair today your joint composition for i insist you had a share in it has cost me the last silver cup in the castle and i suppose will cost me something else next time i hold cour pleniere if the muse descends on macmurrough for you know our proverbwhen the hand of the chief ceases to bestow the breath of the bard is frozen in the utterancewell i would it were even so there are three things that are useless to a modern highlandera sword which he must not draw a bard to sing of deeds which he dare not imitate and a large goatskin purse without a louisdor to put into it  well brother since you betray my secrets you cannot expect me to keep yours i assure you captain waverley that fergus is too proud to exchange his broadsword for a marechals baton that he esteems macmurrough a far greater poet than homer and would not give up his goatskin purse for all the louisdor which it could contain  well pronounced flora blow for blow as conan footnote see note 23 said to the devil now do you two talk of bards and poetry if not of purses and claymores while i return to do the final honours to the senators of the tribe of ivor so saying he left the room  the conversation continued between flora and waverley for two welldressed young women whose character seemed to hover between that of companions and dependants took no share in it they were both pretty girls but served only as foils to the grace and beauty of their patroness the discourse followed the turn which the chieftain had given it and waverley was equally amused and surprised with the account which the lady gave him of celtic poetry  the recitation she said of poems recording the feats of heroes the complaints of lovers and the wars of contending tribes forms the chief amusement of a winter fireside in the highlands some of these are said to be very ancient and if they are ever translated into any of the languages of civilised europe cannot fail to produce a deep and general sensation others are more modern the composition of those family bards whom the chieftains of more distinguished name and power retain as the poets and historians of their tribes these of course possess various degrees of merit but much of it must evaporate in translation or be lost on those who do not sympathise with the feelings of the poet  and your bard whose effusions seemed to produce such effect upon the company today is he reckoned among the favourite poets of the mountains  that is a trying question his reputation is high among his countrymen and you must not expect me to depreciate it footnote the highland poet almost always was an improvisatore captain burt met one of them at lovats table  but the song miss macivor seemed to awaken all those warriors both young and old  the song is little more than a catalogue of names of the highland clans under their distinctive peculiarities and an exhortation to them to remember and to emulate the actions of their forefathers  and am i wrong in conjecturing however extraordinary the guess appears that there was some allusion to me in the verses which he recited  you have a quick observation captain waverley which in this instance has not deceived you the gaelic language being uncommonly vocalic is well adapted for sudden and extemporaneous poetry and a bard seldom fails to augment the effects of a premeditated song by throwing in any stanzas which may be suggested by the circumstances attending the recitation  i would give my best horse to know what the highland bard could find to say of such an unworthy southron as myself  it shall not even cost you a lock of his mane una mavourneen she spoke a few words to one of the young girls in attendance who instantly curtsied and tripped out of the room i have sent una to learn from the bard the expressions he used and you shall command my skill as dragoman  una returned in a few minutes and repeated to her mistress a few lines in gaelic flora seemed to think for a moment and then slightly colouring she turned to waverleyit is impossible to gratify your curiosity captain waverley without exposing my own presumption if you will give me a few moments for consideration i will endeavour to engraft the meaning of these lines upon a rude english translation which i have attempted of a part of the original the duties of the teatable seem to be concluded and as the evening is delightful una will show you the way to one of my favourite haunts and cathleen and i will join you there  una having received instructions in her native language conducted waverley out by a passage different from that through which he had entered the apartment at a distance he heard the hall of the chief still resounding with the clang of bagpipes and the high applause of his guests having gained the open air by a postern door they walked a little way up the wild bleak and narrow valley in which the house was situated following the course of the stream that winded through it in a spot about a quarter of a mile from the castle two brooks which formed the little river had their junction the larger of the two came down the long bare valley which extended apparently without any change or elevation of character as far as the hills which formed its boundary permitted the eye to reach but the other stream which had its source among the mountains on the left hand of the strath seemed to issue from a very narrow and dark opening betwixt two large rocks these streams were different also in character the larger was placid and even sullen in its course wheeling in deep eddies or sleeping in dark blue pools but the motions of the lesser brook were rapid and furious issuing from between precipices like a maniac from his confinement all foam and uproar  it was up the course of this last stream that waverley like a knight of romance was conducted by the fair highland damsel his silent guide a small path which had been rendered easy in many places for floras accommodation led him through scenery of a very different description from that which he had just quitted around the castle all was cold bare and desolate yet tame even in desolation but this narrow glen at so short a distance seemed to open into the land of romance the rocks assumed a thousand peculiar and varied forms in one place a crag of huge size presented its gigantic bulk as if to forbid the passengers farther progress and it was not until he approached its very base that waverley discerned the sudden and acute turn by which the pathway wheeled its course around this formidable obstacle in another spot the projecting rocks from the opposite sides of the chasm had approached so near to each other that two pinetrees laid across and covered with turf formed a rustic bridge at the height of at least one hundred and fifty feet it had no ledges and was barely three feet in breadth  while gazing at this pass of peril which crossed like a single black line the small portion of blue sky not intercepted by the projecting rocks on either side it was with a sensation of horror that waverley beheld flora and her attendant appear like inhabitants of another region propped as it were in mid air upon this trembling structure she stopped upon observing him below and with an air of graceful ease which made him shudder waved her handkerchief to him by way of signal he was unable from the sense of dizziness which her situation conveyed to return the salute and was never more relieved than when the fair apparition passed on from the precarious eminence which she seemed to occupy with so much indifference and disappeared on the other side  advancing a few yards and passing under the bridge which he had viewed with so much terror the path ascended rapidly from the edge of the brook and the glen widened into a sylvan amphitheatre waving with birch young oaks and hazels with here and there a scattered yewtree the rocks now receded but still showed their grey and shaggy crests rising among the copsewood still higher rose eminences and peaks some bare some clothed with wood some round and purple with heath and others splintered into rocks and crags at a short turning the path which had for some furlongs lost sight of the brook suddenly placed waverley in front of a romantic waterfall it was not so remarkable either for great height or quantity of water as for the beautiful accompaniments which made the spot interesting after a broken cataract of about twenty feet the stream was received in a large natural basin filled to the brim with water which where the bubbles of the fall subsided was so exquisitely clear that although it was of great depth the eye could discern each pebble at the bottom eddying round this reservoir the brook found its way as if over a broken part of the ledge and formed a second fall which seemed to seek the very abyss then wheeling out beneath from among the smooth dark rocks which it had polished for ages it wandered murmuring down the glen forming the stream up which waverley had just ascended footnote see note 24 the borders of this romantic reservoir corresponded in beauty but it was beauty of a stern and commanding cast as if in the act of expanding into grandeur mossy banks of turf were broken and interrupted by huge fragments of rock and decorated with trees and shrubs some of which had been planted under the direction of flora but so cautiously that they added to the grace without diminishing the romantic wildness of the scene  here like one of those lovely forms which decorate the landscapes of poussin waverley found flora gazing on the waterfall two paces further back stood cathleen holding a small scottish harp the use of which had been taught to flora by rory dall one of the last harpers of the western highlands the sun now stooping in the west gave a rich and varied tinge to all the objects which surrounded waverley and seemed to add more than human brilliancy to the full expressive darkness of floras eye exalted the richness and purity of her complexion and enhanced the dignity and grace of her beautiful form edward thought he had never even in his wildest dreams imagined a figure of such exquisite and interesting loveliness the wild beauty of the retreat bursting upon him as if by magic augmented the mingled feeling of delight and awe with which he approached her like a fair enchantress of boiardo or ariosto by whose nod the scenery around seemed to have been created an eden in the wilderness  flora like every beautiful woman was conscious of her own power and pleased with its effects which she could easily discern from the respectful yet confused address of the young soldier but as she possessed excellent sense she gave the romance of the scene and other accidental circumstances full weight in appreciating the feelings with which waverley seemed obviously to be impressed and unacquainted with the fanciful and susceptible peculiarities of his character considered his homage as the passing tribute which a woman of even inferior charms might have expected in such a situation she therefore quietly led the way to a spot at such a distance from the cascade that its sound should rather accompany than interrupt that of her voice and instrument and sitting down upon a mossy fragment of rock she took the harp from cathleen  i have given you the trouble of walking to this spot captain waverley both because i thought the scenery would interest you and because a highland song would suffer still more from my imperfect translation were i to introduce it without its own wild and appropriate accompaniments to speak in the poetical language of my country the seat of the celtic muse is in the mist of the secret and solitary hill and her voice in the murmur of the mountain stream he who woos her must love the barren rock more than the fertile valley and the solitude of the desert better than the festivity of the hall  few could have heard this lovely woman make this declaration with a voice where harmony was exalted by pathos without exclaiming that the muse whom she invoked could never find a more appropriate representative but waverley though the thought rushed on his mind found no courage to utter it indeed the wild feeling of romantic delight with which he heard the few first notes she drew from her instrument amounted almost to a sense of pain he would not for worlds have quitted his place by her side yet he almost longed for solitude that he might decipher and examine at leisure the complication of emotions which now agitated his bosom  flora had exchanged the measured and monotonous recitative of the bard for a lofty and uncommon highland air which had been a battlesong in former ages a few irregular strains introduced a prelude of a wild and peculiar tone which harmonised well with the distant waterfall and the soft sigh of the evening breeze in the rustling leaves of an aspen which overhung the seat of the fair harpress the following verses convey but little idea of the feelings with which so sung and accompanied they were heard by waverley      there is mist on the mountain and night on the vale     but more dark is the sleep of the sons of the gael     a stranger commandedit sunk on the land     it has frozen each heart and benumbd every hand      the dirk and the target lie sordid with dust     the bloodless claymore is but reddend with rust     on the hill or the glen if a gun

again with the rapidity of an arrow that is ferguss faithful attendant captain waverley and that was his signal he likes no poetry but what is humorous and comes in good time to interrupt my long catalogue of the tribes whom one of your saucy english poets calls      our bootless host of highborn beggars     macleans mackenzies and macgregors  waverley expressed his regret at the interruption  o you cannot guess how much you have lost the bard as in duty bound has addressed three long stanzas to vich ian vohr of the banners enumerating all his great properties and not forgetting his being a cheerer of the harper and barda giver of bounteous gifts besides you should have heard a practical admonition to the fairhaired son of the stranger who lives in the land where the grass is always greenthe rider on the shining pampered steed whose hue is like the raven and whose neigh is like the scream of the eagle for battle this valiant horseman is affectionately conjured to remember that

 as flora concluded her song fergus stood before them i knew i should find you here even without the assistance of my friend bran a simple and unsublimed taste now like my own would prefer a jet deau at versailles to this cascade with all its accompaniments of rock and roar but this is floras parnassus captain waverley and that fountain her helicon it would be greatly for the benefit of my cellar if she could teach her coadjutor macmurrough the value of its influence he has just drunk a pint of usquebaugh to correct he said the coldness of the claret let me try its virtues he sipped a little

voit sur le rivage que quelques vilains troupeaux suivis de nymphes de village qui les escortent sans sabots  a truce dear fergus spare us those most tedious and insipid persons of all arcadia do not for heavens sake bring down coridon and lindor upon us  nay if you cannot relish la houlette et le chalumeau have with you in heroic strains  dear fergus you have certainly partaken of the inspiration of macmurroughs cup rather than of mine  i disclaim it ma belle demoiselle although i protest it would be the more congenial of the two which of your crackbrained italian romancers is it that says

whoso will in faith i will drink none but if you prefer the gaelic captain waverley here is little cathleen shall sing you drimmindhu come cathleen astore ie my dear begin no apologies to the ceankinne  cathleen sung with much liveliness a little gaelic song the burlesque elegy of a countryman on the loss of his cow the comic tones of which though he did not understand the language made waverley laugh more than once footnote this ancient gaelic ditty is still well known both in the highlands and in ireland it was translated into english and published if i mistake not under the auspices of the facetious tom durfey by the title of colley my cow  admirable cathleen cried the chieftain i must find you a handsome husband among the clansmen one of these days  cathleen laughed blushed and sheltered herself behind her companion  in the progress of their return to the castle the chieftain warmly pressed waverley to remain for a week or two in order to see a grand hunting party in which he and some other highland gentlemen proposed to join the charms of melody and beauty were too strongly impressed in edwards breast to permit his declining an invitation so pleasing it was agreed therefore that he should write a note to the baron of bradwardine expressing his intention to stay a fortnight at glennaquoich and requesting him to forward by the bearer a gilly of the chieftains any letters which might have arrived for him  this turned the discourse upon the baron whom fergus highly extolled as a gentleman and soldier his character was touched with yet more discrimination by flora who observed he was the very model of the old scottish cavalier with all his excellencies and peculiarities it is a character captain waverley which is fast disappearing for its best point was a selfrespect which was never lost sight of till now but in the present time the gentlemen whose principles do not permit them to pay court to the existing government are neglected and degraded and many conduct themselves accordingly and like some of the persons you have seen at tullyveolan adopt habits and companions inconsistent with their birth and breeding the ruthless proscription of party seems to degrade the victims whom it brands however unjustly but let us hope a brighter day is approaching when a scottish country gentleman may be a scholar without the pedantry of our friend the baron a sportsman without the low habits of mr falconer and a judicious improver of his property without becoming a boorish twolegged steer like killancureit  thus did flora prophesy a revolution which time indeed has produced but in a manner very different from what she had in her mind  the amiable rose was next mentioned with the warmest encomium on her person manners and mind that man said flora will find an inestimable treasure in the affections of rose bradwardine who shall be so fortunate as to become their object her very soul is in home and in the discharge of all those quiet virtues of which home is the centre her husband will be to her what her father now is the object of all her care solicitude and affection she will see nothing and connect herself with nothing but by him and through him if he is a man of sense and virtue she will sympathise in his sorrows divert his fatigue and share his pleasures if she becomes the property of a churlish or negligent husband she will suit his taste also for she will not long survive his unkindness and alas how great is the chance that some such unworthy lot may be that of my poor friend o that i were a queen this moment and could command the most amiable and worthy youth of my kingdom to accept happiness with the hand of rose bradwardine  i wish you would command her to accept mine en attendant said fergus laughing  i dont know by what caprice it was that this wish however jocularly expressed rather jarred on edwards feelings notwithstanding his growing inclination to flora and his indifference to miss bradwardine this is one of the inexplicabilities of human nature which we leave without comment  yours brother answered flora regarding him steadily no you have another bridehonour and the dangers you must run in pursuit of her rival would break poor roses heart  with this discourse they reached the castle and waverley soon prepared his despatches for tullyveolan as he knew the baron was punctilious in such matters he was about to impress his billet with a seal on which his armorial bearings were engraved but he did not find it at his watch and thought he must have left it at tullyveolan he mentioned his loss borrowing at the same time the family seal of the chieftain  surely said miss macivor donald bean lean would not  my life for him in such circumstances answered her brother besides he would never have left the watch behind  after all fergus said flora and with every allowance i am surprised you can countenance that man  i countenance him this kind sister of mine would persuade you captain waverley that i take what the people of old used to call a steakraid that is a collop of the foray or in plainer words a portion of the robbers booty paid by him to the laird or chief through whose grounds he drove his prey o it is certain that unless i can find some way to charm floras tongue general blakeney will send a sergeants party from stirling this he said with haughty and emphatic irony to seize vich lan vohr as they nickname me in his own castle  now fergus must not our guest be sensible that all this is folly and affectation you have men enough to serve you without enlisting banditti and your own honour is above taint why dont you send this donald bean lean whom i hate for his smoothness and duplicity even more than for his rapine out of your country at once no cause should induce me to tolerate such a character  no cause flora said the chieftain significantly  no cause fergus not even that which is nearest to my heart spare it the omen of such evil supporters  o but sister rejoined the chief gaily you dont consider my respect for la belle passion evan dhu maccombich is in love with donalds daughter alice and you cannot expect me to disturb him in his amours why the whole clan would cry shame on me you know it is one of their wise sayings that a kinsman is part of a mans body but a fosterbrother is a piece of his heart  well fergus there is no disputing with you but i would all this may end well  devoutly prayed my dear and prophetic sister and the best way in the world to close a dubious argument but hear ye not the pipes captain waverley perhaps you will like better to dance to them in the hall than to be deafened with their harmony without taking part in the exercise they invite us to  waverley took floras hand the dance song and merrymaking proceeded and closed the days entertainment at the castle of vich ian vohr edward at length retired his mind agitated by a variety of new and conflicting feelings which detained him from rest for some time in that not unpleasing state of mind in which fancy takes the helm and the soul rather drifts passively along with the rapid and confused tide of reflections than exerts itself to encounter systematise or examine them at a late hour he fell asleep and dreamed of flora macivor     chapter xxiv  a staghunt and its consequences   shall this be a long or a short chapter this is a question in which you gentle reader have no vote however much you may be interested in the consequences just as you may like myself probably have nothing to do with the imposing a new tax excepting the trifling circumstance of being obliged to pay it more happy surely in the present case since though it lies within my arbitrary power to extend my materials as i think proper i cannot call you into exchequer if you do not think proper to read my narrative let me therefore consider it is true that the annals and documents in my hands say but little of this highland chase but then i can find copious materials for description elsewhere there is old lindsay of pitscottie ready at my elbow with his athole hunting and his lofted and joisted palace of green timber with all kind

partridge plover duck drake brisselcock pawnies blackcock muirfowl and capercailzies not forgetting the costly bedding vaiselle and napry and least of all the excelling stewards cunning baxters excellent cooks and pottingars with confections and drugs for the desserts besides the particulars which may be thence gleaned for this highland feast the splendour of which induced the popes legate to dissent from an opinion which he had hitherto held that scotland namely was thethethe latter end of the worldbesides these might i not illuminate my pages with taylor the water poets hunting in the braes of mar where      through heather mossemong frogs and bogs and fogs       mongst craggy cliffs and thunderbatterd hills     hares hinds bucks roes are chased by men and dogs       where two hours hunting fourscore fat deer kills     lowland your sports are low as is your seat     the highland games and minds are high and great  but without further tyranny over my readers or display of the extent of my own reading i shall content myself with borrowing a single incident from the memorable hunting at lude commemorated in the ingenious mr gunns essay on the caledonian harp and so proceed in my story with all the brevity that my natural style of composition partaking of what scholars call the periphrastic and ambagitory and the vulgar the circumbendibus will permit me  the solemn hunting was delayed from various causes for about three weeks the interval was spent by waverley with great satisfaction at glennaquoich for the impression which flora had made on his mind at their first meeting grew daily stronger she was precisely the character to fascinate a youth of romantic imagination her manners her language her talents for poetry and music gave additional and varied influence to her eminent personal charms even in her hours of gaiety she was in his fancy exalted above the ordinary daughters of eve and seemed only to stoop for an instant to those topics of amusement and gallantry which others appear to live for in the neighbourhood of this enchantress while sport consumed the morning and music and the dance led on the hours of evening waverley became daily more delighted with his hospitable landlord and more enamoured of his bewitching sister  at length the period fixed for the grand hunting arrived and waverley and the chieftain departed for the place of rendezvous which was a days journey to the northward of glennaquoich fergus was attended on this occasion by about three hundred of his clan well armed and accoutred in their best fashion waverley complied so far with the custom of the country as to adopt the trews he could not be reconciled to the kilt brogues and bonnet as the fittest dress for the exercise in which he was to be engaged and which least exposed him to be stared at as a stranger when they should reach the place of rendezvous they found on the spot appointed several powerful chiefs to all of whom waverley was formally presented and by all cordially received their vassals and clansmen a part of whose feudal duty it was to attend on these parties appeared in such numbers as amounted to a small army these active assistants spread through the country far and near forming a circle technically called the tinchel which gradually closing drove the deer in herds together towards the glen where the chiefs and principal sportsmen lay in wait for them in the meanwhile these distinguished personages bivouacked among the flowery heath wrapped up in their plaids a mode of passing a summers night which waverley found by no means unpleasant  for many hours after sunrise the mountain ridges and passes retained their ordinary appearance of silence and solitude and the chiefs with their followers amused themselves with various pastimes in which the joys of the shell as ossian has it were not forgotten others apart sate on a hill retired probably as deeply engaged in the discussion of politics and news as miltons spirits in metaphysical disquisition at length signals of the approach of the game were descried and heard distant shouts resounded from valley to valley as the various parties of highlanders climbing rocks struggling through copses wading brooks and traversing thickets approached more and more near to each other and compelled the astonished deer with the other wild animals that fled before them into a narrower circuit every now and then the report of muskets was heard repeated by a thousand echoes the baying of the dogs was soon added to the chorus which grew ever louder and more loud at length the advanced parties of the deer began to show themselves and as the stragglers came bounding down the pass by two or three at a time the chiefs showed their skill by distinguishing the fattest deer and their dexterity in bringing them down with their guns fergus exhibited remarkable address and edward was also so fortunate as to attract the notice and applause of the sportsmen  but now the main body of the deer appeared at the head of the glen compelled into a very narrow compass and presenting such a formidable phalanx that their antlers appeared at a distance over the ridge of the steep pass like a leafless grove their number was very great and from a desperate stand which they made with the tallest of the reddeer stags arranged in front in a sort of battlearray gazing on the group which barred their passage down the glen the more experienced sportsmen began to augur danger the work of destruction however now commenced on all sides dogs and hunters were at work and muskets and fusees resounded from every quarter the deer driven to desperation made at length a fearful charge right upon the spot where the more distinguished sportsmen had taken their stand the word was given in gaelic to fling themselves upon their faces but waverley on whose english ears the signal was lost had almost fallen a sacrifice to his ignorance of the ancient language in which it was communicated fergus observing his danger sprung up and pulled him with violence to the ground just as the whole herd broke down upon them the tide being absolutely irresistible and wounds from a stags horn highly dangerous the activity of the chieftain may be considered on this occasion as having saved his guests life he detained him with a firm grasp until the whole herd of deer had fairly run over them waverley then attempted to rise but found that he had suffered several very severe contusions and upon a further examination discovered that he had sprained his ankle violently  footnote the thrust from the tynes or branches of the stags horns was accounted far more dangerous than those of the boars tusk      if thou be hurt with horn of stag     it brings thee to thy bier     but barbers hand shall boars hurt heal     thereof have thou no fear  this checked the mirth of the meeting although the highlanders accustomed to such incidents and prepared for them had suffered no harm themselves a wigwam was erected almost in an instant where edward was deposited on a couch of heather the surgeon or he who assumed the office appeared to unite the characters of a leech and a conjuror he was an old smokedried highlander wearing a venerable grey beard and having for his sole garment a tartan frock the skirts of which descended to the knee and being undivided in front made the vestment serve at once for doublet and breeches footnote this garb which resembled the dress often put on children in scotland called a polonie i e polonaise is a very ancient modification of the highland garb it was in fact the hauberk or shirt of mail only composed of cloth instead of rings of armour he observed great ceremony in approaching edward and though our hero was writhing with pain would not proceed to any operation which might assuage it until he had perambulated his couch three times moving from east to west according to the course of the sun this which was called making the deasil footnote old highlanders will still make the deasil around those whom they wish well to to go round a person in the opposite direction or withershins german widershins is unlucky and a sort of incantation both the leech and the assistants seemed to consider as a matter of the last importance to the accomplishment of a cure and waverley whom pain rendered incapable of expostulation and who indeed saw no chance of its being attended to submitted in silence  after this ceremony was duly performed the old esculapius let his patients blood with a cuppingglass with great dexterity and proceeded muttering all the while to himself in gaelic to boil on the fire certain herbs with which he compounded an embrocation he then fomented the parts which had sustained injury never failing to murmur prayers or spells which of the two waverley could not distinguish as his ear only caught the words gasparmelchiorbalthazarmaxpraxfax and similar gibberish the fomentation had a speedy effect in alleviating the pain and swelling which our hero imputed to the virtue of the herbs or the effect of the chafing but which was by the bystanders unanimously ascribed to the spells with which the operation had been accompanied edward was given to understand that not one of the ingredients had been gathered except during the full moon and that the herbalist had while collecting them uniformly recited a charm which in english ran thus      hail to thee thou holy herb     that sprung on holy ground     all in the mount olivet     first wert thou found     thou art boot for many a bruise     and healest many a wound     in our ladys blessed name     i take thee from the ground  footnote this metrical spell or something very like it is preserved by reginald scott in his work on witchcraft  edward observed with some surprise that even fergus notwithstanding his knowledge and education seemed to fall in with the superstitious ideas of his countrymen either because he deemed it impolitic to affect scepticism on a matter of general belief or more probably because like most men who do not think deeply or accurately on such subjects he had in his mind a reserve of superstition which balanced the freedom of his expressions and practice upon other occasions waverley made no commentary therefore on the manner of the treatment but rewarded the professor of medicine with a liberality beyond the utmost conception of his wildest hopes he uttered on the occasion so many incoherent blessings in gaelic and english that macivor rather scandalised at the excess of his acknowledgments cut them short by exclaiming ceud mile mhalloich ort ie a hundred thousand curses on you and so pushed the helper of men out of the cabin  after waverley was left alone the exhaustion of pain and fatiguefor the whole days exercise had been severethrew him into a profound but yet a feverish sleep which he chiefly owed to an opiate draught administered by the old highlander from some decoction of herbs in his pharmacopoeia  early the next morning the purpose of their meeting being over and their sports damped by the untoward accident in which fergus and all his friends expressed the greatest sympathy it became a question how to dispose of the disabled sportsman this was settled by macivor who had a litter prepared of birch and hazelgrey  footnote     on the morrow they made their biers     of birch and hazel grey chevy chase which was borne by his people with such caution and dexterity as renders it not improbable that they may have been the ancestors of some of those sturdy gael who have now the happiness to transport the belles of edinburgh in their sedanchairs to ten routs in one evening when edward was elevated upon their shoulders he could not help being gratified with the romantic effect produced by the breaking up of this sylvan camp footnote see note 25  the various tribes assembled each at the pibroch of their native clan and each headed by their patriarchal ruler some who had already begun to retire were seen winding up the hills or descending the passes which led to the scene of action the sound of their bagpipes dying upon the ear others made still a moving picture upon the narrow plain forming various changeful groups their feathers and loose plaids waving in the morning breeze and their arms glittering in the rising sun most of the chiefs came to take farewell of waverley and to express their anxious hope they might again and speedily meet but the care of fergus abridged the ceremony of taking leave at length his own men being completely assembled and mustered macivor commenced his march but not towards the quarter from which they had come he gave edward to understand that the greater part of his followers now on the field were bound on a distant expedition and that when he had deposited him in the house of a gentleman who he was sure would pay him every attention he himself should be under the necessity of accompanying them the greater part of the way but would lose no time in rejoining his friend  waverley was rather surprised that fergus had not mentioned this ulterior destination when they set out upon the huntingparty but his situation did not admit of many interrogatories the greater part of the clansmen went forward under the guidance of old ballenkeiroch and evan dhu maccombich apparently in high spirits a few remained for the purpose of escorting the chieftain who walked by the side of edwards litter and attended him with the most affectionate assiduity about noon after a journey which the nature of the conveyance the pain of his bruises and the roughness of the way rendered inexpressibly painful waverley was hospitably received into the house of a gentleman related to fergus who had prepared for him every accommodation which the simple habits of living then universal in the highlands put in his power in this person an old man about seventy edward admired a relic of primitive simplicity he wore no dress but what his estate afforded the cloth was the fleece of his own sheep woven by his own servants and stained into tartan by the dyes produced from the herbs and lichens of the hills around him his linen was spun by his daughters and maidservants from his own flax nor did his table though plentiful and varied with game and fish offer an article but what was of native produce  claiming himself no rights of clanship or vassalage he was fortunate in the alliance and protection of vich ian vohr and other bold and enterprising chieftains who protected him in the quiet unambitious life he loved it is true the youth born on his grounds were often enticed to leave him for the service of his more active friends but a few old servants and tenants used to shake their grey locks when they heard their master censured for want of spirit and observed when the wind is still the shower falls soft this good old man whose charity and hospitality were unbounded would have received waverley with kindness had he been the meanest saxon peasant since his situation required assistance but his attention to a friend and guest of vich ian vohr was anxious and unremitted other embrocations were applied to the injured limb and new spells were put in practice at length after more solicitude than was perhaps for the advantage of his health fergus took farewell of edward for a few days when he said he would return to tomanrait and hoped by that time waverley would be able to ride one of the highland ponies of his landlord and in that manner return to glennaquoich  the next day when his good old host appeared edward learned that his friend had departed with the dawn leaving none of his followers except callum beg the sort of footpage who used to attend his person and who had now in charge to wait upon waverley on asking his host if he knew where the chieftain was gone the old man looked fixedly at him with something mysterious and sad in the smile which was his only reply waverley repeated his question to which his host answered in a proverb      what sent the messengers to hell     was asking what they knew full well  footnote corresponding to the lowland saying mony ane speirs the gate they ken fu weel  he was about to proceed but callum beg said rather pertly as edward thought that ta tighearnach ie the chief did not like ta sassenagh duinhewassel to be pingled wi mickle speaking as she was na tat weel from this waverley concluded he should disoblige his friend by inquiring of a stranger the object of a journey which he himself had not communicated  it is unnecessary to trace the progress of our heros recovery the sixth morning had arrived and he was able to walk about with a staff when fergus returned with about a score of his men he seemed in the highest spirits congratulated waverley on his progress towards recovery and finding he was able to sit on horseback proposed their immediate return to glennaquoich waverley joyfully acceded for the form of its fair mistress had lived in his dreams during all the time of his confinement  now he has ridden oer moor and moss oer hill and many a glen  fergus all the while with his myrmidons striding stoutly by his side or diverging to get a shot at a roe or a heathcock waverleys bosom beat thick when they approached the old tower of ian nan chaistel and could distinguish the fair form of its mistress advancing to meet them  fergus began immediately with his usual high spirits to exclaim open your gates incomparable princess to the wounded moor abindarez whom rodrigo de narvez constable of antiquera conveys to your castle or open them if you like it better to the renowned marquis of mantua the sad attendant of his halfslain friend baldovinos of the mountain ah long rest to thy soul cervantes without quoting thy remnants how should i frame my language to befit romantic ears  flora now advanced and welcoming waverley with much kindness expressed her regret for his accident of which she had already heard particulars and her surprise that her brother should not have taken better care to put a stranger on his guard against the perils of the sport in which he engaged him edward easily exculpated the chieftain who indeed at his own personal risk had probably saved his life  this greeting over fergus said three or four words to his sister in gaelic the tears instantly sprung to her eyes but they seemed to be tears of devotion and joy for she looked up to heaven and folded her hands as in a solemn expression of prayer or gratitude after the pause of a minute she presented to edward some letters which had been forwarded from tullyveolan during his absence and at the same time delivered some to her brother to the latter she likewise gave three or four numbers of the caledonian mercury the only newspaper which was then published to the north of the tweed  both gentlemen retired to examine their despatches and edward speedily found that those which he had received contained matters of very deep interest     chapter xxv  news from england   the letters which waverley had hitherto received from his relations in england were not such as required any particular notice in this narrative his father usually wrote to him with the pompous affectation of one who was too much oppressed by public affairs to find leisure to attend to those of his own family now and then he mentioned persons of rank in scotland to whom he wished his son should pay some attention but waverley hitherto occupied by the amusements which he had found at tullyveolan and glennaquoich dispensed with paying any attention to hints so coldly thrown out especially as distance shortness of leave of absence and so forth furnished a ready apology but latterly the burden of mr richard waverleys paternal epistles consisted in certain mysterious hints of greatness and influence which he was speedily to attain and which would ensure his sons obtaining the most rapid promotion should he remain in the military service sir everards letters were of a different tenor they were short for the good baronet was none of your illimitable correspondents whose manuscript overflows the folds of their large post paper and leaves no room for the seal but they were kind and affectionate and seldom concluded without some allusion to our heros stud some question about the state of his purse and a special inquiry after such of his recruits as had preceded him from waverleyhonour aunt rachel charged him to remember his principles of religion to take care of his health to beware of scotch mists which she had heard would wet an englishman through and through never to go out at night without his greatcoat and above all to wear flannel next to his skin  mr pembroke only wrote to our hero one letter but it was of the bulk of six epistles of these degenerate days containing in the moderate compass of ten folio pages closely written a precis of a supplementary quarto manuscript of addenda delenda et corrigenda in reference to the two tracts with which he had presented waverley this he considered as a mere sop in the pan to stay the appetite of edwards curiosity until he should find an opportunity of sending down the volume itself which was much too heavy for the post and which he proposed to accompany with certain interesting pamphlets lately published by his friend in little britain with whom he had kept up a sort of literary correspondence in virtue of which the library shelves of waverleyhonour were loaded with much trash and a good round bill seldom summed in fewer than three figures was yearly transmitted in which sir everard waverley of waverleyhonour bart was marked dr to jonathan grubbet bookseller and stationer little britain such had hitherto been the style of the letters which edward had received from england but the packet delivered to him at glennaquoich was of a different and more interesting complexion it would be impossible for the reader even were i to insert the letters at full length to comprehend the real cause of their being written without a glance into the interior of the british cabinet at the period in question  the ministers of the day happened no very singular event to be divided into two parties the weakest of which making up by assiduity of intrigue their inferiority in real consequence had of late acquired some new proselytes and with them the hope of superseding their rivals in the favour of their sovereign and overpowering them in the house of commons amongst others they had thought it worth while to practise upon richard waverley this honest gentleman by a grave mysterious demeanour an attention to the etiquette of business rather more than to its essence a facility in making long dull speeches consisting of truisms and commonplaces hashed up with a technical jargon of office which prevented the inanity of his orations from being discovered had acquired a certain name and credit in public life and even established with many the character of a profound politician none of your shining orators indeed whose talents evaporate in tropes of rhetoric and flashes of wit but one possessed of steady parts for business which would wear well as the ladies say in choosing their silks and ought in all reason to be good for common and everyday use since they were confessedly formed of no holiday texture  this faith had become so general that the insurgent party in the cabinet of which we have made mention after sounding mr richard waverley were so satisfied with his sentiments and abilities as to propose that in case of a certain revolution in the ministry he should take an ostensible place in the new order of things not indeed of the very first rank but greatly higher in point both of emolument and influence than that which he now enjoyed there was no resisting so tempting a proposal notwithstanding that the great man under whose patronage he had enlisted and by whose banner he had hitherto stood firm was the principal object of the proposed attack by the new allies unfortunately this fair scheme of ambition was blighted in the very bud by a premature movement all the official gentlemen concerned in it who hesitated to take the part of a voluntary resignation were informed that the king had no further occasion for their services and in richard waverleys case which the minister considered as aggravated by ingratitude dismissal was accompanied by something like personal contempt and contumely the public and even the party of whom he shared the fall sympathised little in the disappointment of this selfish and interested statesman and he retired to the country under the comfortable reflection that he had lost at the same time character credit andwhat he at least equally deploredemolument  richard waverleys letter to his son upon this occasion was a masterpiece of its kind aristides himself could not have made out a harder case an unjust monarch and an ungrateful country were the burden of each rounded paragraph he spoke of long services and unrequited sacrifices though the former had been overpaid by his salary and nobody could guess in what the latter consisted unless it were in his deserting not from conviction but for the lucre of gain the tory principles of his family in the conclusion his resentment was wrought to such an excess by the force of his own oratory that he could not repress some threats of vengeance however vague and impotent and finally acquainted his son with his pleasure that he should testify his sense of the illtreatment he had sustained by throwing up his commission as soon as the letter reached him this he said was also his uncles desire as he would himself intimate in due course  accordingly the next letter which edward opened was from sir everard his brothers disgrace seemed to have removed from his wellnatured bosom all recollection of their differences and remote as he was from every means of learning that richards disgrace was in reality only the just as well as natural consequence of his own unsuccessful intrigues the good but credulous baronet at once set it down as a new and enormous instance of the injustice of the existing government it was true he said and he must not disguise it even from edward that his father could not have sustained such an insult as was now for the first time offered to one of his house unless he had subjected himself to it by accepting of an employment under the present system sir everard had no doubt that he now both saw and felt the magnitude of this error and it should be his sir everards business to take care that the cause of his regret should not extend itself to pecuniary consequences it was enough for a waverley to have sustained the public disgrace the patrimonial injury could easily be obviated by the head of their family but it was both the opinion of mr richard waverley and his own that edward the representative of the family of waverleyhonour should not remain in a situation which subjected him also to such treatment as that with which his father had been stigmatised he requested his nephew therefore to take the fittest and at the same time the most speedy opportunity of transmitting his resignation to the war office and hinted moreover that little ceremony was necessary where so little had been used to his father he sent multitudinous greetings to the baron of bradwardine  a letter from aunt rachel spoke out even more plainly she considered the disgrace of brother richard as the just reward of his forfeiting his allegiance to a lawful though exiled sovereign and taking the oaths to an alien a concession which her grandfather sir nigel waverley refused to make either to the roundhead parliament or to cromwell when his life and fortune stood in the utmost extremity she hoped her dear edward would follow the footsteps of his ancestors and as speedily as possible get rid of the badge of servitude to the usurping family and regard the wrongs sustained by his father as an admonition from heaven that every desertion of the line of loyalty becomes its own punishment she also concluded with her respects to mr bradwardine and begged waverley would inform her whether his daughter miss rose was old enough to wear a pair of very handsome earrings which she proposed to send as a token of her affection the good lady also desired to be informed whether mr bradwardine took as much scotch snuff and danced as unweariedly as he did when he was at waverleyhonour about thirty years ago  these letters as might have been expected highly excited waverleys indignation from the desultory style of his studies he had not any fixed political opinion to place in opposition to the movements of indignation which he felt at his fathers supposed wrongs of the real cause of his disgrace edward was totally ignorant nor had his habits at all led him to investigate the politics of the period in which he lived or remark the intrigues in which his father had been so actively engaged indeed any impressions which he had accidentally adopted concerning the parties of the times were owing to the society in which he had lived at waverleyhonour of a nature rather unfavourable to the existing government and dynasty he entered therefore without hesitation into the resentful feeling of the relations who had the best title to dictate his conduct and not perhaps the less willingly when he remembered the tedium of his quarters and the inferior figure which he had made among the officers of his regiment if he could have had any doubt upon the subject it would have been decided by the following letter from his commanding officer which as it is very short shall be inserted verbatim  sir  having carried somewhat beyond the line of my duty an indulgence which even the lights of nature and much more those of christianity direct towards errors which may arise from youth and inexperience and that altogether without effect i am reluctantly compelled at the present crisis to use the only remaining remedy which is in my power you are therefore hereby commanded to repair to  the headquarters of the regiment within three days after the date of this letter if you shall fail to do so i must report you to the war office as absent without leave and also take other steps which will be disagreeable to you as well as to  sir  your obedient servant  j gardiner lieutcol  commanding theregt dragoons  edwards blood boiled within him as he read this letter he had been accustomed from his very infancy to possess in a great measure the disposal of his own time and thus acquired habits which rendered the rules of military discipline as unpleasing to him in this as they were in some other respects an idea that in his own case they would not be enforced in a very rigid manner had also obtained full possession of his mind and had hitherto been sanctioned by the indulgent conduct of his lieutenantcolonel neither had anything occurred to his knowledge that should have induced his commanding officer without any other warning than the hints we noticed at the end of the fourteenth chapter so suddenly to assume a harsh and as edward deemed it so insolent a tone of dictatorial authority connecting it with the letters he had just received from his family he could not but suppose that it was designed to make him feel in his present situation the same pressure of authority which had been exercised in his fathers case and that the whole was a concerted scheme to depress and degrade every member of the waverley family  without a pause therefore edward wrote a few cold lines thanking his lieutenantcolonel for past civilities and expressing regret that he should have chosen to efface the remembrance of them by assuming a different tone towards him the strain of his letter as well as what he edward conceived to be his duty in the present crisis called upon him to lay down his commission and he therefore inclosed the formal resignation of a situation which subjected him to so unpleasant a correspondence and requested colonel gardiner would have the goodness to forward it to the proper authorities  having finished this magnanimous epistle he felt somewhat uncertain concerning the terms in which his resignation ought to be expressed upon which subject he resolved to consult fergus macivor it may be observed in passing that the bold and prompt habits of thinking acting and speaking which distinguished this young chieftain had given him a considerable ascendency over the mind of waverley endowed with at least equal powers of understanding and with much finer genius edward yet stooped to the bold and decisive activity of an intellect which was sharpened by the habit of acting on a preconceived and regular system as well as by extensive knowledge of the world  when edward found his friend the latter had still in his hand the newspaper which he had perused and advanced to meet him with the embarrassment of one who has unpleasing news to communicate do your letters captain waverley confirm the unpleasing information which i find in this paper  he put the paper into his hand where his fathers disgrace was registered in the most bitter terms transferred probably from some london journal at the end of the paragraph was this remarkable innuendo  we understand that this same richard who hath done all this is not the only example of the wavering honour of wvrly hnr see the gazette of this day  with hurried and feverish apprehension our hero turned to the place referred to and found therein recorded edward waverley captain inregiment dragoons superseded for absence without leave and in the list of military promotions referring to the same regiment he discovered this farther article lieut julius butler to be captain vice edward waverley superseded  our heros bosom glowed with the resentment which undeserved and apparently premeditated insult was calculated to excite in the bosom of one who had aspired after honour and was thus wantonly held up to public scorn and disgrace upon comparing the date of his colonels letter with that of the article in the gazette he perceived that his threat of making a report upon his absence had been literally fulfilled and without inquiry as it seemed whether edward had either received his summons or was disposed to comply with it the whole therefore appeared a formed plan to degrade him in the eyes of the public and the idea of its having succeeded filled him with such bitter emotions that after various attempts to conceal them he at length threw himself into macivors arms and gave vent to tears of shame and indignation  it was none of this chieftains faults to be indifferent to the wrongs of his friends and for edward independent of certain plans with which he was connected he felt a deep and sincere interest the proceeding appeared as extraordinary to him as it had done to edward he indeed knew of more motives than waverley was privy to for the peremptory order that he should join his regiment but that without further inquiry into the circumstances of a necessary delay the commanding officer in contradiction to his known and established character should have proceeded in so harsh and unusual a manner was a mystery which he could not penetrate he soothed our hero however to the best of his power and began to turn his thoughts on revenge for his insulted honour  edward eagerly grasped at the idea will you carry a message for me to colonel gardiner my dear fergus and oblige me for ever  fergus paused it is an act of friendship which you should command could it be useful or lead to the righting your honour but in the present case i doubt if your commanding officer would give you the meeting on account of his having taken measures which however harsh and exasperating were still within the strict bounds of his duty besides gardiner is a precise huguenot and has adopted certain ideas about the sinfulness of such rencontres from which it would be impossible to make him depart especially as his courage is beyond all suspicion and besides ii to say the truthi dare not at this moment for some very weighty reasons go near any of the military quarters or garrisons belonging to this government  and am i said waverley to sit down quiet and contented under the injury i have received  that will i never advise my friend replied macivor but i would have vengeance to fall on the head not on the hand on the tyrannical and oppressive government which designed and directed these premeditated and reiterated insults not on the tools of office which they employed in the execution of the injuries they aimed at you  on the government said waverley  yes replied the impetuous highlander on the usurping house of hanover whom your grandfather would no more have served than he would have taken wages of redhot gold from the great fiend of hell  but since the time of my grandfather two generations of this dynasty have possessed the throne said edward coolly  true replied the chieftain and because we have passively given them so long the means of showing their native characterbecause both you and i myself have lived in quiet submission have even truckled to the times so far as to accept commissions under them and thus have given them an opportunity of disgracing us publicly by resuming them are we not on that account to resent injuries which our fathers only apprehended but which we have actually sustained or is the cause of the unfortunate stuart family become less just because their title has devolved upon an heir who is innocent of the charges of misgovernment brought against his father do you remember the lines of your favourite poet      had richard unconstraind resignd the throne     a king can give no more than is his own     the title stood entaild had richard had a son  you see my dear waverley i can quote poetry as well as flora and you but come clear your moody brow and trust to me to show you an honourable road to a speedy and glorious revenge let us seek flora who perhaps has more news to tell us of what has occurred during our absence she will rejoice to hear that you are relieved of your servitude but first add a postscript to your letter marking the time when you received this calvinistical colonels first summons and express your regret that the hastiness of his proceedings prevented your anticipating them by sending your resignation then let him blush for his injustice  the letter was sealed accordingly covering a formal resignation of the commission and macivor despatched it with some letters of his own by a special messenger with charge to put them into the nearest postoffice in the lowlands     chapter xxvi  an eclaircissement   the hint which the chieftain had thrown out respecting flora was not unpremeditated he had observed with great satisfaction the growing attachment of waverley to his sister nor did he see any bar to their union excepting the situation which waverleys father held in the ministry and edwards own commission in the army of george ii these obstacles were now removed and in a manner which apparently paved the way for the sons becoming reconciled to another allegiance in every other respect the match would be most eligible the safety happiness and honourable provision of his sister whom he dearly loved appeared to be ensured by the proposed union and his heart swelled when he considered how his own interest would be exalted in the eyes of the exmonarch to whom he had dedicated his service by an alliance with one of those ancient powerful and wealthy english families of the steady cavalier faith to awaken whose decayed attachment to the stuart family was now a matter of such vital importance to the stuart cause nor could fergus perceive any obstacle to such a scheme waverleys attachment was evident and as his person was handsome and his taste apparently coincided with her own he anticipated no opposition on the part of flora indeed between his ideas of patriarchal power and those which he had acquired in france respecting the disposal of females in marriage any opposition from his sister dear as she was to him would have been the last obstacle on which he would have calculated even had the union been less eligible  influenced by these feelings the chief now led waverley in quest of miss macivor not without the hope that the present agitation of his guests spirits might give him courage to cut short what fergus termed the romance of the courtship they found flora with her faithful attendants una and cathleen busied in preparing what appeared to waverley to be white bridal favours disguising as well as he could the agitation of his mind waverley asked for what joyful occasion miss macivor made such ample preparation  it is for ferguss bridal she said smiling  indeed said edward he has kept his secret well i hope he will allow me to be his bridesman  that is a mans office but not yours as beatrice says retorted flora  and who is the fair lady may i be permitted to ask miss macivor  did not i tell you long since that fergus wooed no bride but honour answered flora  and am i then incapable of being his assistant and counsellor in the pursuit of honour said our hero colouring deeply do i rank so low in your opinion  far from it captain waverley i would to god you were of our determination and made use of the expression which displeased you solely      because you are not of our quality     but stand against us as an enemy  that time is past sister said fergus and you may wish edward waverley no longer captain joy of being freed from the slavery to an usurper implied in that sable and illomened emblem  yes said waverley undoing the cockade from his hat it has pleased the king who bestowed this badge upon me to resume it in a manner which leaves me little reason to regret his service  thank god for that cried the enthusiast and o that they may be blind enough to treat every man of honour who serves them with the same indignity that i may have less to sigh for when the struggle approaches  and now sister said the chieftain replace his cockade with one of a more lively colour i think it was the fashion of the ladies of yore to arm and send forth their knights to high achievement  not replied the lady till the knight adventurer had well weighed the justice and the danger of the cause fergus mr waverley is just now too much agitated by feelings of recent emotion for me to press upon him a resolution of consequence  waverley felt half alarmed at the thought of adopting the badge of what was by the majority of the kingdom esteemed rebellion yet he could not disguise his chagrin at the coldness with which flora parried her brothers hint miss macivor i perceive thinks the knight unworthy of her encouragement and favour said he somewhat bitterly  not so mr waverley she replied with great sweetness why should i refuse my brothers valued friend a boon which i am distributing to his whole clan most willingly would i enlist every man of honour in the cause to which my brother has devoted himself but fergus has taken his measures with his eyes open his life has been devoted to this cause from his cradle with him its call is sacred were it even a summons to the tomb but how can i wish you mr waverley so new to the world so far from every friend who might advise and ought to influence youin a moment too of sudden pique and indignationhow can i wish you to plunge yourself at once into so desperate an enterprise  fergus who did not understand these delicacies strode through the apartment biting his lip and then with a constrained smile said well sister i leave you to act your new character of mediator between the elector of hanover and the subjects of your lawful sovereign and benefactor and left the room  there was a painful pause which was at length broken by miss macivor my brother is unjust she said because he can bear no interruption that seems to thwart his loyal zeal  and do you not share his ardour asked waverley  do i not answered flora god knows mine exceeds his if that be possible but i am not like him rapt by the bustle of military preparation and the infinite detail necessary to the present undertaking beyond consideration of the grand principles of justice and truth on which our enterprise is grounded and these i am certain can only be furthered by measures in themselves true and just to operate upon your present feelings my dear mr waverley to induce you to an irretrievable step of which you have not considered either the justice or the danger is in my poor judgment neither the one nor the other  incomparable flora said edward taking her hand how much do i need such a monitor  a better one by far said flora gently withdrawing her hand mr waverley will always find in his own bosom when he will give its small still voice leisure to be heard  no miss macivor i dare not hope it a thousand circumstances of fatal selfindulgence have made me the creature rather of imagination than reason durst i but hopecould i but thinkthat you would deign to be to me that affectionate that condescending friend who would strengthen me to redeem my errors my future life  hush my dear sir now you carry your joy at escaping the hands of a jacobite recruiting officer to an unparalleled excess of gratitude  nay dear flora trifle with me no longer you cannot mistake the meaning of those feelings which i have almost involuntarily expressed and since i have broken the barrier of silence let me profit by my audacity or may i with your permission mention to your brother  not for the world mr waverley  what am i to understand said edward is there any fatal barhas any prepossession  none sir answered flora i owe it to myself to say that i never yet saw the person on whom i thought with reference to the present subject  the shortness of our acquaintance perhapsif miss macivor will deign to give me time  i have not even that excuse captain waverleys character is so openis in short of that nature that it cannot be misconstrued either in its strength or its weakness  and for that weakness you despise me said edward  forgive me mr waverleyand remember it is but within this half hour that there existed between us a barrier of a nature to me insurmountable since i never could think of an officer in the service of the elector of hanover in any other light than as a casual acquaintance permit me then to arrange my ideas upon so unexpected a topic and in less than an hour i will be ready to give you such reasons for the resolution i shall express as may be satisfactory at least if not pleasing to you so saying flora withdrew leaving waverley to meditate upon the manner in which she had received his addresses  ere he could make up his mind whether to believe his suit had been acceptable or no fergus reentered the apartment what a la mort waverley he cried come down with me to the court and you shall see a sight worth all the tirades of your romances an hundred firelocks my friend and as many broadswords just arrived from good friends and two or three hundred stout fellows almost fighting which shall first possess them but let me look at you closer why a true highlander would say you had been blighted by an evil eye or can it be this silly girl that has thus blanked your spirit never mind her dear edward the wisest of her sex are fools in what regards the business of life  indeed my good friend answered waverley all that i can charge against your sister is that she is too sensible too reasonable  if that be all i ensure you for a louisdor against the mood lasting fourandtwenty hours no woman was ever steadily sensible for that period and i will engage if that will please you flora shall be as unreasonable tomorrow as any of her sex you must learn my dear edward to consider women en mousquetaire so saying he seized waverleys arm and dragged him off to review his military preparations     chapter xxvii  upon the same subject   fergus macivor had too much tact and delicacy to renew the subject which he had interrupted his head was or appeared to be so full of guns broadswords bonnets canteens and tartan hose that waverley could not for some time draw his attention to any other topic  are you to take the field so soon fergus he asked that you are making all these martial preparations  when we have settled that you go with me you shall know all but otherwise the knowledge might rather be prejudicial to you  but are you serious in your purpose with such inferior forces to rise against an established government it is mere frenzy  laissez faire a don antoine i shall take good care of myself we shall at least use the compliment of conan who never got a stroke but he gave one i would not however continued the chieftain have you think me mad enough to stir till a favourable opportunity i will not slip my dog before the games afoot but once more will you join with us and you shall know all  how can i said waverley i who have so lately held that commission which is now posting back to those that gave it my accepting it implied a promise of fidelity and an acknowledgment of the legality of the government  a rash promise answered fergus is not a steel handcuff it may be shaken off especially when it was given under deception and has been repaid by insult but if you cannot immediately make up your mind to a glorious revenge go to england and ere you cross the tweed you will hear tidings that will make the world ring and if sir everard be the gallant old cavalier i have heard him described by some of our honest gentlemen of the year one thousand seven hundred and fifteen he will find you a better horsetroop and a better cause than you have lost  but your sister fergus  out hyperbolical fiend replied the chief laughing how vexest thou this man speakst thou of nothing but of ladies  nay be serious my dear friend said waverley i feel that the happiness of my future life must depend upon the answer which miss macivor shall make to what i ventured to tell her this morning  and is this your very sober earnest said fergus more gravely or are we in the land of romance and fiction  my earnest undoubtedly how could you suppose me jesting on such a subject  then in very sober earnest answered his friend i am very glad to hear it and so highly do i think of flora that you are the only man in england for whom i would say so much but before you shake my hand so warmly there is more to be considered your own familywill they approve your connecting yourself with the sister of a highborn highland beggar  my uncles situation said waverley his general opinions and his uniform indulgence entitle me to say that birth and personal qualities are all he would look to in such a connection and where can i find both united in such excellence as in your sister  o nowhere cela va sans dire replied fergus with a smile but your father will expect a fathers prerogative in being consulted  surely but his late breach with the ruling powers removes all apprehension of objection on his part especially as i am convinced that my uncle will be warm in my cause  religion perhaps said fergus may make obstacles though we are not bigotted catholics  my grandmother was of the church of rome and her religion was never objected to by my family do not think of my friends dear fergus let me rather have your influence where it may be more necessary to remove obstaclesi mean with your lovely sister  my lovely sister replied fergus like her loving brother is very apt to have a pretty decisive will of her own by which in this case you must be ruled but you shall not want my interest nor my counsel and in the first place i will give you one hintloyalty is her ruling passion and since she could spell an english book she has been in love with the memory of the gallant captain wogan who renounced the service of the usurper cromwell to join the standard of charles ii marched a handful of cavalry from london to the highlands to join middleton then in arms for the king and at length died gloriously in the royal cause ask her to show you some verses she made on his history and fate they have been much admired i assure you the next point isi think i saw flora go up towards the waterfall a short time since follow man follow dont allow the garrison time to strengthen its purposes of resistance alerte a la muraille seek flora out and learn her decision as soon as you can and cupid go with you while i go to look over belts and cartouchboxes  waverley ascended the glen with an anxious and throbbing heart love with all its romantic train of hopes fears and wishes was mingled with other feelings of a nature less easily defined he could not but remember how much this morning had changed his fate and into what a complication of perplexity it was likely to plunge him sunrise had seen him possessed of an esteemed rank in the honourable profession of arms his father to all appearance rapidly rising in the favour of his sovereign all this had passed away like a dream he himself was dishonoured his father disgraced and he had become involuntarily the confidant at least if not the accomplice of plans dark deep and dangerous which must infer either the subversion of the government he had so lately served or the destruction of all who had participated in them should flora even listen to his suit favourably what prospect was there of its being brought to a happy termination amid the tumult of an impending insurrection or how could he make the selfish request that she should leave fergus to whom she was so much attached and retiring with him to england wait as a distant spectator the success of her brothers undertaking or the ruin of all his hopes and fortunes or on the other hand to engage himself with no other aid than his single arm in the dangerous and precipitate counsels of the chieftain to be whirled along by him the partaker of all his desperate and impetuous motions renouncing almost the power of judging or deciding upon the rectitude or prudence of his actions this was no pleasing prospect for the secret pride of waverley to stoop to and yet what other conclusion remained saving the rejection of his addresses by flora an alternative not to be thought of in the present highwrought state of his feelings with anything short of mental agony pondering the doubtful and dangerous prospect before him he at length arrived near the cascade where as fergus had augured he found flora seated  she was quite alone and as soon as she observed his approach she rose and came to meet him edward attempted to say something within the verge of ordinary compliment and conversation but found himself unequal to the task flora seemed at first equally embarrassed but recovered herself more speedily and an unfavourable augury for waverleys suit was the first to enter upon the subject of their last interview it is too important in every point of view mr waverley to permit me to leave you in doubt on my sentiments  do not speak them speedily said waverley much agitated unless they are such as i fear from your manner i must not dare to anticipate let timelet my future conductlet your brothers influence  forgive me mr waverley said flora her complexion a little heightened but her voice firm and composed i should incur my own heavy censure did i delay expressing my sincere conviction that i can never regard you otherwise than as a valued friend i should do you the highest injustice did i conceal my sentiments for a moment i see i distress you and i grieve for it but better now than later and o better a thousand times mr waverley that you should feel a present momentary disappointment than the long and heartsickening griefs which attend a rash and illassorted marriage  good god exclaimed waverley why should you anticipate such consequences from a union where birth is equal where fortune is favourable where if i may venture to say so the tastes are similar where you allege no preference for another where you even express a favourable opinion of him whom you reject  mr waverley i have that favourable opinion answered flora and so strongly that though i would rather have been silent on the grounds of my resolution you shall command them if you exact such a mark of my esteem and confidence  she sat down upon a fragment of rock and waverley placing himself near her anxiously pressed for the explanation she offered  i dare hardly she said tell you the situation of my feelings they are so different from those usually ascribed to young women at my period of life and i dare hardly touch upon what i conjecture to be the nature of yours lest i should give offence where i would willingly administer consolation for myself from my infancy till this day i have had but one wishthe restoration of my royal benefactors to their rightful throne it is impossible to express to you the devotion of my feelings to this single subject and i will frankly confess that it has so occupied my mind as to exclude every thought respecting what is called my own settlement in life let me but live to see the day of that happy restoration and a highland cottage a french convent or an english palace will be alike indifferent to me  but dearest flora how is your enthusiastic zeal for the exiled family inconsistent with my happiness  because you seek or ought to seek in the object of your attachment a heart whose principal delight should be in augmenting your domestic felicity and returning your affection even to the height of romance to a man of less keen sensibility and less enthusiastic tenderness of disposition flora macivor might give content if not happiness for were the irrevocable words spoken never would she be deficient in the duties which she vowed  and whywhy miss macivor should you think yourself a more valuable treasure to one who is less capable of loving of admiring you than to me  simply because the tone of our affections would be more in unison and because his more blunted sensibility would not require the return of enthusiasm which i have not to bestow but you mr waverley would for ever refer to the idea of domestic happiness which your imagination is capable of painting and whatever fell short of that ideal representation would be construed into coolness and indifference while you might consider the enthusiasm with which i regarded the success of the royal family as defrauding your affection of its due return  in other words miss macivor you cannot love me said her suitor dejectedly  i could esteem you mr waverley as much perhaps more than any man i have ever seen but i cannot love you as you ought to be loved o do not for your own sake desire so hazardous an experiment the woman whom you marry ought to have affections and opinions moulded upon yours her studies ought to be your studies her wishes her feelings her hopes her fears should all mingle with yours she should enhance your pleasures share your sorrows and cheer your melancholy  and why will not you miss macivor who can so well describe a happy union why will not you be yourself the person you describe  is it possible you do not yet comprehend me answered flora have i not told you that every keener sensation of my mind is bent exclusively towards an event upon which indeed i have no power but those of my earnest prayers  and might not the granting the suit i solicit said waverley too earnest on his purpose to consider what he was about to say even advance the interest to which you have devoted yourself my family is wealthy and powerful inclined in principles to the stuart race and should a favourable opportunity  a favourable opportunity said florasomewhat scornfully inclined in principles can such lukewarm adherence be honourable to yourselves or gratifying to your lawful sovereign think from my present feelings what i should suffer when i held the place of member in a family where the rights which i hold most sacred are subjected to cold discussion and only deemed worthy of support when they shall appear on the point of triumphing without it  your doubts quickly replied waverley are unjust as far as concerns myself the cause that i shall assert i dare support through every danger as undauntedly as the boldest who draws sword in its behalf  of that answered flora i cannot doubt for a moment but consult your own good sense and reason rather than a prepossession hastily adopted probably only because you have met a young woman possessed of the usual accomplishments in a sequestered and romantic situation let your part in this great and perilous drama rest upon conviction and not on a hurried and probably a temporary feeling  waverley attempted to reply but his words failed him every sentiment that flora had uttered vindicated the strength of his attachment for even her loyalty although wildly enthusiastic was generous and noble and disdained to avail itself of any indirect means of supporting the cause to which she was devoted  after walking a little way in silence down the path flora thus resumed the conversationone word more mr waverley ere we bid farewell to this topic for ever and forgive my boldness if that word have the air of advice my brother fergus is anxious that you should join him in his present enterprise but do not consent to this you could not by your single exertions further his success and you would inevitably share his fall if it be gods pleasure that fall he must your character would also suffer irretrievably let me beg you will return to your own country and having publicly freed yourself from every tie to the usurping government i trust you will see cause and find opportunity to serve your injured sovereign with effect and stand forth as your loyal ancestors at the head of your natural followers and adherents a worthy representative of the house of waverley  and should i be so happy as thus to distinguish myself might i not hope  forgive my interruption said flora the present time only is ours and i can but explain to you with candour the feelings which i now entertain how they might be altered by a train of events too favourable perhaps to be hoped for it were in vain even to conjecture only be assured mr waverley that after my brothers honour and happiness there is none which i shall more sincerely pray for than for yours  with these words she parted from him for they were now arrived where two paths separated waverley reached the castle amidst a medley of conflicting passions he avoided any private interview with fergus as he did not find himself able either to encounter his raillery or reply to his solicitations the wild revelry of the feast for macivor kept open table for his clan served in some degree to stun reflection when their festivity was ended he began to consider how he should again meet miss macivor after the painful and interesting explanation of the morning but flora did not appear fergus whose eyes flashed when he was told by cathleen that her mistress designed to keep her apartment that evening went himself in quest of her but apparently his remonstrances were in vain for he returned with a heightened complexion and manifest symptoms of displeasure the rest of the evening passed on without any allusion on the part either of fergus or waverley to the subject which engrossed the reflections of the latter and perhaps of both  when retired to his own apartment edward endeavoured to sum up the business of the day that the repulse he had received from flora would be persisted in for the present there was no doubt but could he hope for ultimate success in case circumstances permitted the renewal of his suit would the enthusiastic loyalty which at this animating moment left no room for a softer passion survive at least in its engrossing force the success or the failure of the present political machinations and if so could he hope that the interest which she had acknowledged him to possess in her favour might be improved into a warmer attachment he taxed his memory to recall every word she had used with the appropriate looks and gestures which had enforced them and ended by finding himself in the same state of uncertainty it was very late before sleep brought relief to the tumult of his mind after the most painful and agitating day which he had ever passed     chapter xxviii  a letter from tullyveolan   in the morning when waverleys troubled reflections had for some time given way to repose there came music to his dreams but not the voice of selma he imagined himself transported back to tullyveolan and that he heard davie gellatley singing in the court those matins which used generally to be the first sounds that disturbed his repose while a guest of the baron of bradwardine the notes which suggested this vision continued and waxed louder until edward awoke in earnest the illusion however did not seem entirely dispelled the apartment was in the fortress of lan nan chaistel but it was still the voice of davie gellatley that made the following lines resound under the window      my hearts in the highlands my heart is not here     my hearts in the highlands achasing the deer     achasing the wild deer and following the roe     my hearts in the highlands wherever i go  footnote these lines form the burden of an old song to which burns wrote additional verses  curious to know what could have determined mr gellatley on an excursion of such unwonted extent edward began to dress himself in all haste during which operation the minstrelsy of davie changed its tune more than once      theres nought in the highlands but syboes and leeks     and langleggit callants gaun wanting the breeks     wanting the breeks and without hose and shoon     but well awin the breeks when king jamie comes hame  footnote these lines are also ancient and i believe to the tune of well never hae peace till jamie comes hame to which burns likewise wrote some verses  by the time waverley was dressed and had issued forth david had associated himself with two or three of the numerous highland loungers who always graced the gates of the castle with their presence and was capering and dancing full merrily in the doubles and full career of a scotch foursome reel to the music of his own whistling in this double capacity of dancer and musician he continued until an idle piper who observed his zeal obeyed the unanimous call of seid suas ie blow up and relieved him from the latter part of his trouble young and old then mingled in the dance as they could find partners the appearance of waverley did not interrupt davids exercise though he contrived by grinning nodding and throwing one or two inclinations of the body into the graces with which he performed the highland fling to convey to our hero symptoms of recognition then while busily employed in setting whooping all the while and snapping his fingers over his head he of a sudden prolonged his sidestep until it brought him to the place where edward was standing and still keeping time to the music like harlequin in a pantomime he thrust a letter into our heros hand and continued his saltation without pause or intermission edward who perceived that the address was in roses handwriting retired to peruse it leaving the faithful bearer to continue his exercise until the piper or he should be tired out  the contents of the letter greatly surprised him it had originally commenced with dear sir but these words had been carefully erased and the monosyllable sir substituted in their place the rest of the contents shall be given in roses own language  i fear i am using an improper freedom by intruding upon you yet i cannot trust to any one else to let you know some things which have happened here with which it seems necessary you should be acquainted forgive me if i am wrong in what i am doing for alas mr waverley i have no better advice than that of my own feelings my dear father is gone from this place and when he can return to my assistance and protection god alone knows you have probably heard that in consequence of some troublesome news from the highlands warrants were sent out for apprehending several gentlemen in these parts and among others my dear father in spite of all my tears and entreaties that he would surrender himself to the government he joined with mr falconer and some other gentlemen and they have all gone northwards with a body of about forty horsemen so i am not so anxious concerning his immediate safety as about what may follow afterwards for these troubles are only beginning but all this is nothing to you mr waverley only i thought you would be glad to learn that my father has escaped in case you happen to have heard that he was in danger  the day after my father went off there came a party of soldiers to tullyveolan and behaved very rudely to bailie macwheeble but the officer was very civil to me only said his duty obliged him to search for arms and papers my father had provided against this by taking away all the arms except the old useless things which hung in the hall and he had put all his papers out of the way but o mr waverley how shall i tell you that they made strict inquiry after you and asked when you had been at tullyveolan and where you now were the officer is gone back with his party but a noncommissioned officer and four men remain as a sort of garrison in the house they have hitherto behaved very well as we are forced to keep them in goodhumour but these soldiers have hinted as if on your falling into their hands you would be in great danger i cannot prevail on myself to write what wicked falsehoods they said for i am sure they are falsehoods but you will best judge what you ought to do the party that returned carried off your servant prisoner with your two horses and everything that you left at tullyveolan i hope god will protect you and that you will get safe home to england where you used to tell me there was no military violence nor fighting among clans permitted but everything was done according to an equal law that protected all who were harmless and innocent i hope you will exert your indulgence as to my boldness in writing to you where it seems to me though perhaps erroneously that your safety and honour are concerned i am sureat least i think my father would approve of my writing for mr rubrick is fled to his cousins at the duchran to to be out of danger from the soldiers and the whigs and bailie macwheeble does not like to meddle he says in other mens concerns though i hope what may serve my fathers friend at such a time as this cannot be termed improper interference farewell captain waverley i shall probably never see you more for it would be very improper to wish you to call at tullyveolan just now even if these men were gone but i will always remember with gratitude your kindness in assisting so poor a scholar as myself and your attentions to my dear dear father  i remain your obliged servant  rose comyne bradwardine  psi hope you will send me a line by david gellatley just to say you have received this and that you will take care of yourself and forgive me if i entreat you for your own sake to join none of these unhappy cabals but escape as fast as possible to your own fortunate country my compliments to my dear flora and to glennaquoich is she not as handsome and accomplished as i have described her  thus concluded the letter of rose bradwardine the contents of which both surprised and affected waverley that the baron should fall under the suspicions of government in consequence of the present stir among the partisans of the house of stuart seemed only the natural consequence of his political predilections but how he himself should have been involved in such suspicions conscious that until yesterday he had been free from harbouring a thought against the prosperity of the reigning family seemed inexplicable both at tullyveolan and glennaquoich his hosts had respected his engagements with the existing government and though enough passed by accidental innuendo that might induce him to reckon the baron and the chief among those disaffected gentlemen who were still numerous in scotland yet until his own connection with the army had been broken off by the resumption of his commission he had no reason to suppose that they nourished any immediate or hostile attempts against the present establishment still he was aware that unless he meant at once to embrace the proposal of fergus macivor it would deeply concern him to leave the suspicious neighbourhood without delay and repair where his conduct might undergo a satisfactory examination upon this he the rather determined as floras advice favoured his doing so and because he felt inexpressible repugnance at the idea of being accessary to the plague of civil war whatever were the original rights of the stuarts calm reflection told him that omitting the question how far james the second could forfeit those of his posterity he had according to the united voice of the whole nation justly forfeited his own since that period four monarchs had reigned in peace and glory over britain sustaining and exalting the character of the nation abroad and its liberties at home reason asked was it worth while to disturb a government so long settled and established and to plunge a kingdom into all the miseries of civil war for the purpose of replacing upon the throne the descendants of a monarch by whom it had been wilfully forfeited if on the other hand his own final conviction of the goodness of their cause or the commands of his father or uncle should recommend to him allegiance to the stuarts still it was necessary to clear his own character by showing that he had not as seemed to be falsely insinuated taken any step to this purpose during his holding the commission of the reigning monarch  the affectionate simplicity of rose and her anxiety for his safety his sense too of her unprotected state and of the terror and actual dangers to which she might be exposed made an impression upon his mind and he instantly wrote to thank her in the kindest terms for her solicitude on his account to express his earnest good wishes for her welfare and that of her father and to assure her of his own safety the feelings which this task excited were speedily lost in the necessity which he now saw of bidding farewell to flora macivor perhaps for ever the pang attending this reflection was inexpressible for her highminded elevation of character her selfdevotion to the cause which she had embraced united to her scrupulous rectitude as to the means of serving it had vindicated to his judgment the choice adopted by his passions but time pressed calumny was busy with his fame and every hours delay increased the power to injure it his departure must be instant  with this determination he sought out fergus and communicated to him the contents of roses letter with his own resolution instantly to go to edinburgh and put into the hands of some one or other of those persons of influence to whom he had letters from his father his exculpation from any charge which might be preferred against him  you run your head into the lions mouth answered macivor you do not know the severity of a government harassed by just apprehensions and a consciousness of their own illegality and insecurity i shall have to deliver you from some dungeon in stirling or edinburgh castle  my innocence my rank my fathers intimacy with lord m general g etc will be a sufficient protection said waverley  you will find the contrary replied the chieftain these gentlemen will have enough to do about their own matters once more will you take the plaid and stay a little while with us among the mists and the crows in the bravest cause ever sword was drawn in  footnote a highland rhyme on glencairns expedition in 1650 has these lines        well bide a while amang ta crows       well wiske ta sword and bend ta bows  for many reasons my dear fergus you must hold me excused  well then said macivor i shall certainly find you exerting your poetical talents in elegies upon a prison or your antiquarian researches in detecting the oggam footnote the oggam is a species of the old irish character the idea of the correspondence betwixt the celtic and punic founded on a scene in plautus was not started till general vallancey set up his theory long after the date of fergus macivor character or some punic hieroglyphic upon the keystones of a vault curiously arched or what say you to un petit pendement bien joli against which awkward ceremony i dont warrant you should you meet a body of the armed westcountry whigs  and why should they use me so said waverley  for a hundred good reasons answered fergus first you are an englishman secondly a gentleman thirdly a prelatist abjured and fourthly they have not had an opportunity to exercise their talents on such a subject this long while but dont be cast down beloved all will be done in the fear of the lord  well i must run my hazard  you are determined then  i am  wilful will dot said fergus but you cannot go on foot and i shall want no horse as i must march on foot at the head of the children of ivor you shall have brown dermid  if you will sell him i shall certainly be much obliged  if your proud english heart cannot be obliged by a gift or loan i will not refuse money at the entrance of a campaign his price is twenty guineas remember reader it was sixty years since and when do you propose to depart  the sooner the better answered waverley  you are right since go you must or rather since go you will i will take floras pony and ride with you as far as ballybrough callum beg see that our horses are ready with a pony for yourself to attend and carry mr waverleys baggage as far asnaming a small town where he can have a horse and guide to edinburgh put on a lowland dress callum and see you keep your tongue close if you would not have me cut it out mr waverley rides dermid then turning to edward you will take leave of my sister  surelythat is if miss macivor will honour me so far  cathleen let my sister know mr waverley wishes to bid her farewell before he leaves us but rose bradwardine her situation must be thought of i wish she were here and why should she not there are but four redcoats at tullyveolan and their muskets would be very useful to us  to these broken remarks edward made no answer his ear indeed received them but his soul was intent upon the expected entrance of flora the door opened it was but cathleen with her ladys excuse and wishes for captain waverleys health and happiness     chapter xxix  waverleys reception in the lowlands after his highland tour   it was noon when the two friends stood at the top of the pass of ballybrough i must go no farther said fergus macivor who during the journey had in vain endeavoured to raise his friends spirits if my crossgrained sister has any share in your dejection trust me she thinks highly of you though her present anxiety about the public cause prevents her listening to any other subject confide your interest to me i will not betray it providing you do not again assume that vile cockade  no fear of that considering the manner in which it has been recalled adieu fergus do not permit your sister to forget me  and adieu waverley you may soon hear of her with a prouder title get home write letters and make friends as many and as fast as you can there will speedily be unexpected guests on the coast of suffolk or my news from france has deceived me footnote the sanguine jacobites during the eventful years 174546 kept up the spirits of their party by the rumour of descents from france on behalf of the chevalier st george  thus parted the friends fergus returning back to his castle while edward followed by callum beg the latter transformed from point to point into a lowcountry groom proceeded to the little town of  edward paced on under the painful and yet not altogether embittered feelings which separation and uncertainty produce in the mind of a youthful lover i am not sure if the ladies understand the full value of the influence of absence nor do i think it wise to teach it them lest like the clelias and mandanes of yore they should resume the humour of sending their lovers into banishment distance in truth produces in idea the same effect as in real perspective objects are softened and rounded and rendered doubly graceful the harsher and more ordinary points of character are mellowed down and those by which it is remembered are the more striking outlines that mark sublimity grace or beauty there are mists too in the mental as well as the natural horizon to conceal what is less pleasing in distant objects and there are happy lights to stream in full glory upon those points which can profit by brilliant illumination  waverley forgot flora macivors prejudices in her magnanimity and almost pardoned her indifference towards his affection when he recollected the grand and decisive object which seemed to fill her whole soul she whose sense of duty so wholly engrossed her in the cause of a benefactor what would be her feelings in favour of the happy individual who should be so fortunate as to awaken them then came the doubtful question whether he might not be that happy mana question which fancy endeavoured to answer in the affirmative by conjuring up all she had said in his praise with the addition of a comment much more flattering than the text warranted all that was commonplace all that belonged to the everyday world was melted away and obliterated in those dreams of imagination which only remembered with advantage the points of grace and dignity that distinguished flora from the generality of her sex not the particulars which she held in common with them edward was in short in the fair way of creating a goddess out of a highspirited accomplished and beautiful young woman and the time was wasted in castlebuilding until at the descent of a steep hill he saw beneath him the markettown of   the highland politeness of callum begthere are few nations by the way who can boast of so much natural politeness as the highlanders footnote the highlander in former times had always a high idea of his own gentility and was anxious to impress the same upon those with whom he conversed his language abounded in the phrases of courtesy and compliment and the habit of carrying arms and mixing with those who did so made it particularly desirable they should use cautious politeness in their intercourse with each otherthe highland civility of his attendant had not permitted him to disturb the reveries of our hero but observing him rouse himself at the sight of the village callum pressed closer to his side and hoped when they cam to the public his honour wad not say nothing about vich ian vohr for ta people were bitter whigs deil burst tem  waverley assured the prudent page that he would be cautious and as he now distinguished not indeed the ringing of bells but the tinkling of something like a hammer against the side of an old mossy green inverted porridgepot that hung in an open booth of the size and shape of a parrots cage erected to grace the east end of a building resembling an old barn he asked callum beg if it were sunday  could na say just preceesely sunday seldom cam aboon the pass of ballybrough  on entering the town however and advancing towards the most apparent publichouse which presented itself the numbers of old women in tartan screens and red cloaks who streamed from the barnresembling building debating as they went the comparative merits of the blessed youth jabesh rentowel and that chosen vessel maister goukthrapple induced callum to assure his temporary master that it was either ta muckle sunday hersell or ta little government sunday that they cad ta fast  on alighting at the sign of the sevenbranched golden candlestick which for the further delectation of the guests was graced with a short hebrew motto they were received by mine host a tall thin puritanical figure who seemed to debate with himself whether he ought to give shelter to those who travelled on such a day reflecting however in all probability that he possessed the power of mulcting them for this irregularity a penalty which they might escape by passing into gregor duncansons at the sign of the highlander and the hawick gill mr ebenezer cruickshanks condescended to admit them into his dwelling  to this sanctified person waverley addressed his request that he would procure him a guide with a saddlehorse to carry his portmanteau to edinburgh  and whar may ye be coming from demanded mine host of the candlestick  i have told you where i wish to go i do not conceive any further information necessary either for the guide or his saddlehorse  hem ahem returned he of the candlestick somewhat disconcerted at this rebuff its the general fast sir and i cannot enter into ony carnal transactions on sic a day when the people should be humbled and the backsliders should return as worthy mr goukthrapple said and moreover when as the precious mr jabesh rentowel did weel observe the land was mourning for covenants burnt broken and buried  my good friend said waverley if you cannot let me have a horse and guide my servant shall seek them elsewhere  aweel your servant and what for gangs he not forward wi you himsell  waverley had but very little of a captain of horses spirit within himi mean of that sort of spirit which i have been obliged to when i happened in a mail coach or diligence to meet some military man who has kindly taken upon him the disciplining of the waiters and the taxing of reckonings some of this useful talent our hero had however acquired during his military service and on this gross provocation it began seriously to arise look ye sir i came here for my own accommodation and not to answer impertinent questions either say you can or cannot get me what i want i shall pursue my course in either case  mr ebenezer cruickshanks left the room with some indistinct mutterings but whether negative or acquiescent edward could not well distinguish the hostess a civil quiet laborious drudge came to take his orders for dinner but declined to make answer on the subject of the horse and guide for the salique law it seems extended to the stables of the golden candlestick  from a window which overlooked the dark and narrow court in which callum beg rubbed down the horses after their journey waverley heard the following dialogue betwixt the subtle footpage of vich ian vohr and his landlord  yell be frae the north young man began the latter  and ye may say that answered callum  and yell hae ridden a lang way the day it may weel be  sae lang that i could weel tak a dram  gudewife bring the gill stoup  here some compliments passed fitting the occasion

bodle  aweel duncandid ye say your name was duncan or donald  na manjamiejamie steensoni telt ye before  this last undaunted parry altogether foiled mr cruickshanks who though not quite satisfied either with the reserve of the master or the extreme readiness of the man was contented to lay a tax on the reckoning and horsehire that might compound for his ungratified curiosity the circumstance of its being the fast day was not forgotten in the charge which on the whole did not however amount to much more than double what in fairness it should have been  callum beg soon after announced in person the ratification of this treaty adding ta auld deevil was ganging to ride wi ta duinhewassel hersell  that will not be very pleasant callum nor altogether safe for our host seems a person of great curiosity but a traveller must submit to these inconveniences meanwhile my good lad here is a trifle for you to drink vich ian vohrs health  the hawks eye of callum flashed delight upon a golden guinea with which these last words were accompanied he hastened not without a curse on the intricacies of a saxon breeches pocket or spleuchan as he called it to deposit the treasure in his fob and then as if he conceived the benevolence called for some requital on his part he gathered close up to edward with an expression of countenance peculiarly knowing and spoke in an undertone if his honour thought ta auld deevil whig carle was a bit dangerous she could easily provide for him and teil ane ta wiser  how and in what manner  her ain sell replied callum could wait for him a wee bit frae the toun and kittle his quarters wiher skeneoccle  skeneoccle whats that  callum unbuttoned his coat raised his left arm and with an emphatic nod pointed to the hilt of a small dirk snugly deposited under it in the lining of his jacket waverley thought he had misunderstood his meaning he gazed in his face and discovered in callums very handsome though embrowned features just the degree of roguish malice with which a lad of the same age in england would have brought forward a plan for robbing an orchard  good god callum would you take the mans life  indeed answered the young desperado and i think he has had just a lang enough lease o t when hes for betraying honest folk that come to spend siller at his public  edward saw nothing was to be gained by argument and therefore contented himself with enjoining callum to lay aside all practices against the person of mr ebenezer cruickshanks in which injunction the page seemed to acquiesce with an air of great indifference  ta duinhewassel might please himsell ta auld rudas loon had never done callum nae ill but heres a bit line frae ta tighearna tat he bade me gie your honour ere i came back  the letter from the chief contained floras lines on the fate of captain wogan whose enterprising character is so well drawn by clarendon he had originally engaged in the service of the parliament but had abjured that party upon the execution of charles i and upon hearing that the royal standard was set up by the earl of glencairn and general middleton in the highlands of scotland took leave of charles ii who was then at paris passed into england assembled a body of cavaliers in the neighbourhood of london and traversed the kingdom which had been so long under domination of the usurper by marches conducted with such skill dexterity and spirit that he safely united his handful of horsemen with the body of highlanders then in arms after several months of desultory warfare in which wogans skill and courage gained him the highest reputation he had the misfortune to be wounded in a dangerous manner and no surgical assistance being within reach he terminated his short but glorious career  there were obvious reasons why the politic chieftain was desirous to place the example of this young hero under the eye of waverley with whose romantic disposition it coincided so peculiarly but his letter turned chiefly upon some trifling commissions which waverley had promised to execute for him in england and it was only toward the conclusion that edward found these words i owe flora a grudge for refusing us her company yesterday and as i am giving you the trouble of reading these lines in order to keep in your memory your promise to procure me the fishingtackle and crossbow from london i will enclose her verses on the grave of wogan this i know will tease her for to tell you the truth i think her more in love with the memory of that dead hero than she is likely to be with any living one unless he shall tread a similar path but english squires of our day keep their oaktrees to shelter their deer parks or repair the losses of an evening at whites and neither invoke them to wreathe their brows nor shelter their graves let me hope for one brilliant exception in a dear friend to whom i would most gladly give a dearer title  the verses were inscribed  to an oak tree  in the churchyard of  in

real merit of flora macivors poetry the enthusiasm which it intimated was well calculated to make a corresponding impression upon her lover the lines were readread again then deposited in waverleys bosom then again drawn out and read line by line in a low and smothered voice and with frequent pauses which prolonged the mental treat as an epicure protracts by sipping slowly the enjoyment of a delicious beverage the entrance of mrs cruickshanks with the sublunary articles of dinner and wine hardly interrupted this pantomime of affectionate enthusiasm  at length the tall ungainly figure and ungracious visage of ebenezer presented themselves the upper part of his form notwithstanding the season required no such defence was shrouded in a large greatcoat belted over his under habiliments and crested with a huge cowl of the same stuff which when drawn over the head and hat completely overshadowed both and being buttoned beneath the chin was called a trotcozy his hand grasped a huge jockeywhip garnished with brassmounting his thin legs tenanted a pair of gambadoes fastened at the sides with rusty clasps thus accoutred he stalked into the midst of the apartment and announced his errand in brief phrase yer horses are ready  you go with me yourself then landlord  i do as far as perth where ye may be supplied with a guide to embro as your occasions shall require  thus saying he placed under waverleys eye the bill which he held in his hand and at the same time selfinvited filled a glass of wine and drank devoutly to a blessing on their journey waverley stared at the mans impudence but as their connection was to be short and promised to be convenient he made no observation upon it and having paid his reckoning expressed his intention to depart immediately he mounted dermid accordingly and sallied forth from the golden candlestick followed by the puritanical figure we have described after he had at the expense of some time and difficulty and by the assistance of a loupingonstane or structure of masonry erected for the travellers convenience in front of the house elevated his person to the back of a longbacked rawboned thingutted phantom of a brokendown bloodhorse on which waverleys portmanteau was deposited our hero though not in a very gay humour could hardly help laughing at the appearance of his new squire and at imagining the astonishment which his person and equipage would have excited at waverleyhonour  edwards tendency to mirth did not escape mine host of the candlestick who conscious of the cause infused a double portion of souring into the pharisaical leaven of his countenance and resolved internally that in one way or other the young englisher should pay dearly for the contempt with which he seemed to regard him callum also stood at the gate and enjoyed with undissembled glee the ridiculous figure of mr cruickshanks as waverley passed him he pulled off his hat respectfully and approaching his stirrup bade him tak heed the auld whig deevil played him nae cantrip  waverley once more thanked and bade him farewell and then rode briskly onward not sorry to be out of hearing of the shouts of the children as they beheld old ebenezer rise and sink in his stirrups to avoid the concussions occasioned by a hard trot upon a halfpaved street the village ofwas soon several miles behind him           waverley  or  tis sixty years since   volume ii      chapter i  shows that the loss of a horses shoe may be a serious inconvenience   the manner and air of waverley but above all the glittering contents of his purse and the indifference with which he seemed to regard them somewhat overawed his companion and deterred him from making any attempts to enter upon conversation his own reflections were moreover agitated by various surmises and by plans of selfinterest with which these were intimately connected the travellers journeyed therefore in silence until it was interrupted by the annunciation on the part of the guide that his naig had lost a forefoot shoe which doubtless his honour would consider it was his part to replace  this was what lawyers call a fishing question calculated to ascertain how far waverley was disposed to submit to petty imposition my part to replace your horses shoe you rascal said waverley mistaking the purport of the intimation  indubitably answered mr cruickshanks though there was no preceese clause to that effect it canna be expected that i am to pay for the casualties whilk may befall the puir naig while in your honours service nathless if your honour  o you mean i am to pay the farrier but where shall we find one  rejoiced at discerning there would be no objection made on the part of his temporary master mr cruickshanks assured him that cairnvreckan a village which they were about to enter was happy in an excellent blacksmith but as he was a professor he would drive a nail for no man on the sabbath or kirkfast unless it were in a case of absolute necessity for which he always charged sixpence each shoe the most important part of this communication in the opinion of the speaker made a very slight impression on the hearer who only internally wondered what college this veterinary professor belonged to not aware that the word was used to denote any person who pretended to uncommon sanctity of faith and manner  as they entered the village of cairnvreckan they speedily distinguished the smiths house being also a public it was two stories high and proudly reared its crest covered with grey slate above the thatched hovels by which it was surrounded the adjoining smithy betokened none of the sabbatical silence and repose which ebenezer had augured from the sanctity of his friend on the contrary hammer clashed and anvil rang the bellows groaned and the whole apparatus of vulcan appeared to be in full activity nor was the labour of a rural and pacific nature the master smith benempt as his sign intimated john mucklewrath with two assistants toiled busily in arranging repairing and furbishing old muskets pistols and swords which lay scattered around his workshop in military confusion the open shed containing the forge was crowded with persons who came and went as if receiving and communicating important news and a single glance at the aspect of the people who traversed the street in haste or stood assembled in groups with eyes elevated and hands uplifted announced that some extraordinary intelligence was agitating the public mind of the municipality of cairnvreckan there is some news said mine host of the candlestick pushing his lanternjawed visage and bareboned nag rudely forward into the crowdthere is some news and if it please my creator i will forthwith obtain speirings thereof  waverley with better regulated curiosity than his attendants dismounted and gave his horse to a boy who stood idling near it arose perhaps from the shyness of his character in early youth that he felt dislike at applying to a stranger even for casual information without previously glancing at his physiognomy and appearance while he looked about in order to select the person with whom he would most willingly hold communication the buzz around saved him in some degree the trouble of interrogatories the names of lochiel clanronald glengarry and other distinguished highland chiefs among whom vich ian vohr was repeatedly mentioned were as familiar in mens mouths as household words and from the alarm generally expressed he easily conceived that their descent into the lowlands at the head of their armed tribes had either already taken place or was instantly apprehended  ere waverley could ask particulars a strong largeboned hardfeatured woman about forty dressed as if her clothes had been flung on with a pitchfork her cheeks flushed with a scarlet red where they were not smutted with soot and lampblack jostled through the crowd and brandishing high a child of two years old which she danced in her arms without regard to its screams of terror sang forth with all her might      charlie is my darling my darling my darling     charlie is my darling     the young chevalier  d ye hear whats come ower ye now continued the virago ye whingeing whig carles dye hear whas coming to cow yer cracks     little wot ye whas coming     little wot ye whas coming     a the wild macraws are coming the vulcan of cairnvreckan who acknowledged his venus in this exulting bacchante regarded her with a grim and ireforeboding countenance while some of the senators of the village hastened to interpose whisht gudewife is this a time or is this a day to be singing your ranting fule sangs ina time when the wine of wrath is poured out without mixture in the cup of indignation and a day when the land should give testimony against popery and prelacy and quakerism and independency and supremacy and erastianism and antinomianism and a the errors of the church  and thats a your whiggery reechoed the

upon a detail of personal experience interposed his matrimonial authority gae hame and be dthat i should say sae and put on the sowens for supper  and you ye doild dotard replied his gentle helpmate her wrath which had hitherto wandered abroad over the whole assembly being at once and violently impelled into its natural channel ye stand there hammering dogheads for fules that will never snap them at a highlandman instead of earning bread for your family and shoeing this winsome young gentlemans horse thats just come frae the north ise warrant him nane of your whingeing king george folk but a gallant gordon at the least o him  the eyes of the assembly were now turned upon waverley who took the opportunity to beg the smith to shoe his guides horse with all speed as he wished to proceed on his journey for he had heard enough to make him sensible that there would be danger in delaying long in this place the smiths eyes rested on him with a look of displeasure and suspicion not lessened by the eagerness with which his wife enforced waverleys mandate dye hear what the weelfavoured young gentleman says ye drunken neerdogood  and what may your name be sir quoth mucklewrath  it is of no consequence to you my friend provided i pay your labour  but it may be of consequence to the state sir replied an old farmer smelling strongly of whisky and peatsmoke and i doubt we maun delay your journey till you have seen the laird  you certainly said waverley haughtily will find it both difficult and dangerous to detain me unless you can produce some proper authority  there was a pause and a whisper among the crowdsecretary murraylord lewis gordonmaybe the chevalier himsell such were the surmises that passed hurriedly among them and there was obviously an increased disposition to resist waverleys departure he attempted to argue mildly with them but his voluntary ally mrs mucklewrath broke in upon and drowned his expostulations taking his part with an abusive violence which was all set down to edwards account by those on whom it was bestowed yell stop ony gentleman thats the princes freend for she too though with other feelings had adopted the general opinion respecting waverley i daur ye to touch him spreading abroad her long and muscular fingers garnished with claws which a vulture might have envied ill set my ten commandments in the face o the first loon that lays a finger on him  gae hame gudewife quoth the farmer aforesaid it wad better set you to be nursing the gudemans bairns than to be deaving us here  his bairns retorted the amazon regarding her husband with a grin of ineffable contempthis bairns      o gin ye were dead gudeman       and a green turf on your head gudeman     then i wad ware my widowhood       upon a ranting highlandman  this canticle which excited a suppressed titter among the younger part of the audience totally overcame the patience of the taunted man of the anvil deil be in me but ill put this het gad down her throat cried he in an ecstasy of wrath snatching a bar from the forge and he might have executed his threat had he not been withheld by a part of the mob while the rest endeavoured to force the termagant out of his presence  waverley meditated a retreat in the confusion but his horse was nowhere to be seen at length he observed at some distance his faithful attendant ebenezer who as soon as he had perceived the turn matters were likely to take had withdrawn both horses from the press and mounted on the one and holding the other answered the loud and repeated calls of waverley for his horse na na if ye are nae friend to kirk and the king and are detained as siccan a person ye maun answer to honest men of the country for breach of contract and i maun keep the naig and the walise for damage and expense in respect my horse and mysell will lose tomorrows days wark besides the afternoon preaching  edward out of patience hemmed in and hustled by the rabble on every side and every moment expecting personal violence resolved to try measures of intimidation and at length drew a pocketpistol threatening on the one hand to shoot whomsoever dared to stop him and on the other menacing ebenezer with a similar doom if he stirred a foot with the horses the sapient partridge says that one man with a pistol is equal to a hundred unarmed because though he can shoot but one of the multitude yet no one knows but that he himself may be that luckless individual the levy en masse of cairnvreckan would therefore probably have given way nor would ebenezer whose natural paleness had waxed three shades more cadaverous have ventured to dispute a mandate so enforced had not the vulcan of the village eager to discharge upon some more worthy object the fury which his helpmate had provoked and not ill satisfied to find such an object in waverley rushed at him with the redhot bar of iron with such determination as made the discharge of his pistol an act of selfdefence the unfortunate man fell and while edward thrilled with a natural horror at the incident neither had presence of mind to unsheathe his sword nor to draw his remaining pistol the populace threw themselves upon him disarmed him and were about to use him with great violence when the appearance of a venerable clergyman the pastor of the parish put a curb on their fury  this worthy man none of the goukthrapples or rentowels maintained his character with the common people although he preached the practical fruits of christian faith as well as its abstract tenets and was respected by the higher orders notwithstanding he declined soothing their speculative errors by converting the pulpit of the gospel into a school of heathen morality perhaps it is owing to this mixture of faith and practice in his doctrine that although his memory has formed a sort of era in the annals of cairnvreckan so that the parishioners to denote what befell sixty years since still say it happened in good mr mortons time i have never been able to discover which he belonged to the evangelical or the moderate party in the kirk nor do i hold the circumstance of much moment since in my own remembrance the one was headed by an erskine the other by a robertson  footnote the reverend john erskine d d an eminent scottish divine and a most excellent man headed the evangelical party in the church of scotland at the time when the celebrated doctor robertson the historian was the leader of the moderate party these two distinguished persons were colleagues in the old grey friars church edinburgh and however much they differed in church politics preserved the most perfect harmony as private friends and as clergymen serving the same cure  mr morton had been alarmed by the discharge of the pistol and the increasing hubbub around the smithy his first attention after he had directed the bystanders to detain waverley but to abstain from injuring him was turned to the body of mucklewrath over which his wife in a revulsion of feeling was weeping howling and tearing her elflocks in a state little short of distraction on raising up the smith the first discovery was that he was alive and the next that he was likely to live as long as if he had never heard the report of a pistol in his life he had made a narrow escape however the bullet had grazed his head and stunned him for a moment or two which trance terror and confusion of spirit had prolonged somewhat longer he now arose to demand vengeance on the person of waverley and with difficulty acquiesced in the proposal of mr morton that he should be carried before the laird as a justice of peace and placed at his disposal the rest of the assistants unanimously agreed to the measure recommended even mrs mucklewrath who had begun to recover from her hysterics whimpered forth she wadna say naething against what the minister proposed he was een ower gude for his trade and she hoped to see him wi a dainty decent bishops gown on his back a comelier sight than your geneva cloaks and bands i wis  all controversy being thus laid aside waverley escorted by the whole inhabitants of the village who were not bedridden was conducted to the house of cairnvreckan which was about half a mile distant     chapter ii  an examination   major melville of cairnvreckan an elderly gentleman who had spent his youth in the military service received mr morton with great kindness and our hero with civility which the equivocal circumstances wherein edward was placed rendered constrained and distant  the nature of the smiths hurt was inquired into and as the actual injury was likely to prove trifling and the circumstances in which it was received rendered the infliction on edwards part a natural act of selfdefence the major conceived he might dismiss that matter on waverleys depositing in his hands a small sum for the benefit of the wounded person  i could wish sir continued the major that my duty terminated here but it is necessary that we should have some further inquiry into the cause of your journey through the country at this unfortunate and distracted time  mr ebenezer cruickshanks now stood forth and communicated to the magistrate all he knew or suspected from the reserve of waverley and the evasions of callum beg the horse upon which edward rode he said he knew to belong to vich ian vohr though he dared not tax edwards former attendant with the fact lest he should have his house and stables burnt over his head some night by that godless gang the macivors he concluded by exaggerating his own services to kirk and state as having been the means under god as he modestly qualified the assertion of attaching this suspicious and formidable delinquent he intimated hopes of future reward and of instant reimbursement for loss of time and even of character by travelling on the state business on the fastday  to this major melville answered with great composure that so far from claiming any merit in this affair mr cruickshanks ought to deprecate the imposition of a very heavy fine for neglecting to lodge in terms of the recent proclamation an account with the nearest magistrate of any stranger who came to his inn that as mr cruickshanks boasted so much of religion and loyalty he should not impute this conduct to disaffection but only suppose that his zeal for kirk and state had been lulled asleep by the opportunity of charging a stranger with double horsehire that however feeling himself incompetent to decide singly upon the conduct of a person of such importance he should reserve it for consideration of the next quartersessions now our history for the present saith no more of him of the candlestick who wended dolorous and malcontent back to his own dwelling  major melville then commanded the villagers to return to their homes excepting two who officiated as constables and whom he directed to wait below the apartment was thus cleared of every person but mr morton whom the major invited to remain a sort of factor who acted as clerk and waverley himself there ensued a painful and embarrassed pause till major melville looking upon waverley with much compassion and often consulting a paper or memorandum which he held in his hand requested to know his name  edward waverley  i thought so late of thedragoons and nephew of sir everard waverley of waverleyhonour  the same  young gentleman i am extremely sorry that this painful duty has fallen to my lot  duty major melville renders apologies superfluous  true sir permit me therefore to ask you how your time has been disposed of since you obtained leave of absence from your regiment several weeks ago until the present moment  my reply said waverley to so general a question must be guided by the nature of the charge which renders it necessary i request to know what that charge is and upon what authority i am forcibly detained to reply to it  the charge mr waverley i grieve to say is of a very high nature and affects your character both as a soldier and a subject in the former capacity you are charged with spreading mutiny and rebellion among the men you commanded and setting them the example of desertion by prolonging your own absence from the regiment contrary to the express orders of your commanding officer the civil crime of which you stand accused is that of high treason and levying war against the king the highest delinquency of which a subject can be guilty  and by what authority am i detained to reply to such heinous calumnies  by one which you must not dispute nor i disobey  he handed to waverley a warrant from the supreme criminal court of scotland in full form for apprehending and securing the person of edward waverley esq suspected of treasonable practices and other high crimes and misdemeanours  the astonishment which waverley expressed at this communication was imputed by major melville to conscious guilt while mr morton was rather disposed to construe it into the surprise of innocence unjustly suspected there was something true in both conjectures for although edwards mind acquitted him of the crime with which he was charged yet a hasty review of his own conduct convinced him he might have great difficulty in establishing his innocence to the satisfaction of others  it is a very painful part of this painful business said major melville after a pause that under so grave a charge i must necessarily request to see such papers as you have on your person  you shall sir without reserve said edward throwing his pocketbook and memorandums upon the table there is but one with which i could wish you would dispense  i am afraid mr waverley i can indulge you with no reservation  you shall see it then sir and as it can be of no service i beg it may be returned  he took from his bosom the lines he had that morning received and presented them with the envelope the major perused them in silence and directed his clerk to make a copy of them he then wrapped the copy in the envelope and placing it on the table before him returned the original to waverley with an air of melancholy gravity  after indulging the prisoner for such our hero must now be considered with what he thought a reasonable time for reflection major melville resumed his examination premising that as mr waverley seemed to object to general questions his interrogatories should be as specific as his information permitted he then proceeded in his investigation dictating as he went on the import of the questions and answers to the amanuensis by whom it was written down  did mr waverley know one humphry houghton a noncommissioned officer in gardiners dragoons  certainly he was sergeant of my troop and son of a tenant of my uncle  exactlyand had a considerable share of your confidence and an influence among his comrades  i had never occasion to repose confidence in a person of his description answered waverley i favoured sergeant houghton as a clever active young fellow and i believe his fellowsoldiers respected him accordingly  but you used through this man answered major melville to communicate with such of your troop as were recruited upon waverleyhonour  certainly the poor fellows finding themselves in a regiment chiefly composed of scotch or irish looked up to me in any of their little distresses and naturally made their countryman and sergeant their spokesman on such occasions  sergeant houghtons influence continued the major extended then particularly over those soldiers who followed you to the regiment from your uncles estate  surely but what is that to the present purpose  to that i am just coming and i beseech your candid reply have you since leaving the regiment held any correspondence direct or indirect with this sergeant houghton  ii hold correspondence with a man of his rank and situation how or for what purpose  that you are to explain but did you not for example send to him for some books  you remind me of a trifling commission said waverley which i gave sergeant houghton because my servant could not read i do recollect i bade him by letter select some books of which i sent him a list and send them to me at tullyveolan  and of what description were those books  they related almost entirely to elegant literature they were designed for a ladys perusal  were there not mr waverley treasonable tracts and pamphlets among them  there were some political treatises into which i hardly looked they had been sent to me by the officiousness of a kind friend whose heart is more to be esteemed than his prudence or political sagacity they seemed to be dull compositions  that friend continued the persevering inquirer was a mr pembroke a nonjuring clergyman the author of two treasonable works of which the manuscripts were found among your baggage  but of which i give you my honour as a gentleman replied waverley i never read six pages  i am not your judge mr waverley your examination will be transmitted elsewhere and now to proceed do you know a person that passes by the name of wily will or will ruthven  i never heard of such a name till this moment  did you never through such a person or any other person communicate with sergeant humphry houghton instigating him to desert with as many of his comrades as he could seduce to join him and unite with the highlanders and other rebels now in arms under the command of the young pretender  i assure you i am not only entirely guiltless of the plot you have laid to my charge but i detest it from the very bottom of my soul nor would i be guilty of such treachery to gain a throne either for myself or any other man alive  yet when i consider this envelope in the handwriting of one of those misguided gentlemen who are now in arms against their country and the verses which it enclosed i cannot but find some analogy between the enterprise i have mentioned and the exploit of wogan which the writer seems to expect you should imitate  waverley was struck with the coincidence but denied that the wishes or expectations of the letterwriter were to be regarded as proofs of a charge otherwise chimerical  but if i am rightly informed your time was spent during your absence from the regiment between the house of this highland chieftain and that of mr bradwardine of bradwardine also in arms for this unfortunate cause  i do not mean to disguise it but i do deny most resolutely being privy to any of their designs against the government  you do not however i presume intend to deny that you attended your host glennaquoich to a rendezvous where under a pretence of a general hunting match most of the accomplices of his treason were assembled to concert measures for taking arms  i acknowledge having been at such a meeting said waverley but i neither heard nor saw anything which could give it the character you affix to it  from thence you proceeded continued the magistrate with glennaquoich and a part of his clan to join the army of the young pretender and returned after having paid your homage to him to discipline and arm the remainder and unite them to his bands on their way southward  i never went with glennaquoich on such an errand i never so much as heard that the person whom you mention was in the country  he then detailed the history of his misfortune at the hunting match and added that on his return he found himself suddenly deprived of his commission and did not deny that he then for the first time observed symptoms which indicated a disposition in the highlanders to take arms but added that having no inclination to join their cause and no longer any reason for remaining in scotland he was now on his return to his native country to which he had been summoned by those who had a right to direct his motions as major melville would perceive from the letters on the table  major melville accordingly perused the letters of richard waverley of sir everard and of aunt rachel but the inferences he drew from them were different from what waverley expected they held the language of discontent with government threw out no obscure hints of revenge and that of poor aunt rachel which plainly asserted the justice of the stuart cause was held to contain the open avowal of what the others only ventured to insinuate  permit me another question mr waverley said major melville did you not receive repeated letters from your commanding officer warning you and commanding you to return to your post and acquainting you with the use made of your name to spread discontent among your soldiers  i never did major melville one letter indeed i received from him containing a civil intimation of his wish that i would employ my leave of absence otherwise than in constant residence at bradwardine as to which i own i thought he was not called on to interfere and finally i received on the same day on which i observed myself superseded in the gazette a second letter from colonel gardiner commanding me to join the regiment an order which owing to my absence already mentioned and accounted for i received too late to be obeyed if there were any intermediate letters and certainly from the colonels high character i think it probable that there were they have never reached me  i have omitted mr waverley continued major melville to inquire after a matter of less consequence but which has nevertheless been publicly talked of to your disadvantage it is said that a treasonable toast having been proposed in your hearing and presence you holding his majestys commission suffered the task of resenting it to devolve upon another gentleman of the company this sir cannot be charged against you in a court of justice but if as i am informed the officers of your regiment requested an explanation of such a rumour as a gentleman and soldier i cannot but be surprised that you did not afford it to them  this was too much beset and pressed on every hand by accusations in which gross falsehoods were blended with such circumstances of truth as could not fail to procure them creditalone unfriended and in a strange land waverley almost gave up his life and honour for lost and leaning his head upon his hand resolutely refused to answer any further questions since the fair and candid statement he had already made had only served to furnish arms against him  without expressing either surprise or displeasure at the change in waverleys manner major melville proceeded composedly to put several other queries to him  what does it avail me to answer you said edward sullenly you appear convinced of my guilt and wrest every reply i have made to support your own preconceived opinion enjoy your supposed triumph then and torment me no further if i am capable of the cowardice and treachery your charge burdens me with i am not worthy to be believed in any reply i can make to you if i am not deserving of your suspicionand god and my own conscience bear evidence with me that it is sothen i do not see why i should by my candour lend my accusers arms against my innocence there is no reason i should answer a word more and i am determined to abide by this resolution  and again he resumed his posture of sullen and determined silence  allow me said the magistrate to remind you of one reason that may suggest the propriety of a candid and open confession the inexperience of youth mr waverley lays it open to the plans of the more designing and artful and one of your friends at leasti mean macivor of glennaquoichranks high in the latter class as from your apparent ingenuousness youth and unacquaintance with the manners of the highlands i should be disposed to place you among the former in such a case a false step or error like yours which i shall be happy to consider as involuntary may be atoned for and i would willingly act as intercessor but as you must necessarily be acquainted with the strength of the individuals in this country who have assumed arms with their means and with their plans i must expect you will merit this mediation on my part by a frank and candid avowal of all that has come to your knowledge upon these heads in which case i think i can venture to promise that a very short personal restraint will be the only ill consequence that can arise from your accession to these unhappy intrigues  waverley listened with great composure until the end of this exhortation when springing from his seat with an energy he had not yet displayed he replied major melville since that is your name i have hitherto answered your questions with candour or declined them with temper because their import concerned myself alone but as you presume to esteem me mean enough to commence informer against others who received me whatever may be their public misconduct as a guest and friend i declare to you that i consider your questions as an insult infinitely more offensive than your calumnious suspicions and that since my hard fortune permits me no other mode of resenting them than by verbal defiance you should sooner have my heart out of my bosom than a single syllable of information on subjects which i could only become acquainted with in the full confidence of unsuspecting hospitality  mr morton and the major looked at each other and the former who in the course of the examination had been repeatedly troubled with a sorry rheum had recourse to his snuffbox and his handkerchief  mr waverley said the major my present situation prohibits me alike from giving or receiving offence and i will not protract a discussion which approaches to either i am afraid i must sign a warrant for detaining you in custody but this house shall for the present be your prison i fear i cannot persuade you to accept a share of our supperedward shook his headbut i will order refreshments in your apartment  our hero bowed and withdrew under guard of the officers of justice to a small but handsome room where declining all offers of food or wine he flung himself on the bed and stupified by the harassing events and mental fatigue of this miserable day he sunk into a deep and heavy slumber this was more than he himself could have expected but it is mentioned of the northamerican indians when at the stake of torture that on the least intermission of agony they will sleep until the fire is applied to awaken them     chapter iii  a conference and the consequence   major melville had detained mr morton during his examination of waverley both because he thought he might derive assistance from his practical good sense and approved loyalty and also because it was agreeable to have a witness of unimpeached candour and veracity to proceedings which touched the honour and safety of a young englishman of high rank and family and the expectant heir of a large fortune every step he knew would be rigorously canvassed and it was his business to place the justice and integrity of his own conduct beyond the limits of question  when waverley retired the laird and clergyman of cairnvreckan sat down in silence to their evening meal while the servants were in attendance neither chose to say anything on the circumstances which occupied their minds and neither felt it easy to speak upon any other the youth and apparent frankness of waverley stood in strong contrast to the shades of suspicion which darkened around him and he had a sort of naivete and openness of demeanour that seemed to belong to one unhackneyed in the ways of intrigue and which pleaded highly in his favour  each mused over the particulars of the examination and each viewed it through the medium of his own feelings both were men of ready and acute talent and both were equally competent to combine various parts of evidence and to deduce from them the necessary conclusions but the wide difference of their habits and education often occasioned a great discrepancy in their respective deductions from admitted premises  major melville had been versed in camps and cities he was  vigilant by profession and cautious from experience had met with much evil in the world and therefore though himself an upright magistrate and an honourable man his opinions of others were always strict and sometimes unjustly severe mr morton on the contrary had passed from the literary pursuits of a college where he was beloved by his companions and respected by his teachers to the ease and simplicity of his present charge where his opportunities of witnessing evil were few and never dwelt upon but in order to encourage repentance and amendment and where the love and respect of his parishioners repaid his affectionate zeal in their behalf by endeavouring to disguise from him what they knew would give him the most acute pain namely their own occasional transgressions of the duties which it was the business of his life to recommend thus it was a common saying in the neighbourhood though both were popular characters that the laird knew only the ill in the parish and the minister only the good  a love of letters though kept in subordination to his clerical studies and duties also distinguished the pastor of cairnvreckan and had tinged his mind in earlier days with a slight feeling of romance which no after incidents of real life had entirely dissipated the early loss of an amiable young woman whom he had married for love and who was quickly followed to the grave by an only child had also served even after the lapse of many years to soften a disposition naturally mild and contemplative his feelings on the present occasion were therefore likely to differ from those of the severe disciplinarian strict magistrate and distrustful man of the world  when the servants had withdrawn the silence of both parties continued until major melville filling his glass and pushing the bottle to mr morton commenced  a distressing affair this mr morton i fear this youngster has brought himself within the compass of a halter  god forbid answered the clergyman  marry and amen said the temporal magistrate but i think even your merciful logic will hardly deny the conclusion  surely major answered the clergyman i should hope it might be averted for aught we have heard tonight  indeed replied melville but my good parson you are one of those who would communicate to every criminal the benefit of clergy  unquestionably i would mercy and longsuffering are the grounds of the doctrine i am called to teach  true religiously speaking but mercy to a criminal may be gross injustice to the community i dont speak of this young fellow in particular who i heartily wish may be able to clear himself for i like both his modesty and his spirit but i fear he has rushed upon his fate  and why hundreds of misguided gentlemen are now in arms against the government many doubtless upon principles which education and early prejudice have gilded with the names of patriotism and heroism justice when she selects her victims from such a multitude for surely all will not be destroyed must regard the moral motive he whom ambition or hope of personal advantage has led to disturb the peace of a wellordered government let him fall a victim to the laws but surely youth misled by the wild visions of chivalry and imaginary loyalty may plead for pardon  if visionary chivalry and imaginary loyalty come within the predicament of high treason replied the magistrate i know no court in christendom my dear mr morton where they can sue out their habeas corpus  but i cannot see that this youths guilt is at all established to my satisfaction said the clergyman  because your goodnature blinds your good sense replied major melville observe now this young man descended of a family of hereditary jacobites his uncle the leader of the tory interest in the county of  his father a disobliged and discontented courtier his tutor a nonjuror and the author of two treasonable volumesthis youth i say enters into gardiners dragoons bringing with him a body of young fellows from his uncles estate who have not stickled at avowing in their way the highchurch principles they learned at waverleyhonour in their disputes with their comrades to these young men waverley is unusually attentive they are supplied with money beyond a soldiers wants and inconsistent with his discipline and are under the management of a favourite sergeant through whom they hold an unusually close communication with their captain and affect to consider themselves as independent of the other officers and superior to their comrades  all this my dear major is the natural consequence of their attachment to their young landlord and of their finding themselves in a regiment levied chiefly in the north of ireland and the west of scotland and of course among comrades disposed to quarrel with them both as englishmen and as members of the church of england  well said parson replied the magistrate i would some of your synod heard you but let me go on this young man obtains leave of absence goes to tullyveolanthe principles of the baron of bradwardine are pretty well known not to mention that this lads uncle brought him off in the year fifteen he engages there in a brawl in which he is said to have disgraced the commission he bore colonel gardiner writes to him first mildly then more sharplyi think you will not doubt his having done so since he says so the mess invite him to explain the quarrel in which he is said to have been involved he neither replies to his commander nor his comrades in the meanwhile his soldiers become mutinous and disorderly and at length when the rumour of this unhappy rebellion becomes general his favourite sergeant houghton and another fellow are detected in correspondence with a french emissary accredited as he says by captain waverley who urges him according to the mens confession to desert with the troop and join their captain who was with prince charles in the meanwhile this trusty captain is by his own admission residing at glennaquoich with the most active subtle and desperate jacobite in scotland he goes with him at least as far as their famous hunting rendezvous and i fear a little farther meanwhile two other summonses are sent him one warning him of the disturbances in his troop another peremptorily ordering him to repair to the regiment which indeed common sense might have dictated when he observed rebellion thickening all round him he returns an absolute refusal and throws up his commission  he had been already deprived of it said mr morton  but he regrets replied melville that the measure had anticipated his resignation his baggage is seized at his quarters and at tullyveolan and is found to contain a stock of pestilent jacobitical pamphlets enough to poison a whole country besides the unprinted lucubrations of his worthy friend and tutor mr pembroke  he says he never read them answered the minister  in an ordinary case i should believe him replied the magistrate for they are as stupid and pedantic in composition as mischievous in their tenets but can you suppose anything but value for the principles they maintain would induce a young man of his age to lug such trash about with him then when news arrive of the approach of the rebels he sets out in a sort of disguise refusing to tell his name and if yon old fanatic tell truth attended by a very suspicious character and mounted on a horse known to have belonged to glennaquoich and bearing on his person letters from his family expressing high rancour against the house of brunswick and a copy of verses in praise of one wogan who abjured the service of the parliament to join the highland insurgents when in arms to restore the house of stuart with a body of english cavalrythe very counterpart of his own plotand summed up with a go thou and do likewise from that loyal subject and most safe and peaceable character fergus macivor of glennaquoich vich ian vohr and so forth and lastly continued major melville warming in the detail of his arguments where do we find this second edition of cavalier wogan why truly in the very track most proper for execution of his design and pistolling the first of the kings subjects who ventures to question his intentions  mr morton prudently abstained from argument which he perceived would only harden the magistrate in his opinion and merely asked how he intended to dispose of the prisoner  it is a question of some difficulty considering the state of the country said major melville  could you not detain him being such a gentlemanlike young man here in your own house out of harms way till this storm blow over  my good friend said major melville neither your house nor mine will be long out of harms way even were it legal to confine him here i have just learned that the commanderinchief who marched into the highlands to seek out and disperse the insurgents has declined giving them battle at coryarrick and marched on northward with all the disposable force of government to inverness johnogroats house or the devil for what i know leaving the road to the low country open and undefended to the highland army  good god said the clergyman is the man a coward a traitor or an idiot  none of the three i believe answered melville sir john has the commonplace courage of a common soldier is honest enough does what he is commanded and understands what is told him but is as fit to act for himself in circumstances of importance as i my dear parson to occupy your pulpit  this important public intelligence naturally diverted the discourse from waverley for some time at length however the subject was resumed  i believe said major melville that i must give this young man in charge to some of the detached parties of armed volunteers who were lately sent out to overawe the disaffected districts they are now recalled towards stirling and a small body comes this way tomorrow or next day commanded by the westland manwhats his name you saw him and said he was the very model of one of cromwells military saints  gilfillan the cameronian answered mr morton i wish the young gentleman may be safe with him strange things are done in the heat and hurry of minds in so agitating a crisis and i fear gilfillan is of a sect which has suffered persecution without learning mercy  he has only to lodge mr waverley in stirling castle said the major i will give strict injunctions to treat him well i really cannot devise any better mode for securing him and i fancy you would hardly advise me to encounter the responsibility of setting him at liberty  but you will have no objection to my seeing him tomorrow in private said the minister  none certainly your loyalty and character are my warrant but with what view do you make the request  simply replied mr morton to make the experiment whether he may not be brought to communicate to me some circumstances which may hereafter be useful to alleviate if not to exculpate his conduct  the friends now parted and retired to rest each filled with the most anxious reflections on the state of the country     chapter iv  a confidant   waverley awoke in the morning from troubled dreams and unrefreshing slumbers to a full consciousness of the horrors of his situation how it might terminate he knew not he might be delivered up to military law which in the midst of civil war was not likely to be scrupulous in the choice of its victims or the quality of the evidence nor did he feel much more comfortable at the thoughts of a trial before a scottish court of justice where he knew the laws and forms differed in many respects from those of england and had been taught to believe however erroneously that the liberty and rights of the subject were less carefully protected a sentiment of bitterness rose in his mind against the government which he considered as the cause of his embarrassment and peril and he cursed internally his scrupulous rejection of macivors invitation to accompany him to the field  why did not i he said to himself like other men of honour take the earliest opportunity to welcome to britain the descendant of her ancient kings and lineal heir of her throne why did not i      unthread the rude eye of rebellion     and welcome home again discarded faith     seek out prince charles and fall before his feet  all that has been recorded of excellence and worth in the house of waverley has been founded upon their loyal faith to the house of stuart from the interpretation which this scotch magistrate has put upon the letters of my uncle and father it is plain that i ought to have understood them as marshalling me to the course of my ancestors and it has been my gross dulness joined to the obscurity of expression which they adopted for the sake of security that has confounded my judgment had i yielded to the first generous impulse of indignation when i learned that my honour was practised upon how different had been my present situation i had then been free and in arms fighting like my forefathers for love for loyalty and for fame and now i am here netted and in the toils at the disposal of a suspicious stern and coldhearted man perhaps to be turned over to the solitude of a dungeon or the infamy of a public execution o fergus how true has your prophecy proved and how speedy how very speedy has been its accomplishment  while edward was ruminating on these painful subjects of contemplation and very naturally though not quite so justly bestowing upon the reigning dynasty that blame which was due to chance or in part at least to his own unreflecting conduct mr morton availed himself of major melvilles permission to pay him an early visit  waverleys first impulse was to intimate a desire that he might not be disturbed with questions or conversation but he suppressed it upon observing the benevolent and reverend appearance of the clergyman who had rescued him from the immediate violence of the villagers  i believe sir said the unfortunate young manthat in any other circumstances i should have had as much gratitude to express to you as the safety of my life may be worth but such is the present tumult of my mind and such is my anticipation of what i am yet likely to endure that i can hardly offer you thanks for your interposition  mr morton replied that far from making any claim upon his good opinion his only wish and the sole purpose of his visit was to find out the means of deserving it my excellent friend major melville he continued has feelings and duties as a soldier and public functionary by which i am not fettered nor can i always coincide in opinions which he forms perhaps with too little allowance for the imperfections of human nature he paused and then proceeded i do not intrude myself on your confidence mr waverley for the purpose of learning any circumstances the knowledge of which can be prejudicial either to yourself or to others but i own my earnest wish is that you would intrust me with any particulars which could lead to your exculpation i can solemnly assure you they will be deposited with a faithful and to the extent of his limited powers a zealous agent  you are sir i presume a presbyterian clergyman mr morton bowed were i to be guided by the prepossessions of education i might distrust your friendly professions in my case but i have observed that similar prejudices are nourished in this country against your professional brethren of the episcopal persuasion and i am willing to believe them equally unfounded in both cases  evil to him that thinks otherwise said mr morton or who holds church government and ceremonies as the exclusive gage of christian faith or moral virtue  but continued waverley i cannot perceive why i should trouble you with a detail of particulars out of which after revolving them as carefully as possible in my recollection i find myself unable to explain much of what is charged against me i know indeed that i am innocent but i hardly see how i can hope to prove myself so  it is for that very reason mr waverley said the clergyman that i venture to solicit your confidence my knowledge of individuals in this country is pretty general and can upon occasion be extended your situation will i fear preclude your taking those active steps for recovering intelligence or tracing imposture which i would willingly undertake in your behalf and if you are not benefited by my exertions at least they cannot be prejudicial to you  waverley after a few minutes reflection was convinced that his reposing confidence in mr morton so far as he himself was concerned could hurt neither mr bradwardine nor fergus macivor both of whom had openly assumed arms against the government and that it might possibly if the professions of his new friend corresponded in sincerity with the earnestness of his expression be of some service to himself he therefore ran briefly over most of the events with which the reader is already acquainted suppressing his attachment to flora and indeed neither mentioning her nor rose bradwardine in the course of his narrative  mr morton seemed particularly struck with the account of waverleys visit to donald bean lean i am glad he said you did not mention this circumstance to the major it is capable of great misconstruction on the part of those who do not consider the power of curiosity and the influence of romance as motives of youthful conduct when i was a young man like you mr waverley any such hairbrained expedition i beg your pardon for the expression would have had inexpressible charms for me but there are men in the world who will not believe that danger and fatigue are often incurred without any very adequate cause and therefore who are sometimes led to assign motives of action entirely foreign to the truth this man bean lean is renowned through the country as a sort of robin hood and the stories which are told of his address and enterprise are the common tales of the winter fireside he certainly possesses talents beyond the rude sphere in which he moves and being neither destitute of ambition nor encumbered with scruples he will probably attempt by every means to distinguish himself during the period of these unhappy commotions mr morton then made a careful memorandum of the various particulars of waverleys interview with donald bean lean and the other circumstances which he had communicated  the interest which this good man seemed to take in his misfortunes above all the full confidence he appeared to repose in his innocence had the natural effect of softening edwards heart whom the coldness of major melville had taught to believe that the world was leagued to oppress him he shook mr morton warmly by the hand and assuring him that his kindness and sympathy had relieved his mind of a heavy load told him that whatever might be his own fate he belonged to a family who had both gratitude and the power of displaying it the earnestness of his thanks called drops to the eyes of the worthy clergyman who was doubly interested in the cause for which he had volunteered his services by observing the genuine and undissembled feelings of his young friend  edward now inquired if mr morton knew what was likely to be his destination  stirling castle replied his friend and so far i am well pleased for your sake for the governor is a man of honour and humanity but i am more doubtful of your treatment upon the road major melville is involuntarily obliged to intrust the custody of your person to another  i am glad of it answered waverley i detest that coldblooded calculating scotch magistrate i hope he and i shall never meet more he had neither sympathy with my innocence nor with my wretchedness and the petrifying accuracy with which he attended to every form of civility while he tortured me by his questions his suspicions and his inferences was as tormenting as the racks of the inquisition do not vindicate him my dear sir for that i cannot bear with patience tell me rather who is to have the charge of so important a state prisoner as i am  i believe a person called gilfillan one of the sect who are termed cameronians  i never heard of them before  they claim said the clergyman to represent the more strict and severe presbyterians who in charles seconds and james seconds days refused to profit by the toleration or indulgence as it was called which was extended to others of that religion they held conventicles in the open fields and being treated with great violence and cruelty by the scottish government more than once took arms during those reigns they take their name from their leader richard cameron  i recollect said waverley but did not the triumph of presbytery at the revolution extinguish that sect  by no means replied morton that great event fell yet far short of what they proposed which was nothing less than the complete establishment of the presbyterian church upon the grounds of the old solemn league and covenant indeed i believe they scarce knew what they wanted but being a numerous body of men and not unacquainted with the use of arms they kept themselves together as a separate party in the state and at the time of the union had nearly formed a most unnatural league with their old enemies the jacobites to oppose that important national measure since that time their numbers have gradually diminished but a good many are still to be found in the western counties and several with a better temper than in 1707 have now taken arms for government this person whom they call gifted gilfillan has been long a leader among them and now heads a small party which will pass here today or tomorrow on their march towards stirling under whose escort major melville proposes you shall travel i would willingly speak to gilfillan in your behalf but having deeply imbibed all the prejudices of his sect and being of the same fierce disposition he would pay little regard to the remonstrances of an erastian divine as he would politely term me and now farewell my young friend for the present i must not weary out the majors indulgence that i may obtain his permission to visit you again in the course of the day     chapter v  things mend a little   about noon mr morton returned and brought an invitation from major melville that mr waverley would honour him with his company to dinner notwithstanding the unpleasant affair which detained him at cairnvreckan from which he should heartily rejoice to see mr waverley completely extricated the truth was that mr mortons favourable report and opinion had somewhat staggered the preconceptions of the old soldier concerning edwards supposed accession to the mutiny in the regiment and in the unfortunate state of the country the mere suspicion of disaffection or an inclination to join the insurgent jacobites might infer criminality indeed but certainly not dishonour besides a person whom the major trusted had reported to him though as it proved inaccurately a contradiction of the agitating news of the preceding evening according to this second edition of the intelligence the highlanders had withdrawn from the lowland frontier with the purpose of following the army in their march to inverness the major was at a loss indeed to reconcile his information with the wellknown abilities of some of the gentlemen in the highland army yet it was the course which was likely to be most agreeable to others he remembered the same policy had detained them in the north in the year 1715 and he anticipated a similar termination to the insurrection as upon that occasion  this news put him in such goodhumour that he readily acquiesced in mr mortons proposal to pay some hospitable attention to his unfortunate guest and voluntarily added he hoped the whole affair would prove a youthful escapade which might be easily atoned by a short confinement the kind mediator had some trouble to prevail on his young friend to accept the invitation he dared not urge to him the real motive which was a goodnatured wish to secure a favourable report of waverleys case from major melville to governor blakeney he remarked from the flashes of our heros spirit that touching upon this topic would be sure to defeat his purpose he therefore pleaded that the invitation argued the majors disbelief of any part of the accusation which was inconsistent with waverleys conduct as a soldier and a man of honour and that to decline his courtesy might be interpreted into a consciousness that it was unmerited in short he so far satisfied edward that the manly and proper course was to meet the major on easy terms that suppressing his strong dislike again to encounter his cold and punctilious civility waverley agreed to be guided by his new friend  the meeting at first was stiff and formal enough but edward having accepted the invitation and his mind being really soothed and relieved by the kindness of morton held himself bound to behave with ease though he could not affect cordiality the major was somewhat of a bon vivant and his wine was excellent he told his old campaign stories and displayed much knowledge of men and manners mr morton had an internal fund of placid and quiet gaiety which seldom failed to enliven any small party in which he found himself pleasantly seated waverley whose life was a dream gave ready way to the predominating impulse and became the most lively of the party he had at all times remarkable natural powers of conversation though easily silenced by discouragement on the present occasion he piqued himself upon leaving on the minds of his companions a favourable impression of one who under such disastrous circumstances could sustain his misfortunes with ease and gaiety his spirits though not unyielding were abundantly elastic and soon seconded his efforts the trio were engaged in very lively discourse apparently delighted with each other and the kind host was pressing a third bottle of burgundy when the sound of a drum was heard at some distance the major who in the glee of an old soldier had forgot the duties of a magistrate cursed with a muttered military oath the circumstances which recalled him to his official functions he rose and went towards the window which commanded a very near view of the highroad and he was followed by his guests  the drum advanced beating no measured martial tune but a kind of rubadubdub like that with which the firedrum startles the slumbering artizans of a scotch burgh it is the object of this history to do justice to all men i must therefore record in justice to the drummer that he protested he could beat any known march or point of war known in the british army and had accordingly commenced with dumbartons drums when he was silenced by gifted gilfillan the commander of the party who refused to permit his followers to move to this profane and even as he said persecutive tune and commanded the drummer to beat the 119th psalm as this was beyond the capacity of the drubber of sheepskin he was fain to have recourse to the inoffensive rowdedow as a harmless substitute for the sacred music which his instrument or skill were unable to achieve this may be held a trifling anecdote but the drummer in question was no less than towndrummer of anderton i remember his successor in office a member of that enlightened body the british convention be his memory therefore treated with due respect     chapter vi  a volunteer sixty years since   on hearing the unwelcome sound of the drum major melville hastily opened a sashed door and stepped out upon a sort of terrace which divided his house from the highroad from which the martial music proceeded waverley and his new friend followed him though probably he would have dispensed with their attendance they soon recognised in solemn march first the performer upon the drum secondly a large flag of four compartments on which were inscribed the words covenant kirk king kingdoms the person who was honoured with this charge was followed by the commander of the party a thin dark rigidlooking man about sixty years old the spiritual pride which in mine host of the candlestick mantled in a sort of supercilious hypocrisy was in this mans face elevated and yet darkened by genuine and undoubting fanaticism it was impossible to behold him without imagination placing him in some strange crisis where religious zeal was the ruling principle a martyr at the stake a soldier in the field a lonely and banished wanderer consoled by the intensity and supposed purity of his faith under every earthly privation perhaps a persecuting inquisitor as terrific in power as unyielding in adversity any of these seemed congenial characters to this personage with these high traits of energy there was something in the affected precision and solemnity of his deportment and discourse that bordered upon the ludicrous so that according to the mood of the spectators mind and the light under which mr gilfillan presented himself one might have feared admired or laughed at him his dress was that of a westcountry peasant of better materials indeed than that of the lower rank but in no respect affecting either the mode of the age or of the scottish gentry at any period his arms were a broadsword and pistols which from the antiquity of their appearance might have seen the rout of pentland or bothwell brigg  as he came up a few steps to meet major melville and touched solemnly but slightly his huge and overbrimmed blue bonnet in answer to the major who had courteously raised a small triangular goldlaced hat waverley was irresistibly impressed with the idea that he beheld a leader of the roundheads of yore in conference with one of marlboroughs captains  the group of about thirty armed men who followed this gifted commander was of a motley description they were in ordinary lowland dresses of different colours which contrasted with the arms they bore gave them an irregular and mobbish appearance so much is the eye accustomed to connect uniformity of dress with the military character in front were a few who apparently partook of their leaders enthusiasm men obviously to be feared in a combat where their natural courage was exalted by religious zeal others puffed and strutted filled with the importance of carrying arms and all the novelty of their situation while the rest apparently fatigued with their march dragged their limbs listlessly along or straggled from their companions to procure such refreshments as the neighbouring cottages and alehouses afforded six grenadiers of ligoniers thought the major to himself as his mind reverted to his own military experience would have sent all these fellows to the right about  greeting however mr gilfillan civilly he requested to know if he had received the letter he had sent to him upon his march and could undertake the charge of the state prisoner whom he there mentioned as far as stirling castle yea was the concise reply of the cameronian leader in a voice which seemed to issue from the very penetralia of his person  but your escort mr gilfillan is not so strong as i expected said major melville  some of the people replied gilfillan hungered and were athirst by the way and tarried until their poor souls were refreshed with the word  i am sorry sir replied the major you did not trust to your refreshing your men at cairnvreckan whatever my house contains is at the command of persons employed in the service  it was not of creaturecomforts i spake answered the covenanter regarding major melville with something like a smile of contempt howbeit i thank you but the people remained waiting upon the precious mr jabesh rentowel for the outpouring of the afternoon exhortation  and have you sir said the major when the rebels are about to spread themselves through this country actually left a great part of your command at a fieldpreaching  gilfillan again smiled scornfully as he made this indirect answereven thus are the children of this world wiser in their generation than the children of light  however sir said the major as you are to take charge of this gentleman to stirling and deliver him with these papers into the hands of governor blakeney i beseech you to observe some rules of military discipline upon your march for example i would advise you to keep your men more closely together and that each in his march should cover his fileleader instead of straggling like geese upon a common and for fear of surprise i further recommend to you to form a small advanceparty of your best men with a single vidette in front of the whole march so that when you approach a village or a woodhere the major interrupted himselfbut as i dont observe you listen to me mr gilfillan i suppose i need not give myself the trouble to say more upon the subject you are a better judge unquestionably than i am of the measures to be pursued but one thing i would have you well aware of that you are to treat this gentleman your prisoner with no rigour nor incivility and are to subject him to no other restraint than is necessary for his security  i have looked into my commission said mr gilfillan subscribed by a worthy and professing nobleman william earl of glencairn nor do i find it therein set down that i am to receive any charges or commands anent my doings from major william melville of cairnvreckan  major melville reddened even to the wellpowdered ears which appeared beneath his neat military sidecurls the more so as he observed mr morton smile at the same moment mr gilfillan he answered with some asperity i beg ten thousand pardons for interfering with a person of your importance i thought however that as you have been bred a grazier if i mistake not there might be occasion to remind you of the difference between highlanders and highland cattle and if you should happen to meet with any gentleman who has seen service and is disposed to speak upon the subject i should still imagine that listening to him would do you no sort of harm but i have done and have only once more to recommend this gentleman to your civility as well as to your custody mr waverley i am truly sorry we should part in this way but i trust when you are again in this country i may have an opportunity to render cairnvreckan more agreeable than circumstances have permitted on this occasion  so saying he shook our hero by the hand morton also took an affectionate farewell and waverley having mounted his horse with a musketeer leading it by the bridle and a file upon each side to prevent his escape set forward upon the march with gilfillan and his party through the little village they were accompanied with the shouts of the children who cried out eh see to the southland gentleman thats gaun to be hanged for shooting lang john mucklewrath the smith     chapter vii  an incident   the dinner hour of scotland sixty years since was two oclock it was therefore about four oclock of a delightful autumn afternoon that mr gilfillan commenced his march in hopes although stirling was eighteen miles distant he might be able by becoming a borrower of the night for an hour or two to reach it that evening he therefore put forth his strength and marched stoutly along at the head of his followers eyeing our hero from time to time as if he longed to enter into controversy with him at length unable to resist the temptation he slackened his pace till he was alongside of his prisoners horse and after marching a few steps in silence abreast of him he suddenly askedcan ye say wha the carle was wi the black coat and the mousted head that was wi the laird of cairnvreckan  a presbyterian clergyman answered waverley  presbyterian answered gilfillan contemptuously a wretched erastian or rather an obscure prelatist a favourer of the black indulgence ane of thae dumb dogs that canna bark they tell ower a clash o terror and a clatter o comfort in their sermons without ony sense or savour or life yeve been fed in siccan a fauld belike  no i am of the church of england said waverley  and theyre just neighbourlike replied the covenanter and nae wonder they gree sae weel wha wad hae thought the goodly structure of the kirk of scotland built up by our fathers in 1642 wad hae been defaced by carnal ends and the corruptions of the timeay wha wad hae thought the carved work of the sanctuary would hae been sae soon cut down  to this lamentation which one or two of the assistants chorussed with a deep groan our hero thought it unnecessary to make any reply whereupon mr gilfillan resolving that he should be a hearer at least if not a disputant proceeded in his jeremiade  and now is it wonderful when for lack of exercise anent the call to the service of the altar and the duty of the day ministers fall into sinful compliances with patronage and indemnities and oaths and bonds and other corruptionsis it wonderful i say that you sir and other siclike unhappy persons should labour to build up your auld babel of iniquity as in the bluidy persecuting saintkilling times i trow gin ye werena blinded wi the graces and favours and services and enjoyments and employments and inheritances of this wicked world i could prove to you by the scripture in what a filthy rag ye put your trust and that your surplices and your copes and vestments are but castoff garments of the muckle harlot that sitteth upon seven hills and drinketh of the cup of abomination but i trow ye are deaf as adders upon that side of the head ay ye are deceived with her enchantments and ye traffic with her merchandise and ye are drunk with the cup of her fornication  how much longer this military theologist might have continued his invective in which he spared nobody but the scattered remnant of hillfolk as he called them is absolutely uncertain his matter was copious his voice powerful and his memory strong so that there was little chance of his ending his exhortation till the party had reached stirling had not his attention been attracted by a pedlar who had joined the march from a crossroad and who sighed or groaned with great regularity at all fitting pauses of his homily  and what may ye be friend said the gifted gilfillan  a puir pedlar thats bound for stirling and craves the protection of your honours party in these kittle times ah your honour has a notable faculty in searching and explaining the secretay the secret and obscure and incomprehensible causes of the backslidings of the land ay your honour touches the root o the matter  friend said gilfillan with a more complacent voice than he had hitherto used honour not me i do not go out to parkdikes and to steadings and to markettowns to have herds and cottars and burghers pull off their bonnets to me as they do to major melville o cairnvreckan and ca me laird or captain or honour no my sma means whilk are not aboon twenty thousand merk have had the blessing of increase but the pride of my heart has not increased with them nor do i delight to be called captain though i have the subscribed commission of that gospelsearching nobleman the earl of glencairn fa whilk i am so designated while i live i am and will be called habakkuk gilfillan who will stand up for the standards of doctrine agreed on by the ance famous kirk of scotland before she trafficked with the accursed achan while he has a plack in his purse or a drap o bluid in his body  ah said the pedlar i have seen your land about mauchlin a fertile spot your lines have fallen in pleasant places and siccan a breed o cattle is not in ony lairds land in scotland  ye say rightye say right friend retorted gilfillan eagerly for he was not inaccessible to flattery upon this subjectye say right they are the real lancashire and theres no the like o them even at the mains of kilmaurs and he then entered into a discussion of their excellences to which our readers will probably be as indifferent as our hero after this excursion the leader returned to his theological discussions while the pedlar less profound upon those mystic points contented himself with groaning and expressing his edification at suitable intervals  what a blessing it would be to the puir blinded popish nations among whom i hae sojourned to have siccan a light to their paths i hae been as far as muscovia in my sma trading way as a travelling merchant and i hae been through france and the low countries and a poland and maist feck o germany and o it would grieve your honours soul to see the murmuring and the singing and massing thats in the kirk and the piping thats in the quire and the heathenish dancing and dicing upon the sabbath  this set gilfillan off upon the book of sports and the covenant and the engagers and the protesters and the whiggamores raid and the assembly of divines at westminster and the longer and shorter catechism and the excommunication at torwood and the slaughter of archbishop sharp this last topic again led him into the lawfulness of defensive arms on which subject he uttered much more sense than could have been expected from some other parts of his harangue and attracted even waverleys attention who had hitherto been lost in his own sad reflections mr gilfillan then considered the lawfulness of a private mans standing forth as the avenger of public oppression and as he was labouring with great earnestness the cause of mas james mitchell who fired at the archbishop of saint andrews some years before the prelates assassination on magus muir an incident occurred which interrupted his harangue  the rays of the sun were lingering on the very verge of the horizon as the party ascended a hollow and somewhat steep path which led to the summit of a rising ground the country was uninclosed being part of a very extensive heath or common but it was far from level exhibiting in many places hollows filled with furze and broom in others little dingles of stunted brushwood a thicket of the latter description crowned the hill up which the party ascended the foremost of the band being the stoutest and most active had pushed on and having surmounted the ascent were out of ken for the present gilfillan with the pedlar and the small party who were waverleys more immediate guard were near the top of the ascent and the remainder straggled after them at a considerable interval  such was the situation of matters when the pedlar missing as he said a little doggie which belonged to him began to halt and whistle for the animal this signal repeated more than once gave offence to the rigour of his companion the rather because it appeared to indicate inattention to the treasures of theological and controversial knowledge which were pouring out for his edification he therefore signified gruffly that he could not waste his time in waiting for an useless cur  but if your honour wad consider the case of tobit  tobit exclaimed gilffflan with great heat tobit and his dog baith are altogether heathenish and apocryphal and none but a prelatist or a papist would draw them into question i doubt i hae been mistaen in you friend  very likely answered the pedlar with great composure but neertheless i shall take leave to whistle again upon puir bawty  this last signal was answered in an unexpected manner for six or eight stout highlanders who lurked among the copse and brushwood sprung into the hollow way and began to lay about them with their claymores gilfillan unappalled at this undesirable apparition cried out manfully the sword of the lord and of gideon and drawing his broadsword would probably have done as much credit to the good old cause as any of its doughty champions at drumclog when behold the pedlar snatching a musket from the person who was next him bestowed the butt of it with such emphasis on the head of his late instructor in the cameronian creed that he was forthwith levelled to the ground in the confusion which ensued the horse which bore our hero was shot by one of gilfillans party as he discharged his firelock at random waverley fell with and indeed under the animal and sustained some severe contusions but he was almost instantly extricated from the fallen steed by two highlanders who each seizing him by the arm hurried him away from the scuffle and from the highroad they ran with great speed half supporting and half dragging our hero who could however distinguish a few dropping shots fired about the spot which he had left this as he afterwards learned proceeded from gilfillans party who had now assembled the stragglers in front and rear having joined the others at their approach the highlanders drew off but not before they had rifled gilfillan and two of his people who remained on the spot grievously wounded a few shots were exchanged betwixt them and the westlanders but the latter now without a commander and apprehensive of a second ambush did not make any serious effort to recover their prisoner judging it more wise to proceed on their journey to stirling carrying with them their wounded captain and comrades     chapter viii  waverley is still in distress   the velocity and indeed violence with which waverley was hurried along nearly deprived him of sensation for the injury he had received from his fall prevented him from aiding himself so effectually as he might otherwise have done when this was observed by his conductors they called to their aid two or three others of the party and swathing our heros body in one of their plaids divided his weight by that means among them and transported him at the same rapid rate as before without any exertion of his own they spoke little and that in gaelic and did not slacken their pace till they had run nearly two miles when they abated their extreme rapidity but continued still to walk very fast relieving each other occasionally  our hero now endeavoured to address them but was only answered with cha neil beurl agam ie i have no english being as waverley well knew the constant reply of a highlander when he either does not understand or does not choose to reply to an englishman or lowlander he then mentioned the name of vich lan vohr concluding that he was indebted to his friendship for his rescue from the clutches of gifted gilfillan but neither did this produce any mark of recognition from his escort  the twilight had given place to moonshine when the party halted upon the brink of a precipitous glen which as partly enlightened by the moonbeams seemed full of trees and tangled brushwood two of the highlanders dived into it by a small footpath as if to explore its recesses and one of them returning in a few minutes said something to his companions who instantly raised their burden and bore him with great attention and care down the narrow and abrupt descent notwithstanding their precautions however waverleys person came more than once into contact rudely enough with the projecting stumps and branches which overhung the pathway  at the bottom of the descent and as it seemed by the side of a brook for waverley heard the rushing of a considerable body of water although its stream was invisible in the darkness the party again stopped before a small and rudelyconstructed hovel the door was open and the inside of the premises appeared as uncomfortable and rude as its situation and exterior foreboded there was no appearance of a floor of any kind the roof seemed rent in several places the walls were composed of loose stones and turf and the thatch of branches of trees the fire was in the centre and filled the whole wigwam with smoke which escaped as much through the door as by means of a circular aperture in the roof an old highland sibyl the only inhabitant of this forlorn mansion appeared busy in the preparation of some food by the light which the fire afforded waverley could discover that his attendants were not of the clan of ivor for fergus was particularly strict in requiring from his followers that they should wear the tartan striped in the mode peculiar to their race a mark of distinction anciently general through the highlands and still maintained by those chiefs who were proud of their lineage or jealous of their separate and exclusive authority  edward had lived at glennaquoich long enough to be aware of a distinction which he had repeatedly heard noticed and now satisfied that he had no interest with his attendants he glanced a disconsolate eye around the interior of the cabin the only furniture excepting a washingtub and a wooden press called in scotland an ambry sorely decayed was a large wooden bed planked as is usual all around and opening by a sliding panel in this recess the highlanders deposited waverley after he had by signs declined any refreshment his slumbers were broken and unrefreshing strange visions passed before his eyes and it required constant and reiterated efforts of mind to dispel them shivering violent headache and shooting pains in his limbs succeeded these symptoms and in the morning it was evident to his highland attendants or guard for he knew not in which light to consider them that waverley was quite unfit to travel  after a long consultation among themselves six of the party left the hut with their arms leaving behind an old and a young man the former addressed waverley and bathed the contusions which swelling and livid colour now made conspicuous his own portmanteau which the highlanders had not failed to bring off supplied him with linen and to his great surprise was with all its undiminished contents freely resigned to his use the bedding of his couch seemed clean and comfortable and his aged attendant closed the door of the bed for it had no curtain after a few words of gaelic from which waverley gathered that he exhorted him to repose so behold our hero for a second time the patient of a highland esculapius but in a situation much more uncomfortable than when he was the guest of the worthy tomanrait  the symptomatic fever which accompanied the injuries he had sustained did not abate till the third day when it gave way to the care of his attendants and the strength of his constitution and he could now raise himself in his bed though not without pain he observed however that there was a great disinclination on the part of the old woman who acted as his nurse as well as on that of the elderly highlander to permit the door of the bed to be left open so that he might amuse himself with observing their motions and at length after waverley had repeatedly drawn open and they had as frequently shut the hatchway of his cage the old gentleman put an end to the contest by securing it on the outside with a nail so effectually that the door could not be drawn till this exterior impediment was removed  while musing upon the cause of this contradictory spirit in persons whose conduct intimated no purpose of plunder and who in all other points appeared to consult his welfare and his wishes it occurred to our hero that during the worst crisis of his illness a female figure younger than his old highland nurse had appeared to flit around his couch of this indeed he had but a very indistinct recollection but his suspicions were confirmed when attentively listening he often heard in the course of the day the voice of another female conversing in whispers with his attendant who could it be and why should she apparently desire concealment fancy immediately aroused herself and turned to flora macivor but after a short conflict between his eager desire to believe she was in his neighbourhood guarding like an angel of mercy the couch of his sickness waverley was compelled to conclude that his conjecture was altogether improbable since to suppose she had left her comparatively safe situation at glennaquoich to descend into the low country now the seat of civil war and to inhabit such a lurkingplace as this was a thing hardly to be imagined yet his heart bounded as he sometimes could distinctly hear the trip of a light female step glide to or from the door of the hut or the suppressed sounds of a female voice of softness and delicacy hold dialogue with the hoarse inward croak of old janet for so he understood his antiquated attendant was denominated  having nothing else to amuse his solitude he employed himself in contriving some plan to gratify his curiosity in despite of the sedulous caution of janet and the old highland janizary for he had never seen the young fellow since the first morning at length upon accurate examination the infirm state of his wooden prisonhouse appeared to supply the means of gratifying his curiosity for out of a spot which was somewhat decayed he was able to extract a nail through this minute aperture he could perceive a female form wrapped in a plaid in the act of conversing with janet but since the days of our grandmother eve the gratification of inordinate curiosity has generally borne its penalty in disappointment the form was not that of flora nor was the face visible and to crown his vexation while he laboured with the nail to enlarge the hole that he might obtain a more complete view a slight noise betrayed his purpose and the object of his curiosity instantly disappeared nor so far as he could observe did she again revisit the cottage  all precautions to blockade his view were from that time abandoned and he was not only permitted but assisted to rise and quit what had been in a literal sense his couch of confinement but he was not allowed to leave the hut for the young highlander had now rejoined his senior and one or other was constantly on the watch whenever waverley approached the cottage door the sentinel upon duty civilly but resolutely placed himself against it and opposed his exit accompanying his action with signs which seemed to imply there was danger in the attempt and an enemy in the neighbourhood old janet appeared anxious and upon the watch and waverley who had not yet recovered strength enough to attempt to take his departure in spite of the opposition of his hosts was under the necessity of remaining patient his fare was in every point of view better than he could have conceived for poultry and even wine were no strangers to his table the highlanders never presumed to eat with him and unless in the circumstance of watching him treated him with great respect his sole amusement was gazing from the window or rather the shapeless aperture which was meant to answer the purpose of a window upon a large and rough brook which raged and foamed through a rocky channel closely canopied with trees and bushes about ten feet beneath the site of his house of captivity  upon the sixth day of his confinement waverley found himself so well that he began to meditate his escape from this dull and miserable prisonhouse thinking any risk which he might incur in the attempt preferable to the stupefying and intolerable uniformity of janets retirement the question indeed occurred whither he was to direct his course when again at his own disposal two schemes seemed practicable yet both attended with danger and difficulty one was to go back to glennaquoich and join fergus macivor by whom he was sure to be kindly received and in the present state of his mind the rigour with which he had been treated fully absolved him in his own eyes from his allegiance to the existing government the other project was to endeavour to attain a scottish seaport and thence to take shipping for england his mind wavered between these plans and probably if he had effected his escape in the manner he proposed he would have been finally determined by the comparative facility by which either might have been executed but his fortune had settled that he was not to be left to his option  upon the evening of the seventh day the door of the hut suddenly opened and two highlanders entered whom waverley recognised as having been a part of his original escort to this cottage they conversed for a short time with the old man and his companion and then made waverley understand by very significant signs that he was to prepare to accompany them this was a joyful communication what had already passed during his confinement made it evident that no personal injury was designed to him and his romantic spirit having recovered during his repose much of that elasticity which anxiety resentment disappointment and the mixture of unpleasant feelings excited by his late adventures had for a time subjugated was now wearied with inaction his passion for the wonderful although it is the nature of such dispositions to be excited by that degree of danger which merely gives dignity to the feeling of the individual exposed to it had sunk under the extraordinary and apparently insurmountable evils by which he appeared environed at cairnvreckan in fact this compound of intense curiosity and exalted imagination forms a peculiar species of courage which somewhat resembles the light usually carried by a minersufficiently competent indeed to afford him guidance and comfort during the ordinary perils of his labour but certain to be extinguished should he encounter the more formidable hazard of earth damps or pestiferous vapours it was now however once more rekindled and with a throbbing mixture of hope awe and anxiety waverley watched the group before him as those who were just arrived snatched a hasty meal and the others assumed their arms and made brief preparations for their departure  as he sat in the smoky hut at some distance from the fire around which the others were crowded he felt a gentle pressure upon his arm he looked round it was alice the daughter of donald bean lean she showed him a packet of papers in such a manner that the motion was remarked by no one else put her finger for a second to her lips and passed on as if to assist old janet in packing waverleys clothes in his portmanteau it was obviously her wish that he should not seem to recognise her yet she repeatedly looked back at him as an opportunity occurred of doing so unobserved and when she saw that he remarked what she did she folded the packet with great address and speed in one of his shirts which she deposited in the portmanteau  here then was fresh food for conjecture was alice his unknown warden and was this maiden of the cavern the tutelar genius that watched his bed during his sickness was he in the hands of her father and if so what was his purpose spoil his usual object seemed in this case neglected for not only waverleys property was restored but his purse which might have tempted this professional plunderer had been all along suffered to remain in his possession all this perhaps the packet might explain but it was plain from alices manner that she desired he should consult it in secret nor did she again seek his eye after she had satisfied herself that her manoeuvre was observed and understood on the contrary she shortly afterwards left the hut and it was only as she tript out from the door that favoured by the obscurity she gave waverley a parting smile and nod of significance ere she vanished in the dark glen  the young highlander was repeatedly despatched by his comrades as if to collect intelligence at length when he had returned for the third or fourth time the whole party arose and made signs to our hero to accompany them before his departure however he shook hands with old janet who had been so sedulous in his behalf and added substantial marks of his gratitude for her attendance  god bless you god prosper you captain waverley said janet in good lowland scotch though he had never hithero heard her utter a syllable save in gaelic but the impatience of his attendants prohibited his asking any explanation     chapter ix  a nocturnal adventure   there was a moments pause when the whole party had got out of the hut and the highlander who assumed the command and who in waverleys awakened recollection seemed to be the same tall figure who had acted as donald bean leans lieutenant by whispers and signs imposed the strictest silence he delivered to edward a sword and steel pistol and pointing up the track laid his hand on the hilt of his own claymore as if to make him sensible they might have occasion to use force to make good their passage he then placed himself at the head of the party who moved up the pathway in single or indian file waverley being placed nearest to their leader he moved with great precaution as if to avoid giving any alarm and halted as soon as he came to the verge of the ascent waverley was soon sensible of the reason for he heard at no great distance an english sentinel call out alls well the heavy sound sunk on the nightwind down the woody glen and was answered by the echoes of its banks a second third and fourth time the signal was repeated fainter and fainter as if at a greater and greater distance it was obvious that a party of soldiers were near and upon their guard though not sufficiently so to detect men skilful in every art of predatory warfare like those with whom he now watched their ineffectual precautions  when these sounds had died upon the silence of the night the highlanders began their march swiftly yet with the most cautious silence waverley had little time or indeed disposition for observation and could only discern that they passed at some distance from a large building in the windows of which a light or two yet seemed to twinkle a little farther on the leading highlander snuffed the wind like a setting spaniel and then made a signal to his party again to halt he stooped down upon all fours wrapped up in his plaid so as to be scarce distinguishable from the heathy ground on which he moved and advanced in this posture to reconnoitre in a short time he returned and dismissed his attendants excepting one and intimating to waverley that he must imitate his cautious mode of proceeding all three crept forward on hands and knees  after proceeding a greater way in this inconvenient manner than was at all comfortable to his knees and shins waverley perceived the smell of smoke which probably had been much sooner distinguished by the more acute nasal organs of his guide it proceeded from the corner of a low and ruinous sheepfold the walls of which were made of loose stones as is usual in scotland close by this low wall the highlander guided waverley and in order probably to make him sensible of his danger or perhaps to obtain the full credit of his own dexterity he intimated to him by sign and example that he might raise his head so as to peep into the sheepfold waverley did so and beheld an outpost of four or five soldiers lying by their watchfire they were all asleep except the sentinel who paced backwards and forwards with his firelock on his shoulder which glanced red in the light of the fire as he crossed and recrossed before it in his short walk casting his eye frequently to that part of the heavens from which the moon hitherto obscured by mist seemed now about to make her appearance  in the course of a minute or two by one of those sudden changes of atmosphere incident to a mountainous country a breeze arose and swept before it the clouds which had covered the horizon and the night planet poured her full effulgence upon a wide and blighted heath skirted indeed with copsewood and stunted trees in the quarter from which they had come but open and bare to the observation of the sentinel in that to which their course tended the wall of the sheepfold indeed concealed them as they lay but any advance beyond its shelter seemed impossible without certain discovery  the highlander eyed the blue vault but far from blessing the useful light with homers or rather popes benighted peasant he muttered a gaelic curse upon the unseasonable splendour of macfarlanes buat ie lantern footnote see note 26 he looked anxiously around for a few minutes and then apparently took his resolution leaving his attendant with waverley after motioning to edward to remain quiet and giving his comrade directions in a brief whisper he retreated favoured by the irregularity of the ground in the same direction and in the same manner as they had advanced edward turning his head after him could perceive him crawling on all fours with the dexterity of an indian availing himself of every bush and inequality to escape observation and never passing over the more exposed parts of his track until the sentinels back was turned from him at length he reached the thickets and underwood which partly covered the moor in that direction and probably extended to the verge of the glen where waverley had been so long an inhabitant the highlander disappeared but it was only for a few minutes for he suddenly issued forth from a different part of the thicket and advancing boldly upon the open heath as if to invite discovery he levelled his piece and fired at the sentinel a wound in the arm proved a disagreeable interruption to the poor fellows meteorological observations as well as to the tune of nancy dawson which he was whistling he returned the fire ineffectually and his comrades starting up at the alarm advanced alertly towards the spot from which the first shot had issued the highlander after giving them a full view of his person dived among the thickets for his ruse de guerre had now perfectly succeeded  while the soldiers pursued the cause of their disturbance in one direction waverley adopting the hint of his remaining attendant made the best of his speed in that which his guide originally intended to pursue and which now the attention of the soldiers being drawn to a different quarter was unobserved and unguarded when they had run about a quarter of a mile the brow of a rising ground which they had surmounted concealed them from further risk of observation they still heard however at a distance the shouts of the soldiers as they hallooed to each other upon the heath and they could also hear the distant roll of a drum beating to arms in the same direction but these hostile sounds were now far in their rear and died away upon the breeze as they rapidly proceeded  when they had walked about half an hour still along open and waste ground of the same description they came to the stump of an ancient oak which from its relics appeared to have been at one time a tree of very large size in an adjacent hollow they found several highlanders with a horse or two they had not joined them above a few minutes which waverleys attendant employed in all probability in communicating the cause of their delay for the words duncan duroch were often repeated when duncan himself appeared out of breath indeed and with all the symptoms of having run for his life but laughing and in high spirits at the success of the stratagem by which he had baffled his pursuers this indeed waverley could easily conceive might be a matter of no great difficulty to the active mountaineer who was perfectly acquainted with the ground and traced his course with a firmness and confidence to which his pursuers must have been strangers the alarm which he excited seemed still to continue for a dropping shot or two were heard at a great distance which seemed to serve as an addition to the mirth of duncan and his comrades  the mountaineer now resumed the arms with which he had entrusted our hero giving him to understand that the dangers of the journey were happily surmounted waverley was then mounted upon one of the horses a change which the fatigue of the night and his recent illness rendered exceedingly acceptable his portmanteau was placed on another pony duncan mounted a third and they set forward at a round pace accompanied by their escort no other incident marked the course of that nights journey and at the dawn of morning they attained the banks of a rapid river the country around was at once fertile and romantic steep banks of wood were broken by cornfields which this year presented an abundant harvest already in a great measure cut down  on the opposite bank of the river and partly surrounded by a winding of its stream stood a large and massive castle the halfruined turrets of which were already glittering in the first rays of the sun footnote see note 27 it was in form an oblong square of size sufficient to contain a large court in the centre the towers at each angle of the square rose higher than the walls of the building and were in their turn surmounted by turrets differing in height and irregular in shape upon one of these a sentinel watched whose bonnet and plaid streaming in the wind declared him to be a highlander as a broad white ensign which floated from another tower announced that the garrison was held by the insurgent adherents of the house of stuart  passing hastily through a small and mean town where their appearance excited neither surprise nor curiosity in the few peasants whom the labours of the harvest began to summon from their repose the party crossed an ancient and narrow bridge of several arches and turning to the left up an avenue of huge old sycamores waverley found himself in front of the gloomy yet picturesque structure which he had admired at a distance a huge irongrated door which formed the exterior defence of the gateway was already thrown back to receive them and a second heavily constructed of oak and studded thickly with iron nails being next opened admitted them into the interior courtyard a gentleman dressed in the highland garb and having a white cockade in his bonnet assisted waverley to dismount from his horse and with much courtesy bid him welcome to the castle  the governor for so we must term him having conducted waverley to a halfruinous apartment where however there was a small campbed and having offered him any refreshment which he desired was then about to leave him  will you not add to your civilities said waverley after having made the usual acknowledgment by having the kindness to inform me where i am and whether or not i am to consider myself as a prisoner  i am not at liberty to be so explicit upon this subject as i could wish briefly however you are in the castle of doune in the district of menteith and in no danger whatever  and how am i assured of that  by the honour of donald stewart governor of the garrison and lieutenantcolonel in the service of his royal highness prince charles edward so saying he hastily left the apartment as if to avoid further discussion  exhausted by the fatigues of the night our hero now threw himself upon the bed and was in a few minutes fast asleep     chapter x  the journey is continued   before waverley awakened from his repose the day was far advanced and he began to feel that he had passed many hours without food this was soon supplied in form of a copious breakfast but colonel stewart as if wishing to avoid the queries of his guest did not again present himself his compliments were however delivered by a servant with an offer to provide anything in his power that could be useful to captain waverley on his journey which he intimated would be continued that evening to waverleys further inquiries the servant opposed the impenetrable barrier of real or affected ignorance and stupidity he removed the table and provisions and waverley was again consigned to his own meditations  as he contemplated the strangeness of his fortune which seemed to delight in placing him at the disposal of others without the power of directing his own motions edwards eye suddenly rested upon his portmanteau which had been deposited in his apartment during his sleep the mysterious appearance of alice in the cottage of the glen immediately rushed upon his mind and he was about to secure and examine the packet which she had deposited among his clothes when the servant of colonel stewart again made his appearance and took up the portmanteau upon his shoulders  may i not take out a change of linen my friend  your honour sall get ane o the colonels ain ruffled sarks but this maun gang in the baggagecart  and so saying he very coolly carried off the portmanteau without waiting further remonstrance leaving our hero in a state where disappointment and indignation struggled for the mastery in a few minutes he heard a cart rumble out of the rugged courtyard and made no doubt that he was now dispossessed for a space at least if not for ever of the only documents which seemed to promise some light upon the dubious events which had of late influenced his destiny with such melancholy thoughts he had to beguile about four or five hours of solitude  when this space was elapsed the trampling of horse was heard in the courtyard and colonel stewart soon after made his appearance to request his guest to take some further refreshment before his departure the offer was accepted for a late breakfast had by no means left our hero incapable of doing honour to dinner which was now presented the conversation of his host was that of a plain country gentleman mixed with some soldierlike sentiments and expressions he cautiously avoided any reference to the military operations or civil politics of the time and to waverleys direct inquiries concerning some of these points replied that he was not at liberty to speak upon such topics  when dinner was finished the governor arose and wishing edward a good journey said that having been informed by waverleys servant that his baggage had been sent forward he had taken the freedom to supply him with such changes of linen as he might find necessary till he was again possessed of his own with this compliment he disappeared a servant acquainted waverley an instant afterwards that his horse was ready  upon this hint he descended into the courtyard and found a trooper holding a saddled horse on which he mounted and sallied from the portal of doune castle attended by about a score of armed men on horseback these had less the appearance of regular soldiers than of individuals who had suddenly assumed arms from some pressing motive of unexpected emergency their uniform which was blue and red an affected imitation of that of french chasseurs was in many respects incomplete and sate awkwardly upon those who wore it waverleys eye accustomed to look at a welldisciplined regiment could easily discover that the motions and habits of his escort were not those of trained soldiers and that although expert enough in the management of their horses their skill was that of huntsmen or grooms rather than of troopers the horses were not trained to the regular pace so necessary to execute simultaneous and combined movements and formations nor did they seem bitted as it is technically expressed for the use of the sword the men however were stout hardylooking fellows and might be individually formidable as irregular cavalry the commander of this small party was mounted upon an excellent hunter and although dressed in uniform his change of apparel did not prevent waverley from recognising his old acquaintance mr falconer of balmawhapple  now although the terms upon which edward had parted with this gentleman were none of the most friendly he would have sacrificed every recollection of their foolish quarrel for the pleasure of enjoying once more the social intercourse of question and answer from which he had been so long secluded but apparently the remembrance of his defeat by the baron of bradwardine of which edward had been the unwilling cause still rankled in the mind of the lowbred and yet proud laird he carefully avoided giving the least sign of recognition riding doggedly at the head of his men who though scarce equal in numbers to a sergeants party were denominated captain falconers troop being preceded by a trumpet which sounded from time to time and a standard borne by cornet falconer the lairds younger brother the lieutenant an elderly man had much the air of a low sportsman and boon companion an expression of dry humour predominated in his countenance over features of a vulgar cast which indicated habitual intemperance his cocked hat was set knowingly upon one side of his head and while he whistled the bob of dumblain under the influence of half a mutchkin of brandy he seemed to trot merrily forward with a happy indifference to the state of the country the conduct of the party the end of the journey and all other sublunary matters whatever  from this wight who now and then dropped alongside of his horse waverley hoped to acquire some information or at least to beguile the way with talk  a fine evening sir was edwards salutation  ow ay sir a bra night replied the lieutenant in broad scotch of the most vulgar description  and a fine harvest apparently continued waverley following up his first attack  ay the aits will be got bravely in but the farmers deil burst them and the cornmongers will make the auld price gude against them as has horses till keep  you perhaps act as quartermaster sir  ay quartermaster ridingmaster and lieutenant answered this officer of all work and to be sure whas fitter to look after the breaking and the keeping of the poor beasts than mysell that bought and sold every ane o them  and pray sir if it be not too great a freedom may i beg to know where we are going just now  a fules errand i fear answered this communicative personage  in that case said waverley determined not to spare civility i should have thought a person of your appearance would not have been found on the road  vera true vera true sir replied the officer but every why has its wherefore ye maun ken the laird there bought a thir beasts frae me to munt his troop and agreed to pay for them according to the necessities and prices of the time but then he hadna the ready penny and i hae been advised his bond will not be worth a boddle against the estate and then i had a my dealers to settle wi at martinmas and so as he very kindly offered me this commission and as the auld fifteen footnote the judges of the supreme court of session in scotland are proverbially termed among the country people the fifteen wad never help me to my siller for sending out naigs against the government why conscience sir i thought my best chance for payment was een to gae out footnote see note 28 mysell and ye may judge sir as i hae dealt a my life in halters i think na mickle o putting my craig in peril of a saint johnstones tippet  you are not then by profession a soldier said waverley  na na thank god answered this doughty partizan i wasna bred at sae short a tether i was brought up to hack and manger i was bred a horsecouper sir and if i might live to see you at whitsontryst or at stagshawbank or the winter fair at hawick and ye wanted a spanker that would lead the field ise be caution i would serve ye easy for jamie jinker was neer the lad to impose upon a gentleman yere a gentleman sir and should ken a horses points ye see that throughganging thing that balmawhapples on i selled her till him she was bred out of licktheladle that wan the kings plate at cavertonedge by duke hamiltons whitefoot etc etc etc  but as jinker was entered full sail upon the pedigree of balmawhapples mare having already got as far as greatgrandsire and greatgranddam and while waverley was watching for an opportunity to obtain from him intelligence of more interest the noble captain checked his horse until they came up and then without directly appearing to notice edward said sternly to the genealogist i thought lieutenant my orders were preceese that no one should speak to the prisoner  the metamorphosed horsedealer was silenced of course and slunk to the rear where he consoled himself by entering into a vehement dispute upon the price of hay with a farmer who had reluctantly followed his laird to the field rather than give up his farm whereof the lease had just expired waverley was therefore once more consigned to silence foreseeing that further attempts at conversation with any of the party would only give balmawhapple a wishedfor opportunity to display the insolence of authority and the sulky spite of a temper naturally dogged and rendered more so by habits of low indulgence and the incense of servile adulation  in about two hours time the party were near the castle of stirling over whose battlements the union flag was brightened as it waved in the evening sun to shorten his journey or perhaps to display his importance and insult the english garrison balmawhapple inclining to the right took his route through the royal park which reaches to and surrounds the rock upon which the fortress is situated      with a mind more at ease waverley could not have failed to admire the mixture of romance and beauty which renders interesting the scene through which he was now passingthe field which had been the scene of the tournaments of oldthe rock from which the ladies beheld the contest while each made vows for the success of some favourite knightthe towers of the gothic church where these vows might be paidand surmounting all the fortress itself at once a castle and palace where valour received the prize from royalty and knights and dames closed the evening amid the revelry of the dance the song and the feast all these were objects fitted to arouse and interest a romantic imagination  but waverley had other objects of meditation and an incident soon occurred of a nature to disturb meditation of any kind balmawhapple in the pride of his heart as he wheeled his little body of cavalry round the base of the castle commanded his trumpet to sound a flourish and his standard to be displayed this insult produced apparently some sensation for when the cavalcade was at such distance from the southern battery as to admit of a gun being depressed so as to bear upon them a flash of fire issued from one of the embrazures upon the rock and ere the report with which it was attended could be heard the rushing sound of a cannonball passed over balmawhapples head and the bullet burying itself in the ground at a few yards distance covered him with the earth which it drove up there was no need to bid the party trudge in fact every man acting upon the impulse of the moment soon brought mr jinkers steeds to show their mettle and the cavaliers retreating with more speed than regularity never took to a trot as the lieutenant afterwards observed until an intervening eminence had secured them from any repetition of so undesirable a compliment on the part of stirling castle i must do balmawhapple however the justice to say that he not only kept the rear of his troop and laboured to maintain some order among them but in the height of his gallantry answered the fire of the castle by discharging one of his horsepistols at the battlements although the distance being nearly half a mile i could never learn that this measure of retaliation was attended with any particular effect  the travellers now passed the memorable field of bannockburn and reached the torwood a place glorious or terrible to the recollections of the scottish peasant as the feats of wallace or the cruelties of wude willie grime predominate in his recollection at falkirk a town formerly famous in scottish history and soon to be again distinguished as the scene of military events of importance balmawhapple proposed to halt and repose for the evening this was performed with very little regard to military discipline his worthy quartermaster being chiefly solicitous to discover where the best brandy might be come at sentinels were deemed unnecessary and the only vigils performed were those of such of the party as could procure liquor a few resolute men might easily have cut off the detachment but of the inhabitants some were favourable many indifferent and the rest overawed so nothing memorable occurred in the course of the evening except that waverleys rest was sorely interrupted by the revellers hallooing forth their jacobite songs without remorse or mitigation of voice  early in the morning they were again mounted and on the road to edinburgh though the pallid visages of some of the troop betrayed that they had spent a night of sleepless debauchery they halted at linlithgow distinguished by its ancient palace which sixty years since was entire and habitable and whose venerable ruins not quite sixty years since very narrowly escaped the unworthy fate of being converted into a barrack for french prisoners may repose and blessings attend the ashes of the patriotic statesman who amongst his last services to scotland interposed to prevent this profanation  as they approached the metropolis of scotland through a champaign and cultivated country the sounds of war began to be heard the distant yet distinct report of heavy cannon fired at intervals apprized waverley that the work of destruction was going forward even balmawhapple seemed moved to take some precautions by sending an advanced party in front of his troop keeping the main body in tolerable order and moving steadily forward  marching in this manner they speedily reached an eminence from which they could view edinburgh stretching along the ridgy hill which slopes eastward from the castle the latter being in a state of siege or rather of blockade by the northern insurgents who had already occupied the town for two or three days fired at intervals upon such parties of highlanders as exposed themselves either on the main street or elsewhere in the vicinity of the fortress the morning being calm and fair the effect of this dropping fire was to invest the castle in wreaths of smoke the edges of which dissipated slowly in the air while the central veil was darkened ever and anon by fresh clouds poured forth from the battlements the whole giving by the partial concealment an appearance of grandeur and gloom rendered more terrific when waverley reflected on the cause by which it was produced and that each explosion might ring some brave mans knell  ere they approached the city the partial cannonade had wholly ceased balmawhapple however having in his recollection the unfriendly greeting which his troop had received from the battery at stirling had apparently no wish to tempt the forbearance of the artillery of the castle he therefore left the direct road and sweeping considerably to the southward so as to keep out of the range of the cannon approached the ancient palace of holyrood without having entered the walls of the city he then drew up his men in front of that venerable pile and delivered waverley to the custody of a guard of highlanders whose officer conducted him into the interior of the building  a long low and illproportioned gallery hung with pictures affirmed to be the portraits of kings who if they ever flourished at all lived several hundred years before the invention of painting in oil colours served as a sort of guard chamber or vestibule to the apartments which the adventurous charles edward now occupied in the palace of his ancestors officers both in the highland and lowland garb passed and repassed in haste or loitered in the hall as if waiting for orders secretaries were engaged in making out passes musters and returns all seemed busy and earnestly intent upon something of importance but waverley was suffered to remain seated in the recess of a window unnoticed by any one in anxious reflection upon the crisis of his fate which seemed now rapidly approaching     chapter xi  an old and a new acquaintance   while he was deep sunk in his reverie the rustle of tartans was heard behind him a friendly arm clasped his shoulders and a friendly voice exclaimed  said the highland prophet sooth or must secondsight go for nothing  waverley turned and was warmly embraced by fergus macivor a thousand welcomes to holyrood once more possessed by her legitimate sovereign did i not say we should prosper and that you would fall into the hands of the philistines if you parted from us  dear fergus said waverley eagerly returning his greeting it is long since i have heard a friends voice where is flora  safe and a triumphant spectator of our success  in this place said waverley  ay in this city at least answered his friend and you shall see her but first you must meet a friend whom you little think of who has been frequent in his inquiries after you  thus saying he dragged waverley by the arm out of the guard chamber and ere he knew where he was conducted edward found himself in a presence room fitted up with some attempt at royal state  a young man wearing his own fair hair distinguished by the dignity of his mien and the noble expression of his wellformed and regular features advanced out of a circle of military gentlemen and highland chiefs by whom he was surrounded in his easy and graceful manners waverley afterwards thought he could have discovered his high birth and rank although the star on his breast and the embroidered garter at his knee had not appeared as its indications  let me present to your royal highness said fergus bowing profoundly  the descendant of one of the most ancient and loyal families in england said the young chevalier interrupting him i beg your pardon for interrupting you my dear macivor but no master of ceremonies is necessary to present a waverley to a stuart  thus saying he extended his hand to edward with the utmost courtesy who could not had he desired it have avoided rendering him the homage which seemed due to his rank and was certainly the right of his birth i am sorry to understand mr waverley that owing to circumstances which have been as yet but ill explained you have suffered some restraint among my followers in perthshire and on your march here but we are in such a situation that we hardly know our friends and i am even at this moment uncertain whether i can have the pleasure of considering mr waverley as among mine  he then paused for an instant but before edward could adjust a suitable reply or even arrange his ideas as to its purport the prince took out a paper and then proceededi should indeed have no doubts upon this subject if i could trust to this proclamation set forth by the friends of the elector of hanover in which they rank mr waverley among the nobility and gentry who are menaced with the pains of hightreason for loyalty to their legitimate sovereign but i desire to gain no adherents save from affection and conviction and if mr waverley inclines to prosecute his journey to the south or to join the forces of the elector he shall have my passport and free permission to do so and i can only regret that my present power will not extend to protect him against the probable consequences of such a measure but continued charles edward after another short pause if mr waverley should like his ancestor sir nigel determine to embrace a cause which has little to recommend it but its justice and follow a prince who throws himself upon the affections of his people to recover the throne of his ancestors or perish in the attempt i can only say that among these nobles and gentlemen he will find worthy associates in a gallant enterprise and will follow a master who may be unfortunate but i trust will never be ungrateful  the politic chieftain of the race of ivor knew his advantage in introducing waverley to this personal interview with the royal adventurer unaccustomed to the address and manners of a polished court in which charles was eminently skilful his words and his kindness penetrated the heart of our hero and easily outweighed all prudential motives to be thus personally solicited for assistance by a prince whose form and manners as well as the spirit which he displayed in this singular enterprise answered his ideas of a hero of romance to be courted by him in the ancient halls of his paternal palace recovered by the sword which he was already bending towards other conquests gave edward in his own eyes the dignity and importance which he had ceased to consider as his attributes rejected slandered and threatened upon the one side he was irresistibly attracted to the cause which the prejudices of education and the political principles of his family had already recommended as the most just these thoughts rushed through his mind like a torrent sweeping before them every consideration of an opposite tendencythe time besides admitted of no deliberationand waverley kneeling to charles edward devoted his heart and sword to the vindication of his rights  the prince for although unfortunate in the faults and follies of his forefathers we shall here and elsewhere give him the title due to his birth raised waverley from the ground and embraced him with an expression of thanks too warm not to be genuine he also thanked fergus macivor repeatedly for having brought him such an adherent and presented waverley to the various noblemen chieftains and officers who were about his person as a young gentleman of the highest hopes and prospects in whose bold and enthusiastic avowal of his cause they might see an evidence of the sentiments of the english families of rank at this important crisis footnote see note 29 indeed this was a point much doubted among the adherents of the house of stuart and as a wellfounded disbelief in the cooperation of the english jacobites kept many scottish men of rank from his standard and diminished the courage of those who had joined it nothing could be more seasonable for the chevalier than the open declaration in his favour of the representative of the house of waverleyhonour so long known as cavaliers and royalists this fergus had foreseen from the beginning he really loved waverley because their feelings and projects never thwarted each other he hoped to see him united with flora and he rejoiced that they were effectually engaged in the same cause but as we before hinted he also exulted as a politician in beholding secured to his party a partizan of such consequence and he was far from being insensible to the personal importance which he himself gained with the prince from having so materially assisted in making the acquisition  charles edward on his part seemed eager to show his attendants the value which he attached to his new adherent by entering immediately as in confidence upon the circumstances of his situation you have been secluded so much from intelligence mr waverley from causes of which i am but indistinctly informed that i presume you are even yet unacquainted with the important particulars of my present situation you have however heard of my landing in the remote district of moidart with only seven attendants and of the numerous chiefs and clans whose loyal enthusiasm at once placed a solitary adventurer at the head of a gallant army you must also i think have learned that the commanderinchief of the hanoverian elector sir john cope marched into the highlands at the head of a numerous and wellappointed military force with the intention of giving us battle but that his courage failed him when we were within three hours march of each other so that he fairly gave us the slip and marched northward to aberdeen leaving the low country open and undefended not to lose so favourable an opportunity i marched on to this metropolis driving before me two regiments of horse gardiners and hamiltons who had threatened to cut to pieces every highlander that should venture to pass stirling and while discussions were carrying forward among the magistracy and citizens of edinburgh whether they should defend themselves or surrender my good friend lochiel laying his hand on the shoulder of that gallant and accomplished chieftain saved them the trouble of farther deliberation by entering the gates with five hundred camerons thus far therefore we have done well but in the meanwhile this doughty generals nerves being braced by the keen air of aberdeen he has taken shipping for dunbar and i have just received certain information that he landed there yesterday his purpose must unquestionably be to march towards us to recover possession of the capital now there are two opinions in my council of war one that being inferior probably in numbers and certainly in discipline and military appointments not to mention our total want of artillery and the weakness of our cavalry it will be safest to fall back towards the mountains and there protract the war until fresh succours arrive from france and the whole body of the highland clans shall have taken arms in our favour the opposite opinion maintains that a retrograde movement in our circumstances is certain to throw utter discredit on our arms and undertaking and far from gaining us new partizans will be the means of disheartening those who have joined our standard the officers who use these last arguments among whom is your friend fergus macivor maintain that if the highlanders are strangers to the usual military discipline of europe the soldiers whom they are to encounter are no less strangers to their peculiar and formidable mode of attack that the attachment and courage of the chiefs and gentlemen are not to be doubted and that as they will be in the midst of the enemy their clansmen will as surely follow them in fine that having drawn the sword we should throw away the scabbard and trust our cause to battle and to the god of battles will mr waverley favour us with his opinion in these arduous circumstances  waverley coloured high betwixt pleasure and modesty at the distinction implied in this question and answered with equal spirit and readiness that he could not venture to offer an opinion as derived from military skill but that the counsel would be far the most acceptable to him which should first afford him an opportunity to evince his zeal in his royal highnesss service  spoken like a waverley answered charles edward and that you may hold a rank in some degree corresponding to your name allow me instead of the captains commission which you have lost to offer you the brevet rank of major in my service with the advantage of acting as one of my aidesdecamp until you can be attached to a regiment of which i hope several will be speedily embodied  your royal highness will forgive me answered waverley for his recollection turned to balmawhapple and his scanty troop if i decline accepting any rank until the time and place where i may have interest enough to raise a sufficient body of men to make my command useful to your royal highnesss service in the meanwhile i hope for your permission to serve as a volunteer under my friend fergus macivor  at least said the prince who was obviously pleased with this proposal allow me the pleasure of arming you after the highland fashion with these words he unbuckled the broadsword which he wore the belt of which was plaited with silver and the steel baskethilt richly and curiously inlaid the blade said the prince is a genuine andrea ferrara it has been a sort of heirloom in our family but i am convinced i put it into better hands than my own and will add to it pistols of the same workmanship colonel macivor you must have much to say to your friend i will detain you no longer from your private conversation but remember we expect you both to attend us in the evening it may be perhaps the last night we may enjoy in these halls and as we go to the field with a clear conscience we will spend the eve of battle merrily  thus licensed the chief and waverley left the presencechamber     chapter xii  the mystery begins to be cleared up   how do you like him was ferguss first question as they descended the large stone staircase  a prince to live and die under was waverleys enthusiastic answer  i knew you would think so when you saw him and i intended you should have met earlier but was prevented by your sprain and yet he has his foibles or rather he has difficult cards to play and his irish officers footnote see note 30 who are much about him are but sorry advisers they cannot discriminate among the numerous pretensions that are set up would you think iti have been obliged for the present to suppress an earls patent granted for services rendered ten years ago for fear of exciting the jealousy forsooth of cand m but you were very right edward to refuse the situation of aidedecamp there are two vacant indeed but clanronald and lochiel and almost all of us have requested one for young aberchallader and the lowlanders and the irish party are equally desirous to have the other for the master of f now if either of these candidates were to be superseded in your favour you would make enemies and then i am surprised that the prince should have offered you a majority when he knows very well that nothing short of lieutenantcolonel will satisfy others who cannot bring one hundred and fifty men to the field but patience cousin and shuffle the cards it is all very well for the present and we must have you properly equipped for the evening in your new costume for to say truth your outward man is scarce fit for a court  why said waverley looking at his soiled dressmy shooting jacket has seen service since we parted but that probably you my friend know as well or better than i  you do my secondsight too much honour said fergus we were so busy first with the scheme of giving battle to cope and afterwards with our operations in the lowlands that i could only give general directions to such of our people as were left in perthshire to respect and protect you should you come in their way but let me hear the full story of your adventures for they have reached us in a very partial and mutilated manner  waverley then detailed at length the circumstances with which the reader is already acquainted to which fergus listened with great attention by this time they had reached the door of his quarters which he had taken up in a small paved court retiring from the street called the canongate at the house of a buxom widow of forty who seemed to smile very graciously upon the handsome young chief she being a person with whom good looks and goodhumour were sure to secure an interest whatever might be the partys political opinions here callum beg received them with a smile of recognition callum said the chief call shemus an snachad james of the needle this was the hereditary tailor of vich lan vohr shemus mr waverley is to wear the cath dath battle colour or tartan his trews must be ready in four hours you know the measure of a wellmade mantwo double nails to the small of the leg  eleven from haunch to heel seven round the waist i give your honour leave to hang shemus if theres a pair of sheers in the highlands that has a baulder sneck than hers ain at the cumadh an truais shape of the trews  get a plaid of macivor tartan and sash continued the chieftain and a blue bonnet of the princes pattern at mr mouats in the crames my short green coat with silver lace and silver buttons will fit him exactly and i have never worn it tell ensign maccombich to pick out a handsome target from among mine the prince has given mr waverley broadsword and pistols i will furnish him with a dirk and purse add but a pair of lowheeled shoes and then my dear edward turning to him you will be a complete son of ivor  these necessary directions given the chieftain resumed the subject of waverleys adventures it is plain he saidthat you have been in the custody of donald bean lean you must know that when i marched away my clan to join the prince i laid my injunctions on that worthy member of society to perform a certain piece of service which done he was to join me with all the force he could muster but instead of doing so the gentleman finding the coast clear thought it better to make war on his own account and has scoured the country plundering i believe both friend and foe under pretence of levying blackmail sometimes as if by my authority and sometimes and be cursed to his consummate impudence in his own great name upon my honour if i live to see the cairn of benmore again i shall be tempted to hang that fellow i recognise his hand particularly in the mode of your rescue from that canting rascal gilfillan and i have little doubt that donald himself played the part of the pedlar on that occasion but how he should not have plundered you or put you to ransom or availed himself in some way or other of your captivity for his own advantage passes my judgment  when and how did you hear the intelligence of my confinement asked waverley  the prince himself told me said fergus and inquired very minutely into your history he then mentioned your being at that moment in the power of one of our northern partiesyou know i could not ask him to explain particularsand requested my opinion about disposing of you i recommended that you should be brought here as a prisoner because i did not wish to prejudice you farther with the english government in case you pursued your purpose of going southward i knew nothing you must recollect of the charge brought against you of aiding and abetting high treason which i presume had some share in changing your original plan that sullen goodfornothing brute balmawhapple was sent to escort you from doune with what he calls his troop of horse as to his behaviour in addition to his natural antipathy to everything that resembles a gentleman i presume his adventure with bradwardine rankles in his recollection the rather that i daresay his mode of telling that story contributed to the evil reports which reached your quondam regiment  very likely said waverley but now surely my dear fergus you may find time to tell me something of flora  why replied fergus i can only tell you that she is well and residing for the present with a relation in this city i thought it better she should come here as since our success a good many ladies of rank attend our military court and i assure you that there is a sort of consequence annexed to the near relative of such a person as flora macivor and where there is such a justling of claims and requests a man must use every fair means to enhance his importance  there was something in this last sentence which grated on waverleys feelings he could not bear that flora should be considered as conducing to her brothers preferment by the admiration which she must unquestionably attract and although it was in strict correspondence with many points of ferguss character it shocked him as selfish and unworthy of his sisters high mind and his own independent pride fergus to whom such manoeuvres were familiar as to one brought up at the french court did not observe the unfavourable impression which he had unwarily made upon his friends mind and concluded by saying that they could hardly see flora before the evening when she would be at the concert and ball with which the princes party were to be entertained she and i had a quarrel about her not appearing to take leave of you i am unwilling to renew it by soliciting her to receive you this morning and perhaps my doing so might not only be ineffectual but prevent your meeting this evening  while thus conversing waverley heard in the court before the windows of the parlour a wellknown voice i aver to you my worthy friend said the speaker that it is a total dereliction of military discipline and were you not as it were a tyro your purpose would deserve strong reprobation for a prisoner of war is on no account to be coerced with fetters or debinded in ergastulo as would have been the case had you put this gentleman into the pit of the peelhouse at balmawhapple i grant indeed that such a prisoner may for security be coerced in carcere that is in a public prison  the growling voice of balmawhapple was heard as taking leave in displeasure but the word landlouper alone was distinctly audible he had disappeared before waverley reached the house in order to greet the worthy baron of bradwardine the uniform in which he was now attired a blue coat namely with gold lace a scarlet waistcoat and breeches and immense jackboots seemed to have added fresh stiffness and rigidity to his tall perpendicular figure and the consciousness of military command and authority had increased in the same proportion the selfimportance of his demeanour and the dogmatism of his conversation  he received waverley with his usual kindness and expressed immediate anxiety to hear an explanation of the circumstances attending the loss of his commission in gardiners dragoons not he said that he had the least apprehension of his young friend having done aught which could merit such ungenerous treatment as he had received from government but because it was right and seemly that the baron of bradwardine should be in point of trust and in point of power fully able to refute all calumnies against the heir of waverleyhonour whom he had so much right to regard as his own son  fergus macivor who had now joined them went hastily over the circumstances of waverleys story and concluded with the flattering reception he had met from the young chevalier the baron listened in silence and at the conclusion shook waverley heartily by the hand and congratulated him upon entering the service of his lawful prince for continued he although it has been justly held in all nations a matter of scandal and dishonour to infringe the sacramentum militare and that whether it was taken by each soldier singly whilk the romans denominated per conjurationem or by one soldier in name of the rest yet no one ever doubted that the allegiance so sworn was discharged by the dimissio or discharging of a soldier whose case would be as hard as that of colliers salters and other adscripti glebes or slaves of the soil were it to be accounted otherwise this is something like the brocard expressed by the learned sanchez in his work de jurejurando which you have questionless consulted upon this occasion as for those who have calumniated you by leasingmaking i protest to heaven i think they have justly incurred the penalty of the memnonia lex also called lex rhemnia which is prelected upon by tullius in his oration in verrem i should have deemed however mr waverley that before destining yourself to any special service in the army of the prince ye might have inquired what rank the old bradwardine held there and whether he would not have been peculiarly happy to have had your services in the regiment of horse which he is now about to levy edward eluded this reproach by pleading the necessity of giving an immediate answer to the princes proposal and his uncertainty at the moment whether his friend the baron was with the army or engaged upon service elsewhere  this punctilio being settled waverley made inquiry after miss bradwardine and was informed she had come to edinburgh with flora macivor under guard of a party of the chieftains men this step was indeed necessary tullyveolan having become a very unpleasant and even dangerous place of residence for an unprotected young lady on account of its vicinity to the highlands and also to one or two large villages which from aversion as much to the caterans as zeal for presbytery had declared themselves on the side of government and formed irregular bodies of partizans who had frequent skirmishes with the mountaineers and sometimes attacked the houses of the jacobite gentry in the braes or frontier betwixt the mountain and plain  i would propose to you continued the baronto walk as far as my quarters in the luckenbooths and to admire in your passage the high street whilk is beyond a shadow of dubitation finer than any street whether in london or paris but rose poor thing is sorely discomposed with the firing of the castle though i have proved to her from blondel and coehorn that it is impossible a bullet can reach these buildings and besides i have it in charge from his royal highness to go to the camp or leaguer of our army to see that the men do condamare vasa that is truss up their bag and baggage for tomorrows march  that will be easily done by most of us said macivor laughing  craving your pardon colonel macivor not quite so easily as ye seem to opine i grant most of your folk left the highlands expedited as it were and free from the incumbrance of baggage but it is unspeakable the quantity of useless sprechery which they have collected on their march i saw one fellow of yours craving your pardon once more with a pierglass upon his back  ay said fergus still in goodhumour he would have told you if you had questioned him a ganging foot is aye getting but come my dear baron you know as well as i that a hundred uhlans or a single troop of schmirschitzs pandours would make more havoc in a country than the knight of the mirror and all the rest of our clans put together  and that is very true likewise replied the baron they are as the heathen author says ferociores in aspectu mitiores in actu of a horrid and grim visage but more benign in demeanour than their physiognomy or aspect might infer but i stand here talking to you two youngsters when i should be in the kings park  but you will dine with waverley and me on your return i assure you baron though i can live like a highlander when needs must i remember my paris education and understand perfectly faire la meilleure chere  and wha the deil doubts it quoth the baron laughing when ye bring only the cookery and the gude toun must furnish the materials weel i have some business in the toun too but ill join you at three if the vivers can tarry so long  so saying he took leave of his friends and went to look after the charge which had been assigned him     chapter xiii  a soldiers dinner   james of the needle was a man of his word when whisky was no party to the contract and upon this occasion callum beg who still thought himself in waverleys debt since he had declined accepting compensation at the expense of mine host of the candlesticks person took the opportunity of discharging the obligation by mounting guard over the hereditary tailor of sliochd nan ivor and as he expressed himself targed him tightly till the finishing of the job to rid himself of this restraint shemuss needle flew through the tartan like lightning and as the artist kept chanting some dreadful skirmish of fin macoul he accomplished at least three stitches to the death of every hero the dress was therefore soon ready for the short coat fitted the wearer and the rest of the apparel required little adjustment  our hero having now fairly assumed the garb of old gaul well calculated as it was to give an appearance of strength to a figure which though tall and wellmade was rather elegant than robust i hope my fair readers will excuse him if he looked at himself in the mirror more than once and could not help acknowledging that the reflection seemed that of a very handsome young fellow in fact there was no disguising it his lightbrown hairfor he wore no periwig notwithstanding the universal fashion of the timebecame the bonnet which surmounted it his person promised firmness and agility to which the ample folds of the tartan added an air of dignity his blue eye seemed of that kind  which melted in love and which kindled in war  and an air of bashfulness which was in reality the effect of want of habitual intercourse with the world gave interest to his features without injuring their grace or intelligence  hes a pratty man a very pratty man said evan dhu now ensign maccombich to ferguss buxom landlady  hes vera weel said the widow flockhart but no naething sae weelfard as your colonel ensign  i wasna comparing them quoth evan nor was i speaking about his being weelfavoured but only that mr waverley looks cleanmade and deliver and like a proper lad o his quarters that will not cry barley in a brulzie and indeed hes gleg aneuch at the broadsword and target i hae played wi him mysell at glennaquoich and sae has vich lan vohr often of a sunday afternoon

thae tearing chields the dragoons ensign maccombich again inquired the landlady  claw for claw as conan said to satan mrs flockhart and the deevil tak the shortest nails  and will the colonel venture on the bagganets himsell  ye may swear it mrs flockhart the very first man will he be by saint phedar  merciful goodness and if hes killed amang the redcoats exclaimed the softhearted widow  troth if it should sae befall mrs flockhart i ken ane that will no be living to weep for him but we maun a live the day and have our dinner and theres vich lan vohr has packed his dorlach and mr waverleys wearied wi majoring yonder afore the muckle pierglass and that grey auld stoor carle the baron o bradwardine that shot young ronald of ballenkeiroch hes coming down the close wi that droghling coghling bailie body they ca macwhupple just like the laird o kittlegabs french cook wi his turnspit doggie trindling ahint him and i am as hungry as a gled my bonny dow sae bid kate set on the broo and do ye put on your pinners for ye ken vich lan vohr winna sit down till ye be at the head o the tableand dinna forget the pint bottle o brandy my woman  this hint produced dinner mrs flockhart smiling in her weeds like the sun through a mist took the head of the table thinking within herself perhaps that she cared not how long the rebellion lasted that brought her into company so much above her usual associates she was supported by waverley and the baron with the advantage of the chieftain visavis the men of peace and of war that is bailie macwheeble and ensign maccombich after many profound conges to their superiors and each other took their places on each side of the chieftain their fare was excellent time place and circumstances considered and ferguss spirits were extravagantly high regardless of danger and sanguine from temper youth and ambition he saw in imagination all his prospects crowned with success and was totally indifferent to the probable alternative of a soldiers grave the baron apologized slightly for bringing macwheeble they had been providing he said for the expenses of the campaign and by my faith said the old man as i think this will be my last so i just end where i began i hae evermore found the sinews of war as a learned author calls the caisse militaire mair difficult to come by than either its flesh blood or bones  what have you raised our only efficient body of cavalry and got ye none of the louisdor out of the doutelle footnote the doutelle was an armed vessel which brought a small supply of money and arms from france for the use of the insurgents to help you  no glennaquoich cleverer fellows have been before me  thats a scandal said the young highlander but you will share what is left of my subsidy it will save you an anxious thought tonight and will be all one tomorrow for we shall all be provided for one way or other before the sun sets waverley blushing deeply but with great earnestness pressed the same request  i thank ye baith my good lads said the baron but i will not infringe upon your peculium bailie macwheeble has provided the sum which is necessary  here the bailie shifted and fidgeted about in his seat and appeared extremely uneasy at length after several preliminary hems and much tautological expression of his devotion to his honours service by night or day living or dead he began to insinuate that the banks had removed a their ready cash into the castle that nae doubt sandie goldie the silversmith would do mickle for his honour but there was little time to get the wadset made out and doubtless if his honour glennaquoich or mr wauverley could accommodate  let me hear of no such nonsense sir said the baron in a tone which rendered macwheeble mute but proceed as we accorded before dinner if it be your wish to remain in my service  to this peremptory order the bailie though he felt as if condemned to suffer a transfusion of blood from his own veins into those of the baron did not presume to make any reply after fidgeting a little while longer however he addressed himself to glennaquoich and told him if his honour had mair ready siller than was sufficient for his occasions in the field he could put it out at use for his honour in safe hands and at great profit at this time  at this proposal fergus laughed heartily and answered when he had recovered his breathmany thanks bailie but you must know it is a general custom among us soldiers to make our landlady our banker here mrs flockhart said he taking four or five broad pieces out of a wellfilled purse and tossing the purse itself with its remaining contents into her apron these will serve my occasions do you take the rest be my banker if i live and my executor if i die but take care to give something to the highland cailliachs footnote old women on whom devolved the duty of lamenting for the dead which the irish call keening that shall cry the coronach loudest for the last vich lan vohr  it is the testamentum militare quoth the baron whilk amang the romans was privilegiate to be nuncupative but the soft heart of mrs flockhart was melted within her at the chieftains speech she set up a lamentable blubbering and positively refused to touch the bequest which fergus was therefore obliged to resume  well then said the chief if i fall it will go to the grenadier that knocks my brains out

martial law in some blind changehouse waverley with the baron and the chieftain proceeded to holyrood house the two last were in full tide of spirits and the baron rallied in his way our hero upon the handsome figure which his new dress displayed to advantage if you have any design upon the heart of a bonny scotch lassie i would premonish you when you address her to remember and quote the words of virgilius      nunc insanus amor duri me martis in armis     tela inter media atque adversos detinet hostes  whilk verses robertson of struan chief of the clan donnochy unless the claims of lude ought

her in his plaidy  by this time they reached the palace of holyrood and were announced respectively as they entered the apartments  it is but too well known how many gentlemen of rank education and fortune took a concern in the illfated and desperate undertaking of 1745 the ladies also of scotland very generally espoused the cause of the gallant and handsome young prince who threw himself upon the mercy of his countrymen rather like a hero of romance than a calculating politician it is not therefore to be wondered that edward who had spent the greater part of his life in the solemn seclusion of waverleyhonour should have been dazzled at the liveliness and elegance of the scene now exhibited in the long deserted halls of the scottish palace the accompaniments indeed fell short of splendour being such as the confusion and hurry of the time admitted still however the general effect was striking and the rank of the company considered might well be called brilliant  it was not long before the lovers eye discovered the object of his attachment flora macivor was in the act of returning to her seat near the top of the room with rose bradwardine by her side among much elegance and beauty they had attracted a great degree of the public attention being certainly two of the handsomest women present the prince took much notice of both particularly of flora with whom he danced a preference which she probably owed to her foreign education and command of the french and italian languages  when the bustle attending the conclusion of the dance permitted edward almost intuitively followed fergus to the place where miss macivor was seated the sensation of hope with which he had nursed his affection in absence of the beloved object seemed to vanish in her presence and like one striving to recover the particulars of a forgotten dream he would have given the world at that moment to have recollected the grounds on which he had founded expectations which now seemed so delusive he accompanied fergus with downcast eyes tingling ears and the feelings of the criminal who while the melancholy cart moves slowly through the crowds that have assembled to behold his execution receives no clear sensation either from the noise which fills his ears or the tumult on which he casts his wandering look flora seemed a littlea very littleaffected and discomposed at his approach i bring you an adopted son of ivor said fergus  and i receive him as a second brother replied flora  there was a slight emphasis on the word which would have escaped every ear but one that was feverish with apprehension it was however distinctly marked and combined with her whole tone and manner plainly intimated i will never think of mr waverley as a more intimate connexion edward stopped bowed and looked at fergus who bit his lip a movement of anger which proved that he also had put a sinister interpretation on the reception which his sister had given his friend this then is an end of my daydream such was waverleys first thought and it was so exquisitely painful as to banish from his cheek every drop of blood  good god said rose bradwardine he is not yet recovered  these words which she uttered with great emotion were overheard by the chevalier himself who stepped hastily forward and taking waverley by the hand inquired kindly after his health and added that he wished to speak with him by a strong and sudden effort which the circumstances rendered indispensable waverley recovered himself so far as to follow the chevalier in silence to a recess in the apartment  here the prince detained him some time asking various questions about the great tory and catholic families of england their connexions their influence and the state of their affections towards the house of stuart to these queries edward could not at any time have given more than general answers and it may be supposed that in the present state of his feelings his responses were indistinct even to confusion the chevalier smiled once or twice at the incongruity of his replies but continued the same style of conversation although he found himself obliged to occupy the principal share of it until he perceived that waverley had recovered his presence of mind it is probable that this long audience was partly meant to further the idea which the prince desired should be entertained among his followers that waverley was a character of political influence but it appeared from his concluding expressions that he had a different and goodnatured motive personal to our hero for prolonging the conference i cannot resist the temptation he said of boasting of my own discretion as a ladys confidant you see mr waverley that i know all and i assure you i am deeply interested in the affair but my good young friend you must put a more severe restraint upon your feelings there are many here whose eyes can see as clearly as mine but the prudence of whose tongues may not be equally trusted  so saying he turned easily away and joined a circle of officers at a few paces distance leaving waverley to meditate upon his parting expression which though not intelligible to him in its whole purport was sufficiently so in the caution which the last word recommended making therefore an effort to show himself worthy of the interest which his new master had expressed by instant obedience to his recommendation he walked up to the spot where flora and miss bradwardine were still seated and having made his compliments to the latter he succeeded even beyond his own expectation in entering into conversation upon general topics  if my dear reader thou hast ever happened to take posthorses ator atone at least of which blanks or more probably both you will be able to fill up from an inn near your own residence you must have observed and doubtless with sympathetic pain the reluctant agony with which the poor jades at first apply their galled necks to the collars of the harness but when the irresistible arguments of the postboy have prevailed upon them to proceed a mile or two they will become callous to the first sensation and being warm in the harness as the said postboy may term it proceed as if their withers were altogether unwrung this simile so much corresponds with the state of waverleys feelings in the course of this memorable evening that i prefer it especially as being i trust wholly original to any more splendid illustration with which byshes art of poetry might supply me  exertion like virtue is its own reward and our hero had moreover other stimulating motives for persevering in a display of affected composure and indifference to floras obvious unkindness pride which supplies its caustic as an useful though severe remedy for the wounds of affection came rapidly to his aid distinguished by the favour of a prince destined he had room to hope to play a conspicuous part in the revolution which awaited a mighty kingdom excelling probably in mental acquirements and equalling at least in personal accomplishments most of the noble and distinguished persons with whom he was now ranked young wealthy and highborncould he or ought he to droop beneath the frown of a capricious beauty      o nymph unrelenting and cold as thou art     my bosom is proud as thine own  with the feeling expressed in these beautiful lines which however were not then written footnote they occur in miss sewards fine verses beginningto thy rocks stormy lannow adieu waverley determined upon convincing flora that he was not to be depressed by a rejection in which his vanity whispered that perhaps she did her own prospects as much injustice as his and to aid this change of feeling there lurked the secret and unacknowledged hope that she might learn to prize his affection more highly when she did not conceive it to be altogether within her own choice to attract or repulse it there was a mystic tone of encouragement also in the chevaliers words though he feared they only referred to the wishes of fergus in favour of an union between him and his sister but the whole circumstances of time place and incident combined at once to awaken his imagination and to call upon him for a manly and decisive tone of conduct leaving to fate to dispose of the issue should he appear to be the only one sad and disheartened on the eve of battle how greedily would the tale be commented upon by the slander which had been already but too busy with his fame never never he internally resolved shall my unprovoked enemies possess such an advantage over my reputation  under the influence of these mixed sensations and cheered at times by a smile of intelligence and approbation from the prince as he passed the group waverley exerted his powers of fancy animation and eloquence and attracted the general admiration of the company the conversation gradually assumed the tone best qualified for the display of his talents and acquisitions the gaiety of the evening was exalted in character rather than checked by the approaching dangers of the morrow all nerves were strung for the future and prepared to enjoy the present this mood of mind is highly favourable for the exercise of the powers of imagination for poetry and for that eloquence which is allied to poetry waverley as we have elsewhere observed possessed at times a wonderful flow of rhetoric and on the present occasion he touched more than once the higher notes of feeling and then again ran off in a wild voluntary of fanciful mirth he was supported and excited by kindred spirits who felt the same impulse of mood and time and even those of more cold and calculating habits were hurried along by the torrent many ladies declined the dance which still went forward and under various pretences joined the party to which the handsome young englishman seemed to have attached himself he was presented to several of the first rank and his manners which for the present were altogether free from the bashful restraint by which in a moment of less excitation they were usually clouded gave universal delight  flora macivor appeared to be the only female present who regarded him with a degree of coldness and reserve yet even she could not suppress a sort of wonder at talents which in the course of their acquaintance she had never seen displayed with equal brilliancy and impressive effect i do not know whether she might not feel a momentary regret at having taken so decisive a resolution upon the addresses of a lover who seemed fitted so well to fill a high place in the highest stations of society certainly she had hitherto accounted among the incurable deficiencies of edwards disposition the mauvaise honte which as she had been educated in the first foreign circles and was little acquainted with the shyness of english manners was in her opinion too nearly related to timidity and imbecility of disposition but if a passing wish occurred that waverley could have rendered himself uniformly thus amiable and attractive its influence was momentary for circumstances had arisen since they met which rendered in her eyes the resolution she had formed respecting him final and irrevocable  with opposite feelings rose bradwardine bent her whole soul to listen she felt a secret triumph at the public tribute paid to one whose merit she had learned to prize too early and too fondly without a thought of jealousy without a feeling of fear pain or doubt and undisturbed by a single selfish consideration she resigned herself to the pleasure of observing the general murmur of applause when waverley spoke her ear was exclusively filled with his voice when others answered her eye took its turn of observation and seemed to watch his reply perhaps the delight which she experienced in the course of that evening though transient and followed by much sorrow was in its nature the most pure and disinterested which the human mind is capable of enjoying  baron said the chevalier i would not trust my mistress in the company of your young friend he is really though perhaps somewhat romantic one of the most fascinating young men whom i have ever seen  and by my honour sir replied the baronthe lad can sometimes be as dowff as a sexagenary like myself if your royal highness had seen him dreaming and dozing about the banks of tullyveolan like an hypochondriac person or as burtons anatomia hath it a phrenesiac or lethargic patient you would wonder where he hath sae suddenly acquired all this fine sprack festivity and jocularity  truly said fergus macivor i think it can only be the inspiration of the tartans for though waverley be always a young fellow of sense and honour i have hitherto often found him a very absent and inattentive companion  we are the more obliged to him said the prince for having reserved for this evening qualities which even such intimate friends had not discovered but come gentlemen the night advances and the business of tomorrow must be early thought upon each take charge of his fair partner and honour a small refreshment with your company  he led the way to another suite of apartments and assumed the seat and canopy at the head of a long range of tables with an air of dignity mingled with courtesy which well became his high birth and lofty pretensions an hour had hardly flown away when the musicians played the signal for parting so well known in scotland footnote which is or was wont to be the old air of goodnight and joy be wi you a  goodnight then said the chevalier rising goodnight and joy be with you goodnight fair ladies who have so highly honoured a proscribed and banished prince goodnight my brave friends may the happiness we have this evening experienced be an omen of our return to these our paternal halls speedily and in triumph and of many and many future meetings of mirth and pleasure in the palace of holyrood  when the baron of bradwardine afterwards mentioned this adieu of the chevalier he never failed to repeat in a melancholy tone     audiit et voti phoebus succedere partem     mente dedit partem volucres dispersit in auras  which as he added is weel rendered into english metre by my friend bangour      ae half the prayer wi phoebus grace did find     the tother half he whistled down the wind      chapter xv  the march   the conflicting passions and exhausted feelings of waverley had resigned him to late but sound repose he was dreaming of glennaquoich and had transferred to the halls of lan nan chaistel the festal train which so lately graced those of holyrood the pibroch too was distinctly heard and this at least was no delusion for the proud step of the chief piper of the chlain macivor was perambulating the court before the door of his chieftains quarters and as mrs flockhart apparently no friend to his minstrelsy was pleased to observe garring the very staneandlime was dingle wi his screeching of course it soon became too powerful for waverleys dream with which it had at first rather harmonised  the sound of callums brogues in his apartment for macivor had again assigned waverley to his care was the next note of parting winna yer honour bang up vich lan vohr and ta prince are awa to the lang green glen ahint the clachan tat they ca the kings park footnote the main body of the highland army encamped or rather bivouacked in that part of the kings park which lies towards the village of duddingston and mony anes on his ain shanks the day that will be carried on ither folks ere night  waverley sprung up and with callums assistance and instructions adjusted his tartans in proper costume callum told him also tat his leather dorlach wi the lock on her was come frae doune and she was awa again in the wain wi vich ian vohrs walise  by this periphrasis waverley readily apprehended his portmanteau was intended he thought upon the mysterious packet of the maid of the cavern which seemed always to escape him when within his very grasp but this was no time for indulgence of curiosity and having declined mrs flockharts compliment of a morning ie a matutinal dram being probably the only man in the chevaliers army by whom such a courtesy would have been rejected he made his adieus and departed with callum  callum said he as they proceeded down a dirty close to gain the southern skirts of the canongate what shall i do for a horse  ta deil ane ye maun think o said callum vich ian vohrs marching on foot at the head o his kin not to say ta prince wha does the like wi his target on his shoulder and ye maun een be neighbourlike  and so i will callum give me my target so there we are fixed how does it look  like the bra highlander tats painted on the board afore the mickle changehouse they ca luckie middlemasss answered callum meaning i must observe a high compliment for in his opinion luckie middlemasss sign was an exquisite specimen of art waverley however not feeling the full force of this polite simile asked him no further questions  upon extricating themselves from the mean and dirty suburbs of the metropolis and emerging into the open air waverley felt a renewal of both health and spirits and turned his recollection with firmness upon the events of the preceding evening and with hope and resolution towards those of the approaching day  when he had surmounted a small craggy eminence called st leonards hill the kings park or the hollow between the mountain of arthurs seat and the rising grounds on which the southern part of edinburgh is now built lay beneath him and displayed a singular and animating prospect it was occupied by the army of the highlanders now in the act of preparing for their march waverley had already seen something of the kind at the huntingmatch which he attended with fergus macivor but this was on a scale of much greater magnitude and incomparably deeper interest the rocks which formed the background of the scene and the very sky itself rang with the clang of the bagpipers summoning forth each with his appropriate pibroch his chieftain and clan the mountaineers rousing themselves from their couch under the canopy of heaven with the hum and bustle of a confused and irregular multitude like bees alarmed and arming in their hives seemed to possess all the pliability of movement fitted to execute military manoeuvres their motions appeared spontaneous and confused but the result was order and regularity so that a general must have praised the conclusion though a martinet might have ridiculed the method by which it was attained  the sort of complicated medley created by the hasty arrangements of the various clans under their respective banners for the purpose of getting into the order of march was in itself a gay and lively spectacle they had no tents to strike having generally and by choice slept upon the open field although the autumn was now waning and the nights began to be frosty for a little space while they were getting into order there was exhibited a changing fluctuating and confused appearance of waving tartans and floating plumes and of banners displaying the proud gathering word of clanronald ganion coheriga gainsay who dares lochsloy the watchword of the macfarlanes forth fortune and fill the fetters the motto of the marquis of tullibardine bydand that of lord lewis gordon and the appropriate signal words and emblems of many other chieftains and clans  at length the mixed and wavering multitude arranged themselves into a narrow and dusky column of great length stretching through the whole extent of the valley in the front of the column the standard of the chevalier was displayed bearing a red cross upon a white ground with the motto tandem triumphans the few cavalry being chiefly lowland gentry with their domestic servants and retainers formed the advanced guard of the army and their standards of which they had rather too many in respect of their numbers were seen waving upon the extreme verge of the horizon many horsemen of this body among whom waverley accidentally remarked balmawhapple and his lieutenant jinker which last however had been reduced with several others by the advice of the baron of bradwardine to the situation of what he called reformed officers or reformadoes added to the liveliness though by no means to the regularity of the scene by galloping their horses as fast forward as the press would permit to join their proper station in the van the fascinations of the circes of the high street and the potations of strength with which they had been drenched over night had probably detained these heroes within the walls of edinburgh somewhat later than was consistent with their morning duty of such loiterers the prudent took the longer and circuitous but more open route to attain their place in the march by keeping at some distance from the infantry and making their way through the inclosures to the right at the expense of leaping over or pulling down the drystone fences the irregular appearance and vanishing of these small parties of horsemen as well as the confusion occasioned by those who endeavoured though generally without effect to press to the front through the crowd of highlanders maugre their curses oaths and opposition added to the picturesque wildness what it took from the military regularity of the scene  while waverley gazed upon this remarkable spectacle rendered yet more impressive by the occasional discharge of cannonshot from the castle at the highland guards as they were withdrawn from its vicinity to join their main body callum with his usual freedom of interference reminded him that vich lan vohrs folk were nearly at the head of the column of march which was still distant and that they would gang very fast after the cannon fired thus admonished waverley walked briskly forward yet often casting a glance upon the darksome clouds of warriors who were collected before and beneath him a nearer view indeed rather diminished the effect impressed on the mind by the more distant appearance of the army the leading men of each clan were well armed with broadsword target and fusee to which all added the dirk and most the steel pistol but these consisted of gentlemen that is relations of the chief however distant and who had an immediate title to his countenance and protection finer and hardier men could not have been selected out of any army in christendom while the free and independent habits which each possessed and which each was yet so well taught to subject to the command of his chief and the peculiar mode of discipline adopted in highland warfare rendered them equally formidable by their individual courage and high spirit and from their rational conviction of the necessity of acting in unison and of giving their national mode of attack the fullest opportunity of success  but in a lower rank to these there were found individuals of an inferior description the common peasantry of the highland country who although they did not allow themselves to be so called and claimed often with apparent truth to be of more ancient descent than the masters whom they served bore nevertheless the livery of extreme penury being indifferently accoutred and worse armed half naked stinted in growth and miserable in aspect each important clan had some of those helots attached to them thus the maccouls though tracing their descent from comhal the father of finn or fingal were a sort of gibeonites or hereditary servants to the stewarts of appin the macbeths descended from the unhappy monarch of that name were subjects to the morays and clan donnochy or robertsons of athole and many other examples might be given were it not for the risk of hurting any pride of clanship which may yet be left and thereby drawing a highland tempest into the shop of my publisher now these same helots though forced into the field by the arbitrary authority of the chieftains under whom they hewed wood and drew water were in general very sparingly fed ill dressed and worse armed the latter circumstance was indeed owing chiefly to the general disarming act which had been carried into effect ostensibly through the whole highlands although most of the chieftains contrived to elude its influence by retaining the weapons of their own immediate clansmen and delivering up those of less value which they collected from these inferior satellites it followed as a matter of course that as we have already hinted many of these poor fellows were brought to the field in a very wretched condition  from this it happened that in bodies the van of which were admirably well armed in their own fashion the rear resembled actual banditti here was a poleaxe there a sword without a scabbard here a gun without a lock there a scythe set straight upon a pole and some had only their dirks and bludgeons or stakes pulled out of hedges the grim uncombed and wild appearance of these men most of whom gazed with all the admiration of ignorance upon the most ordinary productions of domestic art created surprise in the lowlands but it also created terror so little was the condition of the highlands known at that late period that the character and appearance of their population while thus sallying forth as military adventurers conveyed to the southcountry lowlanders as much surprise as if an invasion of african negroes or esquimaux indians had issued forth from the northern mountains of their own native country it cannot therefore be wondered if waverley who had hitherto judged of the highlanders generally from the samples which the policy of fergus had from time to time exhibited should have felt damped and astonished at the daring attempt of a body not then exceeding four thousand men and of whom not above half the number at the utmost were armed to change the fate and alter the dynasty of the british kingdoms  as he moved along the column which still remained stationary an iron gun the only piece of artillery possessed by the army which meditated so important a revolution was fired as the signal of march the chevalier had expressed a wish to leave this useless piece of ordnance behind him but to his surprise the highland chiefs interposed to solicit that it might accompany their march pleading the prejudices of their followers who little accustomed to artillery attached a degree of absurd importance to this fieldpiece and expected it would contribute essentially to a victory which they could only owe to their own muskets and broadswords two or three french artillerymen were therefore appointed to the management of this military engine which was drawn along by a string of highland ponies and was after all only used for the purpose of firing signals footnote see note 31  no sooner was its voice heard upon the present occasion than the whole line was in motion a wild cry of joy from the advancing batallions rent the air and was then lost in the shrill clangour of the bagpipes as the sound of these in their turn was partially drowned by the heavy tread of so many men put at once into motion the banners glittered and shook as they moved forward and the horse hastened to occupy their station as the advanced guard and to push on reconnoitring parties to ascertain and report the motions of the enemy they vanished from waverleys eye as they wheeled round the base of arthurs seat under the remarkable ridge of basaltic rocks which fronts the little lake of duddingston  the infantry followed in the same direction regulating their pace by another body which occupied a road more to the southward it cost edward some exertion of activity to attain the place which ferguss followers occupied in the line of march     chapter xvi  an incident gives rise to unavailing reflections   when waverley reached that part of the column which was filled by the clan of macivor they halted formed and received him with a triumphant flourish upon the bagpipes and a loud shout of the men most of whom knew him personally and were delighted to see him in the dress of their country and of their sept you shout said a highlander of a neighbouring clan to evan dhu as if the chieftain were just come to your head  mar e bran is e a brathair if it be not bran it is brans brother was the proverbial reply of maccombich footnote bran the wellknown dog of fingal is often the theme of highland proverb as well as song  o then it is the handsome sassenach duinhewassel that is to be married to lady flora  that may be or it may not be and it is neither your matter nor mine gregor  fergus advanced to embrace the volunteer and afford him a warm and hearty welcome but he thought it necessary to apologize for the diminished numbers of his battalion which did not exceed three hundred men by observing he had sent a good many out upon parties  the real fact however was that the defection of donald bean lean had deprived him of at least thirty hardy fellows whose services he had fully reckoned upon and that many of his occasional adherents had been recalled by their several chiefs to the standards to which they most properly owed their allegiance the rival chief of the great northern branch also of his own clan had mustered his people although he had not yet declared either for the government or for the chevalier and by his intrigues had in some degree diminished the force with which fergus took the field to make amends for these disappointments it was universally admitted that the followers of vich ian vohr in point of appearance equipment arms and dexterity in using them equalled the most choice troops which followed the standard of charles edward old ballenkeiroch acted as his major and with the other officers who had known waverley when at glennaquoich gave our hero a cordial reception as the sharer of their future dangers and expected honours  the route pursued by the highland army after leaving the village of duddingston was for some time the common postroad betwixt edinburgh and haddington until they crossed the esk at musselburgh when instead of keeping the low grounds towards the sea they turned more inland and occupied the brow of the eminence called carberry hill a place already distinguished in scottish history as the spot where the lovely mary surrendered herself to her insurgent subjects this direction was chosen because the chevalier had received notice that the army of the government arriving by sea from aberdeen had landed at dunbar and quartered the night before to the west of haddington with the intention of falling down towards the seaside and approaching edinburgh by the lower coastroad by keeping the height which overhung that road in many places it was hoped the highlanders might find an opportunity of attacking them to advantage the army therefore halted upon the ridge of carberry hill both to refresh the soldiers and as a central situation from which their march could be directed to any point that the motions of the enemy might render most advisable while they remained in this position a messenger arrived in haste to desire macivor to come to the prince adding that their advanced post had had a skirmish with some of the enemys cavalry and that the baron of bradwardine had sent in a few prisoners  waverley walked forward out of the line to satisfy his curiosity and soon observed five or six of the troopers who covered with dust had galloped in to announce that the enemy were in full march westward along the coast passing still a little farther on he was struck with a groan which issued from a hovel he approached the spot and heard a voice in the provincial english of his native county which endeavoured though frequently interrupted by pain to repeat the lords prayer the voice of distress always found a ready answer in our heros bosom he entered the hovel which seemed to be intended for what is called in the pastoral counties of scotland a smearinghouse and in its obscurity edward could only at first discern a sort of red bundle for those who had stripped the wounded man of his arms and part of his clothes had left him the dragooncloak in which he was enveloped  for the love of god said the wounded man as he heard waverleys step give me a single drop of water  you shall have it answered waverley at the same time raising him in his arms bearing him to the door of the hut and giving him some drink from his flask  i should know that voice said the man but looking on waverleys dress with a bewildered lookno this is not the young squire  this was the common phrase by which edward was distinguished on the estate of waverleyhonour and the sound now thrilled to his heart with the thousand recollections which the wellknown accents of his native country had already contributed to awaken houghton he said gazing on the ghastly features which death was fast disfiguring can this be you  i never thought to hear an english voice again said the wounded manthey left me to live or die here as i could when they found i would say nothing about the strength of the regiment but o squire how could you stay from us so long and let us be tempted by that fiend of the pit ruffin we should have followed you through flood and fire to be sure  ruffin i assure you houghton you have been vilely imposed upon  i often thought so said houghtonthough they showed us your very seal and so tims was shot and i was reduced to the ranks  do not exhaust your strength in speaking said edward i will get you a surgeon presently  he saw macivor approaching who was now returning from headquarters where he had attended a council of war and hastened to meet him brave news shouted the chief we shall be at it in less than two hours the prince has put himself at the head of the advance and as he drew his sword called out my friends i have thrown away the scabbard come waverley we move instantly  a momenta moment this poor prisoner is dying where shall i find a surgeon  why where should you we have none you know but two or three french fellows who i believe are little better than garcons apothecaires  but the man will bleed to death  poor fellow said fergus in a momentary fit of compassion then instantly added but it will be a thousand mens fate before night so come along  i cannot i tell you he is a son of a tenant of my uncles  o if hes a follower of yours he must be looked to ill send callum to you but diaoul ceade millia mottigheart continued the impatient chieftain what made an old soldier like bradwardine send dying men here to cumber us  callum came with his usual alertness and indeed waverley rather gained than lost in the opinion of the highlanders by his anxiety about the wounded man they would not have understood the general philanthropy which rendered it almost impossible for waverley to have passed any person in such distress but as apprehending that the sufferer was one of his following they unanimously allowed that waverleys conduct was that of a kind and considerate chieftain who merited the attachment of his people in about a quarter of an hour poor humphrey breathed his last praying his young master when he returned to waverleyhonour to be kind to old job houghton and his dame and conjuring him not to fight with these wild petticoatmen against old england  when his last breath was drawn waverley who had beheld with sincere sorrow and no slight tinge of remorse the final agonies of mortality now witnessed for the first time commanded callum to remove the body into the hut this the young highlander performed not without examining the pockets of the defunct which however he remarked had been pretty well spunged he took the cloak however and proceeding with the provident caution of a spaniel hiding a bone concealed it among some furze and carefully marked the spot observing that if he chanced to return that way it would be an excellent rokelay for his auld mother elspat  it was by a considerable exertion that they regained their place in the marching column which was now moving rapidly forward to occupy the high grounds above the village of tranent between which and the sea lay the purposed march of the opposite army  this melancholy interview with his late sergeant forced many unavailing and painful reflections upon waverleys mind it was clear from the confession of the man that colonel gardiners proceedings had been strictly warranted and even rendered indispensable by the steps taken in edwards name to induce the soldiers of his troop to mutiny the circumstance of the seal he now for the first time recollected and that he had lost it in the cavern of the robber bean lean that the artful villain had secured it and used it as the means of carrying on an intrigue in the regiment for his own purposes was sufficiently evident and edward had now little doubt that in the packet placed in his portmanteau by his daughter he should find farther light upon his proceedings in the meanwhile the repeated expostulation of houghtonah squire why did you leave us rung like a knell in his ears  yes he said i have indeed acted towards you with thoughtless cruelty i brought you from your paternal fields and the protection of a generous and kind landlord and when i had subjected you to all the rigour of military discipline i shunned to bear my own share of the burden and wandered from the duties i had undertaken leaving alike those whom it was my business to protect and my own reputation to suffer under the artifices of villainy o indolence and indecision of mind if not in yourselves vicesto how much exquisite misery and mischief do you frequently prepare the way     chapter xvii  the eve of battle   although the highlanders marched on very fast the sun was declining when they arrived upon the brow of those high grounds which command an open and extensive plain stretching northward to the sea on which are situated but at a considerable distance from each other the small villages of seaton and cockenzie and the larger one of preston one of the low coastroads to edinburgh passed through this plain issuing upon it from the enclosures of seaton house and at the town or village of preston again entering the denies of an enclosed country by this way the english general had chosen to approach the metropolis both as most commodious for his cavalry and being probably of opinion that by doing so he would meet in front with the highlanders advancing from edinburgh in the opposite direction in this he was mistaken for the sound judgment of the chevalier or of those to whose advice he listened left the direct passage free but occupied the strong ground by which it was overlooked and commanded  when the highlanders reached the heights above the plain described they were immediately formed in array of battle along the brow of the hill almost at the same instant the van of the english appeared issuing from among the trees and enclosures of seaton with the purpose of occupying the level plain between the high ground and the sea the space which divided the armies being only about half a mile in breadth waverley could plainly see the squadrons of dragoons issue one after another from the defiles with their videttes in front and form upon the plain with their front opposed to that of the princes army they were followed by a train of fieldpieces which when they reached the flank of the dragoons were also brought into line and pointed against the heights the march was continued by three or four regiments of infantry marching in open column their fixed bayonets showing like successive hedges of steel and their arms glancing like lightning as at a signal given they also at once wheeled up and were placed in direct opposition to the highlanders a second train of artillery with another regiment of horse closed the long march and formed on the left flank of the infantry the whole line facing southward  while the english army went through these evolutions the highlanders showed equal promptitude and zeal for battle as fast as the clans came upon the ridge which fronted their enemy they were formed into line so that both armies got into complete order of battle at the same moment when this was accomplished the highlanders set up a tremendous yell which was reechoed by the heights behind them the regulars who were in high spirits returned a loud shout of defiance and fired one or two of their cannon upon an advanced post of the highlanders the latter displayed great earnestness to proceed instantly to the attack evan dhu urging to fergus by way of argument that the sidier roy was tottering like an egg upon a staff and that they had a the vantage of the onset for even a haggis god bless her could charge down hill  but the ground through which the mountaineers must have descended although not of great extent was impracticable in its character being not only marshy but intersected with walls of dry stone and traversed in its whole length by a very broad and deep ditch circumstances which must have given the musketry of the regulars dreadful advantages before the mountaineers could have used their swords on which they were taught to rely the authority of the commanders was therefore interposed to curb the impetuosity of the highlanders and only a few marksmen were sent down the descent to skirmish with the enemys advanced posts and to reconnoitre the ground  here then was a military spectacle of no ordinary interest or usual occurrence the two armies so different in aspect and discipline yet each admirably trained in its own peculiar mode of war upon whose conflict the temporary fate at least of scotland appeared to depend now faced each other like two gladiators in the arena each meditating upon the mode of attacking their enemy the leading officers and the generals staff of each army could be distinguished in front of their lines busied with spyglasses to watch each others motions and occupied in despatching the orders and receiving the intelligence conveyed by the aidesdecamp and orderly men who gave life to the scene by galloping along in different directions as if the fate of the day depended upon the speed of their horses the space between the armies was at times occupied by the partial and irregular contest of individual sharpshooters and a hat or bonnet was occasionally seen to fall as a wounded man was borne off by his comrades these however were but trifling skirmishes for it suited the views of neither party to advance in that direction from the neighbouring hamlets the peasantry cautiously showed themselves as if watching the issue of the expected engagement and at no great distance in the bay were two squarerigged vessels bearing the english flag whose tops and yards were crowded with less timid spectators  when this awful pause had lasted for a short time fergus with another chieftain received orders to detach their clans towards the village of preston in order to threaten the right flank of copes army and compel him to a change of position to enable him to execute these orders the chief of glennaquoich occupied the churchyard of tranent a commanding situation and a convenient place as evan dhu remarked for any gentleman who might have the misfortune to be killed and chanced to be curious about christian burial to check or dislodge this party the english general detached two guns escorted by a strong party of cavalry they approached so near that waverley could plainly recognise the standard of the troop he had formerly commanded and hear the trumpets and kettledrums sound the signal of advance which he had so often obeyed he could hear too the wellknown word given in the english dialect by the equally welldistinguished voice of the commanding officer for whom he had once felt so much respect it was at that instant that looking around him he saw the wild dress and appearance of his highland associates heard their whispers in an uncouth and unknown language looked upon his own dress so unlike that which he had worn from his infancy and wished to awake from what seemed at the moment a dream strange horrible and unnatural good god he muttered am i then a traitor to my country a renegade to my standard and a foe as that poor dying wretch expressed himself to my native england  ere he could digest or smother the recollection the tall military form of his late commander came full in view for the purpose of reconnoitring i can hit him now said callum cautiously raising his fusee over the wall under which he lay couched at scarce sixty yards distance  edward felt as if he was about to see a parricide committed in his presence for the venerable grey hair and striking countenance of the veteran recalled the almost paternal respect with which his officers universally regarded him but ere he could say hold an aged highlander who lay beside callum beg stopped his arm spare your shot said the seer his hour is not yet come but let him beware of tomorrow i see his windingsheet high upon his breast  callum flint to other considerations was penetrable to superstition he turned pale at the words of the taishatr and recovered his piece colonel gardiner unconscious of the danger he had escaped turned his horse round and rode slowly back to the front of his regiment  by this time the regular army had assumed a new line with one flank inclined towards the sea and the other resting upon the village of preston and as similar difficulties occurred in attacking their new position fergus and the rest of the detachment were recalled to their former post this alteration created the necessity of a corresponding change in general copes army which was again brought into a line parallel with that of the highlanders in these manoeuvres on both sides the daylight was nearly consumed and both armies prepared to rest upon their arms for the night in the lines which they respectively occupied  there will be nothing done tonight said fergus to his friend waverley ere we wrap ourselves in our plaids let us go see what the baron is doing in the rear of the line  when they approached his post they found the good old careful officer after having sent out his night patrols and posted his sentinels engaged in reading the evening service of the episcopal church to the remainder of his troop his voice was loud and sonorous and though his spectacles upon his nose and the appearance of saunders saunderson in military array performing the functions of clerk had something ludicrous yet the circumstances of danger in which they stood the military costume of the audience and the appearance of their horses saddled and picqueted behind them gave an impressive and solemn effect to the office of devotion  i have confessed today ere you were awake whispered fergus to waverley yet i am not so strict a catholic as to refuse to join in this good mans prayers  edward assented and they remained till the baron had concluded the service  as he shut the book now lads said he have at them in the morning with heavy hands and light consciences he then kindly greeted macivor and waverley who requested to know his opinion of their situation why you know tacitus saith in rebus bellicis maxime dominalur fortuna which is equiponderate with our vernacular adage luck can maist in the mellee but credit me gentlemen yon man is not a deacon o his craft he damps the spirits of the poor lads he commands by keeping them on the defensive whilk of itself implies inferiority or fear now will they lie on their arms yonder as anxious and as ill at ease as a toad under a harrow while our men will be quite fresh and blithe for action in the morning well goodnight one thing troubles me but if tomorrow goes well off i will consult you about it glennaquoich  i could almost apply to mr bradwardine the character which henry gives of fluellen said waverley as his friend and he walked towards their bivouac      though it appears a little out of fashion     there is much care and valour in this scotchman  he has seen much service answered fergus and one is sometimes astonished to find how much nonsense and reason are mingled in his composition i wonder what can be troubling his mind probably something about rose hark the english are setting their watch  the roll of the drum and shrill accompaniment of the fifes swelled up the hilldied awayresumed its thunderand was at length hushed the trumpets and kettledrums of the cavalry were next heard to perform the beautiful and wild point of war appropriated as a signal for that piece of nocturnal duty and then finally sunk upon the wind with a shrill and mournful cadence  the friends who had now reached their post stood and looked round them ere they lay down to rest the western sky twinkled with stars but a frostmist rising from the ocean covered the eastern horizon and rolled in white wreaths along the plain where the adverse army lay couched upon their arms their advanced posts were pushed as far as the side of the great ditch at the bottom of the descent and had kindled large fires at different intervals gleaming with obscure and hazy lustre through the heavy fog which encircled them with a doubtful halo  the highlanders thick as leaves in vallombrosa lay stretched upon the ridge of the hill buried excepting their sentinels in the most profound repose how many of these brave fellows will sleep more soundly before tomorrow night fergus said waverley with an involuntary sigh  you must not think of that answered fergus whose ideas were entirely military you must only think of your sword and by whom it was given all other reflections are now too late  with the opiate contained in this undeniable remark edward endeavoured to lull the tumult of his conflicting feelings the chieftain and he combining their plaids made a comfortable and warm couch callum sitting down at their head for it was his duty to watch upon the immediate person of the chief began a long mournful song in gaelic to a low and uniform tune which like the sound of the wind at a distance soon lulled them to sleep     chapter xviii  the conflict   when fergus macivor and his friend had slept for a few hours they were awakened and summoned to attend the prince the distant village clock was heard to toll three as they hastened to the place where he lay he was already surrounded by his principal officers and the chiefs of clans a bundle of peasestraw which had been lately his couch now served for his seat just as fergus reached the circle the consultation had broken up courage my brave friends said the chevalier and each one put himself instantly at the head of his command a faithful friend footnote see note 32 has offered to guide us by a practicable though narrow and circuitous route which sweeping to our right traverses the broken ground and morass and enables us to gain the firm and open plain upon which the enemy are lying this difficulty surmounted heaven and your good swords must do the rest  the proposal spread unanimous joy and each leader hastened to get his men into order with as little noise as possible the army moving by its right from off the ground on which they had rested soon entered the path through the morass conducting their march with astonishing silence and great rapidity the mist had not risen to the higher grounds so that for some time they had the advantage of starlight but this was lost as the stars faded before approaching day and the head of the marching column continuing its descent plunged as it were into the heavy ocean of fog which rolled its white waves over the whole plain and over the sea by which it was bounded some difficulties were now to be encountered inseparable from darkness a narrow broken and marshy path and the necessity of preserving union in the march these however were less inconvenient to highlanders from their habits of life than they would have been to any other troops and they continued a steady and swift movement  as the clan of ivor approached the firm ground following the track of those who preceded them the challenge of a patrol was heard through the mist though they could not see the dragoon by whom it was madewho goes there  hush cried fergus hush let none answer as he values his life press forward and they continued their march with silence and rapidity  the patrol fired his carabine upon the body and the report was instantly followed by the clang of his horses feet as he galloped off hylax in limine latrat said the baron of bradwardine who heard the shot that loon will give the alarm  the clan of fergus had now gained the firm plain which had lately borne a large crop of corn but the harvest was gathered in and the expanse was unbroken by tree bush or interruption of any kind the rest of the army were following fast when they heard the drums of the enemy beat the general surprise however had made no part of their plan so they were not disconcerted by this intimation that the foe was upon his guard and prepared to receive them it only hastened their dispositions for the combat which were very simple  the highland army which now occupied the eastern end of the wide plain or stubble field so often referred to was drawn up in two lines extending from the morass towards the sea the first was destined to charge the enemy the second to act as a reserve the few horse whom the prince headed in person remained between the two lines the adventurer had intimated a resolution to charge in person at the head of his first line but his purpose was deprecated by all around him and he was with difficulty induced to abandon it  both lines were now moving forward the first prepared for instant combat the clans of which it was composed formed each a sort of separate phalanx narrow in front and in depth ten twelve or fifteen files according to the strength of the following the bestarmed and bestborn for the words were synonymous were placed in front of each of these irregular subdivisions the others in the rear shouldered forward the front and by their pressure added both physical impulse and additional ardour and confidence to those who were first to encounter the danger  down with your plaid waverley cried fergus throwing off his own well win silks for our tartans before the sun is above the sea  the clansmen on every side stript their plaids prepared their arms and there was an awful pause of about three minutes during which the men pulling off their bonnets raised their faces to heaven and uttered a short prayer then pulled their bonnets over their brows and began to move forward at first slowly waverley felt his heart at that moment throb as it would have burst from his bosom it was not fear it was not ardour it was a compound of both a new and deeply energetic impulse that with its first emotion chilled and astounded then fevered and maddened his mind the sounds around him combined to exalt his enthusiasm the pipes played and the clans rushed forward each in its own dark column as they advanced they mended their pace and the muttering sounds of the men to each other began to swell into a wild cry  at this moment the sun which was now risen above the horizon dispelled the mist the vapours rose like a curtain and showed the two armies in the act of closing the line of the regulars was formed directly fronting the attack of the highlanders it glittered with the appointments of a complete army and was flanked by cavalry and artillery but the sight impressed no terror on the assailants  forward sons of ivor cried their chief or the camerons will draw the first blood they rushed on with a tremendous yell  the rest is well known the horse who were commanded to charge the advancing highlanders in the flank received an irregular fire from their fusees as they ran on and seized with a disgraceful panic wavered halted disbanded and galloped from the field the artillery men deserted by the cavalry fled after discharging their pieces and the highlanders who dropped their guns when fired and drew their broadswords rushed with headlong fury against the infantry  it was at this moment of confusion and terror that waverley remarked an english officer apparently of high rank standing alone and unsupported by a fieldpiece which after the flight of the men by whom it was wrought he had himself levelled and discharged against the clan of macivor the nearest group of highlanders within his aim struck with his tall martial figure and eager to save him from inevitable destruction waverley outstripped for an instant even the speediest of the warriors and reaching the spot first called to him to surrender the officer replied by a thrust with his sword which waverley received in his target and in turning it aside the englishmans weapon broke at the same time the battleaxe of dugald mahony was in the act of descending upon the officers head waverley intercepted and prevented the blow and the officer perceiving further resistance unavailing and struck with edwards generous anxiety for his safety resigned the fragment of his sword and was committed by waverley to dugald with strict charge to use him well and not to pillage his person promising him at the same time full indemnification for the spoil  on edwards right the battle for a few minutes raged fierce and thick the english infantry trained in the wars in flanders stood their ground with great courage but their extended files were pierced and broken in many places by the close masses of the clans and in the personal struggle which ensued the nature of the highlanders weapons and their extraordinary fierceness and activity gave them a decided superiority over those who had been accustomed to trust much to their array and discipline and felt that the one was broken and the other useless waverley as he cast his eyes towards this scene of smoke and slaughter observed colonel gardiner deserted by his own soldiers in spite of all his attempts to rally them yet spurring his horse through the field to take the command of a small body of infantry who with their backs arranged against the wall of his own park for his house was close by the field of battle continued a desperate and unavailing resistance waverley could perceive that he had already received many wounds his clothes and saddle being marked with blood to save this good and brave man became the instant object of his most anxious exertions but he could only witness his fall ere edward could make his way among the highlanders who furious and eager for spoil now thronged upon each other he saw his former commander brought from his horse by the blow of a scythe and beheld him receive while on the ground more wounds than would have let out twenty lives when waverley came up however perception had not entirely fled the dying warrior seemed to recognize edward for he fixed his eye upon him with an upbraiding yet sorrowful look and appeared to struggle for utterance but he felt that death was dealing closely with him and resigning his purpose and folding his hands as if in devotion he gave up his soul to his creator the look with which he regarded waverley in his dying moments did not strike him so deeply at that crisis of hurry and confusion as when it recurred to his imagination at the distance of some time footnote see note 33      loud shouts of triumph now echoed over the whole field the battle was fought and won and the whole baggage artillery and military stores of the regular army remained in possession of the victors never was a victory more complete scarce any escaped from the battle excepting the cavalry who had left it at the very onset and even these were broken into different parties and scattered all over the country so far as our tale is concerned we have only to relate the fate of balmawhapple who mounted on a horse as headstrong and stiffnecked as his rider pursued the flight of the dragoons above four miles from the field of battle when some dozen of the fugitives took heart of grace turned round and cleaving his skull with their broadswords satisfied the world that the unfortunate gentleman had actually brains the end of his life thus giving proof of a fact greatly doubted during its progress his death was lamented by few most of those who knew him agreed in the pithy observation of ensign maccombich that there was mair tint lost at sheriffmuir his friend lieutenant jinker bent his eloquence only to exculpate his favourite mare from any share in contributing to the catastrophe he had tauld the laird a thousand times he said that it was a burning shame to put a martingale upon the puir thing when he would needs ride her wi a curb of half a yard lang and that he could na but bring himsell not to say her to some mischief by flinging her down or otherwise whereas if he had had a wee bit rinnin ring on the snaffle she wad ha reind as cannily as a cadgers pownie  such was the elegy of the laird of balmawhapple footnote see note 34     chapter xix  an unexpected embarrassment   when the battle was over and all things coming into order the baron of bradwardine returning from the duty of the day and having disposed those under his command in their proper stations sought the chieftain of glennaquoich and his friend edward waverley he found the former busied in determining disputes among his clansmen about points of precedence and deeds of valour besides sundry high and doubtful questions concerning plunder the most important of the last respected the property of a gold watch which had once belonged to some unfortunate english officer the party against whom judgment was awarded consoled himself by observing she ie the watch which he took for a living animal died the very night vich lan vohr gave her to murdoch the machine having in fact stopped for want of winding up  it was just when this important question was decided that the baron of bradwardine with a careful and yet important expression of countenance joined the two young men he descended from his reeking charger the care of which he recommended to one of his grooms i seldom ban sir said he to the man but if you play any of your houndsfoot tricks and leave puir berwick before hes sorted to rin after spuilzie deil be wi me if i do not give your craig a thraw he then stroked with great complacency the animal which had borne him through the fatigues of the day and having taken a tender leave of him weel my good young friends a glorious and decisive victory said he but these loons of troopers fled ower soon i should have liked to have shown you the true points of the pralium equestre or equestrian combat whilk their cowardice has postponed and which i hold to be the pride and terror of warfare weeli have fought once more in this old quarrel though i admit i could not be so far ben as you lads being that it was my point of duty to keep together our handful of horse and no cavalier ought in any wise to begrudge honour that befalls his companions even though they are ordered upon thrice his danger whilk another time by the blessing of god may be his own case but glennaquoich and you mr waverley i pray ye to give me your best advice on a matter of mickle weight and which deeply affects the honour of the house of bradwardine i crave your pardon ensign maccombich and yours inveraughlin and yours edderalshendrach and yours sir  the last person he addressed was ballenkeiroch who remembering the death of his son loured on him with a look of savage defiance the baron quick as lightning at taking umbrage had already bent his brow when glennaquoich dragged his major from the spot and remonstrated with him in the authoritative tone of a chieftain on the madness of reviving a quarrel in such a moment  the ground is cumbered with carcasses said the old mountaineer turning sullenly away one more would hardly have been kennd upon it and if it wasna for yoursell vich lan vohr that one should be bradwardines or mine  the chief soothed while he hurried him away and then returned to the baron it is ballenkeiroch he said in an under and confidential voice father of the young man who fell eight years since in the unlucky affair at the mains  ah said the baron instantly relaxing the doubtful sternness of his features i can take mickle frae a man to whom i have unhappily rendered sic a displeasure as that ye were right to apprise me glennaquoich he may look as black as midnight at martinmas ere cosmo comyne bradwardine shall say he does him wrang ah i have nae male lineage and i should bear with one i have made childless though you are aware the bloodwit was made up to your ain satisfaction by assythment and that i have since expedited letters of slains weel as i have said i have no male issue and yet it is needful that i maintain the honour of my house and it is on that score i prayed ye for your peculiar and private attention  the two young men awaited to hear him in anxious curiosity  i doubt na lads he proceeded but your education has been sae seen to that ye understand the true nature of the feudal tenures  fergus afraid of an endless dissertation answered intimately baron and touched waverley as a signal to express no ignorance  and ye are aware i doubt not that the holding of the barony of bradwardine is of a nature alike honourable and peculiar being blanch which craig opines ought to be latinated blancum or rather francum a free holding pro servitio detrahendi seu exuendi caligas regis post battalliam here fergus turned his falcon eye upon edward with an almost imperceptible rise of his eyebrow to which his shoulders corresponded in the same degree of elevation now twa points of dubitation occur to me upon this topic first whether this service or feudal homage be at any event due to the person of the prince the words being per expressum caligas regis the boots of the king himself and i pray your opinion anent that particular before we proceed farther  why he is prince regent answered macivor with laudable composure of countenance and in the court of france all the honours are rendered to the person of the regent which are due to that of the king besides were i to pull off either of their boots i would render that service to the young chevalier ten times more willingly than to his father  ay but i talk not of personal predilections however your authority is of great weight as to the usages of the court of france and doubtless the prince as alter ego may have a right to claim the homagium of the great tenants of the crown since all faithful subjects are commanded in the commission of regency to respect him as the kings own person far therefore be it from me to diminish the lustre of his authority by withholding this act of homage so peculiarly calculated to give it splendour for i question if the emperor of germany hath his boots taken off by a free baron of the empire but here lieth the second difficultythe prince wears no boots but simply brogues and trews  this last dilemma had almost disturbed ferguss gravity  why said he you know baron the proverb tells us its ill taking the breeks off a highlandman and the boots are here in the same predicament  the word caligae however continued the baron though i admit that by family tradition and even in our ancient evidents it is explained lieboots means in its primitive sense rather sandals and caius caesar the nephew and successor of caius tiberius received the agnomen of caligula a caligulis sine caligis levioribus quibus adolescentior usus fuerat in exercitu germanici patris sui and the caligae were also proper to the monastic bodies for we read in an ancient glossarium upon the rule of saint benedict in the abbey of saint amand that caligae were tied with latchets  that will apply to the brogues said fergus  it will so my dear glennaquoich and the words are express caligae dicta sunt quia ligantur nam socci non ligantur sed tantum intromittuntur that is caligae are denominated from the ligatures wherewith they are bound whereas socci which may be analogous to our mules whilk the english denominate slippers are only slipped upon the feet the words of the charter are also alternative exuere seu detrahere that is to undo as in the case of sandals or brogues and to pull of as we say vernacularly concerning boots yet i would we had more light but i fear there is little chance of finding hereabout any erudite author de re vestiaria  i should doubt it very much said the chieftain looking around on the straggling highlanders who were returning loaded with spoils of the slainthough the res vestiaria itself seems to be in some request at present  this remark coming within the barons idea of jocularity he honoured it with a smile but immediately resumed what to him appeared very serious business  bailie macwheeble indeed holds an opinion that this honorary service is due from its very nature si petatur tantum only if his royal highness shall require of the great tenant of the crown to perform that personal duty and indeed he pointed out the case in dirletons doubts and queries grippit versus spicer anent the eviction of an estate ob non solutum canonem that is for nonpayment of a feuduty of three peppercorns a year whilk were taxt to be worth seveneighths of a penny scots in whilk the defender was assoilzied but i deem it safest wi your good favour to place myself in the way of rendering the prince this service and to proffer performance thereof and i shall cause the bailie to attend with a schedule of a protest whilk he has here prepared taking out a paper intimating that if it shall be his royal highnesss pleasure to accept of other assistance at pulling off his caligae whether the same shall be rendered boots or brogues save that of the said baron of bradwardine who is in presence ready and willing to perform the same it shall in no wise impinge upon or prejudice the right of the said cosmo comyne bradwardine to perform the said service in future nor shall it give any esquire valet of the chamber squire or page whose assistance it may please his royal highness to employ any right title or ground for evicting from the said cosmo comyne bradwardine the estate and barony of bradwardine and others held as aforesaid by the due and faithful performance thereof  fergus highly applauded this arrangement and the baron took a friendly leave of them with a smile of contented importance upon his visage  long live our dear friend the baron exclaimed the chief as soon as he was out of hearing for the most absurd original that exists north of the tweed i wish to heaven i had recommended him to attend the circle this evening with a bootketch under his arm i think he might have adopted the suggestion if it had been made with suitable gravity  and how can you take pleasure in making a man of his worth so ridiculous  begging pardon my dear waverley you are as ridiculous as he why do you not see that the mans whole mind is wrapped up in this ceremony he has heard and thought of it since infancy as the most august privilege and ceremony in the world and i doubt not but the expected pleasure of performing it was a principal motive with him for taking up arms depend upon it had i endeavoured to divert him from exposing himself he would have treated me as an ignorant conceited coxcomb or perhaps might have taken a fancy to cut my throat a pleasure which he once proposed to himself upon some point of etiquette not half so important in his eyes as this matter of boots or brogues or whatever the caliga shall finally be pronounced by the learned but i must go to headquarters to prepare the prince for this extraordinary scene my information will be well taken for it will give him a hearty laugh at present and put him on his guard against laughing when it might be very malapropos so au revoir my dear waverley     chapter vii  the english prisoner   the first occupation of waverley after he departed from the chieftain was to go in quest of the officer whose life he had saved he was guarded along with his companions in misfortune who were very numerous in a gentlemans house near the field of battle  on entering the room where they stood crowded together waverley easily recognised the object of his visit not only by the peculiar dignity of his appearance but by the appendage of dugald mahony with his battleaxe who had stuck to him from the moment of his captivity as if he had been skewered to his side this close attendance was perhaps for the purpose of securing his promised reward from edward but it also operated to save the english gentleman from being plundered in the scene of general confusion for dugald sagaciously argued that the amount of the salvage which he might be allowed would be regulated by the state of the prisoner when he should deliver him over to waverley he hastened to assure waverley therefore with more words than he usually employed that he had keepit ta sidier roy haill and that he wasna a plack the waur since the fery moment when his honour forbad her to gie him a bit clamhewit wi her lochaberaxe  waverley assured dugald of a liberal recompense and approaching the english officer expressed his anxiety to do anything which might contribute to his convenience under his present unpleasant circumstances  i am not so inexperienced a soldier sir answered the englishman as to complain of the fortune of war i am only grieved to see those scenes acted in our own island which i have often witnessed elsewhere with comparative indifference  another such day as this said waverley and i trust the cause of your regrets will be removed and all will again return to peace and order  the officer smiled and shook his head i must not forget my situation so far as to attempt a formal confutation of that opinion but notwithstanding your success and the valour which achieved it you have undertaken a task to which your strength appears wholly inadequate  at this moment fergus pushed into the press  come edward come along the prince has gone to pinkie house for the night and we must follow or lose the whole ceremony of the caligae your friend the baron has been guilty of a great piece of cruelty he has insisted upon dragging bailie macwheeble out to the field of battle now you must know the bailies greatest horror is an armed highlander or a loaded gun and there he stands listening to the barons instructions concerning the protest ducking his head like a seagull at the report of every gun and pistol that our idle boys are firing upon the fields and undergoing by way of penance at every symptom of flinching a severe rebuke from his patron who would not admit the discharge of a whole battery of cannon within pointblank distance as an apology for neglecting a discourse in which the honour of his family is interested  but how has mr bradwardine got him to venture so far said edward  why he had come as far as musselburgh i fancy in hopes of making some of our wills and the peremptory commands of the baron dragged him forward to preston after the battle was over he complains of one or two of our ragamuffins having put him in peril of his life by presenting their pieces at him but as they limited his ransom to an english penny i dont think we need trouble the provostmarshal upon that subject so come along waverley  waverley said the english officer with great emotion the nephew of sir everard waverley ofshire  the same sir replied our hero somewhat surprised at the tone in which he was addressed  i am at once happy and grieved said the prisoner to have met with you  i am ignorant sir answered waverley how i have deserved so much interest  did your uncle never mention a friend called talbot  i have heard him talk with great regard of such a person replied edward a colonel i believe in the army and the husband of lady emily blandeville but i thought colonel talbot had been abroad  i am just returned answered the officer and being in scotland thought it my duty to act where my services promised to be useful yes mr waverley i am that colonel talbot the husband of the lady you have named and i am proud to acknowledge that i owe alike my professional rank and my domestic happiness to your generous and nobleminded relative good god that i should find his nephew in such a dress and engaged in such a cause  sir said fergus haughtily the dress and cause are those of men of birth and honour  my situation forbids me to dispute your assertion said colonel talbot otherwise it were no difficult matter to show that neither courage nor pride of lineage can gild a bad cause but with mr waverleys permission and yours sir if yours also must be asked i would willingly speak a few words with him on affairs connected with his own family  mr waverley sir regulates his own motions you will follow me i suppose to pinkie said fergus turning to edward when you have finished your discourse with this new acquaintance so saying the chief of glennaquoich adjusted his plaid with rather more than his usual air of haughty assumption and left the apartment  the interest of waverley readily procured for colonel talbot the freedom of adjourning to a large garden belonging to his place of confinement they walked a few paces in silence colonel talbot apparently studying how to open what he had to say at length he addressed edward  mr waverley you have this day saved my life and yet i would to god that i had lost it ere i had found you wearing the uniform and cockade of these men  i forgive your reproach colonel talbot it is well meant and your education and prejudices render it natural but there is nothing extraordinary in finding a man whose honour has been publicly and unjustly assailed in the situation which promised most fair to afford him satisfaction on his calumniators  i should rather say in the situation most likely to confirm the reports which they have circulated said colonel talbot by following the very line of conduct ascribed to you are you aware mr waverley of the infinite distress and even danger which your present conduct has occasioned to your nearest relatives  danger  yes sir danger when i left england your uncle and father had been obliged to find bail to answer a charge of treason to which they were only admitted by the exertion of the most powerful interest i came down to scotland with the sole purpose of rescuing you from the gulf into which you have precipitated yourself nor can i estimate the consequences to your family of your having openly joined the rebellion since the very suspicion of your intention was so perilous to them most deeply do i regret that i did not meet you before this last and fatal error  i am really ignorant said waverley in a tone of reserve why colonel talbot should have taken so much trouble on my account  mr waverley answered talbot i am dull at apprehending irony and therefore i shall answer your words according to their plain meaning i am indebted to your uncle for benefits greater than those which a son owes to a father i acknowledge to him the duty of a son and as i know there is no manner in which i can requite his kindness so well as by serving you i will serve you if possible whether you will permit me or no the personal obligation which you have this day laid me under although in common estimation as great as one human being can bestow on another adds nothing to my zeal on your behalf nor can that zeal be abated by any coolness with which you may please to receive it  your intentions may be kind sir said waverley drily but your language is harsh or at least peremptory  on my return to england continued colonel talbot after long absence i found your uncle sir everard waverley in the custody of a kings messenger in consequence of the suspicion brought upon him by your conduct he is my oldest friendhow often shall i repeat itmy best benefactor he sacrificed his own views of happiness to mine he never uttered a word he never harboured a thought that benevolence itself might not have thought or spoken i found this man in confinement rendered harsher to him by his habits of life his natural dignity of feeling andforgive me mr waverleyby the cause through which this calamity had come upon him i cannot disguise from you my feelings upon this occasion they were most painfully unfavorable to you having by my family interest which you probably know is not inconsiderable succeeded in obtaining sir everards release i set out for scotland i saw colonel gardiner a man whose fate alone is sufficient to render this insurrection for ever execrable in the course of conversation with him i found that from late circumstances from a reexamination of the persons engaged in the mutiny and from his original good opinion of your character he was much softened towards you and i doubted not that if i could be so fortunate as to discover you all might yet be well but this unnatural rebellion has ruined all i have for the first time in a long and active military life seen britons disgrace themselves by a panic flight and that before a foe without either arms or discipline and now i find the heir of my dearest friendthe son i may say of his affectionssharing a triumph for which he ought the first to have blushed why should i lament gardiner his lot was happy compared to mine  there was so much dignity in colonel talbots manner such a mixture of military pride and manly sorrow and the news of sir everards imprisonment was told in so deep a tone of feeling that edward stood mortified abashed and distressed in presence of the prisoner who owed to him his life not many hours before he was not sorry when fergus interrupted their conference a second time  his royal highness commands mr waverleys attendance colonel talbot threw upon edward a reproachful glance which did not escape the quick eye of the highland chief his immediate attendance he repeated with considerable emphasis waverley turned again towards the colonel  we shall meet again he said in the meanwhile every possible accommodation  i desire none said the colonel let me fare like the meanest of those brave men who on this day of calamity have preferred wounds and captivity to flight i would almost exchange places with one of those who have fallen to know that my words have made a suitable impression on your mind  let colonel talbot be carefully secured said fergus to the highland officer who commanded the guard over the prisoners it is the princes particular command he is a prisoner of the utmost importance  but let him want no accommodation suitable to his rank said waverley consistent always with secure custody reiterated fergus the officer signified his acquiescence in both commands and edward followed fergus to the gardengate where callum beg with three saddlehorses awaited them turning his head he saw colonel talbot reconducted to his place of confinement by a file of highlanders he lingered on the threshold of the door and made a signal with his hand towards waverley as if enforcing the language he had held towards him  horses said fergus as he mounted are now as plenty as blackberries every man may have them for the catching come let callum adjust your stirrups and let us to pinkie house footnote charles edward took up his quarters after the battle at pinkie house adjoining to musselburgh as fast as these cidevant dragoonhorses choose to carry us     chapter xxi  rather unimportant   i was turned back said fergus to edward as they galloped from preston to pinkie house by a message from the prince but i suppose you know the value of this most noble colonel talbot as a prisoner he is held one of the best officers among the redcoats a special friend and favourite of the elector himself and of that dreadful hero the duke of cumberland who has been summoned from his triumphs at fontenoy to come over and devour us poor highlanders alive has he been telling you how the bells of st jamess ring not turn again whittington like those of bow in the days of yore  fergus said waverley with a reproachful look  nay i cannot tell what to make of you answered the chief of macivor you are blown about with every wind of doctrine here have we gained a victory unparalleled in history and your behaviour is praised by every living mortal to the skies and the prince is eager to thank you in person and all our beauties of the white rose are pulling caps for youand you the preux chevalier of the day are stooping on your horses neck like a butterwoman riding to market and looking as black as a funeral  i am sorry for poor colonel gardiners death he was once very kind to me  why then be sorry for five minutes and then be glad again his chance today may be ours tomorrow and what does it signify the next best thing to victory is honourable death but it is a pisaller and one would rather a foe had it than ones self  but colonel talbot has informed me that my father and uncle are both imprisoned by government on my account  well put in bail my boy old andrew ferrara footnote see note 10 shall lodge his security and i should like to see him put to justify it in westminster hall  nay they are already at liberty upon bail of a more civic disposition  then why is thy noble spirit cast down edward dost think that the electors ministers are such doves as to set their enemies at liberty at this critical moment if they could or durst confine and punish them assure thyself that either they have no charge against your relations on which they can continue their imprisonment or else they are afraid of our friends the jolly cavaliers of old england at any rate you need not be apprehensive upon their account and we will find some means of conveying to them assurances of your safety  edward was silenced but not satisfied with these reasons he had now been more than once shocked at the small degree of sympathy which fergus exhibited for the feelings even of those whom he loved if they did not correspond with his own mood at the time and more especially if they thwarted him while earnest in a favourite pursuit fergus sometimes indeed observed that he had offended waverley but always intent upon some favourite plan or project of his own he was never sufficiently aware of the extent or duration of his displeasure so that the reiteration of these petty offences somewhat cooled the volunteers extreme attachment to his officer  the chevalier received waverley with his usual favour and paid him many compliments on his distinguished bravery he then took him apart made many inquiries concerning colonel talbot and when he had received all the information which edward was able to give concerning him and his connexions he proceededi cannot but think mr waverley that since this gentleman is so particularly connected with our worthy and excellent friend sir everard waverley and since his lady is of the house of blandeville whose devotion to the true and loyal principles of the church of england is so generally known the colonels own private sentiments cannot be unfavorable to us whatever mask he may have assumed to accommodate himself to the times  if i am to judge from the language he this day held to me i am under the necessity of differing widely from your royal highness  well it is worth making a trial at least i therefore entrust you with the charge of colonel talbot with power to act concerning him as you think most advisable and i hope you will find means of ascertaining what are his real dispositions towards our royal fathers restoration  i am convinced said waverley bowing that if colonel talbot chooses to grant his parole it may be securely depended upon but if he refuses it i trust your royal highness will devolve on some other person than the nephew of his friend the task of laying him under the necessary restraint  i will trust him with no person but you said the prince smiling but peremptorily repeating his mandate it is of importance to my service that there should appear to be a good intelligence between you even if you are unable to gain his confidence in earnest you will therefore receive him into your quarters and in case he declines giving his parole you must apply for a proper guard i beg you will go about this directly we return to edinburgh tomorrow  being thus remanded to the vicinity of preston waverley lost the baron of bradwardines solemn act of homage so little however was he at this time in love with vanity that he had quite forgotten the ceremony in which fergus had laboured to engage his curiosity but next day a formal gazette was circulated containing a detailed account of the battle of gladsmuir as the highlanders chose to denominate their victory it concluded with an account of the court afterwards held by the chevalier at pinkie house which contained this among other highflown descriptive paragraphs  since that fatal treaty which annihilates scotland as an independent nation it has not been our happiness to see her princes receive and her nobles discharge those acts of feudal homage which founded upon the splendid actions of scottish valour recall the memory of her early history with the manly and chivalrous simplicity of the ties which united to the crown the homage of the warriors by whom it was repeatedly upheld and defended but on the evening of the 20th our memories were refreshed with one of those ceremonies which belong to the ancient days of scotlands glory after the circle was formed cosmo comyne bradwardine of that ilk colonel in the service etc etc etc came before the prince attended by mr d macwheeble the bailie of his ancient barony of bradwardine who we understand has been lately named a commissary and under form of instrument claimed permission to perform to the person of his royal highness as representing his father the service used and wont for which under a charter of robert bruce of which the original was produced and inspected by the masters of his royal highnesss chancery for the time being the claimant held the barony of bradwardine and lands of tullyveolan his claim being admitted and registered his royal highness having placed his foot upon a cushion the baron of bradwardine kneeling upon his right knee proceeded to undo the latchet of the brogue or lowheeled highland shoe which our gallant young hero wears in compliment to his brave followers when this was performed his royal highness declared the ceremony completed and embracing the gallant veteran protested that nothing but compliance with an ordinance of robert bruce could have induced him to receive even the symbolical performance of a menial office from hands which had fought so bravely to put the crown upon the head of his father the baron of bradwardine then took instruments in the hands of mr commissary macwheeble bearing that all points and circumstances of the act of homage had been rite et solenniter acta et peracta and a corresponding entry was made in the protocol of the lord high chamberlain and in the record of chancery we understand that it is in contemplation of his royal highness when his majestys pleasure can be known to raise colonel bradwardine to the peerage by the title of viscount bradwardine of bradwardine and tullyveolan and that in the meanwhile his royal highness in his fathers name and authority has been pleased to grant him an honourable augmentation to his paternal coat of arms being a budget or bootjack disposed saltierwise with a naked broadsword to be borne in the dexter cantle of the shield and as an additional motto on a scroll beneath the words draw and draw off  were it not for the recollection of ferguss raillery thought waverley to himself when he had perused this long and grave document how very tolerably would all this sound and how little should i have thought of connecting it with any ludicrous idea well after all everything has its fair as well as its seamy side and truly i do not see why the barons bootjack may not stand as fair in heraldry as the waterbuckets waggons cartwheels ploughsocks shuttles candlesticks and other ordinaries conveying ideas of anything save chivalry which appear in the arms of some of our most ancient gentry  this however is an episode in respect to the principal story  when waverley returned to preston and rejoined colonel talbot he found him recovered from the strong and obvious emotions with which a concurrence of unpleasing events had affected him he had regained his natural manner which was that of an english gentleman and soldier manly open and generous but not unsusceptible of prejudice against those of a different country or who opposed him in political tenets when waverley acquainted colonel talbot with the chevaliers purpose to commit him to his charge i did not think to have owed so much obligation to that young gentleman he said as is implied in this destination i can at least cheerfully join in the prayer of the honest presbyterian clergyman that as he has come among us seeking an earthly crown his labours may be speedily rewarded with a heavenly one footnote the clergymans name was macvicar protected by the cannon of the castle he preached every sunday in the west kirk while the highlanders were in possession of edinburgh and it was in presence of some of the jacobites that he prayed for prince charles edward in the terms quoted in the text i shall willingly give my parole not to attempt an escape without your knowledge since in fact it was to meet you that i came to scotland and i am glad it has happened even under this predicament but i suppose we shall be but a short time together your chevalier that is a name we may both give to him with his plaids and blue caps will i presume be continuing his crusade southward  not as i hear i believe the army makes some stay in edinburgh to collect reinforcements  and to besiege the castle said talbot smiling sarcastically well unless my old commander general preston turn false metal or the castle sink into the north loch events which i deem equally probable i think we shall have some time to make up our acquaintance i have a guess that this gallant chevalier has a design that i should be your proselyte and as i wish you to be mine there cannot be a more fair proposal than to afford us fair conference together but as i spoke today under the influence of feelings i rarely give way to i hope you will excuse my entering again upon controversy till we are somewhat better acquainted     chapter xxii  intrigues of love and politics   it is not necessary to record in these pages the triumphant entrance of the chevalier into edinburgh after the decisive affair at preston one circumstance however may be noticed because it illustrates the high spirit of flora macivor the highlanders by whom the prince was surrounded in the license and extravagance of this joyful moment fired their pieces repeatedly and one of these having been accidentally loaded with ball the bullet grazed the young ladys temple as she waved her handkerchief from a balcony footnote see note 11 fergus who beheld the accident was at her side in an instant and on seeing that the wound was trifling he drew his broadsword with the purpose of rushing down upon the man by whose carelessness she had incurred so much danger when holding him by the plaid do not harm the poor fellow she cried for heavens sake do not harm him but thank god with me that the accident happened to flora macivor for had it befallen a whig they would have pretended that the shot was fired on purpose  waverley escaped the alarm which this accident would have occasioned to him as he was unavoidably delayed by the necessity of accompanying colonel talbot to edinburgh  they performed the journey together on horseback and for some time as if to sound each others feelings and sentiments they conversed upon general and ordinary topics  when waverley again entered upon the subject which he had most at heart the situation namely of his father and his uncle colonel talbot seemed now rather desirous to alleviate than to aggravate his anxiety this appeared particularly to be the case when he heard waverleys history which he did not scruple to confide to him  and so said the colonel there has been no malice prepense as lawyers i think term it in this rash step of yours and you have been trepanned into the service of this italian knighterrant by a few civil speeches from him and one or two of his highland recruiting sergeants it is sadly foolish to be sure but not nearly so bad as i was led to expect however you cannot desert even from the pretender at the present moment that seems impossible but i have little doubt that in the dissensions incident to this heterogeneous mass of wild and desperate men some opportunity may arise by availing yourself of which you may extricate yourself honourably from your rash engagement before the bubble burst if this can be managed i would have you go to a place of safety in flanders which i shall point out and i think i can secure your pardon from government after a few months residence abroad  i cannot permit you colonel talbot answered waverley to speak of any plan which turns on my deserting an enterprise in which i may have engaged hastily but certainly voluntarily and with the purpose of abiding the issue  well said colonel talbot smiling leave me my thoughts and hopes at least at liberty if not my speech but have you never examined your mysterious packet  it is in my baggage replied edward we shall find it in edinburgh  in edinburgh they soon arrived waverleys quarters had been assigned to him by the princes express orders in a handsome lodging where there was accommodation for colonel talbot his first business was to examine his portmanteau and after a very short search out tumbled the expected packet waverley opened it eagerly under a blank cover simply addressed to e waverley esq he found a number of open letters the uppermost were two from colonel gardiner addressed to himself the earliest in date was a kind and gentle remonstrance for neglect of the writers advice respecting the disposal of his time during his leave of absence the renewal of which he reminded captain waverley would speedily expire indeed the letter proceeded had it been otherwise the news from abroad and my instructions from the war office must have compelled me to recall it as there is great danger since the disaster in flanders both of foreign invasion and insurrection among the disaffected at home i therefore entreat you will repair as soon as possible to the headquarters of the regiment and i am concerned to add that this is still the more necessary as there is some discontent in your troop and i postpone inquiry into particulars until i can have the advantage of your assistance  the second letter dated eight days later was in such a style as might have been expected from the colonels receiving no answer to the first it reminded waverley of his duty as a man of honour an officer and a briton took notice of the increasing dissatisfaction of his men and that some of them had been heard to hint that their captain encouraged and approved of their mutinous behaviour and finally the writer expressed the utmost regret and surprise that he had not obeyed his commands by repairing to headquarters reminded him that his leave of absence had been recalled and conjured him in a style in which paternal remonstrance was mingled with military authority to redeem his error by immediately joining his regiment that i may be certain concluded the letter that this actually reaches you i despatch it by corporal tims of your troop with orders to deliver it into your own hand  upon reading these letters waverley with great bitterness of feeling was compelled to make the amende honorable to the memory of the brave and excellent writer for surely as colonel gardiner must have had every reason to conclude they had come safely to hand less could not follow on their being neglected than that third and final summons which waverley actually received at glennaquoich though too late to obey it and his being superseded in consequence of his apparent neglect of this last command was so far from being a harsh or severe proceeding that it was plainly inevitable the next letter he unfolded was from the major of the regiment acquainting him that a report to the disadvantage of his reputation was public in the country stating that one mr falconer of ballihopple or some such name had proposed in his presence a treasonable toast which he permitted to pass in silence although it was so gross an affront to the royal family that a gentleman in company not remarkable for his zeal for government had nevertheless taken the matter up and that supposing the account true captain waverley had thus suffered another comparatively unconcerned to resent an affront directed against him personally as an officer and to go out with the person by whom it was offered the major concluded that no one of captain waverleys brother officers could believe this scandalous story but that it was necessarily their joint opinion that his own honour equally with that of the regiment depended upon its being instantly contradicted by his authority etc etc etc  what do you think of all this said colonel talbot to whom waverley handed the letters after he had perused them  think it renders thought impossible it is enough to drive me mad  be calm my young friend let us see what are these dirty scrawls that follow  the first was addressed  for master w ruffin these  dear sur sum of our yong gulpins will not bite thof i tuold them you shoed me the squoires own seel but tims will deliver you the lettrs as desired and tell ould addem he gave them to squoirs bond as to be sure yours is the same and shall be ready for signal and hoy for hoy church and sachefrel as fadur sings at harvestwhome yours deer sur  h h  poscriffdoe tell squoire we longs to heer from him and has dootings about his not writing himself and lifetenant bottler is smoky  this ruffin i suppose then is your donald of the cavern who has intercepted your letters and carried on a correspondence with the poor devil houghton as if under your authority  it seems too true but who can addem be  possibly adam for poor gardiner a sort of pun on his name  the other letters were to the same purpose and they soon received yet more complete light upon donald beans machinations  john hodges one of waverleys servants who had remained with the regiment and had been taken at preston now made his appearance he had sought out his master with the purpose of again entering his service from this fellow they learned that some time after waverley had gone from the headquarters of the regiment a pedlar called ruthven rufnn or rivane known among the soldiers by the name of wily will had made frequent visits to the town of dundee he appeared to possess plenty of money sold his commodities very cheap seemed always willing to treat his friends at the alehouse and easily ingratiated himself with many of waverleys troop particularly sergeant houghton and one tims also a noncommissioned officer to these he unfolded in waverleys name a plan for leaving the regiment and joining him in the highlands where report said the clans had already taken arms in great numbers the men who had been educated as jacobites so far as they had any opinion at all and who knew their landlord sir everard had always been supposed to hold such tenets easily fell into the snare that waverley was at a distance in the highlands was received as a sufficient excuse for transmitting his letters through the medium of the pedlar and the sight of his wellknown seal seemed to authenticate the negotiations in his name where writing might have been dangerous the cabal however began to take air from the premature mutinous language of those concerned wily will justified his appellative for after suspicion arose he was seen no more when the gazette appeared in which waverley was superseded great part of his troop broke out into actual mutiny but were surrounded and disarmed by the rest of the regiment in consequence of the sentence of a courtmartial houghton and tims were condemned to be shot but afterwards permitted to cast lots for life houghton the survivor showed much penitence being convinced from the rebukes and explanations of colonel gardiner that he had really engaged in a very heinous crime it is remarkable that as soon as the poor fellow was satisfied of this he became also convinced that the instigator had acted without authority from edward saying if it was dishonourable and against old england the squire could know nought about it he never did or thought to do anything dishonourable no more didnt sir everard nor none of them afore him and in that belief he would live and die that ruffin had done it all of his own head  the strength of conviction with which he expressed himself upon this subject as well as his assurances that the letters intended for waverley had been delivered to ruthven made that revolution in colonel gardiners opinion which he expressed to talbot  the reader has long since understood that donald bean lean played the part of tempter on this occasion his motives were shortly these of an active and intriguing spirit he had been long employed as a subaltern agent and spy by those in the confidence of the chevalier to an extent beyond what was suspected even by fergus macivor whom though obliged to him for protection he regarded with fear and dislike to success in this political department he naturally looked for raising himself by some bold stroke above his present hazardous and precarious trade of rapine he was particularly employed in learning the strength of the regiments in scotland the character of the officers etc and had long had his eye upon waverleys troop as open to temptation donald even believed that waverley himself was at bottom in the stuart interest which seemed confirmed by his long visit to the jacobite baron of bradwardine when therefore he came to his cave with one of glennaquoichs attendants the robber who could never appreciate his real motive which was mere curiosity was so sanguine as to hope that his own talents were to be employed in some intrigue of consequence under the auspices of this wealthy young englishman nor was he undeceived by waverleys neglecting all hints and openings afforded for explanation his conduct passed for prudent reserve and somewhat piqued donald bean who supposing himself left out of a secret where confidence promised to be advantageous determined to have his share in the drama whether a regular part were assigned him or not for this purpose during waverleys sleep he possessed himself of his seal as a token to be used to any of the troopers whom he might discover to be possessed of the captains confidence his first journey to dundee the town where the regiment was quartered undeceived him in his original supposition but opened to him a new field of action he knew there would be no service so well rewarded by the friends of the chevalier as seducing a part of the regular army to his standard for this purpose he opened the machinations with which the reader is already acquainted and which form a clue to all the intricacies and obscurities of the narrative previous to waverleys leaving glennaquoich  by colonel talbots advice waverley declined detaining in his service the lad whose evidence had thrown additional light on these intrigues he represented to him that it would be doing the man an injury to engage him in a desperate undertaking and that whatever should happen his evidence would go some length at least in explaining the circumstances under which waverley himself had embarked in it waverley therefore wrote a short state of what had happened to his uncle and his father cautioning them however in the present circumstances not to attempt to answer his letter talbot then gave the young man a letter to the commander of one of the english vessels of war cruising in the frith requesting him to put the bearer ashore at berwick with a pass to proceed to shire he was then furnished with money to make an expeditious journey and directed to get on board the ship by means of bribing a fishingboat which as they afterwards learned he easily effected  tired of the attendance of callum beg who he thought had some disposition to act as a spy on his motions waverley hired as a servant a simple edinburgh swain who had mounted the white cockade in a fit of spleen and jealousy because jenny jop had danced a whole night with corporal bullock of the fusileers      chapter xxiii  intrigues of society and love   colonel talbot became more kindly in his demeanour towards waverley after the confidence he had reposed in him and as they were necessarily much together the character of the colonel rose in waverleys estimation there seemed at first something harsh in his strong expressions of dislike and censure although no one was in the general case more open to conviction the habit of authority had also given his manners some peremptory hardness notwithstanding the polish which they had received from his intimate acquaintance with the higher circles as a specimen of the military character he differed from all whom waverley had as yet seen the soldiership of the baron of bradwardine was marked by pedantry that of major melville by a sort of martinet attention to the minutiae and technicalities of discipline rather suitable to one who was to manoeuvre a battalion than to him who was to command an army the military spirit of fergus was so much warped and blended with his plans and political views that it was less that of a soldier than of a petty sovereign but colonel talbot was in every point the english soldier his whole soul was devoted to the service of his king and country without feeling any pride in knowing the theory of his art with the baron or its practical minutiae with the major or in applying his science to his own particular plans of ambition like the chieftain of glennaquoich added to this he was a man of extended knowledge and cultivated taste although strongly tinged as we have already observed with those prejudices which are peculiarly english  the character of colonel talbot dawned upon edward by degrees for the delay of the highlanders in the fruitless siege of edinburgh castle occupied several weeks during which waverley had little to do excepting to seek such amusement as society afforded he would willingly have persuaded his new friend to become acquainted with some of his former intimates but the colonel after one or two visits shook his head and declined farther experiment indeed he went farther and characterised the baron as the most intolerable formal pedant he had ever had the misfortune to meet with and the chief of glennaquoich as a frenchified scotchman possessing all the cunning and plausibility of the nation where he was educated with the proud vindictive and turbulent humour of that of his birth if the devil he said had sought out an agent expressly for the purpose of embroiling this miserable country i do not think he could find a better than such a fellow as this whose temper seems equally active supple and mischievous and who is followed and implicitly obeyed by a gang of such cutthroats as those whom you are pleased to admire so much  the ladies of the party did not escape his censure he allowed that flora macivor was a fine woman and rose bradwardine a pretty girl but he alleged that the former destroyed the effect of her beauty by an affectation of the grand airs which she had probably seen practised in the mock court of st germains as for rose bradwardine he said it was impossible for any mortal to admire such a little uninformed thing whose small portion of education was as ill adapted to her sex or youth as if she had appeared with one of her fathers old campaigncoats upon her person for her sole garment now much of this was mere spleen and prejudice in the excellent colonel with whom the white cockade on the breast the white rose in the hair and the mac at the beginning of a name would have made a devil out of an angel and indeed he himself jocularly allowed that he could not have endured venus herself if she had been announced in a drawingroom by the name of miss macjupiter  waverley it may easily be believed looked upon these young ladies with very different eyes during the period of the siege he paid them almost daily visits although he observed with regret that his suit made as little progress in the affections of the former as the arms of the chevalier in subduing the fortress she maintained with rigour the rule she had laid down of treating him with indifference without either affecting to avoid him or to shun intercourse with him every word every look was strictly regulated to accord with her system and neither the dejection of waverley nor the anger which fergus scarcely suppressed could extend floras attention to edward beyond that which the most ordinary politeness demanded on the other hand rose bradwardine gradually rose in waverleys opinion he had several opportunities of remarking that as her extreme timidity wore off her manners assumed a higher character that the agitating circumstances of the stormy time seemed to call forth a certain dignity of feeling and expression which he had not formerly observed and that she omitted no opportunity within her reach to extend her knowledge and refine her taste  flora macivor called rose her pupil and was attentive to assist her in her studies and to fashion both her taste and understanding it might have been remarked by a very close observer that in the presence of waverley she was much more desirous to exhibit her friends excellences than her own but i must request of the reader to suppose that this kind and disinterested purpose was concealed by the most cautious delicacy studiously shunning the most distant approach to affectation so that it was as unlike the usual exhibition of one pretty woman affecting to proner another as the friendship of david and jonathan might be to the intimacy of two bond street loungers the fact is that though the effect was felt the cause could hardly be observed each of the ladies like two excellent actresses were perfect in their parts and performed them to the delight of the audience and such being the case it was almost impossible to discover that the elder constantly ceded to her friend that which was most suitable to her talents  but to waverley rose bradwardine possessed an attraction which few men can resist from the marked interest which she took in everything that affected him she was too young and too inexperienced to estimate the full force of the constant attention which she paid to him her father was too abstractedly immersed in learned and military discussions to observe her partiality and flora macivor did not alarm her by remonstrance because she saw in this line of conduct the most probable chance of her friend securing at length a return of affection  the truth is that in her first conversation after their meeting rose had discovered the state of her mind to that acute and intelligent friend although she was not herself aware of it from that time flora was not only determined upon the final rejection of waverleys addresses but became anxious that they should if possible be transferred to her friend nor was she less interested in this plan though her brother had from time to time talked as between jest and earnest of paying his suit to miss bradwardine she knew that fergus had the true continental latitude of opinion respecting the institution of marriage and would not have given his hand to an angel unless for the purpose of strengthening his alliances and increasing his influence and wealth the barons whim of transferring his estate to the distant heirmale instead of his own daughter was therefore likely to be an insurmountable obstacle to his entertaining any serious thoughts of rose bradwardine indeed ferguss brain was a perpetual workshop of scheme and intrigue of every possible kind and description while like many a mechanic of more ingenuity than steadiness he would often unexpectedly and without any apparent motive abandon one plan and go earnestly to work upon another which was either fresh from the forge of his imagination or had at some former period been flung aside half finished it was therefore often difficult to guess what line of conduct he might finally adopt upon any given occasion  although flora was sincerely attached to her brother whose high energies might indeed have commanded her admiration even without the ties which bound them together she was by no means blind to his faults which she considered as dangerous to the hopes of any woman who should found her ideas of a happy marriage in the peaceful enjoyment of domestic society and the exchange of mutual and engrossing affection the real disposition of waverley on the other hand notwithstanding his dreams of tented fields and military honour seemed exclusively domestic he asked and received no share in the busy scenes which were constantly going on around him and was rather annoyed than interested by the discussion of contending claims rights and interests which often passed in his presence all this pointed him out as the person formed to make happy a spirit like that of rose which corresponded with his own  she remarked this point in waverleys character one day while she sat with miss bradwardine his genius and elegant taste answered rose cannot be interested in such trifling discussions what is it to him for example whether the chief of the macindallaghers who has brought out only fifty men should be a colonel or a captain and how could mr waverley be supposed to interest himself in the violent altercation between your brother and young corrinaschian whether the post of honour is due to the eldest cadet of a clan or the youngest  my dear rose if he were the hero you suppose him he would interest himself in these matters not indeed as important in themselves but for the purpose of mediating between the ardent spirits who actually do make them the subject of discord you saw when corrinaschian raised his voice in great passion and laid his hand upon his sword waverley lifted his head as if he had just awaked from a dream and asked with great composure what the matter was  well and did not the laughter they fell into at his absence of mind serve better to break off the dispute than anything he could have said to them  true my dear answered flora but not quite so creditably for waverley as if he had brought them to their senses by force of reason  would you have him peacemaker general between all the gunpowder highlanders in the army i beg your pardon flora your brother you know is out of the question he has more sense than half of them but can you think the fierce hot furious spirits of whose brawls we see much and hear more and who terrify me out of my life every day in the world are at all to be compared to waverley  i do not compare him with those uneducated men my dear rose i only lament that with his talents and genius he does not assume that place in society for which they eminently fit him and that he does not lend their full impulse to the noble cause in which he has enlisted are there not lochiel and p and m and g all men of the highest education as well as the first talentswhy will he not stoop like them to be alive and useful i often believe his zeal is frozen by that proud coldblooded englishman whom he now lives with so much  colonel talbot he is a very disagreeable person to be sure he looks as if he thought no scottish woman worth the trouble of handing her a cup of tea but waverley is so gentle so well informed  yes said flora smiling he can admire the moon and quote a stanza from tasso  besides you know how he fought added miss bradwardine  for mere fighting answered flora i believe all men that is who deserve the name are pretty much alike there is generally more courage required to run away they have besides when confronted with each other a certain instinct for strife as we see in other male animals such as dogs bulls and so forth but high and perilous enterprise is not waverleys forte he would never have been his celebrated ancestor sir nigel but only sir nigels eulogist and poet i will tell you where he will be at home my dear and in his placein the quiet circle of domestic happiness lettered indolence and elegant enjoyments of waverleyhonour and he will refit the old library in the most exquisite gothic taste and garnish its shelves with the rarest and most valuable volumes and he will draw plans and landscapes and write verses and rear temples and dig grottoes and he will stand in a clear summer night in the colonnade before the hall and gaze on the deer as they stray in the moonlight or lie shadowed by the boughs of the huge old fantastic oaks and he will repeat verses to his beautiful wife who will hang upon his armand he will be a happy man  and she will be a happy woman thought poor rose but she only sighed and dropped the conversation     chapter xxiv  fergus a suitor   waverley had indeed as he looked closer into the state of the chevaliers court less reason to be satisfied with it it contained as they say an acorn includes all the ramifications of the future oak as many seeds of tracasserie and intrigue as might have done honour to the court of a large empire every person of consequence had some separate object which he pursued with a fury that waverley considered as altogether disproportioned to its importance almost all had their reasons for discontent although the most legitimate was that of the worthy old baron who was only distressed on account of the common cause  we shall hardly said he one morning to waverley when they had been viewing the castlewe shall hardly gain the obsidional crown which you wot well was made of the roots or grain which takes root within the place besieged or it may be of the herb woodbind parietaria or pellitory we shall not i say gain it by this same blockade or leaguer of edinburgh castle for this opinion he gave most learned and satisfactory reasons that the reader may not care to hear repeated  having escaped from the old gentleman waverley went to ferguss lodgings by appointment to await his return from holyrood house i am to have a particular audience tomorrow said fergus to waverley overnight and you must meet me to wish me joy of the success which i securely anticipate  the morrow came and in the chiefs apartment he found ensign maccombich waiting to make report of his turn of duty in a sort of ditch which they had dug across the castlehill and called a trench in a short time the chiefs voice was heard on the stair in a tone of impatient fury callum why callum beg diaoul he entered the room with all the marks of a man agitated by a towering passion and there were few upon whose features rage produced a more violent effect the veins of his forehead swelled when he was in such agitation his nostril became dilated his cheek and eye inflamed and his look that of a demoniac these appearances of halfsuppressed rage were the more frightful because they were obviously caused by a strong effort to temper with discretion an almost ungovernable paroxysm of passion and resulted from an internal conflict of the most dreadful kind which agitated his whole frame of mortality  as he entered the apartment he unbuckled his broadsword and throwing it down with such violence that the weapon rolled to the other end of the room i know not what he exclaimed withholds me from taking a solemn oath that i will never more draw it in his cause load my pistols callum and bring them hither instantlyinstantly callum whom nothing ever startled dismayed or disconcerted obeyed very coolly evan dhu upon whose brow the suspicion that his chief had been insulted called up a corresponding storm swelled in sullen silence awaiting to learn where or upon whom vengeance was to descend  so waverley you are there said the chief after a moments recollection yes i remember i asked you to share my triumph and you have come to witness my disappointment we shall call it evan now presented the written report he had in his hand which fergus threw from him with great passion i wish to god he said the old den would tumble down upon the heads of the fools who attack and the knaves who defend it i see waverley you think i am mad leave us evan but be within call  the colonels in an unco kippage said mrs flockhart to evan as he descended i wish he may be weelthe very veins on his brent brow are swelled like whipcord wad he no tak something  he usually lets blood for these fits answered the highland ancient with great composure  when this officer left the room the chieftain gradually reassumed some degree of composure i know waverley he said that colonel talbot has persuaded you to curse ten times a day your engagement with us nay never deny it for i am at this moment tempted to curse my own would you believe it i made this very morning two suits to the prince and he has rejected them both what do you think of it  what can i think answered waverley till i know what your requests were why what signifies what they were man i tell you it was i that made themi to whom he owes more than to any three who have joined the standard for i negotiated the whole business and brought in all the perthshire men when not one would have stirred i am not likely i think to ask anything very unreasonable and if i did they might have stretched a point well but you shall know all now that i can draw my breath again with some freedom you remember my earls patent it is dated some years back for services then rendered and certainly my merit has not been diminished to say the least by my subsequent behaviour now sir i value this bauble of a coronet as little as you can or any philosopher on earth for i hold that the chief of such a clan as the sliochd nan ivor is superior in rank to any earl in scotland but i had a particular reason for assuming this cursed title at this time you must know that i learned accidentally that the prince has been pressing that old foolish baron of bradwardine to disinherit his male heir or nineteenth or twentieth cousin who has taken a command in the elector of hanovers militia and to settle his estate upon your pretty little friend rose and this as being the command of his king and overlord who may alter the destination of a fief at pleasure the old gentleman seems well reconciled to  and what becomes of the homage  curse the homage i believe rose is to pull off the queens slipper on her coronationday or some such trash well sir as rose bradwardine would always have made a suitable match for me but for this idiotical predilection of her father for the heirmale it occurred to me there now remained no obstacle unless that the baron might expect his daughters husband to take the name of bradwardine which you know would be impossible in my case and that this might be evaded by my assuming the title to which i had so good a right and which of course would supersede that difficulty if she was to be also viscountess bradwardine in her own right after her fathers demise so much the better i could have no objection  but fergus said waverley i had no idea that you had any affection for miss bradwardine and you are always sneering at her father  i have as much affection for miss bradwardine my good friend as i think it necessary to have for the future mistress of my family and the mother of my children she is a very pretty intelligent girl and is certainly of one of the very first lowland families and with a little of floras instructions and forming will make a very good figure as to her father he is an original it is true and an absurd one enough but he has given such severe lessons to sir hew halbert that dear defunct the laird of balmawhapple and others that nobody dare laugh at him so his absurdity goes for nothing i tell you there could have been no earthly objectionnone i had settled the thing entirely in my own mind  but had you asked the barons consent said waverley or roses  to what purpose to have spoke to the baron before i had assumed my title would have only provoked a premature and irritating discussion on the subject of the change of name when as earl of glennaquoich i had only to propose to him to carry his dd bear and bootjack party per pale or in a scutcheon of pretence or in a separate shield perhapsany way that would not blemish my own coat of arms and as to rose i dont see what objection she could have made if her father was satisfied  perhaps the same that your sister makes to me you being satisfied  fergus gave a broad stare at the comparison which this supposition implied but cautiously suppressed the answer which rose to his tongue o we should easily have arranged all that so sir i craved a private interview and this morning was assigned and i asked you to meet me here thinking like a fool that i should want your countenance as bridesman well i state my pretensionthey are not denied the promises so repeatedly made and the patent grantedthey are acknowledged but i propose as a natural consequence to assume the rank which the patent bestowed i have the old story of the jealousy of cand mtrumped up against me i resist this pretext and offer to procure their written acquiescence in virtue of the date of my patent as prior to their silly claims i assure you i would have had such a consent from them if it had been at the point of the sword and then out comes the real truth and he dares to tell me to my face that my patent must be suppressed for the present for fear of disgusting that rascally coward and faineant naming the rival chief of his own clan who has no better title to be a chieftain than i to be emperor of china and who is pleased to shelter his dastardly reluctance to come out agreeable to his promise twenty times pledged under a pretended jealousy of the princes partiality to me and to leave this miserable driveller without a pretence for his cowardice the prince asks it as a personal favour of me forsooth not to press my just and reasonable request at this moment after this put your faith in princes  and did your audience end here  end o no i was determined to leave him no pretence for his ingratitude and i therefore stated with all the composure i could musterfor i promise you i trembled with passionthe particular reasons i had for wishing that his royal highness would impose upon me any other mode of exhibiting my duty and devotion as my views in life made what at any other time would have been a mere trifle at this crisis a severe sacrifice and then i explained to him my full plan  and what did the prince answer  answer whyit is well it is written curse not the king no not in thy thoughtwhy he answered that truly he was glad i had made him my confidant to prevent more grievous disappointment for he could assure me upon the word of a prince that miss bradwardines affections were engaged and he was under a particular promise to favour them so my dear fergus said he with his most gracious cast of smile as the marriage is utterly out of question there need be no hurry you know about the earldom and so he glided off and left me plante la  and what did you do  ill tell you what i could have done at that momentsold myself to the devil or the elector whichever offered the dearest revenge however i am now cool i know he intends to marry her to some of his rascally frenchmen or his irish officers but i will watch them close and let the man that would supplant me look well to himself bisogna coprirsi signor  after some further conversation unnecessary to be detailed waverley took leave of the chieftain whose fury had now subsided into a deep and strong desire of vengeance and returned home scarce able to analyse the mixture of feelings which the narrative had awakened in his own bosom     chapter xxv  to one thing constant never   i am the very child of caprice said waverley to himself as he bolted the door of his apartment and paced it with hasty steps what is it to me that fergus macivor should wish to marry rose bradwardine i love her not i might have been loved by her perhaps but rejected her simple natural and affecting attachment instead of cherishing it into tenderness and dedicated myself to one who will never love mortal man unless old warwick the kingmaker should arise from the dead the baron tooi would not have cared about his estate and so the name would have been no stumblingblock the devil might have taken the barren moors and drawn off the royal caligae for anything i would have minded but framed as she is for domestic affection and tenderness for giving and receiving all those kind and quiet attentions which sweeten life to those who pass it together she is sought by fergus macivor he will not use her ill to be sure of that he is incapable but he will neglect her after the first month he will be too intent on subduing some rival chieftain or circumventing some favourite at court on gaining some heathy hill and lake or adding to his bands some new troop of caterans to inquire what she does or how she amuses herself     and then will canker sorrow eat her bud     and chase the native beauty from her cheek     and she will look as hollow as a ghost     and dim and meagre as an ague fit     and so shell die and such a catastrophe of the most gentle creature on earth might have been prevented if mr edward waverley had had his eyes upon my word i cannot understand how i thought flora so much that is so very much handsomer than rose she is taller indeed and her manner more formed but many people think miss bradwardines more natural and she is certainly much younger i should think flora is two years older than i am i will look at them particularly this evening  and with this resolution waverley went to drink tea as the fashion was sixty years since at the house of a lady of quality attached to the cause of the chevalier where he found as he expected both the ladies all rose as he entered but flora immediately resumed her place and the conversation in which she was engaged rose on the contrary almost imperceptibly made a little way in the crowded circle for his advancing the corner of a chair her manner upon the whole is most engaging said waverley to himself  a dispute occurred whether the gaelic or italian language was most liquid and best adapted for poetry the opinion for the gaelic which probably might not have found supporters elsewhere was here fiercely defended by seven highland ladies who talked at the top of their lungs and screamed the company deaf with examples of celtic euphonia flora observing the lowland ladies sneer at the comparison produced some reasons to show that it was not altogether so absurd but rose when asked for her opinion gave it with animation in praise of italian which she had studied with waverleys assistance she has a more correct ear than flora though a less accomplished musician said waverley to himself i suppose miss macivor will next compare macmurrough nan fonn to ariosto  lastly it so befell that the company differed whether fergus should be asked to perform on the flute at which he was an adept or waverley invited to read a play of shakspeare and the lady of the house goodhumouredly undertook to collect the votes of the company for poetry or music under the condition that the gentleman whose talents were not laid under contribution that evening should contribute them to enliven the next it chanced that rose had the casting vote now flora who seemed to impose it as a rule upon herself never to countenance any proposal which might seem to encourage waverley had voted for music providing the baron would take his violin to accompany fergus i wish you joy of your taste miss macivor thought edward as they sought for his book i thought it better when we were at glennaquoich but certainly the baron is no great performer and shakspeare is worth listening to  romeo and juliet was selected and edward read with taste feeling and spirit several scenes from that play all the company applauded with their hands and many with their tears flora to whom the drama was well known was among the former rose to whom it was altogether new belonged to the latter class of admirers she has more feeling too said waverley internally  the conversation turning upon the incidents of the play and upon the characters fergus declared that the only one worth naming as a man of fashion and spirit was mercutio i could not he said quite follow all his oldfashioned wit but he must have been a very pretty fellow according to the ideas of his time  and it was a shame said ensign maccombich who usually followed his colonel everywhere for that tibbert or taggart or whatever was his name to stick him under the other gentlemans arm while he was redding the fray  the ladies of course declared loudly in favour of romeo but this opinion did not go undisputed the mistress of the house and several other ladies severely reprobated the levity with which the hero transfers his affections from rosalind to juliet flora remained silent until her opinion was repeatedly requested and then answered she thought the circumstance objected to not only reconcilable to nature but such as in the highest degree evinced the art of the poet romeo is described said she as a young man peculiarly susceptible of the softer passions his love is at first fixed upon a woman who could afford it no return this he repeatedly tells you      from loves weak childish bow she lives unharmed  and again      she hath forsworn to love  now as it was impossible that romeos love supposing him a reasonable being could continue to subsist without hope the poet has with great art seized the moment when he was reduced actually to despair to throw in his way an object more accomplished than her by whom he had been rejected and who is disposed to repay his attachment i can scarce conceive a situation more calculated to enhance the ardour of romeos affection for juliet than his being at once raised by her from the state of drooping melancholy in which he appears first upon the scene to the ecstatic state in which he exclaims            come what sorrow can     it cannot countervail the exchange of joy     that one short moment gives me in her sight  good now miss macivor said a young lady of quality do you mean to cheat us out of our prerogative will you persuade us love cannot subsist without hope or that the lover must become fickle if the lady is cruel o fie i did not expect such an unsentimental conclusion  a lover my dear lady betty said flora may i conceive persevere in his suit under very discouraging circumstances affection can now and then withstand very severe storms of rigour but not a long polar frost of downright indifference dont even with your attractions try the experiment upon any lover whose faith you value love will subsist on wonderfully little hope but not altogether without it  it will be just like duncan macgirdies mare said evan if your ladyships please he wanted to use her by degrees to live without meat and just as he had put her on a straw a day the poor thing died  evans illustration set the company alaughing and the discourse took a different turn shortly afterwards the party broke up and edward returned home musing on what flora had said i will love my rosalind no more said he she has given me a broad enough hint for that and i will speak to her brother and resign my suit but for a julietwould it be handsome to interfere with ferguss pretensions though it is impossible they can ever succeed and should they miscarry what then why then alors comme alors and with this resolution of being guided by circumstances did our hero commit himself to repose     chapter xxvi  a brave man in sorrow   if my fair readers should be of opinion that my heros levity in love is altogether unpardonable i must remind them that all his griefs and difficulties did not arise from that sentimental source even the lyric poet who complains so feelingly of the pains of love could not forget that at the same time he was in debt and in drink which doubtless were great aggravations of his distress there were indeed whole days in which waverley thought neither of flora nor rose bradwardine but which were spent in melancholy conjectures on the probable state of matters at waverleyhonour and the dubious issue of the civil contest in which he was pledged colonel talbot often engaged him in discussions upon the justice of the cause he had espoused not he said that it is possible for you to quit it at this present moment for come what will you must stand by your rash engagement but i wish you to be aware that the right is not with you that you are fighting against the real interests of your country and that you ought as an englishman and a patriot to take the first opportunity to leave this unhappy expedition before the snowball melts  in such political disputes waverley usually opposed the common arguments of his party with which it is unnecessary to trouble the reader but he had little to say when the colonel urged him to compare the strength by which they had undertaken to overthrow the government with that which was now assembling very rapidly for its support to this statement waverley had but one answer if the cause i have undertaken be perilous there would be the greater disgrace in abandoning it and in his turn he generally silenced colonel talbot and succeeded in changing the subject  one night when after a long dispute of this nature the friends had separated and our hero had retired to bed he was awakened about midnight by a suppressed groan he started up and listened it came from the apartment of colonel talbot which was divided from his own by a wainscotted partition with a door of communication waverley approached this door and distinctly heard one or two deepdrawn sighs what could be the matter the colonel had parted from him apparently in his usual state of spirits he must have been taken suddenly ill under this impression he opened the door of communication very gently and perceived the colonel in his nightgown seated by a table on which lay a letter and a picture he raised his head hastily as edward stood uncertain whether to advance or retire and waverley perceived that his cheeks were stained with tears  as if ashamed at being found giving way to such emotion colonel talbot rose with apparent displeasure and said with some sternness i think mr waverley my own apartment and the hour might have secured even a prisoner against  do not say intrusion colonel talbot i heard you breathe hard and feared you were ill that alone could have induced me to break in upon you  i am well said the colonel perfectly well  but you are distressed said edward is there anything can be done  nothing mr waverley i was only thinking of home and some unpleasant occurrences there  good god my uncle exclaimed waverley  no it is a grief entirely my own i am ashamed you should have seen it disarm me so much but it must have its course at times that it may be at others more decently supported i would have kept it secret from you for i think it will grieve you and yet you can administer no consolation but you have surprised mei see you are surprised yourselfand i hate mystery read that letter  the letter was from colonel talbots sister and in these words  i received yours my dearest brother by hodges sir e w and mr r are still at large but are not permitted to leave london i wish to heaven i could give you as good an account of matters in the square but the news of the unhappy affair at preston came upon us with the dreadful addition that you were among the fallen you know lady emilys state of health when your friendship for sir e induced you to leave her she was much harassed with the sad accounts from scotland of the rebellion having broken out but kept up her spirits as she said it became your wife and for the sake of the future heir so long hoped for in vain alas my dear brother these hopes are now ended notwithstanding all my watchful care this unhappy rumour reached her without preparation she was taken ill immediately and the poor infant scarce survived its birth would to god this were all but although the contradiction of the horrible report by your own letter has greatly revived her spirits yet dr apprehends i grieve to say serious and even dangerous consequences to her health especially from the uncertainty in which she must necessarily remain for some time aggravated by the ideas she has formed of the ferocity of those with whom you are a prisoner  do therefore my dear brother as soon as this reaches you endeavour to gain your release by parole by ransom or any way that is practicable i do not exaggerate lady emilys state of health but i must notdare notsuppress the truth ever my dear philip your most affectionate sister  lucy talbot  edward stood motionless when he had perused this letter for the conclusion was inevitable that by the colonels journey in quest of him he had incurred this heavy calamity it was severe enough even in its irremediable part for colonel talbot and lady emily long without a family had fondly exulted in the hopes which were now blasted but this disappointment was nothing to the extent of the threatened evil and edward with horror regarded himself as the original cause of both  ere he could collect himself sufficiently to speak colonel talbot had recovered his usual composure of manner though his troubled eye denoted his mental agony  she is a woman my young friend who may justify even a soldiers tears he reached him the miniature exhibiting features which fully justified the eulogium and yet god knows what you see of her there is the least of the charms she possessespossessed i should perhaps saybut gods will be done  you must flyyou must fly instantly to her relief it is notit shall not be too late  fly how is it possible i am a prisoner upon parole  i am your keeper i restore your parole i am to answer for you  you cannot do so consistently with your duty nor can i accept a discharge from you with due regard to my own honour you would be made responsible  i will answer it with my head if necessary said waverley impetuously i have been the unhappy cause of the loss of your child make me not the murderer of your wife  no my dear edward said talbot taking him kindly by the hand you are in no respect to blame and if i concealed this domestic distress for two days it was lest your sensibility should view it in that light you could not think of me hardly knew of my existence when i left england in quest of you it is a responsibility heaven knows sufficiently heavy for mortality that we must answer for the foreseen and direct result of our actions for their indirect and consequential operation the great and good being who alone can foresee the dependence of human events on each other hath not pronounced his frail creatures liable  but that you should have left lady emily said waverley with much emotion in the situation of all others the most interesting to a husband to seek a  i only did my duty answered colonel talbot calmly and i do not ought not to regret it if the path of gratitude and honour were always smooth and easy there would be little merit in following it but it moves often in contradiction to our interest and passions and sometimes to our better affections these are the trials of life and this though not the least bitter the tears came unbidden to his eyes is not the first which it has been my fate to encounter but we will talk of this tomorrow he said wringing waverleys hands goodnight strive to forget it for a few hours it will dawn i think by six and it is now past two goodnight  edward retired without trusting his voice with a reply     chapter xxvii  exertion   when colonel talbot entered the breakfastparlour next morning he learned from waverleys servant that our hero had been abroad at an early hour and was not yet returned the morning was well advanced before he again appeared he arrived out of breath but with an air of joy that astonished colonel talbot  there said he throwing a paper on the table there is my mornings work alick pack up the colonels clothes make haste make haste  the colonel examined the paper with astonishment it was a pass from the chevalier to colonel talbot to repair to leith or any other port in possession of his royal highnesss troops and there to embark for england or elsewhere at his free pleasure he only giving his parole of honour not to bear arms against the house of stuart for the space of a twelvemonth  in the name of god said the colonel his eyes sparkling with eagerness how did you obtain this  i was at the chevaliers levee as soon as he usually rises he was gone to the camp at duddingston i pursued him thither asked and obtained an audiencebut i will tell you not a word more unless i see you begin to pack  before i know whether i can avail myself of this passport or how it was obtained  o you can take out the things again you know now i see you busy i will go on when i first mentioned your name his eyes sparkled almost as bright as yours did two minutes since had you he earnestly asked shown any sentiments favourable to his cause not in the least nor was there any hope you would do so his countenance fell i requested your freedom impossible he said your importance as a friend and confidant of such and such personages made my request altogether extravagant i told him my own story and yours and asked him to judge what my feelings must be by his own he has a heart and a kind one colonel talbot you may say what you please he took a sheet of paper and wrote the pass with his own hand i will not trust myself with my council he said they will argue me out of what is right i will not endure that a friend valued as i value you should be loaded with the painful reflections which must afflict you in case of further misfortune in colonel talbots family nor will i keep a brave enemy a prisoner under such circumstances besides said he i think i can justify myself to my prudent advisers by pleading the good effect such lenity will produce on the minds of the great english families with whom colonel talbot is connected  there the politician peeped out said the colonel  well at least he concluded like a kings son take the passport i have added a condition for forms sake but if the colonel objects to it let him depart without giving any parole whatever i come here to war with men but not to distress or endanger women  well i never thought to have been so much indebted to the pretend  to the prince said waverley smiling  to the chevalier said the colonel it is a good travelling name and which we may both freely use did he say anything more  only asked if there was anything else he could oblige me in and when i replied in the negative he shook me by the hand and wished all his followers were as considerate since some friends of mine not only asked all he had to bestow but many things which were entirely out of his power or that of the greatest sovereign upon earth indeed he said no prince seemed in the eyes of his followers so like the deity as himself if you were to judge from the extravagant requests which they daily preferred to him  poor young gentleman said the colonel i suppose he begins to feel the difficulties of his situation well dear waverley this is more than kind and shall not be forgotten while philip talbot can remember anything my lifepshawlet emily thank you for that this is a favour worth fifty lives i cannot hesitate on giving my parole in the circumstances there it is he wrote it out in form and now how am i to get off  all that is settled your baggage is packed my horses wait and a boat has been engaged by the princes permission to put you on board the fox frigate i sent a messenger down to leith on purpose  that will do excellently well captain beaver is my particular friend he will put me ashore at berwick or shields from whence i can ride post to london and you must entrust me with the packet of papers which you recovered by means of your miss bean lean i may have an opportunity of using them to your advantage but i see your highland friend glen  what do you call his barbarous name and his orderly with him i must not call him his orderly cutthroat any more i suppose see how he walks as if the world were his own with the bonnet on one side of his head and his plaid puffed out across his breast i should like now to meet that youth where my hands were not tied i would tame his pride or he should tame mine  for shame colonel talbot you swell at sight of tartan as the bull is said to do at scarlet you and macivor have some points not much unlike so far as national prejudice is concerned  the latter part of this discourse took place in the street they passed the chief the colonel and he sternly and punctiliously greeting each other like two duellists before they take their ground it was evident the dislike was mutual i never see that surly fellow that dogs his heels said the colonel after he had mounted his horse but he reminds me of lines i have somewhere heardupon the stage i think      close behind him     stalks sullen bertram like a sorcerers fiend     pressing to be employed  i assure you colonel said waverley that you judge too harshly of the highlanders  not a whit not a whit i cannot spare them a jot i cannot bate them an ace let them stay in their own barren mountains and puff and swell and hang their bonnets on the horns of the moon if they have a mind but what business have they to come where people wear breeches and speak an intelligible language i mean intelligible in comparison to their gibberish for even the lowlanders talk a kind of english little better than the negroes in jamaica i could pity the pr i mean the chevalier himself for having so many desperadoes about him and they learn their trade so early there is a kind of subaltern imp for example a sort of sucking devil whom your friend glenaglenamuck there has sometimes in his train to look at him he is about fifteen years but he is a century old in mischief and villainy he was playing at quoits the other day in the court a gentleman a decentlooking person enough came past and as a quoit hit his shin he lifted his cane but my young bravo whips out his pistol like beau clincher in the trip to the jubilee and had not a scream of gardez leau from an upper window set all parties ascampering for fear of the inevitable consequences the poor gentleman would have lost his life by the hands of that little cockatrice  a fine character youll give of scotland upon your return colonel talbot  o justice shallow said the colonel will save me the troublebarren barren beggars all beggars all marry good airand that only when you are fairly out of edinburgh and not yet come to leith as is our case at present  in a short time they arrived at the seaport  the boat rockd at the pier of leith full loud the wind blew down the ferry the ship rode at the berwick law  farewell colonel may you find all as you would wish it perhaps we may meet sooner than you expect they talk of an immediate route to england  tell me nothing of that said talbot i wish to carry no news of your motions  simply then adieu say with a thousand kind greetings all that is dutiful and affectionate to sir everard and aunt rachel think of me as kindly as you can speak of me as indulgently as your conscience will permit and once more adieu  and adieu my dear waverley many many thanks for your kindness unplaid yourself on the first opportunity i shall ever think on you with gratitude and the worst of my censure shall be que diable alloitil faire dans cette galere  and thus they parted colonel talbot going on board of the boat and waverley returning to edinburgh     chapter xxviii  the march   it is not our purpose to intrude upon the province of history we shall therefore only remind our readers that about the beginning of november the young chevalier at the head of about six thousand men at the utmost resolved to peril his cause on an attempt to penetrate into the centre of england although aware of the mighty preparations which were made for his reception they set forward on this crusade in weather which would have rendered any other troops incapable of marching but which in reality gave these active mountaineers advantages over a less hardy enemy in defiance of a superior army lying upon the borders under fieldmarshal wade they besieged and took carlisle and soon afterwards prosecuted their daring march to the southward  as colonel macivors regiment marched in the van of the clans he and waverley who now equalled any highlander in the endurance of fatigue and was become somewhat acquainted with their language were perpetually at its head they marked the progress of the army however with very different eyes fergus all air and fire and confident against the world in arms measured nothing but that every step was a yard nearer london he neither asked expected nor desired any aid except that of the clans to place the stuarts once more on the throne and when by chance a few adherents joined the standard he always considered them in the light of new claimants upon the favours of the future monarch who he concluded must therefore subtract for their gratification so much of the bounty which ought to be shared among his highland followers  edwards views were very different he could not but observe that in those towns in which they proclaimed james the third no man cried god bless him the mob stared and listened heartless stupefied and dull but gave few signs even of that boisterous spirit which induces them to shout upon all occasions for the mere exercise of their most sweet voices the jacobites had been taught to believe that the northwestern counties abounded with wealthy squires and hardy yeomen devoted to the cause of the white rose but of the wealthier tories they saw little some fled from their houses some feigned themselves sick some surrendered themselves to the government as suspected persons of such as remained the ignorant gazed with astonishment mixed with horror and aversion at the wild appearance unknown language and singular garb of the scottish clans and to the more prudent their scanty numbers apparent deficiency in discipline and poverty of equipment seemed certain tokens of the calamitous termination of their rash undertaking thus the few who joined them were such as bigotry of political principle blinded to consequences or whose broken fortunes induced them to hazard all on a risk so desperate  the baron of bradwardine being asked what he thought of these recruits took a long pinch of snuff and answered drilythat he could not but have an excellent opinion of them since they resembled precisely the followers who attached themselves to the good king david at the cave of adullamvidelicet every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented which the vulgate renders bitter of soul and doubtless he said they will prove mighty men of their hands and there is much need that they should for i have seen many a sour look cast upon us  but none of these considerations moved fergus he admired the luxuriant beauty of the country and the situation of many of the seats which they passed is waverleyhonour like that house edward  it is onehalf larger  is your uncles park as fine a one as that  it is three times as extensive and rather resembles a forest than a mere park  flora will be a happy woman  i hope miss macivor will have much reason for happiness unconnected with waverleyhonour  i hope so too but to be mistress of such a place will be a pretty addition to the sum total  an addition the want of which i trust will be amply supplied by some other means  how said fergus stopping short and turning upon waverleyhow am i to understand that mr waverley had i the pleasure to hear you aright  perfectly right fergus  and am i to understand that you no longer desire my alliance and my sisters hand  your sister has refused mine said waverley both directly and by all the usual means by which ladies repress undesired attentions  i have no idea answered the chieftain of a lady dismissing or a gentleman withdrawing his suit after it has been approved of by her legal guardian without giving him an opportunity of talking the matter over with the lady you did not i suppose expect my sister to drop into your mouth like a ripe plum the first moment you chose to open it  as to the ladys title to dismiss her lover colonel replied edward it is a point which you must argue with her as i am ignorant of the customs of the highlands in that particular but as to my title to acquiesce in a rejection from her without an appeal to your interest i will tell you plainly without meaning to undervalue miss macivors admitted beauty and accomplishments that i would not take the hand of an angel with an empire for her dowry if her consent were extorted by the importunity of friends and guardians and did not flow from her own free inclination  an angel with the dowry of an empire repeated fergus in a tone of bitter irony is not very likely to be pressed upon a shire squire but sir changing his tone if flora macivor have not the dowry of an empire she is my sister and that is sufficient at least to secure her against being treated with anything approaching to levity  she is flora macivor sir said waverley with firmness which to me were i capable of treating any woman with levity would be a more effectual protection  the brow of the chieftain was now fully clouded but edward felt too indignant at the unreasonable tone which he had adopted to avert the storm by the least concession they both stood still while this short dialogue passed and fergus seemed half disposed to say something more violent but by a strong effort suppressed his passion and turning his face forward walked sullenly on as they had always hitherto walked together and almost constantly side by side waverley pursued his course silently in the same direction determined to let the chief take his own time in recovering the goodhumour which he had so unreasonably discarded and firm in his resolution not to bate him an inch of dignity  after they had marched on in this sullen manner about a mile fergus resumed the discourse in a different tone i believe i was warm my dear edward but you provoke me with your want of knowledge of the world you have taken pet at some of floras prudery or highflying notions of loyalty and now like a child you quarrel with the plaything you have been crying for and beat me your faithful keeper because my arm cannot reach to edinburgh to hand it to you i am sure if i was passionate the mortification of losing the alliance of such a friend after your arrangement had been the talk of both highlands and lowlands and that without so much as knowing why or wherefore might well provoke calmer blood than mine i shall write to edinburgh and put all to rights that is if you desire i should do so as indeed i cannot suppose that your good opinion of flora it being such as you have often expressed to me can be at once laid aside  colonel macivor said edward who had no mind to be hurried farther or faster than he chose in a matter which he had already considered as broken off i am fully sensible of the value of your good offices and certainly by your zeal on my behalf in such an affair you do me no small honour but as miss macivor has made her election freely and voluntarily and as all my attentions in edinburgh were received with more than coldness i cannot in justice either to her or myself consent that she should again be harassed upon this topic i would have mentioned this to you some time since but you saw the footing upon which we stood together and must have understood it had i thought otherwise i would have earlier spoken but i had a natural reluctance to enter upon a subject so painful to us both  o very well mr waverley said fergus haughtily the thing is at an end i have no occasion to press my sister upon any man  nor have i any occasion to court repeated rejection from the same young lady answered edward in the same tone  i shall make due inquiry however said the chieftain without noticing the interruption and learn what my sister thinks of all this we will then see whether it is to end here  respecting such inquiries you will of course be guided by your own judgment said waverley it is i am aware impossible miss macivor can change her mind and were such an unsupposable case to happen it is certain i will not change mine i only mention this to prevent any possibility of future misconstruction  gladly at this moment would macivor have put their quarrel to a personal arbitrement his eye flashed fire and he measured edward as if to choose where he might best plant a mortal wound but although we do not now quarrel according to the modes and figures of caranza or vincent saviola no one knew better than fergus that there must be some decent pretext for a mortal duel for instance you may challenge a man for treading on your corn in a crowd or for pushing you up to the wall or for taking your seat in the theatre but the modern code of honour will not permit you to found a quarrel upon your right of compelling a man to continue addresses to a female relative which the fair lady has already refused so that fergus was compelled to stomach this supposed affront until the whirligig of time whose motion he promised himself he would watch most sedulously should bring about an opportunity of revenge  waverleys servant always led a saddlehorse for him in the rear of the battalion to which he was attached though his master seldom rode but now incensed at the domineering and unreasonable conduct of his late friend he fell behind the column and mounted his horse resolving to seek the baron of bradwardine and request permission to volunteer in his troop instead of the macivor regiment  a happy time of it i should have had thought he after he was mounted to have been so closely allied to this superb specimen of pride and selfopinion and passion a colonel why he should have been a generalissimo a petty chief of three or four hundred men his pride might suffice for the cham of tartarythe grand seigniorthe great mogul i am well free of him were flora an angel she would bring with her a second lucifer of ambition and wrath for a brotherinlaw  the baron whose learning like sanchos jests while in the sierra morena seemed to grow mouldy for want of exercise joyfully embraced the opportunity of waverleys offering his service in his regiment to bring it into some exertion the goodnatured old gentleman however laboured to effect a reconciliation between the two quondam friends fergus turned a cold ear to his remonstrances though he gave them a respectful hearing and as for waverley he saw no reason why he should be the first in courting a renewal of the intimacy which the chieftain had so unreasonably disturbed the baron then mentioned the matter to the prince who anxious to prevent quarrels in his little army declared he would himself remonstrate with colonel macivor on the unreasonableness of his conduct but in the hurry of their march it was a day or two before he had an opportunity to exert his influence in the manner proposed  in the meanwhile waverley turned the instructions he had received while in gardiners dragoons to some account and assisted the baron in his command as a sort of adjutant parmi les aveugles un borgne est roi says the french proverb and the cavalry which consisted chiefly of lowland gentlemen their tenants and servants formed a high opinion of waverleys skill and a great attachment to his person this was indeed partly owing to the satisfaction which they felt at the distinguished english volunteers leaving the highlanders to rank among them for there was a latent grudge between the horse and foot not only owing to the difference of the services but because most of the gentlemen living near the highlands had at one time or other had quarrels with the tribes in their vicinity and all of them looked with a jealous eye on the highlanders avowed pretensions to superior valour and utility in the princes service     chapter xxix  the confusion of king agramants camp   itwas waverleys custom sometimes to ride a little apart from the main body to look at any object of curiosity which occurred on the march they were now in lancashire when attracted by a castellated old hall he left the squadron for half an hour to take a survey and slight sketch of it as he returned down the avenue he was met by ensign maccombich this man had contracted a sort of regard for edward since the day of his first seeing him at tullyveolan and introducing him to the highlands he seemed to loiter as if on purpose to meet with our hero yet as he passed him he only approached his stirrup and pronounced the single word beware and then walked swiftly on shunning all further communication  edward somewhat surprised at this hint followed with his eyes the course of evan who speedily disappeared among the trees his servant alick polwarth who was in attendance also looked after the highlander and then riding up close to his master said  the neer be in me sir if i think youre safe amang thae highland rinthereouts  what do you mean alick said waverley  the macivors sir hae gotten it into their heads that ye hae affronted their young leddy miss flora and i hae heard mae than ane say they wadna tak muckle to mak a blackcock o ye and ye ken weel eneugh theres mony o them wadna mind a bawbee the weising a ball through the prince himsell an the chief gae them the wink or whether he did or no if they thought it a thing that would please him when it was dune  waverley though confident that fergus macivor was incapable of such treachery was by no means equally sure of the forbearance of his followers he knew that where the honour of the chief or his family was supposed to be touched the happiest man would be he that could first avenge the stigma and he had often heard them quote a proverb that the best revenge was the most speedy and most safe coupling this with the hint of evan he judged it most prudent to set spurs to his horse and ride briskly back to the squadron ere he reached the end of the long avenue however a ball whistled past him and the report of a pistol was heard  it was that deevils buckle callum beg said alick i saw him whisk away through amang the reises  edward justly incensed at this act of treachery galloped out of the avenue and observed the battalion of macivor at some distance moving along the common in which it terminated he also saw an individual running very fast to join the party this he concluded was the intended assassin who by leaping an enclosure might easily make a much shorter path to the main body than he could find on horseback unable to contain himself he commanded alick to go to the baron of bradwardine who was at the head of his regiment about half a mile in front and acquaint him with what had happened he himself immediately rode up to ferguss regiment the chief himself was in the act of joining them he was on horseback having returned from waiting on the prince on perceiving edward approaching he put his horse in motion towards him  colonel macivor said waverley without any farther salutation i have to inform you that one of your people has this instant fired at me from a lurkingplace  as that answered macivor excepting the circumstance of a lurkingplace is a pleasure which i presently propose to myself i should be glad to know which of my clansmen dared to anticipate me  i shall certainly be at your command whenever you please the gentleman who took your office upon himself is your page there callum beg  stand forth from the ranks callum did you fire at mr waverley  no answered the unblushing callum  you did said alick polwarth who was already returned having met a trooper by whom he despatched an account of what was going forward to the baron of bradwardine while he himself returned to his master at full gallop neither sparing the rowels of his spurs nor the sides of his horse you did i saw you as plainly as i ever saw the auld kirk at coudingham  you lie replied callum with his usual impenetrable obstinacy the combat between the knights would certainly as in the days of chivalry have been preceded by an encounter between the squires for alick was a stouthearted merseman and feared the bow of cupid far more than a highlanders dirk or claymore but fergus with his usual tone of decision demanded callums pistol the cock was down the pan and muzzle were black with the smoke it had been that instant fired  take that said fergus striking the boy upon the head with the heavy pistolbutt with his whole forcetake that for acting without orders and lying to disguise it callum received the blow without appearing to flinch from it and fell without sign of life stand still upon your lives said fergus to the rest of the clan i blow out the brains of the first man who interferes between mr waverley and me they stood motionless evan dhu alone showed symptoms of vexation and anxiety callum lay on the ground bleeding copiously but no one ventured to give him any assistance it seemed as if he had gotten his deathblow  and now for you mr waverley please to turn your horse twenty yards with me upon the common waverley complied and fergus confronting him when they were a little way from the line of march said with great affected coolness i could not but wonder sir at the fickleness of taste which you were pleased to express the other day but it was not an angel as you justly observed who had charms for you unless she brought an empire for her fortune i have now an excellent commentary upon that obscure text  i am at a loss even to guess at your meaning colonel macivor unless it seems plain that you intend to fasten a quarrel upon me  your affected ignorance shall not serve you sir the princethe prince himself has acquainted me with your manoeuvres i little thought that your engagements with miss bradwardine were the reason of your breaking off your intended match with my sister i suppose the information that the baron had altered the destination of his estate was quite a sufficient reason for slighting your friends sister and carrying off your friends mistress  did the prince tell you i was engaged to miss bradwardine said waverley impossible  he did sir answered macivor so either draw and defend yourself or resign your pretensions to the lady this is absolute madness exclaimed waverley or some strange mistake  o no evasion draw your sword said the infuriated chieftain his own already unsheathed  must i fight in a madmans quarrel  then give up now and forever all pretensions to miss bradwardines hand  what title have you cried waverley utterly losing command of himselfwhat title have you or any man living to dictate such terms to me and he also drew his sword  at this moment the baron of bradwardine followed by several of his troop came up on the spur some from curiosity others to take part in the quarrel which they indistinctly understood had broken out between the macivors and their corps the clan seeing them approach put themselves in motion to support their chieftain and a scene of confusion commenced which seamed likely to terminate in bloodshed a hundred tongues were in motion at once the baron lectured the chieftain stormed the highlanders screamed in gaelic the horsemen cursed and swore in lowland scotch at length matters came to such a pass that the baron threatened to charge the macivors unless they resumed their ranks and many of them in return presented their firearms at him and the other troopers the confusion was privately fostered by old ballenkeiroch who made no doubt that his own day of vengeance was arrived when behold a cry arose of room make way place a monseigneur place a monseigneur this announced the approach of the prince who came up with a party of fitzjamess foreign dragoons that acted as his bodyguard his arrival produced some degree of order the highlanders reassumed their ranks the cavalry fell in and formed squadron and the baron and chieftain were silent  the prince called them and waverley before him having heard the original cause of the quarrel through the villainy of callum beg he ordered him into custody of the provostmarshal for immediate execution in the event of his surviving the chastisement inflicted by his chieftain fergus however in a tone betwixt claiming a right and asking a favour requested he might be left to his disposal and promised his punishment should be exemplary to deny this might have seemed to encroach on the patriarchal authority of the chieftains of which they were very jealous and they were not persons to be disobliged callum was therefore left to the justice of his own tribe  the prince next demanded to know the new cause of quarrel between colonel macivor and waverley there was a pause both gentlemen found the presence of the baron of bradwardine for by this time all three had approached the chevalier by his command an insurmountable barrier against entering upon a subject where the name of his daughter must unavoidably be mentioned they turned their eyes on the ground with looks in which shame and embarrassment were mingled with displeasure the prince who had been educated amongst the discontented and mutinous spirits of the court of st germains where feuds of every kind were the daily subject of solicitude to the dethroned sovereign had served his apprenticeship as old frederick of prussia would have said to the trade of royalty to promote or restore concord among his followers was indispensable accordingly he took his measures  monsieur de beaujeu  monseigneur said a very handsome french cavalry officer who was in attendance  ayez la bonte daligner ces montagnards la ainsi que la cavalerie sil vous plait et de les remettre a la marche vous parlez si bien langlois cela ne vous donneroit pas beaucoup de peine  ah pas du tout monseigneur replied mons le comte de beaujeu his head bending down to the neck of his little prancing highlymanaged charger accordingly he piaffed away in high spirits and confidence to the head of ferguss regiment although understanding not a word of gaelic and very little english  messieurs les sauvages ecossoisdat is gentilmans savages have the goodness darranger vous  the clan comprehending the order more from the gesture than the words and seeing the prince himself present hastened to dress their ranks  ah ver well dat is fort bien said the count de beaujeu gentilmans sauvages mais tres bien eh bien quest ce que vous appelez visage monsieur to a lounging trooper who stood by him ah oui face je vous remercie monsieur gentilshommes have de goodness to make de face to de right par file dat is by files marsh mais tres bien encore messieurs il faut vous mettre a la marche  marchez done au nom de dieu parceque jai oublie le mot anglois mais vous etes des braves gens et me comprenez tres bien  the count next hastened to put the cavalry in motion gentilmans cavalry you must fall in ah par ma foi i did not say fall off i am a fear de little gross fat gentilman is moche hurt ah mon dieu cest le commissaire qui nous a apporte les premieres nouvelles de ce maudit fracas je suis trop fache monsieur  but poor macwheeble who with a sword stuck across him and a white cockade as large as a pancake now figured in the character of a commissary being overturned in the bustle occasioned by the troopers hastening to get themselves in order in the princes presence before he could rally his galloway slunk to the rear amid the unrestrained laughter of the spectators  eh bien messieurs wheel to de right ah dat is it eh monsieur de bradwardine ayez la bonte de vous mettre a la tete de votre regiment car par dieu je nen puis plus  the baron of bradwardine was obliged to go to the assistance of monsieur de beaujeu after he had fairly expended his few english military phrases one purpose of the chevalier was thus answered the other he proposed was that in the eagerness to hear and comprehend commands issued through such an indistinct medium in his own presence the thoughts of the soldiers in both corps might get a current different from the angry channel in which they were flowing at the time  charles edward was no sooner left with the chieftain and waverley the rest of his attendants being at some distance than he said if i owed less to your disinterested friendship i could be most seriously angry with both of you for this very extraordinary and causeless broil at a moment when my fathers service so decidedly demands the most perfect unanimity but the worst of my situation is that my very best friends hold they have liberty to ruin themselves as well as the cause they are engaged in upon the slightest caprice  both the young men protested their resolution to submit every difference to his arbitration indeed said edward i hardly know of what i am accused i sought colonel macivor merely to mention to him that i had narrowly escaped assassination at the hand of his immediate dependent a dastardly revenge which i knew him to be incapable of authorising as to the cause for which he is disposed to fasten a quarrel upon me i am ignorant of it unless it be that he accuses me most unjustly of having engaged the affections of a young lady in prejudice of his pretensions  if there is an error said the chieftain it arises from a conversation which i held this morning with his royal highness himself  with me said the chevalier how can colonel macivor have so far misunderstood me  he then led fergus aside and after five minutes earnest conversation spurred his horse towards edward is it possiblenay ride up colonel for i desire no secretsis it possible mr waverley that i am mistaken in supposing that you are an accepted lover of miss bradwardine a fact of which i was by circumstances though not by communication from you so absolutely convinced that i alleged it to vich ian vohr this morning as a reason why without offence to him you might not continue to be ambitious of an alliance which to an unengaged person even though once repulsed holds out too many charms to be lightly laid aside  your royal highness said waverleymust have founded on circumstances altogether unknown to me when you did me the distinguished honour of supposing me an accepted lover of miss bradwardine i feel the distinction implied in the supposition but i have no title to it for the rest my confidence in my own merit is too justly slight to admit of my hoping for success in any quarter after positive rejection  the chevalier was silent for a moment looking steadily at them both and then said upon my word mr waverley you are a less happy man than i conceived i had very good reason to believe you but now gentlemen allow me to be umpire in this matter not as prince regent but as charles stuart a brother adventurer with you in the same gallant cause lay my pretensions to be obeyed by you entirely out of view and consider your own honour and how far it is well or becoming to give our enemies the advantage and our friends the scandal of showing that few as we are we are not united and forgive me if i add that the names of the ladies who have been mentioned crave more respect from us all than to be made themes of discord  he took fergus a little apart and spoke to him very earnestly for two or three minutes and then returning to waverley said i believe i have satisfied colonel macivor that his resentment was founded upon a misconception to which indeed i myself gave rise and i trust mr waverley is too generous to harbour any recollection of what is past when i assure him that such is the case you must state this matter properly to your clan vich ian vohr to prevent a recurrence of their precipitate violence fergus bowed and now gentlemen let me have the pleasure to see you shake hands  they advanced coldly and with measured steps each apparently reluctant to appear most forward in concession they did however shake hands and parted taking a respectful leave of the chevalier  charles edward footnote see note 12 then rode to the head of the macivors threw himself from his horse begged a drink out of old ballenkeirochs cantine and marched about half a mile along with them inquiring into the history and connexions of sliochd nan ivor adroitly using the few words of gaelic he possessed and affecting a great desire to learn it more thoroughly he then mounted his horse once more and galloped to the barons cavalry which was in front halted them and examined their accoutrements and state of discipline took notice of the principal gentlemen and even of the cadets inquired after their ladies and commended their horses rode about an hour with the baron of bradwardine and endured three long stories about fieldmarshal the duke of berwick  ah beaujeu mon cher ami said he as he returned to his usual place in the line of march que mon metier de prince errant est ennuyant par fois mais courage cest le grand jeu apres tout     chapter xxx  a skirmish   the reader need hardly be reminded that after a council of war held at derby on the 5th of december the highlanders relinquished their desperate attempt to penetrate farther into england and greatly to the dissatisfaction of their young and daring leader positively determined to return northward they commenced their retreat accordingly and by the extreme celerity of their movements outstripped the motions of the duke of cumberland who now pursued them with a very large body of cavalry  this retreat was a virtual resignation of their towering hopes none had been so sanguine as fergus macivor none consequently was so cruelly mortified at the change of measures he argued or rather remonstrated with the utmost vehemence at the council of war and when his opinion was rejected shed tears of grief and indignation from that moment his whole manner was so much altered that he could scarcely have been recognised for the same soaring and ardent spirit for whom the whole earth seemed too narrow but a week before the retreat had continued for several days when edward to his surprise early on the 12th of december received a visit from the chieftain in his quarters in a hamlet about halfway between shap and penrith  having had no intercourse with the chieftain since their rupture edward waited with some anxiety an explanation of this unexpected visit nor could he help being surprised and somewhat shocked with the change in his appearance his eye had lost much of its fire his cheek was hollow his voice was languid even his gait seemed less firm and elastic than it was wont and his dress to which he used to be particularly attentive was now carelessly flung about him he invited edward to walk out with him by the little river in the vicinity and smiled in a melancholy manner when he observed him take down and buckle on his sword  as soon as they were in a wild sequestered path by the side of the stream the chief broke outour fine adventure is now totally ruined waverley and i wish to know what you intend to donay never stare at me man i tell you i received a packet from my sister yesterday and had i got the information it contains sooner it would have prevented a quarrel which i am always vexed when i think of in a letter written after our dispute i acquainted her with the cause of it and she now replies to me that she never had nor could have any purpose of giving you encouragement so that it seems i have acted like a madman poor flora she writes in high spirits what a change will the news of this unhappy retreat make in her state of mind      waverley who was really much affected by the deep tone of melancholy with which fergus spoke affectionately entreated him to banish from his remembrance any unkindness which had arisen between them and they once more shook hands but now with sincere cordiality fergus again inquired of waverley what he intended to do had you not better leave this luckless army and get down before us into scotland and embark for the continent from some of the eastern ports that are still in our possession when you are out of the kingdom your friends will easily negotiate your pardon and to tell you the truth i wish you would carry rose bradwardine with you as your wife and take flora also under your joint protectionedward looked surprisedshe loves you and i believe you love her though perhaps you have not found it out for you are not celebrated for knowing your own mind very pointedly he said this with a sort of smile  how answered edward can you advise me to desert the expedition in which we are all embarked  embarked said fergus the vessel is going to pieces and it is full time for all who can to get into the longboat and leave her  why what will other gentlemen do answered waverley and why did the highland chiefs consent to this retreat if it is so ruinous  o replied macivor they think that as on former occasions the heading hanging and forfeiting will chiefly fall to the lot of the lowland gentry that they will be left secure in their poverty and their fastnesses there according to their proverb to listen to the wind upon the hill till the waters abate but they will be disappointed they have been too often troublesome to be so repeatedly passed over and this time john bull has been too heartily frightened to recover his goodhumour for some time the hanoverian ministers always deserved to be hanged for rascals but now if they get the power in their handsas sooner or later they must since there is neither rising in england nor assistance from francethey will deserve the gallows as fools if they leave a single clan in the highlands in a situation to be again troublesome to government ay they will make rootandbranchwork i warrant them  and while you recommend flight to me said edwarda counsel which i would rather die than embracewhat are your own views  o answered fergus with a melancholy air my fate is settled dead or captive i must be before tomorrow  what do you mean by that my friend said edward the enemy is still a days march in our rear and if he comes up we are still strong enough to keep him in check remember gladsmuir  what i tell you is true notwithstanding so far as i am individually concerned  upon what authority can you found so melancholy a prediction asked waverley  on one which never failed a person of my house i have seen he said lowering his voice i have seen the bodach glas  bodach glas  yes have you been so long at glennaquoich and never heard of the grey spectre though indeed there is a certain reluctance among us to mention him  no never  ah it would have been a tale for poor flora to have told you or if that hill were benmore and that long blue lake which you see just winding towards yon mountainous country were loch tay or my own loch an ri the tale would be better suited with scenery however let us sit down on this knoll even saddleback and ulswater will suit what i have to say better than the english hedgerows enclosures and farmhouses you must know then that when my ancestor ian nan chaistel wasted northumberland there was associated with him in the expedition a sort of southland chief or captain of a band of lowlanders called halbert hall in their return through the cheviots they quarrelled about the division of the great booty they had acquired and came from words to blows the lowlanders were cut off to a man and their chief fell the last covered with wounds by the sword of my ancestor since that time his spirit has crossed the vich ian vohr of the day when any great disaster was impending but especially before approaching death my father saw him twice once before he was made prisoner at sheriffmuir another time on the morning of the day on which he died  how can you my dear fergus tell such nonsense with a grave face  i do not ask you to believe it but i tell you the truth ascertained by three hundred years experience at least and last night by my own eyes  the particulars for heavens sake said waverley with eagerness  i will on condition you will not attempt a jest on the subject since this unhappy retreat commenced i have scarce ever been able to sleep for thinking of my clan and of this poor prince whom they are leading back like a dog in a string whether he will or no and of the downfall of my family last night i felt so feverish that i left my quarters and walked out in hopes the keen frosty air would brace my nervesi cannot tell how much i dislike going on for i know you will hardly believe me howeveri crossed a small footbridge and kept walking backwards and forwards when i observed with surprise by the clear moonlight a tall figure in a grey plaid such as shepherds wear in the south of scotland which move at what pace i would kept regularly about four yards before me  you saw a cumberland peasant in his ordinary dress probably  no i thought so at first and was astonished at the mans audacity in daring to dog me i called to him but received no answer i felt an anxious throbbing at my heart and to ascertain what i dreaded i stood still and turned myself on the same spot successively to the four points of the compass by heaven edward turn where i would the figure was instantly before my eyes at precisely the same distance i was then convinced it was the bodach glas my hair bristled and my knees shook i manned myself however and determined to return to my quarters my ghastly visitant glided before me for i cannot say he walked until he reached the footbridge there he stopped and turned full round i must either wade the river or pass him as close as i am to you a desperate courage founded on the belief that my death was near made me resolve to make my way in despite of him i made the sign of the cross drew my sword and uttered in the name of god evil spirit give place vich ian vohr it said in a voice that made my very blood curdle beware of tomorrow it seemed at that moment not half a yard from my swords point but the words were no sooner spoken than it was gone and nothing appeared further to obstruct my passage i got home and threw myself on my bed where i spent a few hours heavily enough and this morning as no enemy was reported to be near us i took my horse and rode forward to make up matters with you i would not willingly fall until i am in charity with a wronged friend  edward had little doubt that this phantom was the operation of an exhausted frame and depressed spirits working on the belief common to all highlanders in such superstitions he did not the less pity fergus for whom in his present distress he felt all his former regard revive with the view of diverting his mind from these gloomy images he offered with the barons permission which he knew he could readily obtain to remain in his quarters till ferguss corps should come up and then to march with them as usual the chief seemed much pleased yet hesitated to accept the offer  we are you know in the rear the post of danger in a retreat  and therefore the post of honour  well replied the chieftain let alick have your horse in readiness in case we should be overmatched and i shall be delighted to have your company once more  the rearguard were late in making their appearance having been delayed by various accidents and by the badness of the roads at length they entered the hamlet when waverley joined the clan macivor arminarm with their chieftain all the resentment they had entertained against him seemed blown off at once evan dhu received him with a grin of congratulation and even callum who was running about as active as ever pale indeed and with a great patch on his head appeared delighted to see him  that gallowsbirds skull said fergus must be harder than marble the lock of the pistol was actually broken  how could you strike so young a lad so hard said waverley with some interest  why if i did not strike hard sometimes the rascals would forget themselves  they were now in full march every caution being taken to prevent surprise ferguss people and a fine clan regiment from badenoch commanded by cluny macpherson had the rear they had passed a large open moor and were entering into the enclosures which surround a small village called clifton the winter sun had set and edward began to rally fergus upon the false predictions of the grey spirit the ides of march are not past said macivor with a smile when suddenly casting his eyes back on the moor a large body of cavalry was indistinctly seen to hover upon its brown and dark surface to line the enclosures facing the open ground and the road by which the enemy must move from it upon the village was the work of a short time while these manoeuvres were accomplishing night sunk down dark and gloomy though the moon was at full sometimes however she gleamed forth a dubious light upon the scene of action  the highlanders did not long remain undisturbed in the defensive position they had adopted favoured by the night one large body of dismounted dragoons attempted to force the enclosures while another equally strong strove to penetrate by the highroad both were received by such a heavy fire as disconcerted their ranks and effectually checked their progress unsatisfied with the advantage thus gained fergus to whose ardent spirit the approach of danger seemed to restore all its elasticity drawing his sword and calling out claymore encouraged his men by voice and example to break through the hedge which divided them and rush down upon the enemy mingling with the dismounted dragoons they forced them at the swordpoint to fly to the open moor where a considerable number were cut to pieces but the moon which suddenly shone out showed to the english the small number of assailants disordered by their own success two squadrons of horse moving to the support of their companions the highlanders endeavoured to recover the enclosures but several of them amongst others their brave chieftain were cut off and surrounded before they could effect their purpose waverley looking eagerly for fergus from whom as well as from the retreating body of his followers he had been separated in the darkness and tumult saw him with evan dhu and callum defending themselves desperately against a dozen of horsemen who were hewing at them with their long broadswords the moon was again at that moment totally overclouded and edward in the obscurity could neither bring aid to his friends nor discover which way lay his own road to rejoin the rearguard after once or twice narrowly escaping being slain or made prisoner by parties of the cavalry whom he encountered in the darkness he at length reached an enclosure and clambering over it concluded himself in safety and on the way to the highland forces whose pipes he heard at some distance for fergus hardly a hope remained unless that he might be made prisoner revolving his fate with sorrow and anxiety the superstition of the bodach glas recurred to edwards recollection and he said to himself with internal surprise what can the devil speak truth footnote see note 13     chapter xxxi  chapter of accidents   edward was in a most unpleasant and dangerous situation he soon lost the sound of the bagpipes and what was yet more unpleasant when after searching long in vain and scrambling through many enclosures he at length approached the highroad he learned from the unwelcome noise of kettledrums and trumpets that the english cavalry now occupied it and consequently were between him and the highlanders precluded therefore from advancing in a straight direction he resolved to avoid the english military and endeavour to join his friends by making a circuit to the left for which a beaten path deviating from the main road in that direction seemed to afford facilities the path was muddy and the night dark and cold but even these inconveniences were hardly felt amidst the apprehensions which falling into the hands of the kings forces reasonably excited in his bosom  after walking about three miles he at length reached a hamlet conscious that the common people were in general unfavourable to the cause he had espoused yet desirous if possible to procure a horse and guide to penrith where he hoped to find the rear if not the main body of the chevaliers army he approached the alehouse of the place there was a great noise within he paused to listen a round english oath or two and the burden of a campaign song convinced him the hamlet also was occupied by the duke of cumberlands soldiers endeavouring to retire from it as softly as possible and blessing the obscurity which hitherto he had murmured against waverley groped his way the best he could along a small paling which seemed the boundary of some cottage garden as he reached the gate of this little enclosure his outstretched hand was grasped by that of a female whose voice at the same time uttered edward ist thou man  here is some unlucky mistake thought edward struggling but gently to disengage himself  naen o thy foun now man or the red cwoats will hear thee they hae been houlerying and poulerying every ane that past alehouse door this noight to make them drive their waggons and sick loike come into feythers or theyll do ho a mischief  a good hint thought waverley following the girl through the little garden into a brickpaved kitchen where she set herself to kindle a match at an expiring fire and with the match to light a candle she had no sooner looked on edward than she dropped the light with a shrill scream of o feyther feyther  the father thus invoked speedily appeareda sturdy old farmer in a pair of leather breeches and boots pulled on without stockings having just started from his bed the rest of his dress was only a westmoreland statesmans robedechambrethat is his shirt his figure was displayed to advantage by a candle which he bore in his left hand in his right he brandished a poker  what hast ho here wench  o cried the poor girl almost going off in hysterics i thought it was ned williams and it is one of the plaidmen  and what was thee ganging to do wi ned williams at this time o noight to this which was perhaps one of the numerous class of questions more easily asked than answered the rosycheeked damsel made no reply but continued sobbing and wringing her hands  and thee lad dost ho know that the dragoons be a town dost ho know that mon ad theyll sliver thee loike a turnip mon  i know my life is in great danger said waverley but if you can assist me i will reward you handsomely i am no scotchman but an unfortunate english gentleman  be ho scot or no said the honest farmer i wish thou hadst kept the other side of the hallan but since thou art here jacob jopson will betray no mans bluid and the plaids were gay canny and did not do so much mischief when they were here yesterday accordingly he set seriously about sheltering and refreshing our hero for the night the fire was speedily rekindled but with precaution against its light being seen from without the jolly yeoman cut a rasher of bacon which cicely soon broiled and her father added a swingeing tankard of his best ale it was settled that edward should remain there till the troops marched in the morning then hire or buy a horse from the farmer and with the best directions that could be obtained endeavour to overtake his friends a clean though coarse bed received him after the fatigues of this unhappy day  with the morning arrived the news that the highlanders had evacuated penrith and marched off towards carlisle that the duke of cumberland was in possession of penrith and that detachments of his army covered the roads in every direction to attempt to get through undiscovered would be an act of the most frantic temerity ned williams the right edward was now called to council by cicely and her father ned who perhaps did not care that his handsome namesake should remain too long in the same house with his sweetheart for fear of fresh mistakes proposed that waverley exchanging his uniform and plaid for the dress of the country should go with him to his fathers farm near ullswater and remain in that undisturbed retirement until the military movements in the country should have ceased to render his departure hazardous a price was also agreed upon at which the stranger might board with farmer williams if he thought proper till he could depart with safety it was of moderate amount the distress of his situation among this honest and simplehearted race being considered as no reason for increasing their demand  the necessary articles of dress were accordingly procured and by following bypaths known to the young farmer they hoped to escape any unpleasant rencontre a recompense for their hospitality was refused peremptorily by old jopson and his cherrycheeked daughter a kiss paid the one and a hearty shake of the hand the other both seemed anxious for their guests safety and took leave of him with kind wishes  in the course of their route edward with his guide traversed those fields which the night before had been the scene of action a brief gleam of decembers sun shone sadly on the broad heath which towards the spot where the great northwest road entered the enclosures of lord lonsdales property exhibited dead bodies of men and horses and the usual companions of war a number of carrioncrows hawks and ravens  and this then was thy last field said waverley to himself his eye filling at the recollection of the many splendid points of ferguss character and of their former intimacy all his passions and imperfections forgottenhere fell the last vich ian vohr on a nameless heath and in an obscure nightskirmish was quenched that ardent spirit who thought it little to cut a way for his master to the british throne ambition policy bravery all far beyond their sphere here learned the fate of mortals the sole support too of a sister whose spirit as proud and unbending was even more exalted than thine own here ended all thy hopes for flora and the long and valued line which it was thy boast to raise yet more highly by thy adventurous valour  as these ideas pressed on waverleys mind he resolved to go upon the open heath and search if among the slain he could discover the body of his friend with the pious intention of procuring for him the last rites of sepulture the timorous young man who accompanied him remonstrated upon the danger of the attempt but edward was determined the followers of the camp had already stripped the dead of all they could carry away but the country people unused to scenes of blood had not yet approached the field of action though some stood fearfully gazing at a distance about sixty or seventy dragoons lay slain within the first enclosure upon the highroad and on the open moor of the highlanders not above a dozen had fallen chiefly those who venturing too far on the moor could not regain the strong ground he could not find the body of fergus among the slain on a little knoll separated from the others lay the carcasses of three english dragoons two horses and the page callum beg whose hard skull a troopers broadsword had at length effectually cloven it was possible his clan had carried off the body of fergus but it was also possible he had escaped especially as evan dhu who would never leave his chief was not found among the dead or he might be prisoner and the less formidable denunciation inferred from the appearance of the bodach glas might have proved the true one the approach of a party sent for the purpose of compelling the country people to bury the dead and who had already assembled several peasants for that purpose now obliged edward to rejoin his guide who awaited him in great anxiety and fear under shade of the plantations  after leaving this field of death the rest of their journey was happily accomplished at the house of farmer williams edward passed for a young kinsman educated for the church who was come to reside there till the civil tumults permitted him to pass through the country this silenced suspicion among the kind and simple yeomanry of cumberland and accounted sufficiently for the grave manners and retired habits of the new guest the precaution became more necessary than waverley had anticipated as a variety of incidents prolonged his stay at fasthwaite as the farm was called  a tremendous fall of snow rendered his departure impossible for more than ten days when the roads began to become a little practicable they successively received news of the retreat of the chevalier into scotland then that he had abandoned the frontiers retiring upon glasgow and that the duke of cumberland had formed the siege of carlisle his army therefore cut off all possibility of waverleys escaping into scotland in that direction on the eastern border marshal wade with a large force was advancing upon edinburgh and all along the frontier parties of militia volunteers and partizans were in arms to suppress insurrection and apprehend such stragglers from the highland army as had been left in england the surrender of carlisle and the severity with which the rebel garrison were threatened soon formed an additional reason against venturing upon a solitary and hopeless journey through a hostile country and a large army to carry the assistance of a single sword to a cause which seemed altogether desperate in this lonely and secluded situation without the advantage of company or conversation with men of cultivated minds the arguments of colonel talbot often recurred to the mind of our hero a still more anxious recollection haunted his slumbersit was the dying look and gesture of colonel gardiner most devoutly did he hope as the rarely occurring post brought news of skirmishes with various success that it might never again be his lot to draw his sword in civil conflict then his mind turned to the supposed death of fergus to the desolate situation of flora and with yet more tender recollection to that of rose bradwardine who was destitute of the devoted enthusiasm of loyalty which to her friend hallowed and exalted misfortune these reveries he was permitted to enjoy undisturbed by queries or interruption and it was in many a winter walk by the shores of ullswater that he acquired a more complete mastery of a spirit tamed by adversity than his former experience had given him and that he felt himself entitled to say firmly though perhaps with a sigh that the romance of his life was ended and that its real history had now commenced he was soon called upon to justify his pretensions by reason and philosophy     chapter xxxii  a journey to london   theamily at fasthwaite were soon attached to edward he had indeed that gentleness and urbanity which almost universally attracts corresponding kindness and to their simple ideas his learning gave him consequence and his sorrows interest the last he ascribed evasively to the loss of a brother in the skirmish near clifton and in that primitive state of society where the ties of affection were highly deemed of his continued depression excited sympathy but not surprise  in the end of january his more lively powers were called out by the happy union of edward williams the son of his host with cicely jopson our hero would not cloud with sorrow the festivity attending the wedding of two persons to whom he was so highly obliged he therefore exerted himself danced sung played at the various games of the day and was the blithest of the company the next morning however he had more serious matters to think of  the clergyman who had married the young couple was so much pleased with the supposed student of divinity that he came next day from penrith on purpose to pay him a visit this might have been a puzzling chapter had he entered into any examination of our heros supposed theological studies but fortunately he loved better to hear and communicate the news of the day he brought with him two or three old newspapers in one of which edward found a piece of intelligence that soon rendered him deaf to every word which the reverend mr twigtythe was saying upon the news from the north and the prospect of the dukes speedily overtaking and crushing the rebels this was an article in these or nearly these words  died at his house in hill street berkeley square upon the 10th inst richard waverley esq second son of sir giles waverley of waverleyhonour etc etc he died of a lingering disorder augmented by the unpleasant predicament of suspicion in which he stood having been obliged to find bail to a high amount to meet an impending accusation of hightreason an accusation of the same grave crime hangs over his elder brother sir everard waverley the representative of that ancient family and we understand the day of his trial will be fixed early in the next month unless edward waverley son of the deceased richard and heir to the baronet shall surrender himself to justice in that case we are assured it is his majestys gracious purpose to drop further proceedings upon the charge against sir everard this unfortunate young gentleman is ascertained to have been in arms in the pretenders service and to have marched along with the highland troops into england but he has not been heard of since the skirmish at clifton on the 18th december last  such was this distracting paragraph good god exclaimed waverley am i then a parricide impossible my father who never showed the affection of a father while he lived cannot have been so much affected by my supposed death as to hasten his own no i will not believe it it were distraction to entertain for a moment such a horrible idea but it were if possible worse than parricide to suffer any danger to hang over my noble and generous uncle who has ever been more to me than a father if such evil can be averted by any sacrifice on my part  while these reflections passed like the stings of scorpions through waverleys sensorium the worthy divine was startled in a long disquisition on the battle of falkirk by the ghastliness which they communicated to his looks and asked him if he was ill fortunately the bride all smirk and blush had just entered the room mrs williams was none of the brightest of women but she was goodnatured and readily concluding that edward had been shocked by disagreeable news in the papers interfered so judiciously that without exciting suspicion she drew off mr twigtythes attention and engaged it until he soon after took his leave waverley then explained to his friends that he was under the necessity of going to london with as little delay as possible  one cause of delay however did occur to which waverley had been very little accustomed his purse though well stocked when he first went to tullyveolan had not been reinforced since that period and although his life since had not been of a nature to exhaust it hastily for he had lived chiefly with his friends or with the army yet he found that after settling with his kind landlord he should be too poor to encounter the expense of travelling post the best course therefore seemed to be to get into the great north road about boroughbridge and there take a place in the northern diligence a huge oldfashioned tub drawn by three horses which completed the journey from edinburgh to london god willing as the advertisement expressed it in three weeks our hero therefore took an affectionate farewell of his cumberland friends whose kindness he promised never to forget and tacitly hoped ene day to acknowledge by substantial proofs of gratitude after some petty difficulties and vexatious delays and after putting his dress into a shape better befitting his rank though perfectly plain and simple he accomplished crossing the country and found himself in the desired vehicle visavis to mrs nosebag the lady of lieutenant nosebag adjutant and ridingmaster of thedragoons a jolly woman of about fifty wearing a blue habit faced with scarlet and grasping a silvermounted horsewhip  this lady was one of those active members of society who take upon them faire lefrais de la conversation she had just returned from the north and informed edward how nearly her regiment had cut the petticoat people into ribands at falkirk only somehow there was one of those nasty awkward marshes that they are never without in scotland i think and so our poor dear little regiment suffered something as my nosebag says in that unsatisfactory affair you sir have served in the dragoons waverley was taken so much at unawares that he acquiesced  o i knew it at once i saw you were military from your air and i was sure you could be none of the footwobblers as my nosebag calls them what regiment pray here was a delightful question waverley however justly concluded that this good lady had the whole armylist by heart and to avoid detection by adhering to truth answered gardiners dragoons maam but i have retired some time  o aye those as won the race at the battle of preston as my nosebag says pray sir were you there  i was so unfortunate madam he replied as to witness that engagement  and that was a misfortune that few of gardiners stood to witness i believe sirha ha ha i beg your pardon but a soldiers wife loves a joke  devil confound you thought waverley what infernal luck has penned me up with this inquisitive hag  fortunately the good lady did not stick long to one subject we are coming to ferrybridge now she said where there was a party of ours left to support the beadles and constables and justices and these sort of creatures that are examining papers and stopping rebels and all that they were hardly in the inn before she dragged waverley to the window exclaiming yonder comes corporal bridoon of our poor dear troop hes coming with the constable man bridoons one of my lambs as nosebag calls ern come mraapray whats your name sir  butler maam said waverley resolved rather to make free with the name of a former fellowofficer than run the risk of detection by inventing one not to be found in the regiment  o you got a troop lately when that shabby fellow waverley went over to the rebels lord i wish our old cross captain crump would go over to the rebels that nosebag might get the troop lord what can bridoon be standing swinging on the bridge for ill be hanged if he ant hazy as nosebag says come sir as you and i belong to the service well go put the rascal in mind of his duty  waverley with feelings more easily conceived than described saw himself obliged to follow this doughty female commander the gallant trooper was as like a lamb as a drunk corporal of dragoons about six feet high with very broad shoulders and very thin legs not to mention a great scar across his nose could well be mrs nosebag addressed him with something which if not an oath sounded very like one and commanded him to attend to his duty you be dd for a commenced the gallant cavalier but looking up in order to suit the action to the words and also to enforce the epithet which he meditated with an adjective applicable to the party he recognised the speaker made his military salaam and altered his tone lord love your handsome face madam nosebag is it you why if a poor fellow does happen to fire a slug of a morning i am sure you were never the lady to bring him to harm  well you rascallion go mind your duty this gentleman and i belong to the service but be sure you look after that shy cock in the slouched hat that sits in the corner of the coach i believe hes one of the rebels in disguise  dn her gooseberry wig said the corporal when she was out of hearing that gimleteyed jademother adjutant as we call heris a greater plague to the regiment than provostmarshal sergeantmajor and old hubbledeshuff the colonel into the bargain come master constable lets see if this shy cock as she calls him who by the way was a quaker from leeds with whom mrs nosebag had had some tart argument on the legality of bearing arms will stand godfather to a sup of brandy for your yorkshire ale is cold on my stomach  the vivacity of this good lady as it helped edward out of this scrape was like to have drawn him into one or two others in every town where they stopped she wished to examine the corps de garde if there was one and once very narrowly missed introducing waverley to a recruitingsergeant of his own regiment then she captaind and butlerd him till he was almost mad with vexation and anxiety and never was he more rejoiced in his life at the termination of a journey than when the arrival of the coach in london freed him from the attentions of madam nosebag     chapter xxxiii  whats to be done next   itwas twilight when they arrived in town and having shaken off his companions and walked through a good many streets to avoid the possibility of being traced by them edward took a hackneycoach and drove to colonel talbots house in one of the principal squares at the west end of the town that gentleman by the death of relations had succeeded since his marriage to a large fortune possessed considerable political interest and lived in what is called great style  when waverley knocked at his door he found it at first difficult to procure admittance but at length was shown into an apartment where the colonel was at table lady emily whose very beautiful features were still pallid from indisposition sate opposite to him the instant he heard waverleys voice he started up and embraced him frank stanley my dear boy how dye do emily my love this is young stanley  the blood started to the ladys cheek as she gave waverley a reception in which courtesy was mingled with kindness while her trembling hand and faltering voice showed how much she was startled and discomposed dinner was hastily replaced and while waverley was engaged in refreshing himself the colonel proceededi wonder you have come here frank the doctors tell me the air of london is very bad for your complaints you should not have risked it but i am delighted to see you and so is emily though i fear we must not reckon upon your staying long  some particular business brought me up muttered waverley  i supposed so but i shant allow you to stay long spontoon to an elderly militarylooking servant out of liverytake away these things and answer the bell yourself if i ring dont let any of the other fellows disturb us my nephew and i have business to talk of  when the servants had retired in the name of god waverley what has brought you here it may be as much as your life is worth  dear mr waverley said lady emily to whom i owe so much more than acknowledgments can ever pay how could you be so rash  my fathermy unclethis paragraphhe handed the paper to colonel talbot  i wish to heaven these scoundrels were condemned to be squeezed to death in their own presses said talbot i am told there are not less than a dozen of their papers now published in town and no wonder that they are obliged to invent lies to find sale for their journals it is true however my dear edward that you have lost your father but as to this flourish of his unpleasant situation having grated upon his spirits and hurt his healththe truth isfor though it is harsh to say so now yet it will relieve your mind from the idea of weighty responsibilitythe truth then is that mr richard waverley through this whole business showed great want of sensibility both to your situation and that of your uncle and the last time i saw him he told me with great glee that as i was so good as to take charge of your interests he had thought it best to patch up a separate negotiation for himself and make his peace with government through some channels which former connexions left still open to him  and my uncle my dear uncle  is in no danger whatever it is true looking at the date of the paper there was a foolish report some time ago to the purport here quoted but it is entirely false sir everard is gone down to waverleyhonour freed from all uneasiness unless upon your own account but you are in peril yourself your name is in every proclamation warrants are out to apprehend you how and when did you come here  edward told his story at length suppressing his quarrel with fergus for being himself partial to highlanders he did not wish to give any advantage to the colonels national prejudice against them  are you sure it was your friend glens footboy you saw dead in clifton moor  quite positive  then that little limb of the devil has cheated the gallows for cutthroat was written in his face though turning to lady emily it was a very handsome face too but for you edward i wish you would go down again to cumberland or rather i wish you had never stirred from thence for there is an embargo in all the seaports and a strict search for the adherents of the pretender and the tongue of that confounded woman will wag in her head like the clack of a mill till somehow or other she will detect captain butler to be a feigned personage  do you know anything asked waverley of my fellowtraveller  her husband was my sergeantmajor for six years she was a buxom widow with a little money he married her was steady and got on by being a good drill i must send spontoon to see what she is about he will find her out among the old regimental connections tomorrow you must be indisposed and keep your room from fatigue lady emily is to be your nurse and spontoon and i your attendants you bear the name of a near relation of mine whom none of my present people ever saw except spontoon so there will be no immediate danger so pray feel your head ache and your eyes grow heavy as soon as possible that you may be put upon the sicklist and emily do you order an apartment for frank stanley with all the attentions which an invalid may require  in the morning the colonel visited his guest now said he i have some good news for you your reputation as a gentleman and officer is effectually cleared of neglect of duty and accession to the mutiny in gardiners regiment i have had a correspondence on this subject with a very zealous friend of yours your scottish parson morton his first letter was addressed to sir everard but i relieved the good baronet of the trouble of answering it you must know that your freebooting acquaintance donald of the cave has at length fallen into the hands of the philistines he was driving off the cattle of a certain proprietor called killansomething or other  killancureit  the same now the gentleman being it seems a great farmer and having a special value for his breed of cattle being moreover rather of a timid disposition had got a party of soldiers to protect his property so donald ran his head unawares into the lions mouth and was defeated and made prisoner being ordered for execution his conscience was assailed on the one hand by a catholic priest on the other by your friend morton he repulsed the catholic chiefly on account of the doctrine of extreme unction which this economical gentleman considered as an excessive waste of oil so his conversion from a state of impenitence fell to mr mortons share who i daresay acquitted himself excellently though i suppose donald made but a queer kind of christian after all he confessed however before a magistrate one major melville who seems to have been a correct friendly sort of person his full intrigue with houghton explaining particularly how it was carried on and fully acquitting you of the least accession to it he also mentioned his rescuing you from the hands of the volunteer officer and sending you by orders of the pretchevalier i meanas a prisoner to doune from whence he understood you were carried prisoner to edinburgh these are particulars which cannot but tell in your favour he hinted that he had been employed to deliver and protect you and rewarded for doing so but he would not confess by whom alleging that though he would not have minded breaking any ordinary oath to satisfy the curiosity of mr morton to whose pious admonitions he owed so much yet in the present case he had been sworn to silence upon the edge of his dirk footnote see note 38 which it seems constituted in his opinion an inviolable obligation  and what is become of him  oh he was hanged at stirling after the rebels raised the siege with his lieutenant and four plaids besides he having the advantage of a gallows more lofty than his friends  well i have little cause either to regret or rejoice at his death and yet he has done me both good and harm to a very considerable extent  his confession at least will serve you materially since it wipes from your character all those suspicions which gave the accusation against you a complexion of a nature different from that with which so many unfortunate gentlemen now or lately in arms against the government may be justly charged their treasoni must give it its name though you participate in its guiltis an action arising from mistaken virtue and therefore cannot be classed as a disgrace though it be doubtless highly criminal where the guilty are so numerous clemency must be extended to far the greater number and i have little doubt of procuring a remission for you providing we can keep you out of the claws of justice till she has selected and gorged upon her victims for in this as in other cases it will be according to the vulgar proverb first come first served besides government are desirous at present to intimidate the english jacobites among whom they can find few examples for punishment this is a vindictive and timid feeling which will soon wear off for of all nations the english are least bloodthirsty by nature but it exists at present and you must therefore be kept out of the way in the meantime  now entered spontoon with an anxious countenance by his regimental acquaintances he had traced out madam nosebag and found her full of ire fuss and fidget at discovery of an impostor who had travelled from the north with her under the assumed name of captain butler of gardiners dragoons she was going to lodge an information on the subject to have him sought for as an emissary of the pretender but spontoon an old soldier while he pretended to approve contrived to make her delay her intention no time however was to be lost the accuracy of this good dames description might probably lead to the discovery that waverley was the pretended captain butler an identification fraught with danger to edward perhaps to his uncle and even to colonel talbot which way to direct his course was now therefore the question  to scotland said waverley  to scotland said the colonel with what purpose not to engage again with the rebels i hope  no i considered my campaign ended when after all my efforts i could not rejoin them and now by all accounts they are gone to make a winter campaign in the highlands where such adherents as i am would rather be burdensome than useful indeed it seems likely that they only prolong the war to place the chevaliers person out of danger and then to make some terms for themselves to burden them with my presence would merely add another party whom they would not give up and could not defend i understand they left almost all their english adherents in garrison at carlisle for that very reason and on a more general view colonel to confess the truth though it may lower me in your opinion i am heartly tired of the trade of war and am as fletchers humorous lieutenant says even as weary of this fighting  fighting pooh what have you seen but a skirmish or two ah if you saw war on the grand scalesixty or a hundred thousand men in the field on each side  i am not at all curious colonel enough says our homely proverb is as good as a feast the plumed troops and the big war used to enchant me in poetry but the night marches vigils couches under the wintry sky and such accompaniments of the glorious trade are not at all to my taste in practice then for dry blows i had my fill of fighting at clifton where i escaped by a hairsbreadth half a dozen times and you i should think he stopped  had enough of it at preston you mean to say answered the colonel laughing but tis my vocation hal  it is not mine though said waverley and having honourably got rid of the sword which i drew only as a volunteer i am quite satisfied with my military experience and shall be in no hurry to take it up again  i am very glad you are of that mind but then what would you do in the north  in the first place there are some seaports on the eastern coast of scotland still in the hands of the chevaliers friends should i gain any of them i can easily embark for the continent  good your second reason  why to speak the very truth there is a person in scotland upon whom i now find my happiness depends more than i was always aware and about whose situation i am very anxious  then emily was right and there is a love affair in the case after all and which of these two pretty scotchwomen whom you insisted upon my admiring is the distinguished fair not miss gleni hope  no  ah pass for the other simplicity may be improved but pride and conceit never well i dont discourage you i think it will please sir everard from what he said when i jested with him about it only i hope that intolerable papa with his brogue and his snuff and his latin and his insufferable long stories about the duke of berwick will find it necessary hereafter to be an inhabitant of foreign parts but as to the daughter though i think you might find as fitting a match in england yet if your heart be really set upon this scotch rosebud why the baronet has a great opinion of her father and of his family and he wishes much to see you married and settled both for your own sake and for that of the three ermines passant which may otherwise pass away altogether but i will bring you his mind fully upon the subject since you are debarred correspondence for the present for i think you will not be long in scotland before me  indeed and what can induce you to think of returning to scotland no relenting longings towards the land of mountains and floods i am afraid  none on my word but emilys health is now thank god reestablished and to tell you the truth i have little hopes of concluding the business which i have at present most at heart until i can have a personal interview with his royal highness the commanderinchief for as fluellen says the duke doth love me well and i thank heaven i have deserved some love at his hands i am now going out for an hour or two to arrange matters for your departure your liberty extends to the next room lady emilys parlour where you will find her when you are disposed for music reading or conversation we have taken measures to exclude all servants but spontoon who is as true as steel  in about two hours colonel talbot returned and found his young friend conversing with his lady she pleased with his manners and information and he delighted at being restored though but for a moment to the society of his own rank from which he had been for some time excluded  and now said the colonel hear my arrangements for there is little time to lose this youngster edward waverley alias williams alias captain butler must continue to pass by his fourth alias of francis stanley my nephew he shall set out tomorrow for the north and the chariot shall take him the first two stages spontoon shall then attend him and they shall ride post as far as huntingdon and the presence of spontoon well known on the road as my servant will check all disposition to inquiry at huntingdon you will meet the real frank stanley he is studying at cambridge but a little while ago doubtful if emilys health would permit me to go down to the north myself i procured him a passport from the secretary of states office to go in my stead as he went chiefly to look after you his journey is now unnecessary he knows your story you will dine together at huntingdon and perhaps your wise heads may hit upon some plan for removing or diminishing the danger of your farther progress northward and now taking out a morocco case let me put you in funds for the campaign  i am ashamed my dear colonel  nay said colonel talbot you should command my purse in any event but this money is your own your father considering the chance of your being attainted left me his trustee for your advantage so that you are worth above l15000 besides brerewood lodgea very independent person i promise you there are bills here for l200 any larger sum you may have or credit abroad as soon as your motions require it  the first use which occurred to waverley of his newly acquired wealth was to write to honest farmer jopson requesting his acceptance of a silver tankard on the part of his friend williams who had not forgotten the night of the eighteenth december last he begged him at the same time carefully to preserve for him his highland garb and accoutrements particularly the arms curious in themselves and to which the friendship of the donors gave additional value lady emily undertook to find some suitable token of remembrance likely to flatter the vanity and please the taste of mrs williams and the colonel who was a kind of farmer promised to send the ullswater patriarch an excellent team of horses for cart and plough  one happy day waverley spent in london and travelling in the manner projected he met with frank stanley at huntingdon the two young men were acquainted in a minute  i can read my uncles riddle said stanleythe cautious old soldier did not care to hint to me that i might hand over to you this passport which i have no occasion for but if it should afterwards come out as the rattlepated trick of a young cantab cela ne tire a rien you are therefore to be francis stanley with this passport this proposal appeared in effect to alleviate a great part of the difficulties which edward must otherwise have encountered at every turn and accordingly he scrupled not to avail himself of it the more especially as he had discarded all political purposes from his present journey and could not be accused of furthering machinations against the government while travelling under protection of the secretarys passport  the day passed merrily away the young student was inquisitive about waverleys campaigns and the manners of the highlands and edward was obliged to satisfy his curiosity by whistling a pibroch dancing a strathspey and singing a highland song the next morning stanley rode a stage northward with his new friend and parted from him with great reluctance upon the remonstrances of spontoon who accustomed to submit to discipline was rigid in enforcing it     chapter xxxiv  desolation   waverley riding post as was the usual fashion of the period without any adventure save one or two queries which the talisman of his passport sufficiently answered reached the borders of scotland here he heard the tidings of the decisive battle of culloden it was no more than he had long expected though the success at falkirk had thrown a faint and setting gleam over the arms of the chevalier yet it came upon him like a shock by which he was for a time altogether unmanned the generous the courteous the nobleminded adventurer was then a fugitive with a price upon his head his adherents so brave so enthusiastic so faithful were dead imprisoned or exiled where now was the exalted and highsouled fergus if indeed he had survived the night at clifton where the purehearted and primitive baron of bradwardine whose foibles seemed foils to set off the disinterestedness of his disposition the genuine goodness of his heart and his unshaken courage those who clung for support to these fallen columns rose and flora where were they to be sought and in what distress must not the loss of their natural protectors have involved them of flora he thought with the regard of a brother for a sister of rose with a sensation yet more deep and tender it might be still his fate to supply the want of those guardians they had lost agitated by these thoughts he precipitated his journey  when he arrived in edinburgh where his inquiries must necessarily commence he felt the full difficulty of his situation many inhabitants of that city had seen and known him as edward waverley how then could he avail himself of a passport as francis stanley he resolved therefore to avoid all company and to move northward as soon as possible he was however obliged to wait a day or two in expectation of a letter from colonel talbot and he was also to leave his own address under his feigned character at a place agreed upon with this latter purpose he sallied out in the dusk through the wellknown streets carefully shunning observation but in vain one of the first persons whom he met at once recognised him it was mrs flockhart fergus macivors goodhumoured landlady  gude guide us mr waverley is this you na ye needna be feared for me i wad betray nae gentleman in your circumstances eh lackaday lackaday heres a change o markets how merry colonel macivor and you used to be in our house and the goodnatured widow shed a few natural tears as there was no resisting her claim of acquaintance waverley acknowledged it with a good grace as well as the danger of his own situation as its near the darkening sir wad ye just step in by to our house and tak a dish o tea and i am sure if ye like to sleep in the little room i wad tak care ye are no disturbed and naebody wad ken ye for kate and matty the limmers gaed aff wi twa o hawleys dragoons and i hae twa new queans instead o them  waverley accepted her invitation and engaged her lodging for a night or two satisfied he should be safer in the house of this simple creature than anywhere else when he entered the parlour his heart swelled to see ferguss bonnet with the white cockade hanging beside the little mirror  ay said mrs flockhart sighing as she observed the direction of his eyes the puir colonel bought a new ane just the day before they marched and i winna let them tak that ane doun but just to brush it ilka day mysell and whiles i look at it till i just think i hear him cry to callum to bring him his bonnet as he used to do when he was ganging out its unco sillythe neighbours ca me a jacobite but they may say their sayi am sure its no for thatbut he was as kindhearted a gentleman as ever lived and as weelfard too oh dye ken sir when he is to suffer  suffer good heaven why where is he  eh lords sake dye no ken the poor hieland body dugald mahony cam here a while syne wi ane o his arms cuttit off and a sair clour in the headyell mind dugald he carried aye an axe on his shoutherand he cam here just begging as i may say for something to eat aweel he tauld us the chief as they cad him but i aye ca him the colonel and ensign maccombich that ye mind weel were taen somewhere beside the english border when it was sae dark that his folk never missed him till it was ower late and they were like to gang clean daft and he said that little callum beg he was a bauld mischievous callant that and your honour were killed that same night in the tuilzie and mony mae braw men but he grat when he spak o the colonel ye never saw the like and now the word gangs the colonel is to be tried and to suffer wi them that were taen at carlisle  and his sister  ay that they cad the lady floraweel shes away up to carlisle to him and lives wi some grand papist lady thereabouts to be near him  and said edwardthe other young lady  whilk other i ken only of ae sister the colonel had  i mean miss bradwardine said edward  ou ay the lairds daughter said his landlady she was a very bonny lassie poor thing but far shyer than lady flora  where is she for gods sake  ou wha kens where ony o them is now puir things theyre sair taen doun for their white cockades and their white roses but she gaed north to her fathers in perthshire when the government troops cam back to edinbro there was some prettymen amang them and ane major whacker was quartered on me a very ceevil gentlemanbut o mr waverley he was naething sae weel fard as the puir colonel  do you know what is become of miss bradwardines father  the auld laird na naebody kens that but they say he fought very hard in that bluidy battle at inverness and deacon clank the whitiron smith says that the government folk are sair agane him for having been out twice and troth he might hae taen warning but theres nae me like an auld fule the puir colonel was only out ance  such conversation contained almost all the goodnatured widow knew of the fate of her late lodgers and acquaintances but it was enough to determine edward at all hazards to proceed instantly to tullyveolan where he concluded he should see or at least hear something of rose he therefore left a letter for colonel talbot at the place agreed upon signed by his assumed name and giving for his address the posttown next to the barons residence  from edinburgh to perth he took posthorses resolving to make the rest of his journey on foot a mode of travelling to which he was partial and which had the advantage of permitting a deviation from the road when he saw parties of military at a distance his campaign had considerably strengthened his constitution and improved his habits of enduring fatigue his baggage he sent before him as opportunity occurred  as he advanced northward the traces of war became visible broken carriages dead horses unroofed cottages trees felled for palisades and bridges destroyed or only partially repairedall indicated the movements of hostile armies in those places where the gentry were attached to the stuart cause their houses seemed dismantled or deserted the usual course of what may be called ornamental labour was totally interrupted and the inhabitants were seen gliding about with fear sorrow and dejection on their faces  it was evening when he approached the village of tullyveolan with feelings and sentimentshow different from those which attended his first entrance then life was so new to him that a dull or disagreeable day was one of the greatest misfortunes which his imagination anticipated and it seemed to him that his time ought only to be consecrated to elegant or amusing study and relieved by social or youthful frolic now how changed how saddened yet how elevated was his character within the course of a very few months danger and misfortune are rapid though severe teachers a sadder and a wiser man he felt in internal confidence and mental dignity a compensation for the gay dreams which in his case experience had so rapidly dissolved  as he approached the village he saw with surprise and anxiety that a party of soldiers were quartered near it and what was worse that they seemed stationary there this he conjectured from a few tents which he beheld glimmering upon what was called the common moor to avoid the risk of being stopped and questioned in a place where he was so likely to be recognised he made a large circuit altogether avoiding the hamlet and approaching the upper gate of the avenue by a bypath well known to him a single glance announced that great changes had taken place one half of the gate entirely destroyed and split up for firewood lay in piles ready to be taken away the other swung uselessly about upon its loosened hinges the battlements above the gate were broken and thrown down and the carved bears which were said to have done sentinels duty upon the top for centuries now hurled from their posts lay among the rubbish the avenue was cruelly wasted several large trees were felled and left lying across the path and the cattle of the villagers and the more rude hoofs of dragoon horses had poached into black mud the verdant turf which waverley had so much admired  upon entering the courtyard edward saw the fears realised which these circumstances had excited the place had been sacked by the kings troops who in wanton mischief had even attempted to burn it and though the thickness of the walls had resisted the fire unless to a partial extent the stables and outhouses were totally consumed the towers and pinnacles of the main building were scorched and blackened the pavement of the court broken and shattered the doors torn down entirely or hanging by a single hinge the windows dashed in and demolished and the court strewed with articles of furniture broken into fragments the accessaries of ancient distinction to which the baron in the pride of his heart had attached so much importance and veneration were treated with peculiar contumely the fountain was demolished and the spring which had supplied it now flooded the courtyard the stone basin seemed to be destined for a drinkingtrough for cattle from the manner in which it was arranged upon the ground the whole tribe of bears large and small had experienced as little favour as those at the head of the avenue and one or two of the family pictures which seemed to have served as targets for the soldiers lay on the ground in tatters with an aching heart as may well be imagined edward viewed this wreck of a mansion so respected but his anxiety to learn the fate of the proprietors and his fears as to what that fate might be increased with every step when he entered upon the terrace new scenes of desolation were visible the balustrade was broken down the walls destroyed the borders overgrown with weeds and the fruittrees cut down or grubbed up in one compartment of this oldfashioned garden were two immense horsechestnut trees of whose size the baron was particularly vain too lazy perhaps to cut them down the spoilers with malevolent ingenuity had mined them and placed a quantity of gunpowder in the cavity one had been shivered to pieces by the explosion and the fragments lay scattered around encumbering the ground it had so long shadowed the other mine had been more partial in its effect about onefourth of the trunk of the tree was torn from the mass which mutilated and defaced on the one side still spread on the other its ample and undiminished boughs footnote a pair of chestnut trees destroyed the one entirely and the other in part by such a mischievous and wanton act of revenge grew at invergarry castle the fastness of macdonald of glengarry  amid these general marks of ravage there were some which more particularly addressed the feelings of waverley viewing the front of the building thus wasted and defaced his eyes naturally sought the little balcony which more properly belonged to roses apartment her troisieme or rather cinquieme etage it was easily discovered for beneath it lay the stageflowers and shrubs with which it was her pride to decorate it and which had been hurled from the bartizan several of her books were mingled with broken flowerpots and other remnants among these waverley distinguished one of his own a small copy of ariosto and gathered it as a treasure though wasted by the wind and rain  while plunged in the sad reflections which the scene excited he was looking around for some one who might explain the fate of the inhabitants he heard a voice from the interior of the building singing in wellremembered accents an old scottish song      they came upon us in the night     and brake my bower and slew my knight     my servants a for life did flee     and left us in extremitie      they slew my knight to me sae dear     they slew my knight and drave his gear     the moon may set the sun may rise     but a deadly sleep has closed his eyes  footnote the first three couplets are from an old ballad called the border widows lament  alas thought edward is it thou poor helpless being art thou alone left to gibber and moan and fill with thy wild and unconnected scraps of minstrelsy the halls that protected thee he then called first low and then louder daviedavie gellatley  the poor simpleton showed himself from among the ruins of a sort of greenhouse that once terminated what was called the terracewalk but at first sight of a stranger retreated as if in terror waverley remembering his habits began to whistle a tune to which he was partial which davie had expressed great pleasure in listening to and had picked up from him by the ear our heros minstrelsy no more equalled that of blondel than poor davie resembled coeur de lion but the melody had the same effect of producing recognition davie again stole from his lurkingplace but timidly while waverley afraid of frightening him stood making the most encouraging signals he could devise its his ghaist muttered davie yet coming nearer he seemed to acknowledge his living acquaintance the poor fool himself appeared the ghost of what he had been the peculiar dress in which he had been attired in better days showed only miserable rags of its whimsical finery the lack of which was oddly supplied by the remnants of tapestried hangings windowcurtains and shreds of pictures with which he had bedizened his tatters his face too had lost its vacant and careless air and the poor creature looked holloweyed meagre halfstarved and nervous to a pitiable degree after long hesitation he at length approached waverley with some confidence stared him sadly in the face and said a dead and ganea dead and gane  who are dead said waverley forgetting the incapacity of davie to hold any connected discourse  baron and bailie and saunders saunderson and lady rose that sang sae sweeta dead and ganedead and gane      but follow follow me     while glowworms light the lea     ill show ye where the dead should be       each in his shroud       while winds pipe loud       and the red moon peeps dim through the cloud     follow follow me     brave should he be     that treads by night the dead mans lea  with these words chanted in a wild and earnest tone he made a sign to waverley to follow him and walked rapidly towards the bottom of the garden tracing the bank of the stream which it may be remembered was its eastern boundary edward over whom an involuntary shuddering stole at the import of his words followed him in some hope of an explanation as the house was evidently deserted he could not expect to find among the ruins any more rational informer  davie walking very fast soon reached the extremity of the garden and scrambled over the ruins of the wall that once had divided it from the wooded glen in which the old tower of tullyveolan was situated he then jumped down into the bed of the stream and followed by waverley proceeded at a great pace climbing over some fragments of rock and turning with difficulty round others they passed beneath the ruins of the castle waverley followed keeping up with his guide with difficulty for the twilight began to fall following the descent of the stream a little lower he totally lost him but a twinkling light which he now discovered among the tangled copsewood and bushes seemed a surer guide he soon pursued a very uncouth path and by its guidance at length reached the door of a wretched hut a fierce barking of dogs was at first heard but it stilled at his approach a voice sounded from within and he held it most prudent to listen before he advanced  wha hast thou brought here thou unsonsy villain thou said an old woman apparently in great indignation he heard davie gellatley in answer whistle a part of the tune by which he had recalled himself to the simpletons memory and had now no hesitation to knock at the door there was a dead silence instantly within except the deep growling of the dogs and he next heard the mistress of the hut approach the door not probably for the sake of undoing a latch but of fastening a bolt to prevent this waverley lifted the latch himself  in front was an old wretchedlooking woman exclaiming wha comes into folks houses in this gate at this time o the night on one side two grim and halfstarved deer greyhounds laid aside their ferocity at his appearance and seemed to recognise him on the other side half concealed by the open door yet apparently seeking that concealment reluctantly with a cocked pistol in his right hand and his left in the act of drawing another from his belt stood a tall bony gaunt figure in the remnants of a faded uniform and a beard of three weeks growth it was the baron of bradwardine it is unnecessary to add that he threw aside his weapon and greeted waverley with a hearty embrace     chapter xxxv  comparing of notes   thearons story was short when divested of the adages and commonplaces latin english and scotch with which his erudition garnished it he insisted much upon his grief at the loss of edward and of glennaquoich fought the fields of falkirk and culloden and related how after all was lost in the last battle he had returned home under the idea of more easily finding shelter among his own tenants and on his own estate than elsewhere a party of soldiers had been sent to lay waste his property for clemency was not the order of the day their proceedings however were checked by an order from the civil court the estate it was found might not be forfeited to the crown to the prejudice of malcolm bradwardine of inchgrabbit the heirmale whose claim could not be prejudiced by the barons attainder as deriving no right through him and who therefore like other heirs of entail in the same situation entered upon possession but unlike many in similar circumstances the new laird speedily showed that he intended utterly to exclude his predecessor from all benefit or advantage in the estate and that it was his purpose to avail himself of the old barons evil fortune to the full extent this was the more ungenerous as it was generally known that from a romantic idea of not prejudicing this young mans right as heirmale the baron had refrained from settling his estate on his daughter  this selfish injustice was resented by the country people who were partial to their old master and irritated against his successor in the barons own words the matter did not coincide with the feelings of the commons of bradwardine mr waverley and the tenants were slack and repugnant in payment of their mails and duties and when my kinsman came to the village wi the new factor mr james howie to lift the rents some wanchancy personi suspect john heatherblutter the auld gamekeeper that was out wi me in the year fifteenfired a shot at him in the gloaming whereby he was so affrighted that i may say with tullius in catilinam abiit evasit erupit effugit he fled sir as one may say incontinent to stirling and now he hath advertised the estate for sale being himself the last substitute in the entail and if i were to lament about sic matters this would grieve me mair than its passing from my immediate possession whilk by the course of nature must have happened in a few years whereas now it passes from the lineage that should have possessed it in scecula saculorum but gods will be done humana perpessi sumus sir john of bradwardineblack sir john as he is calledwho was the common ancestor of our house and the inchgrabbits little thought such a person would have sprung from his loins mean time he has accused me to some of the primates the rulers for the time as if i were a cutthroat and an abettor of bravoes and assassinates and coupejarrets and they have sent soldiers here to abide on the estate and hunt me like a partridge upon the mountains as scripture says of good king david or like our valiant sir william wallacenot that i bring myself into comparison with either i thought when i heard you at the door they had driven the auld deer to his den at last and so i een proposed to die at bay like a buck of the first head but now janet canna ye gie us something for supper ou ay sir ill brander the moorfowl that john heatherblutter brought in this morning and ye see puir davies roasting the black hens eggs i daur say mr wauverley ye never kend that a the eggs that were sae weel roasted at supper in the hahouse were aye turned by our davie theres no the like o him ony gate for powtering wi his fingers amang the het peatashes and roasting eggs davie all this while lay with his nose almost in the fire nuzzling among the ashes kicking his heels mumbling to himself turning the eggs as they lay in the hot embers as if to confute the proverb that there goes reason to roasting of eggs and justify the eulogium which poor janet poured out upon      him whom she loved her idiot boy  davies no sae silly as folk tak him for mr wauverley he wadna hae brought you here unless he had kend ye was a friend to his honour indeed the very dogs kend ye mr wauverley for ye was aye kind to beast and body i can tell you a story o davie wi his honours leave his honour ye see being under hiding in thae sair timesthe mairs the pityhe lies a day and whiles a night in the cove in the dern hag but though its a bieldy eneugh bit and the auld gudeman o corsecleugh has panged it wi a kemple o strae amaist yet when the countrys quiet and the night very cauld his honour whiles creeps doun here to get a warm at the ingle and a sleep amang the blankets and gangs awa in the morning and so ae morning siccan a fright as i got twa unlucky redcoats were up for blackfishing or some siccan ployfor the neb o thems never out o mischiefand they just got a glisk o his honour as he gaed into the wood and banged aff a gun at him i out like a jerfalcon and criedwad they shoot an honest womans poor innocent bairn and i fleyt at them and threepit it was my son and they damned and swuir at me that it was the auld rebel as the villains cad his honour and davie was in the wood and heard the tuilzie and he just out o his ain head got up the auld grey mantle that his honour had flung off him to gang the faster and he cam out o the very same bit o the wood majoring and looking about sae like his honour that they were clean beguiled and thought they had letten aff their gun at crackbrained sawney as they ca him and they gae me saxpence and twa saumon fish to say naething about it na na davies no just like other folk puir fallow but hes no sae silly as folk tak him for but to be sure how can we do eneugh for his honour when we and ours have lived on his ground this twa hundred years and when he keepit my puir jamie at school and college and even at the hahouse till he gaed to a better place and when he saved me frae being taen to perth as a witchlord forgie them that would touch sic a puir silly auld bodyand has maintained puir davie at heck and manger maist feck o his life  waverley at length found an opportunity to interrupt janets narrative by an inquiry after miss bradwardine  shes weel and safe thank god at the duchran answered the baron the lairds distantly related to us and more nearly to my chaplain mr rubrick and though he be of whig principles yet hes not forgetful of auld friendship at this time the bailies doing what he can to save something out of the wreck for puir rose but i doubt i doubt i shall never see her again for i maun lay my banes in some far country  hout na your honour said old janet ye were just as ill aff in the feifteen and got the bonnie baronie back an a and now the eggs is ready and the muircocks brandered and theres ilk ane a trencher and some saut and the heel o the white loaf that cam frae the bailies and theres plenty o brandy in the greybeard that luckie maclearie sent doun and winna ye be suppered like princes  i wish one prince at least of our acquaintance may be no worse off said the baron to waverley who joined him in cordial hopes for the safety of the unfortunate chevalier  they then began to talk of their future prospects the barons plan was very simple it was to escape to france where by the interest of his old friends he hoped to get some military employment of which he still conceived himself capable he invited waverley to go with him a proposal in which he acquiesced providing the interest of colonel talbot should fail in procuring his pardon tacitly he hoped the baron would sanction his addresses to rose and give him a right to assist him in his exile but he forbore to speak on this subject until his own fate should be decided they then talked of glennaquoich for whom the baron expressed great anxiety although he observed he was the very achilles of horatius flaccus  impiger iracundus inexorabilis acer which he continued has been thus rendered vernacularly by struan robertson      a fiery ettercap a fractious chiel     as het as ginger and as stieve as steel  flora had a large and unqualified share of the good old mans sympathy  it was now wearing late old janet got into some kind of kennel behind the hallan davie had been long asleep and snoring between ban and buscar these dogs had followed him to the hut after the mansionhouse was deserted and there constantly resided and their ferocity with the old womans reputation of being a witch contributed a good deal to keep visitors from the glen with this view bailie macwheeble provided janet underhand with meal for their maintenance and also with little articles of luxury for his patrons use in supplying which much precaution was necessarily used after some compliments the baron occupied his usual couch and waverley reclined in an easy chair of tattered velvet which had once garnished the state bedroom of tullyveolan for the furniture of this mansion was now scattered through all the cottages in the vicinity and went to sleep as comfortably as if he had been in a bed of down     chapter xxxvi  more explanation   with the first dawn of day old janet was scuttling about the house to wake the baron who usually slept sound and heavily  i must go back he said to waverleyto my cove will you walk down the glen wi me they went out together and followed a narrow and entangled footpath which the occasional passage of anglers or woodcutters had traced by the side of the stream on their way the baron explained to waverley that he would be under no danger in remaining a day or two at tullyveolan and even in being seen walking about if he used the precaution of pretending that he was looking at the estate as agent or surveyor for an english gentleman who designed to be purchaser with this view he recommended to him to visit the bailie who still lived at the factors house called little veolan about a mile from the village though he was to remove at next term stanleys passport would be an answer to the officer who commanded the military and as to any of the country people who might recognise waverley the baron assured him he was in no danger of being betrayed by them  i believe said the old man half the people of the barony know that their poor auld laird is somewhere hereabout for i see they do not suffer a single bairn to come here a birdnesting a practice whilk when i was in full possession of my power as baron i was unable totally to inhibit nay i often find bits of things in my way that the poor bodies god help them leave there because they think they may be useful to me i hope they will get a wiser master and as kind a one as i was  a natural sigh closed the sentence but the quiet equanimity with which the baron endured his misfortunes had something in it venerable and even sublime there was no fruitless repining no turbid melancholy he bore his lot and the hardships which it involved with a goodhumored though serious composure and used no violent language against the prevailing party  i did what i thought my duty said the good old man and questionless they are doing what they think theirs it grieves me sometimes to look upon these blackened walls of the house of my ancestors but doubtless officers cannot always keep the soldiers hand from depredation and spuilzie and gustavus adolphus himself as ye may read in colonel munro his expedition with the worthy scotch regiment called mackays regiment did often permit it indeed i have myself seen as sad sights as tullyveolan now is when i served with the marechal duke of berwick to be sure we may say with virgilius maro fuimus troesand theres the end of an auld sang but houses and families and men have a stood lang eneugh when they have stood till they fall with honour and now i hae gotten a house that is not unlike a domus ultimathey were now standing below a steep rock we poor jacobites continued the baron looking up are now like the conies in holy scripture which the great traveller pococke calleth jerboa a feeble people that make our abode in the rocks so fare you well my good lad till we meet at janets in the even for i must get into my patmos which is no easy matter for my auld stiff limbs  with that he began to ascend the rock striding with the help of his hands from one precarious footstep to another till he got about halfway up where two or three bushes concealed the mouth of a hole resembling an oven into which the baron insinuated first his head and shoulders and then by slow gradation the rest of his l ong body his legs and feet finally disappearing coiled up like a huge snake entering his retreat or a long pedigree introduced with care and difficulty into the narrow pigeonhole of an old cabinet waverley had the curiosity to clamber up and look in upon him in his den as the lurkingplace might well be termed upon the whole he looked not unlike that ingenious puzzle called a reel in a bottle the marvel of children and of some grown people too myself for one who can neither comprehend the mysteryhowit has got in or how it is to be taken out the cave was very narrow too low in the roof to admit of his standing or almost of his sitting up though he made some awkward attempts at the latter posture his sole amusement was the perusal of his old friend titus livius varied by occasionally scratching latin proverbs and texts of scripture with his knife on the roof and walls of his fortalice which were of sandstone as the cave was dry and filled with clean straw and withered fern it made as he said coiling himself up with an air of snugness and comfort which contrasted strangely with his situation unless when the wind was due north a very passable gite for an old soldier neither as he observed was he without sentries for the purpose of reconnoitring davie and his mother were constantly on the watch to discover and avert danger and it was singular what instances of address seemed dictated by the instinctive attachment of the poor simpleton when his patrons safety was concerned  with janet edward now sought an interview he had recognised her at first sight as the old woman who had nursed him during his sickness after his delivery from gifted gilfillan the hut also although a little repaired and somewhat better furnished was certainly the place of his confinement and he now recollected on the common moor of tullyveolan the trunk of a large decayed tree called the try stingtree which he had no doubt was the same at which the highlanders rendezvoused on that memorable night all this he had combined in his imagination the night before but reasons which may probably occur to the reader prevented him from catechising janet in the presence of the baron  he now commenced the task in good earnest and the first question was who was the young lady that visited the hut during his illness janet paused for a little and then observed that to keep the secret now would neither do good nor ill to anybody  it was just a leddy that hasna her equal in the worldmiss rose bradwardine  then miss rose was probably also the author of my deliverance inferred waverley delighted at the confirmation of an idea which local circumstances had already induced him to entertain  i wot weel mr wauverley and that was she een but sair sair angry and affronted wad she hae been puir thing if she had thought ye had been ever to ken a word about the matter for she gard me speak aye gaelic when ye was in hearing to mak ye trow we were in the hielands i can speak it weil eneugh for my mother was a hieland woman  a few more questions now brought out the whole mystery respecting waverleys deliverance from the bondage in which he left cairnvreckan never did music sound sweeter to an amateur than the drowsy tautology with which old janet detailed every circumstance thrilled upon the ears of waverley but my reader is not a lover and i must spare his patience by attempting to condense within reasonable compass the narrative which old janet spread through a harangue of nearly two hours  when waverley communicated to fergus the letter he had received from rose bradwardine by davie gellatley giving an account of tullyveolan being occupied by a small party of soldiers that circumstance had struck upon the busy and active mind of the chieftain eager to distress and narrow the posts of the enemy desirous to prevent their establishing a garrison so near him and willing also to oblige the baronfor he often had the idea of marriage with rose floating through his brainhe resolved to send some of his people to drive out the redcoats and to bring rose to glennaquoich but just as he had ordered evan with a small party on this duty the news of copes having marched into the highlands to meet and disperse the forces of the chevalier ere they came to a head obliged him to join the standard with his whole forces  he sent to order donald bean to attend him but that cautious freebooter who well understood the value of a separate command instead of joining sent various apologies which the pressure of the times compelled fergus to admit as current though not without the internal resolution of being revenged on him for his procrastination time and place convenient however as he could not amend the matter he issued orders to donald to descend into the low country drive the soldiers from tullyveolan and paying all respect to the mansion of the baron to take his abode somewhere near it for protection of his daughter and family and to harass and drive away any of the armed volunteers or small parties of military which he might find moving about the vicinity as this charge formed a sort of roving commission which donald proposed to interpret in the way most advantageous to himself as he was relieved from the immediate terrors of fergus and as he had from former secret services some interest in the councils of the chevalier he resolved to make hay while the sun shone he achieved without difficulty the task of driving the soldiers from tullyveolan but although he did not venture to encroach upon the interior of the family or to disturb miss rose being unwilling to make himself a powerful enemy in the chevaliers army     for well he knew the barons wrath was deadly yet he set about to raise contributions and exactions upon the tenantry and otherwise to turn the war to his own advantage meanwhile he mounted the white cockade and waited upon rose with a pretext of great devotion for the service in which her father was engaged and many apologies for the freedom he must necessarily use for the support of his people it was at this moment that rose learned by openmouthed fame with all sorts of exaggeration that waverley had killed the smith at cairnvreckan in an attempt to arrest him had been cast into a dungeon by major melville of cairnvreckan and was to be executed by martial law within three days in the agony which these tidings excited she proposed to donald bean the rescue of the prisoner it was the very sort of service which he was desirous to undertake judging it might constitute a merit of such a nature as would make amends for any peccadilloes which he might be guilty of in the country he had the art however pleading all the while duty and discipline to hold off until poor rose in the extremity of her distress offered to bribe him to the enterprise with some valuable jewels which had been her mothers  donald bean who had served in france knew and perhaps overestimated the value of these trinkets but he also perceived roses apprehensions of its being discovered that she had parted with her jewels for waverleys liberation resolved this scruple should not part him and the treasure he voluntarily offered to take an oath that he would never mention miss roses share in the transaction and foreseeing convenience in keeping the oath and no probable advantage in breaking it he took the engagementin order as he told his lieutenant to deal handsomely by the young ladyin the only mode and form which by a mental paction with himself he considered as binding he swore secrecy upon his drawn dirk he was the more especially moved to this act of good faith by some attentions that miss bradwardine showed to his daughter alice which while they gained the heart of the mountain damsel highly gratified the pride of her father alice who could now speak a little english was very communicative in return for roses kindness readily confided to her the whole papers respecting the intrigue with gardiners regiment of which she was the depositary and as readily undertook at her instance to restore them to waverley without her fathers knowledge for they may oblige the bonnie young lady and the handsome young gentleman said alice and what use has my father for a whin bits o scarted paper  the reader is aware that she took an opportunity of executing this purpose on the eve of waverleys leaving the glen  how donald executed his enterprise the reader is aware but the expulsion of the military from tullyveolan had given alarm and while he was lying in wait for gilfillan a strong party such as donald did not care to face was sent to drive back the insurgents in their turn to encamp there and to protect the country the officer a gentleman and a disciplinarian neither intruded himself on miss bradwardine whose unprotected situation he respected nor permitted his soldiers to commit any breach of discipline he formed a little camp upon an eminence near the house of tullyveolan and placed proper guards at the passes in the vicinity this unwelcome news reached donald bean lean as he was returning to tullyveolan determined however to obtain the guerdon of his labour he resolved since approach to tullyveolan was impossible to deposit his prisoner in janets cottage a place the very existence of which could hardly have been suspected even by those who had long lived in the vicinity unless they had been guided thither and which was utterly unknown to waverley himself this effected he claimed and received his reward waverleys illness was an event which deranged all their calculations donald was obliged to leave the neighbourhood with his people and to seek more free course for his adventures elsewhere at roses entreaty he left an old man a herbalist who was supposed to understand a little of medicine to attend waverley during his illness  in the meanwhile new and fearful doubts started in roses mind they were suggested by old janet who insisted that a reward having been offered for the apprehension of waverley and his own personal effects being so valuable there was no saying to what breach of faith donald might be tempted in an agony of grief and terror rose took the daring resolution of explaining to the prince himself the danger in which mr waverley stood judging that both as a politician and a man of honour and humanity charles edward would interest himself to prevent his falling into the hands of the opposite party this letter she at first thought of sending anonymously but naturally feared it would not in that case be credited she therefore subscribed her name though with reluctance and terror and consigned it in charge to a young man who at leaving his farm to join the chevaliers army made it his petition to her to have some sort of credentials to the adventurer from whom he hoped to obtain a commission  the letter reached charles edward on his descent to the lowlands and aware of the political importance of having it supposed that he was in correspondence with the english jacobites he caused the most positive orders to be transmitted to donald bean lean to transmit waverley safe and uninjured in person or effects to the governor of doune castle the freebooter durst not disobey for the army of the prince was now so near him that punishment might have followed besides he was a politician as well as a robber and was unwilling to cancel the interest created through former secret services by being refractory on this occasion he therefore made a virtue of necessity and transmitted orders to his lieutenant to convey edward to doune which was safely accomplished in the mode mentioned in a former chapter the governor of doune was directed to send him to edinburgh as a prisoner because the prince was apprehensive that waverley if set at liberty might have resumed his purpose of returning to england without affording him an opportunity of a personal interview in this indeed he acted by the advice of the chieftain of glennaquoich with whom it may be remembered the chevalier communicated upon the mode of disposing of edward though without telling him how he came to learn the place of his confinement  this indeed charles edward considered as a ladys secret for although roses letter was couched in the most cautious and general terms and professed to be written merely from motives of humanity and zeal for the princes service yet she expressed so anxious a wish that she should not be known to have interfered that the chevalier was induced to suspect the deep interest which she took in waverleys safety this conjecture which was well founded led however to false inferences for the emotion which edward displayed on approaching flora and rose at the ball of holyrood was placed by the chevalier to the account of the latter and he concluded that the barons views about the settlement of his property or some such obstacle thwarted their mutual inclinations common fame it is true frequently gave waverley to miss macivor but the prince knew that common fame is very prodigal in such gifts and watching attentively the behaviour of the ladies towards waverley he had no doubt that the young englishman had no interest with flora and was beloved by rose bradwardine desirous to bind waverley to his service and wishing also to do a kind and friendly action the prince next assailed the baron on the subject of settling his estate upon his daughter mr bradwardine acquiesced but the consequence was that fergus was immediately induced to prefer his double suit for a wife and an earldom which the prince rejected in the manner we have seen the chevalier constantly engaged in his own multiplied affairs had not hitherto sought any explanation with waverley though often meaning to do so but after ferguss declaration he saw the necessity of appearing neutral between the rivals devoutly hoping that the matter which now seemed fraught with the seeds of strife might be permitted to lie over till the termination of the expedition when on the march to derby fergus being questioned concerning his quarrel with waverley alleged as the cause that edward was desirous of retracting the suit he had made to his sister the chevalier plainly told him that he had himself observed miss macivors behaviour to waverley and that he was convinced fergus was under the influence of a mistake in judging of waverleys conduct who he had every reason to believe was engaged to miss bradwardine the quarrel which ensued between edward and the chieftain is i hope still in the remembrance of the reader these circumstances will serve to explain such points of our narrative as according to the custom of storytellers we deemed it fit to leave unexplained for the purpose of exciting the readers curiosity  when janet had once finished the leading facts of this narrative waverley was easily enabled to apply the clue which they afforded to other mazes of the labyrinth in which he had been engaged to rose bradwardine then he owed the life which he now thought he could willingly have laid down to serve her a little reflection convinced him however that to live for her sake was more convenient and agreeable and that being possessed of independence she might share it with him either in foreign countries or in his own the pleasure of being allied to a man of the barons high worth and who was so much valued by his uncle sir everard was also an agreeable consideration had anything been wanting to recommend the match his absurdities which had appeared grotesquely ludicrous during his prosperity seemed in the sunset of his fortune to be harmonised and assimilated with the noble features of his character so as to add peculiarity without exciting ridicule his mind occupied with such projects of future happiness edward sought little veolan the habitation of mr duncan macwheeble     chapter xxxvii  now is cupid a child of consciencehe makes restitutionshakspeare   mr duncan macwheeble no longer commissary or bailie though still enjoying the empty name of the latter dignity had escaped proscription by an early secession from the insurgent party and by his insignificance  edward found him in his office immersed among papers and accounts before him was a large bicker of oatmeal porridge and at the side thereof a horn spoon and a bottle of twopenny eagerly running his eye over a voluminous lawpaper he from time to time shovelled an immense spoonful of these nutritive viands into his capacious mouth a potbellied dutch bottle of brandy which stood by intimated either that this honest limb of the law had taken his morning already or that he meant to season his porridge with such digestive or perhaps both circumstances might reasonably be inferred his nightcap and morninggown had whilome been of tartan but equally cautious and frugal the honest bailie had got them dyed black lest their original illomened colour might remind his visitors of his unlucky excursion to derby to sum up the picture his face was daubed with snuff up to the eyes and his fingers with ink up to the knuckles he looked dubiously at waverley as he approached the little green rail which fenced his desk and stool from the approach of the vulgar nothing could give the bailie more annoyance than the idea of his acquaintance being claimed by any of the unfortunate gentlemen who were now so much more likely to need assistance than to afford profit but this was the rich young englishman who knew what might be his situation he was the barons friend too what was to be done      while these reflections gave an air of absurd perplexity to the poor mans visage waverley reflecting on the communication he was about to make to him of a nature so ridiculously contrasted with the appearance of the individual could not help bursting out alaughing as he checked the propensity to exclaim with syphax      catos a proper person to intrust     a lovetale with  as mr macwheeble had no idea of any person laughing heartily who was either encircled by peril or oppressed by poverty the hilarity of edwards countenance greatly relieved the embarrassment of his own and giving him a tolerably hearty welcome to little veolan he asked what he would choose for breakfast his visitor had in the first place something for his private ear and begged leave to bolt the door duncan by no means liked this precaution which savoured of danger to be apprehended but he could not now draw back  convinced he might trust this man as he could make it his interest to be faithful edward communicated his present situation and future schemes to macwheeble the wily agent listened with apprehension when he found waverley was still in a state of proscription was somewhat comforted by learning that he had a passport rubbed his hands with glee when he mentioned the amount of his present fortune opened huge eyes when he heard the brilliancy of his future expectations but when he expressed his intention to share them with miss rose bradwardine ecstasy had almost deprived the honest man of his senses the bailie started from his threefooted stool like the pythoness from her tripod flung his best wig out of the window because the block on which it was placed stood in the way of his career chucked his cap to the ceiling caught it as it fell whistled tullochgorum danced a highland fling with inimitable grace and agility and then threw himself exhausted into a chair exclaiming lady wauverley ten thousand a year the least penny lord preserve my poor understanding      amen with all my heart said waverley but now mr macwheeble let us proceed to business this word had somewhat a sedative effect but the bailies head as he expressed himself was still in the bees he mended his pen however marked half a dozen sheets of paper with an ample marginal fold whipped down dallas of st martins styles from a shelf where that venerable work roosted with stairs institutions dirletons doubts balfours practiques and a parcel of old accountbooks opened the volume at the article contract of marriage and prepared to make what he called asma minute to prevent parties frae resiling  with some difficulty waverley made him comprehend that he was going a little too fast he explained to him that he should want his assistance in the first place to make his residence safe for the time by writing to the officer at tullyveolan that mr stanley an english gentleman nearly related to colonel talbot was upon a visit of business at mr macwheebles and knowing the state of the country had sent his passport for captain fosters inspection this produced a polite answer from the officer with an invitation to mr stanley to dine with him which was declined as may easily be supposed under pretence of business  waverleys next request was that mr macwheeble would despatch a man and horse to the posttown at which colonel talbot was to address him with directions to wait there until the post should bring a letter for mr stanley and then to forward it to little veolan with all speed in a moment the bailie was in search of his apprentice or servitor as he was called sixty years since jock scriever and in not much greater space of time jock was on the back of the white pony tak care ye guide him weel sir for hes aye been short in the wind sinceahemlord be gude to me in a low voice i was gaun to come out wisince i rode whip and spur to fetch the chevalier to redd mr wauverley and vich lan vohr and an uncanny coup i gat

macwheeble but that he was still in carlisle castle and was soon to be panelled for his life i dinna wish the young gentleman ill he said but i hope that they that hae got him will keep him and no let him back to this hieland border to plague us wi blackmail and a manner o violent wrongous and masterfu oppression and spoliation both by himself and others of his causing sending and hounding out and he couldna tak care o the siller when he had gotten it neither but flung it a into yon idle queans lap at edinburgh but light come light gane for my part i never wish to see a kilt in the country

violent profits against them what better are ye they hae na a plack to pay ye ye need never extract it  with such discourse and the intervening topics of business the time passed until dinner macwheeble meanwhile promising to devise some mode of introducing edward at the duchran where rose at present resided without risk of danger or suspicion which seemed no very easy task since the laird was a very zealous friend to government the poultryyard had been laid under requisition and cockyleeky and scotch collops soon reeked in the bailies little parlour the landlords corkscrew was just introduced into the muzzle of a pint bottle of claret cribbed possibly from the cellars of tullyveolan when the sight of the grey pony passing the window at full trot induced the bailie but with due precaution to place it aside for the moment enter jock scriever with a packet for mr stanley it is colonel talbots seal and edwards ringers tremble as he undoes it two official papers folded signed and sealed in all formality drop out they were hastily picked up by the bailie who had a natural respect for everything resembling a deed and glancing slily on their titles his eyes or rather spectacles are greeted with protection by his royal highness to the person of cosmo comyne bradwardine esq of that ilk commonly called baron of bradwardine forfeited for his accession to the late rebellion the other proves to be a protection of the same tenor in favour of edward waverley esq colonel talbots letter was in these words  my dear edward  i am just arrived here and yet i have finished my business it has cost me some trouble though as you shall hear i waited upon his royal highness immediately on my arrival and found him in no very good humour for my purpose three or four scotch gentlemen were just leaving his levee after he had expressed himself to me very courteously would you think it he said talbot here have been half a dozen of the most respectable gentlemen and best friends to government north of the forth major melville of cairnvreckan rubrick of duchran and others who have fairly wrung from me by their downright importunity a present protection and the promise of a future pardon for that stubborn old rebel whom they call baron of bradwardine they allege that his high personal character and the clemency which he showed to such of our people as fell into the rebels hands should weigh in his favour especially as the loss of his estate is likely to be a severe enough punishment rubrick has undertaken to keep him at his own house till things are settled in the country but its a little hard to be forced in a manner to pardon such a mortal enemy to the house of brunswick this was no favourable moment for opening my business however i said i was rejoiced to learn that his royal highness was in the course of granting such requests as it emboldened me to present one of the like nature in my own name he was very angry but i persisted i mentioned the uniform support of our three votes in the house touched modestly on services abroad though valuable only in his royal highnesss having been pleased kindly to accept them and founded pretty strongly on his own expressions of friendship and goodwill he was embarrassed but obstinate i hinted the policy of detaching on all future occasions the heir of such a fortune as your uncles from the machinations of the disaffected but i made no impression i mentioned the obligations which i lay under to sir everard and to you personally and claimed as the sole reward of my services that he would be pleased to afford me the means of evincing my gratitude i perceived that he still meditated a refusal and taking my commission from my pocket i said as a last resource that as his royal highness did not under these pressing circumstances think me worthy of a favour which he had not scrupled to grant to other gentlemen whose services i could hardly judge more important than my own i must beg leave to deposit with all humility my commission in his royal highnesss hands and to retire from the service he was not prepared for this he told me to take up my commission said some handsome things of my services and granted my request you are therefore once more a free man and i have promised for you that you will be a good boy in future and remember what you owe to the lenity of government thus you see my prince can be as generous as yours i do not pretend indeed that he confers a favour with all the foreign graces and compliments of your chevalier errant but he has a plain english manner and the evident reluctance with which he grants your request indicates the sacrifice which he makes of his own inclination to your wishes my friend the adjutantgeneral has procured me a duplicate of the barons protection the original being in major melvilles possession which i send to you as i know that if you can find him you will have pleasure in being the first to communicate the joyful intelligence he will of course repair to the duchran without loss of time there to ride quarantine for a few weeks as for you i give you leave to escort him thither and to stay a week there as i understand a certain fair lady is in that quarter and i have the pleasure to tell you that whatever progress you can make in her good graces will be highly agreeable to sir everard and mrs rachel who will never believe your views and prospects settled and the three ermines passant in actual safety until you present them with a mrs edward waverley now certain loveaffairs of my owna good many years sinceinterrupted some measures which were then proposed in favour of the three ermines passant so i am bound in honour to make them amends therefore make good use of your time for when your week is expired it will be necessary that you go to london to plead your pardon in the law courts  ever dear waverley yours most truly philip talbot     chapter xxxviii       happys the wooing      thats not long a doing   when the first rapturous sensation occasioned by these excellent tidings had somewhat subsided edward proposed instantly to go down to the glen to acquaint the baron with their import but the cautious bailie justly observed that if the baron were to appear instantly in public the tenantry and villagers might become riotous in expressing their joy and give offence to the powers that be a sort of persons for whom the bailie always had unlimited respect he therefore proposed that mr waverley should go to janet gellatleys and bring the baron up under cloud of night to little veolan where he might once more enjoy the luxury of a good bed in the meanwhile he said he himself would go to captain foster and show him the barons protection and obtain his countenance for harbouring him that night and he would have horses ready on the morrow to set him on his way to the duchran along with mr stanley whilk denomination i apprehend your honour will for the present retain said the bailie  certainly mr macwheeble but will you not go down to the glen yourself in the evening to meet your patron  that i wad wi a my heart and mickle obliged to your honour for putting me in mind o my bounden duty but it will be past sunset afore i get back frae the captains and at these unsonsy hours the glen has a bad name theres something no that canny about auld janet gellatley the laird hell no believe thae things but he was aye ower rash and venturesome and feared neither man nor deevil an saes seen ot but right sure am i sir george mackenyie says that no divine can doubt there are witches since the bible says thou shalt not suffer them to live and that no lawyer in scotland can doubt it since it is punishable with death by our law so theres baith law and gospel for it an his honour winna believe the leviticus he might aye believe the statutebook but he may tak his ain way ot its a ane to duncan macwheeble however i shall send to ask up auld janet this een its best no to lightly them that have that character and well want davie to turn the spit for ill gar eppie put down a fat goose to the fire for your honours to your supper  when it was near sunset waverley hastened to the hut and he could not but allow that superstition had chosen no improper locality or unfit object for the foundation of her fantastic terrors it resembled exactly the description of spenser      there in a gloomy hollow glen she found     a little cottage built of sticks and reeds     in homely wise and walld with sods around     in which a witch did dwell in loathly weeds     and wilful want all careless of her needs     so choosing solitary to abide     far from all neighbours that her devilish deeds     and hellish arts from people she might hide     and hurt far off unknown whomsoever she espied  he entered the cottage with these verses in his memory poor old janet bent double with age and bleared with peatsmoke was tottering about the hut with a birch broom muttering to herself as she endeavoured to make her hearth and floor a little clean for the reception of her expected guests waverleys step made her start look up and fall atrembling so much had her nerves been on the rack for her patrons safety with difficulty waverley made her comprehend that the baron was now safe from personal danger and when her mind had admitted that joyful news it was equally hard to make her believe that he was not to enter again upon possession of his estate it behoved to be she said he wad get it back again naebody wad be sae gripple as to tak his gear after they had gien him a pardon and for that inchgrabbit i could whiles wish mysell a witch for his sake if i werena feared the enemy wad tak me at my word waverley then gave her some money and promised that her fidelity should be rewarded how can i be rewarded sir sae weel as just to see my auld maister and miss rose come back and bruik their ain  waverley now took leave of janet and soon stood beneath the barons patmos at a low whistle he observed the veteran peeping out to reconnoitre like an old badger with his head out of his hole ye hae come rather early my good lad said he descending i question if the redcoats hae beat the tattoo yet and were not safe till then  good news cannot be told too soon said waverley and with infinite joy communicated to him the happy tidings the old man stood for a moment in silent devotion then exclaimed praise be to god i shall see my bairn again  and never i hope to part with her more said waverley  i trust in god not unless it be to win the means of supporting her for my things are but in a bruckle statebut what signifies warlds gear  and if said waverley modestly there were a situation in life which would put miss bradwardine beyond the uncertainty of fortune and in the rank to which she was born would you object to it my dear baron because it would make one of your friends the happiest man in the world the baron turned and looked at him with great earnestness yes continued edward i shall not consider my sentence of banishment as repealed unless you will give me permission to accompany you to the duchran and  the baron seemed collecting all his dignity to make a suitable reply to what at another time he would have treated as the propounding a treaty of alliance between the houses of bradwardine and waverley but his efforts were in vain the father was too mighty for the baron the pride of birth and rank were swept away in the joyful surprise a slight convulsion passed rapidly over his features as he gave way to the feelings of nature threw his arms around waverleys neck and sobbed outmy son my son if i had been to search the world i would have made my choice here edward returned the embrace with great sympathy of feeling and for a little while they both kept silence at length it was broken by edward but miss bradwardine  she had never a will but her old fathers besides you are a likely youth of honest principles and high birth no she never had any other will than mine and in my proudest days i could not have wished a mair eligible espousal for her than the nephew of my excellent old friend sir everard but i hope young man ye deal na rashly in this matter i hope ye hae secured the approbation of your ain friends and allies particularly of your uncle who is in loco parentis ah we maun tak heed o that edward assured him that sir everard would think himself highly honoured in the flattering reception his proposal had met with and that it had his entire approbation in evidence of which he put colonel talbots letter into the barons hand the baron read it with great attention sir everard he said always despised wealth in comparison of honour and birth and indeed he hath no occasion to court the diva pecunia yet i now wish since this malcolm turns out such a parricide for i can call him no better as to think of alienating the family inheritancei now wish his eyes fixed on a part of the roof which was visible above the trees that i could have left rose the auld hurleyhouse and the riggs belanging to it and yet said he resuming more cheerfully its maybe as weel as it is for as baron of bradwardine i might have thought it my duty to insist upon certain compliances respecting name and bearings whilk now as a landless laird wi a tocherless daughter no one can blame me for departing from  now heaven be praised thought edwardthat sir everard does not hear these scruples the three ermines passant and rampant bear would certainly have gone together by the ears he then with all the ardour of a young lover assured the baron that he sought for his happiness only in roses heart and hand and thought himself as happy in her fathers simple approbation as if he had settled an earldom upon his daughter  they now reached little veolan the goose was smoking on the table and the bailie brandished his knife and fork a joyous greeting took place between him and his patron the kitchen too had its company auld janet was established at the inglenook davie had turned the spit to his immortal honour and even ban and buscar in the liberality of macwheebles joy had been stuffed to the throat with food and now lay snoring on the floor  the next day conducted the baron and his young friend to the duchran where the former was expected in consequence of the success of the nearly unanimous application of the scottish friends of government in his favour this had been so general and so powerful that it was almost thought his estate might have been saved had it not passed into the rapacious hands of his unworthy kinsman whose right arising out of the barons attainder could not be affected by a pardon from the crown the old gentleman however said with his usual spirit he was more gratified by the hold he possessed in the good opinion of his neighbours than he would have been in being rehabilitated and restored in integrum had it been found practicable  we shall not attempt to describe the meeting of the father and daughter loving each other so affectionately and separated under such perilous circumstances still less shall we attempt to analyse the deep blush of rose at receiving the compliments of waverley or stop to inquire whether she had any curiosity respecting the particular cause of his journey to scotland at that period we shall not even trouble the reader with the humdrum details of a courtship sixty years since it is enough to say that under so strict a martinet as the baron all things were conducted in due form he took upon himself the morning after their arrival the task of announcing the proposal of waverley to rose which she heard with a proper degree of maiden timidity fame does however say that waverley had the evening before found five minutes to apprise her of what was coming while the rest of the company were looking at three twisted serpents which formed a jet deau in the garden  my fair readers will judge for themselves but for my part i cannot conceive how so important an affair could be communicated in so short a space of time at least it certainly took a full hour in the barons mode of conveying it  waverley was now considered as a received lover in all the forms he was made by dint of smirking and nodding on the part of the lady of the house to sit next miss bradwardine at dinner to be miss bradwardines partner at cards if he came into the room she of the four miss rubricks who chanced to be next rose was sure to recollect that her thimble or her scissors were at the other end of the room in order to leave the seat nearest to miss bradwardine vacant for his occupation and sometimes if papa and mamma were not in the way to keep them on their good behaviour the misses would titter a little the old laird of duchran would also have his occasional jest and the old lady her remark even the baron could not refrain but here rose escaped every embarrassment but that of conjecture for his wit was usually couched in a latin quotation the very footmen sometimes grinned too broadly the maidservants giggled mayhap too loud and a provoking air of intelligence seemed to pervade the whole family alice bean the pretty maid of the cavern who after her fathers misfortune as she called it had attended rose as filledechambre smiled and smirked with the best of them rose and edward however endured all these little vexatious circumstances as other folks have done before and since and probably contrived to obtain some indemnification since they are not supposed on the whole to have been particularly unhappy during waverleys six days stay at the duchran  it was finally arranged that edward should go to waverleyhonour to make the necessary arrangements for his marriage thence to london to take the proper measures for pleading his pardon and return as soon as possible to claim the hand of his plighted bride he also intended in his journey to visit colonel talbot but above all it was his most important object to learn the fate of the unfortunate chief of glennaquoich to visit him at carlisle and to try whether anything could be done for procuring if not a pardon a commutation at least or alleviation of the punishment to which he was almost certain of being condemned and in case of the worst to offer the miserable flora an asylum with rose or otherwise to assist her views in any mode which might seem possible the fate of fergus seemed hard to be averted edward had already striven to interest his friend colonel talbot in his behalf but had been given distinctly to understand by his reply that his credit in matters of that nature was totally exhausted  the colonel was still in edinburgh and proposed to wait there for some months upon business confided to him by the duke of cumberland he was to be joined by lady emily to whom easy travelling and goats whey were recommended and who was to journey northward under the escort of francis stanley edward therefore met the colonel at edinburgh who wished him joy in the kindest manner on his approaching happiness and cheerfully undertook many commissions which our hero was necessarily obliged to delegate to his charge but on the subject of fergus he was inexorable he satisfied edward indeed that his interference would be unavailing but besides colonel talbot owned that he could not conscientiously use any influence in favour of that unfortunate gentleman justice he said which demanded some penalty of those who had wrapped the whole nation in fear and in mourning could not perhaps have selected a fitter victim he came to the field with the fullest light upon the nature of his attempt he had studied and understood the subject his fathers fate could not intimidate him the lenity of the laws which had restored to him his fathers property and rights could not melt him that he was brave generous and possessed many good qualities only rendered him the more dangerous that he was enlightened and accomplished made his crime the less excusable that he was an enthusiast in a wrong cause only made him the more fit to be its martyr above all he had been the means of bringing many hundreds of men into the field who without him would never have broken the peace of the country  i repeat it said the colonelthough heaven knows with a heart distressed for him as an individual that this young gentleman has studied and fully understood the desperate game which he has played he threw for life or death a coronet or a coffin and he cannot now be permitted with justice to the country to draw stakes because the dice have gone against him  such was the reasoning of those times held even by brave and humane men towards a vanquished enemy let us devoutly hope that in this respect at least we shall never see the scenes or hold the sentiments that were general in britain sixty years since     chapter xxxix  to morrow o thats suddenspare him spare himshakspeare   edward attended by his former servant alick polwarth who had reentered his service at edinburgh reached carlisle while the commission of oyer and terminer on his unfortunate associates was yet sitting he had pushed forward in haste not alas with the most distant hope of saving fergus but to see him for the last time i ought to have mentioned that he had furnished funds for the defence of the prisoners in the most liberal manner as soon as he heard that the day of trial was fixed a solicitor and the first counsel accordingly attended but it was upon the same footing on which the first physicians are usually summoned to the bedside of some dying man of rankthe doctors to take the advantage of some incalculable chance of an exertion of nature the lawyers to avail themselves of the barely possible occurrence of some legal flaw edward pressed into the court which was extremely crowded but by his arriving from the north and his extreme eagerness and agitation it was supposed he was a relation of the prisoners and people made way for him it was the third sitting of the court and there were two men at the bar the verdict of guilty was already pronounced edward just glanced at the bar during the momentous pause which ensued there was no mistaking the stately form and noble features of fergus macivor although his dress was squalid and his countenance tinged with the sickly yellow hue of long and close imprisonment by his side was evan maccombich edward felt sick and dizzy as he gazed on them but he was recalled to himself as the clerk of arraigns pronounced the solemn words fergus macivor of glennaquoich otherwise called vich ian vohr and evan macivor in the dhu of tarrascleugh otherwise called evan dhu otherwise called evan maccombich or evan dhu maccombichyou and each of you stand attainted of high treason what have you to say for yourselves why the court should not pronounce judgment against you that you die according to law  fergus as the presiding judge was putting on the fatal cap of judgment placed his own bonnet upon his head regarded him with a steadfast and stern look and replied in a firm voice i cannot let this numerous audience suppose that to such an appeal i have no answer to make but what i have to say you would not bear to hear for my defence would be your condemnation proceed then in the name of god to do what is permitted to you yesterday and the day before you have condemned loyal and honourable blood to be poured forth like water spare not mine were that of all my ancestors in my veins i would have perilled it in this quarrel he resumed his seat and refused again to rise  evan maccombich looked at him with great earnestness and rising up seemed anxious to speak but the confusion of the court and the perplexity arising from thinking in a language different from that in which he was to express himself kept him silent there was a murmur of compassion among the spectators from the idea that the poor fellow intended to plead the influence of his superior as an excuse for his crime the judge commanded silence and encouraged evan to proceed i was only ganging to say my lord said evan in what he meant to be an insinuating manner that if your excellent honour and the honourable court would let vich ian vohr go free just this once and let him gae back to france and no to trouble king georges government again that ony six o the very best of his clan will be willing to be justified in his stead and if youll just let me gae down to glennaquoich ill fetch them up to ye mysell to head or hang and you may begin wi me the very first man  notwithstanding the solemnity of the occasion a sort of laugh was heard in the court at the extraordinary nature of the proposal the judge checked this indecency and evan looking sternly around when the murmur abated if the saxon gentlemen are laughing he said because a poor man such as me thinks my life or the life of six of my degree is worth that of vich ian vohr its like enough they may be very right but if they laugh because they think i would not keep my word and come back to redeem him i can tell them they ken neither the heart of a hielandman nor the honour of a gentleman  there was no farther inclination to laugh among the audience and a dead silence ensued  the judge then pronounced upon both prisoners the sentence of the law of high treason with all its horrible accompaniments the execution was appointed for the ensuing day for you fergus macivor continued the judge i can hold out no hope of mercy you must prepare against tomorrow for your last sufferings here and your great audit hereafter  i desire nothing else my lord answered fergus in the same manly and firm tone  the hard eyes of evan which had been perpetually bent on his chief were moistened with a tear for you poor ignorant man continued the judge who following the ideas in which you have been educated have this day given us a striking example how the loyalty due to the king and state alone is from your unhappy ideas of clanship transferred to some ambitious individual who ends by making you the tool of his crimesfor you i say i feel so much compassion that if you can make up your mind to petition for grace i will endeavour to procure it for you otherwise  grace me no grace said evan since you are to shed vich ian vohrs blood the only favour i would accept from you is to bid them loose my hands and gie me my claymore and bide you just a minute sitting where you are  remove the prisoners said the judge his blood be upon his own head  almost stupefied with his feelings edward found that the rush of the crowd had conveyed him out into the street ere he knew what he was doing his immediate wish was to see and speak with fergus once more he applied at the castle where his unfortunate friend was confined but was refused admittance the high sheriff a noncommissioned officer said had requested of the governor that none should be admitted to see the prisoner excepting his confessor and his sister  and where was miss macivor they gave him the direction it was the house of a respectable catholic family near carlisle  repulsed from the gate of the castle and not venturing to make application to the high sheriff or judges in his own unpopular name he had recourse to the solicitor who came down in ferguss behalf this gentleman told him that it was thought the public mind was in danger of being debauched by the account of the last moments of these persons as given by the friends of the pretender that there had been a resolution therefore to exclude all such persons as had not the plea of near kindred for attending upon them yet he promised to oblige the heir of waverleyhonour to get him an order for admittance to the prisoner the next morning before his irons were knocked off for execution  is it of fergus macivor they speak thus thought waverley or do i dream of fergus the bold the chivalrous the freeminded the lofty chieftain of a tribe devoted to him is it he that i have seen lead the chase and head the attack the brave the active the young the noble the love of ladies and the theme of songis it he who is ironed like a malefactor who is to be dragged on a hurdle to the common gallows to die a lingering and cruel death and to be mangled by the hand of the most outcast of wretches evil indeed was the spectre that boded such a fate as this to the brave chief of glennaquoich  with a faltering voice he requested the solicitor to find means to warn fergus of his intended visit should he obtain permission to make it he then turned away from him and returning to the inn wrote a scarcely intelligible note to flora macivor intimating his purpose to wait upon her that evening the messenger brought back a letter in floras beautiful italian hand which seemed scarce to tremble even under this load of misery miss flora macivor the letter bore could not refuse to see the dearest friend of her dear brother even in her present circumstances of unparalleled distress  when edward reached miss macivors present place of abode he was instantly admitted in a large and gloomy tapestried apartment flora was seated by a latticed window sewing what seemed to be a garment of white flannel at a little distance sat an elderly woman apparently a foreigner and of a religious order she was reading in a book of catholic devotion but when waverley entered laid it on the table and left the room flora rose to receive him and stretched out her hand but neither ventured to attempt speech her fine complexion was totally gone her person considerably emaciated and her face and hands as white as the purest statuary marble forming a strong contrast with her sable dress and jetblack hair yet amid these marks of distress there was nothing negligent or illarranged about her attire even her hair though totally without ornament was disposed with her usual attention to neatness the first words she uttered were have you seen him  alas no answered waverley i have been refused admittance  it accords with the rest she said but we must submit shall you obtain leave do you suppose  forfortomorrow said waverley but muttering the last word so faintly that it was almost unintelligible  ay then or never said flora untilshe added looking upwardthe time when i trust we shall all meet but i hope you will see him while earth yet bears him he always loved you at his heart thoughbut it is vain to talk of the past  vain indeed echoed waverley  or even of the future my good friend said floraso far as earthly events are concerned for how often have i pictured to myself the strong possibility of this horrid issue and tasked myself to consider how i could support my part and yet how far has all my anticipation fallen short of the unimaginable bitterness of this hour  dear flora if your strength of mind  ay there it is she answered somewhat wildly there is mr waverley there is a busy devil at my heart that whispersbut it were madness to listen to itthat the strength of mind on which flora prided herself has murdered her brother  good god how can you give utterance to a thought so shocking  ay is it not so but yet it haunts me like a phantom i know it is unsubstantial and vain but it will be present will intrude its horrors on my mind will whisper that my brother as volatile as ardent would have divided his energies amid a hundred objects it was i who taught him to concentrate them and to gage all on this dreadful and desperate cast oh that i could recollect that i had but once said to him he that striketh with the sword shall die by the sword that i had but once said remain at home reserve yourself your vassals your life for enterprises within the reach of man but o mr waverley i spurred his fiery temper and half of his ruin at least lies with his sister  the horrid idea which she had intimated edward endeavoured to combat by every incoherent argument that occurred to him he recalled to her the principles on which both thought it their duty to act and in which they had been educated  do not think i have forgotten them she said looking up with eager quickness i do not regret his attempt because it was wrongo no on that point i am armedbut because it was impossible it could end otherwise than thus  yet it did not always seem so desperate and hazardous as it was and it would have been chosen by the bold spirit of fergus whether you had approved it or no your counsels only served to give unity and consistence to his conduct to dignify but not to precipitate his resolution flora had soon ceased to listen to edward and was again intent upon her needlework  do you remember she said looking up with a ghastly smile you once found me making ferguss bridefavours and now i am sewing his bridal garment our friends here she continued with suppressed emotion are to give hallowed earth in their chapel to the bloody relics of the last vich ian vohr but they will not all rest together nohis headi shall not have the last miserable consolation of kissing the cold lips of my dear dear fergus  the unfortunate flora here after one or two hysterical sobs fainted in her chair the lady who had been attending in the anteroom now entered hastily and begged edward to leave the room but not the house  when he was recalled after the space of nearly half an hour he found that by a strong effort miss macivor had greatly composed herself it was then he ventured to urge miss bradwardines claim to be considered as an adopted sister and empowered to assist her plans for the future  i have had a letter from my dear rose she replied to the same purpose sorrow is selfish and engrossing or i would have written to express that even in my own despair i felt a gleam of pleasure at learning her happy prospects and at hearing that the good old baron has escaped the general wreck give this to my dearest rose it is her poor floras only ornament of value and was the gift of a princess she put into his hands a case containing the chain of diamonds with which she used to decorate her hair to me it is in future useless the kindness of my friends has secured me a retreat in the convent of the scottish benedictine nuns in paris tomorrowif indeed i can survive tomorrowi set forward on my journey with this venerable sister and now mr waverley adieu may you be as happy with rose as your amiable dispositions deserve and think sometimes on the friends you have lost do not attempt to see me again it would be mistaken kindness  she gave him her hand on which edward shed a torrent of tears and with a faltering step withdrew from the apartment and returned to the town of carlisle at the inn he found a letter from his law friend intimating that he would be admitted to fergus next morning as soon as the castle gates were opened and permitted to remain with him till the arrival of the sheriff gave signal for the fatal procession        chapter xl  a darker departure is near the death drum is muffled and sable the biercampbell   after a sleepless night the first dawn of morning found waverley on the esplanade in front of the old gothic gate of carlisle castle but he paced it long in every direction before the hour when according to the rules of the garrison the gates were opened and the drawbridge lowered he produced his order to the sergeant of the guard and was admitted  the place of ferguss confinement was a gloomy and vaulted apartment in the central part of the castle a huge old tower supposed to be of great antiquity and surrounded by outworks seemingly of henry viiis time or somewhat later the grating of the large oldfashioned bars and bolts withdrawn for the purpose of admitting edward was answered by the clash of chains as the unfortunate chieftain strongly and heavily fettered shuffled along the stone floor of his prison to fling himself into his friends arms  my dear edward he said in a firm and even cheerful voicethis is truly kind i heard of your approaching happiness with the highest pleasure and how does rose and how is our old whimsical friend the baron well i trust since i see you at freedom and how will you settle precedence between the three ermines passant and the bear and bootjack  how o how my dear fergus can you talk of such things at such a moment  why we have entered carlisle with happier auspices to be sure on the 16th of november last for example when we marched in side by side and hoisted the white flag on these ancient towers but i am no boy to sit down and weep because the luck has gone against me i knew the stake which i risked we played the game boldly and the forfeit shall be paid manfully and now since my time is short let me come to the questions that interest me mostthe prince has he escaped the bloodhounds  he has and is in safety  praised be god for that tell me the particulars of his escape  waverley communicated that remarkable history so far as it had then transpired to which fergus listened with deep interest he then asked after several other friends and made many minute inquiries concerning the fate of his own clansmen they had suffered less than other tribes who had been engaged in the affair for having in a great measure dispersed and returned home after the captivity of their chieftain according to the universal custom of the highlanders they were not in arms when the insurrection was finally suppressed and consequently were treated with less rigour this fergus heard with great satisfaction  you are rich he said waverley and you are generous when you hear of these poor macivors being distressed about their miserable possessions by some harsh overseer or agent of government remember you have worn their tartan and are an adopted son of their race the baron who knows our manners and lives near our country will apprise you of the time and means to be their protector will you promise this to the last vich ian vohr  edward as may well be believed pledged his word which he afterwards so amply redeemed that his memory still lives in these glens by the name of the friend of the sons of ivor  would to god continued the chieftain i could bequeath to you my rights to the love and obedience of this primitive and brave race or at least as i have striven to do persuade poor evan to accept of his life upon their terms and be to you what he has been to me the kindest the bravest the most devoted  the tears which his own fate could not draw forth fell fast for that of his fosterbrother  but said he drying themthat cannot be you cannot be to them vich ian vohr and these three magic words said he half smiling are the only open sesame to their feelings and sympathies and poor evan must attend his fosterbrother in death as he has done through his whole life  and i am sure said maccombich raising himself from the floor on which for fear of interrupting their conversation he had lain so still that in the obscurity of the apartment edward was not aware of his presencei am sure evan never desired or deserved a better end than just to die with his chieftain  and now said fergus while we are upon the subject of clanshipwhat think you now of the prediction of the bodach glas then before edward could answer i saw him again last night he stood in the slip of moonshine which fell from that high and narrow window towards my bed why should i fear him i thought tomorrow long ere this time i shall be as immaterial as he false spirit i said art thou come to close thy walks on earth and to enjoy thy triumph in the fall of the last descendant of thine enemy the spectre seemed to beckon and to smile as he faded from my sight what do you think of it i asked the same question of the priest who is a good and sensible man he admitted that the church allowed that such apparitions were possible but urged me not to permit my mind to dwell upon it as imagination plays us such strange tricks what do you think of it  much as your confessor said waverley willing to avoid dispute upon such a point at such a moment a tap at the door now announced that good man and edward retired while he administered to both prisoners the last rites of religion in the mode which the church of rome prescribes  in about an hour he was readmitted soon after a file of soldiers entered with a blacksmith who struck the fetters from the legs of the prisoners  you see the compliment they pay to our highland strength and courage we have lain chained here like wild beasts till our legs are cramped into palsy and when they free us they send six soldiers with loaded muskets to prevent our taking the castle by storm  edward afterwards learned that these severe precautions had been taken in consequence of a desperate attempt of the prisoners to escape in which they had very nearly succeeded  shortly afterwards the drums of the garrison beat to arms this is the last turnout said fergus that i shall hear and obey and now my dear dear edward ere we part let us speak of floraa subject which awakes the tenderest feeling that yet thrills within me  we part not here said waverley  o yes we do you must come no farther not that i fear what is to follow for myself he said proudly nature has her tortures as well as art and how happy should we think the man who escapes from the throes of a mortal and painful disorder in the space of a short half hour and this matter spin it out as they will cannot last longer but what a dying man can suffer firmly may kill a living friend to look upon this same law of high treason he continued with astonishing firmness and composure is one of the blessings edward with which your free country has accommodated poor old scotland her own jurisprudence as i have heard was much milder but i suppose one day or otherwhen there are no longer any wild highlanders to benefit by its tender merciesthey will blot it from their records as levelling them with a nation of cannibals the mummery too of exposing the senseless headthey have not the wit to grace mine with a paper coronet there would be some satire in that edward i hope they will set it on the scotch gate though that i may look even after death to the blue hills of my own country which i love so dearly the baron would have added      moritur et moriens dukes reminiscitur argos  a bustle and the sound of wheels and horses feet was now heard in the courtyard of the castle as i have told you why you must not follow me and these sounds admonish me that my time flies fast tell me how you found poor flora  waverley with a voice interrupted by suffocating sensations gave some account of the state of her mind  poor flora answered the chief she could have borne her own sentence of death but not mine you waverley will soon know the happiness of mutual affection in the married statelong long may rose and you enjoy itbut you can never know the purity of feeling which combines two orphans like flora and me left alone as it were in the world and being all in all to each other from our very infancy but her strong sense of duty and predominant feeling of loyalty will give new nerve to her mind after the immediate and acute sensation of this parting has passed away she will then think of fergus as of the heroes of our race upon whose deeds she loved to dwell  shall she not see you then asked waverley she seemed to expect it  a necessary deceit will spare her the last dreadful parting i could not part with her without tears and i cannot bear that these men should think they have power to extort them she was made to believe she would see me at a later hour and this letter which my confessor will deliver will apprise her that all is over  an officer now appeared and intimated that the high sheriff and his attendants waited before the gate of the castle to claim the bodies of fergus macivor and evan maccombich i come said fergus accordingly supporting edward by the arm and followed by evan dhu and the priest he moved down the stairs of the tower the soldiers bringing up the rear the court was occupied by a squadron of dragoons and a battalion of infantry drawn up in hollow square within their ranks was the sledge or hurdle on which the prisoners were to be drawn to the place of execution about a mile distant from carlisle it was painted black and drawn by a white horse at one end of the vehicle sat the executioner a horridlooking fellow as beseemed his trade with the broad axe in his hand at the other end next the horse was an empty seat for two persons through the deep and dark gothic archway that opened on the drawbridge were seen on horseback the high sheriff and his attendants whom the etiquette betwixt the civil and military powers did not permit to come farther this is well got up for a closing scene said fergus smiling disdainfully as he gazed around upon the apparatus of terror evan dhu exclaimed with some eagerness after looking at the dragoons these are the very chields that galloped off at gladsmuir before we could kill a dozen o them they look bold enough now however the priest entreated him to be silent  the sledge now approached and fergus turning round embraced waverley kissed him on each side of the face and stepped nimbly into his place evan sat down by his side the priest was to follow in a carriage belonging to his patron the catholic gentleman at whose house flora resided as fergus waved his hand to edward the ranks closed around the sledge and the whole procession began to move forward there was a momentary stop at the gateway while the governor of the castle and the high sheriff went through a short ceremony the military officer there delivering over the persons of the criminals to the civil power god save king george said the high sheriff when the formality concluded fergus stood erect in the sledge and with a firm and steady voice replied god save king james these were the last words which waverley heard him speak  the procession resumed its march and the sledge vanished from beneath the portal under which it had stopped for an instant the dead march was then heard and its melancholy sounds were mingled with those of a muffled peal tolled from the neighbouring cathedral the sound of military music died away as the procession moved on the sullen clang of the bells was soon heard to sound alone  the last of the soldiers had now disappeared from under the vaulted archway through which they had been filing for several minutes the courtyard was now totally empty but waverley still stood there as if stupefied his eyes fixed upon the dark pass where he had so lately seen the last glimpse of his friend at length a female servant of the governors struck with compassion at the stupefied misery which his countenance expressed asked him if he would not walk into her masters house and sit down she was obliged to repeat her question twice ere he comprehended her but at length it recalled him to himself declining the courtesy by a hasty gesture he pulled his hat over his eyes and leaving the castle walked as swiftly as he could through the empty streets till he regained his inn then rushed into an apartment and bolted the door  in about an hour and a half which seemed an age of unutterable suspense the sound of the drums and fifes performing a lively air and the confused murmur of the crowd which now filled the streets so lately deserted apprised him that all was finished and that the military and populace were returning from the dreadful scene i will not attempt to describe his sensations  in the evening the priest made him a visit and informed him that he did so by directions of his deceased friend to assure him that fergus macivor had died as he lived and remembered his friendship to the last he added he had also seen flora whose state of mind seemed more composed since all was over with her and sister theresa the priest proposed next day to leave carlisle for the nearest seaport from which they could embark for france waverley forced on this good man a ring of some value and a sum of money to be employed as he thought might gratify flora in the services of the catholic church for the memory of his friend fungarque inani munere he repeated as the ecclesiastic retired yet why not class these acts of remembrance with other honours with which affection in all sects pursues the memory of the dead  the next morning ere daylight he took leave of the town of carlisle promising to himself never again to enter its walls he dared hardly look back towards the gothic battlements of the fortified gate under which he passed for the place is surrounded with an old wall theyre no there said alick polwarth who guessed the cause of the dubious look which waverley cast backward and who with the vulgar appetite for the horrible was master of each detail of the butcherythe heads are ower the scotch yate as they ca it its a great pity of evan dhu who was a very weelmeaning goodnatured man to be a hielandman and indeed so was the laird o glennaquoich too for that matter when he wasna in ane o his tirrivies     chapter xli  dulce domum   the impression of horror with which waverley left carlisle softened by degrees into melancholy a gradation which was accelerated by the painful yet soothing task of writing to rose and while he could not suppress his own feelings of the calamity he endeavoured to place it in a light which might grieve her without shocking her imagination the picture which he drew for her benefit he gradually familiarised to his own mind and his next letters were more cheerful and referred to the prospects of peace and happiness which lay before them yet though his first horrible sensations had sunk into melancholy edward had reached his native country before he could as usual on former occasions look round for enjoyment upon the face of nature  he then for the first time since leaving edinburgh began to experience that pleasure which almost all feel who return to a verdant populous and highly cultivated country from scenes of waste desolation or of solitary and melancholy grandeur but how were those feelings enhanced when he entered on the domain so long possessed by his forefathers recognised the old oaks of waverleychace thought with what delight he should introduce rose to all his favourite haunts beheld at length the towers of the venerable hall arise above the woods which embowered it and finally threw himself into the arms of the venerable relations to whom he owed so much duty and affection  the happiness of their meeting was not tarnished by a single word of reproach on the contrary whatever pain sir everard and mrs rachel had felt during waverleys perilous engagement with the young chevalier it assorted too well with the principles in which they had been brought up to incur reprobation or even censure colonel talbot also had smoothed the way with great address for edwards favourable reception by dwelling upon his gallant behaviour in the military character particularly his bravery and generosity at preston until warmed at the idea of their nephews engaging in single combat making prisoner and saving from slaughter so distinguished an officer as the colonel himself the imagination of the baronet and his sister ranked the exploits of edward with those of wilibert hildebrand and nigel the vaunted heroes of their line  the appearance of waverley embrowned by exercise and dignified by the habits of military discipline had acquired an athletic and hardy character which not only verified the colonels narration but surprised and delighted all the inhabitants of waverleyhonour they crowded to see to hear him and to sing his praises mr pembroke who secretly extolled his spirit and courage in embracing the genuine cause of the church of england censured his pupil gently nevertheless for being so careless of his manuscripts which indeed he said had occasioned him some personal inconvenience as upon the baronets being arrested by a kings messenger he had deemed it prudent to retire to a concealment called the priests hole from the use it had been put to in former days where he assured our hero the butler had thought it safe to venture with food only once in the day so that he had been repeatedly compelled to dine upon victuals either absolutely cold or what was worse only half warm not to mention that sometimes his bed had not been arranged for two days together waverleys mind involuntarily turned to the patmos of the baron of bradwardine who was well pleased with janets fare and a few bunches of straw stowed in a cleft in the front of a sandcliff but he made no remarks upon a contrast which could only mortify his worthy tutor  all was now in a bustle to prepare for the nuptials of edward an event to which the good old baronet and mrs rachel looked forward as if to the renewal of their own youth the match as colonel talbot had intimated had seemed to them in the highest degree eligible having every recommendation but wealth of which they themselves had more than enough mr clippurse was therefore summoned to waverleyhonour under better auspices than at the commencement of our story but mr clippurse came not alone for being now stricken in years he had associated with him a nephew a younger vulture as our english juvenal who tells the tale of swallow the attorney might have called him and they now carried on business as messrs clippurse and hookem these worthy gentlemen had directions to make the necessary settlements on the most splendid scale of liberality as if edward were to wed a peeress in her own right with her paternal estate tacked to the fringe of her ermine  but before entering upon a subject of proverbial delay i must remind my reader of the progress of a stone rolled downhill by an idle truant boy a pastime at which i was myself expert in my more juvenile years it moves at first slowly avoiding by inflection every obstacle of the least importance but when it has attained its full impulse and draws near the conclusion of its career it smokes and thunders down taking a rood at every spring clearing hedge and ditch like a yorkshire huntsman and becoming most furiously rapid in its course when it is nearest to being consigned to rest for ever even such is the course of a narrative like that which you are perusing the earlier events are studiously dwelt upon that you kind reader may be introduced to the character rather by narrative than by the duller medium of direct description but when the story draws near its close we hurry over the circumstances however important which your imagination must have forestalled and leave you to suppose those things which it would be abusing your patience to relate at length  we are therefore so far from attempting to trace the dull progress of messrs clippurse and hookem or that of their worthy official brethren who had the charge of suing out the pardons of edward waverley and his intended fatherinlaw that we can but touch upon matters more attractive the mutual epistles for example which were exchanged between sir everard and the baron upon this occasion though matchless specimens of eloquence in their way must be consigned to merciless oblivion nor can i tell you at length how worthy aunt rachel not without a delicate and affectionate allusion to the circumstances which had transferred roses maternal diamonds to the hands of donald bean lean stocked her casket with a set of jewels that a duchess might have envied moreover the reader will have the goodness to imagine that job houghton and his dame were suitably provided for although they could never be persuaded that their son fell otherwise than fighting by the young squires side so that alick who as a lover of truth had made many needless attempts to expound the real circumstances to them was finally ordered to say not a word more upon the subject he indemnified himself however by the liberal allowance of desperate battles grisly executions and rawhead and bloodybone stories with which he astonished the servants hall  but although these important matters may be briefly told in narrative like a newspaper report of a chancery suit yet with all the urgency which waverley could use the real time which the law proceedings occupied joined to the delay occasioned by the mode of travelling at that period rendered it considerably more than two months ere waverley having left england alighted once more at the mansion of the laird of duchran to claim the hand of his plighted bride  the day of his marriage was fixed for the sixth after his arrival the baron of bradwardine with whom bridals christenings and funerals were festivals of high and solemn import felt a little hurt that including the family of the duchran and all the immediate vicinity who had title to be present on such an occasion there could not be above thirty persons collected when he was married he observedthree hundred horse of gentlemen born besides servants and some score or two of highland lairds who never got on horseback were present on the occasion  but his pride found some consolation in reflecting that he and his soninlaw having been so lately in arms against government it might give matter of reasonable fear and offence to the ruling powers if they were to collect together the kith kin and allies of their houses arrayed in effeir of war as was the ancient custom of scotland on these occasionsand without dubitation he concluded with a sigh many of those who would have rejoiced most freely upon these joyful espousals are either gone to a better place or are now exiles from their native land  the marriage took place on the appointed day the reverend mr rubrick kinsman to the proprietor of the hospitable mansion where it was solemnised and chaplain to the baron of bradwardine had the satisfaction to unite their hands and frank stanley acted as bridesman having joined edward with that view soon after his arrival lady emily and colonel talbot had proposed being present but lady emilys health when the day approached was found inadequate to the journey in amends it was arranged that edward waverley and his lady who with the baron proposed an immediate journey to waverleyhonour should in their way spend a few days at an estate which colonel talbot had been tempted to purchase in scotland as a very great bargain and at which he proposed to reside for some time     chapter xlii  this is no mine ain house i ken by the bigging otold song   the nuptial party travelled in great style there was a coach and six after the newest pattern which sir everard had presented to his nephew that dazzled with its splendour the eyes of one half of scotland there was the family coach of mr rubrickboth these were crowded with ladiesand there were gentlemen on horseback with their servants to the number of a round score nevertheless without having the fear of famine before his eyes bailie macwheeble met them in the road to entreat that they would pass by his house at little veolan the baron stared and said his son and he would certainly ride by little veolan and pay their compliments to the bailie but could not think of bringing with them the haill comitatus nuptialis or matrimonial procession he added that as he understood that the barony had been sold by its unworthy possessor he was glad to see his old friend duncan had regained his situation under the new dominus or proprietor the bailie ducked bowed and fidgeted and then again insisted upon his invitation until the baron though rather piqued at the pertinacity of his instances could not nevertheless refuse to consent without making evident sensations which he was anxious to conceal  he fell into a deep study as they approached the top of the avenue and was only startled from it by observing that the battlements were replaced the ruins cleared away and most wonderful of all that the two great stone bears those mutilated dagons of his idolatry had resumed their posts over the gateway now this new proprietor said he to edward has shown mair gusto as the italians call it in the short time he has had this domain than that hound malcolm though i bred him here mysell has acquired vita adhuc durante and now i talk of hounds is not yon ban and buscar who come scouping up the avenue with davie gellatley  i vote we should go to meet them sir said waverley for i believe the present master of the house is colonel talbot who will expect to see us we hesitated to mention to you at first that he had purchased your ancient patrimonial property and even yet if you do not incline to visit him we can pass on to the bailies  the baron had occasion for all his magnanimity however he drew a long breath took a long snuff and observed since they had brought him so far he could not pass the colonels gate and he would be happy to see the new master of his old tenants he alighted accordingly as did the other gentlemen and ladies he gave his arm to his daughter and as they descended the avenue pointed out to her how speedily the diva pecunia of the southrontheir tutelary deity he might call herhad removed the marks of spoliation  in truth not only had the felled trees been removed but their stumps being grubbed up and the earth round them levelled and sown with grass every mark of devastation unless to an eye intimately acquainted with the spot was already totally obliterated there was a similar reformation in the outward man of davie gellatley who met them every now and then stopping to admire the new suit which graced his person in the same colours as formerly but bedizened fine enough to have served touchstone himself he danced up with his usual ungainly frolics first to the baron and then to rose passing his hands over his clothes crying bra bra davie and scarce able to sing a bar to an end of his thousandandone songs for the breathless extravagance of his joy the dogs also acknowledged their old master with a thousand gambols upon my conscience rose ejaculated the baron the gratitude o thae dumb brutes and of that puir innocent brings the tears into my auld een while that schellum malcolmbut im obliged to colonel talbot for putting my hounds into such good condition and likewise for puir davie but rose my dear we must not permit them to be a liferent burden upon the estate  as he spoke lady emily leaning upon the arm of her husband met the party at the lower gate with a thousand welcomes after the ceremony of introduction had been gone through much abridged by the ease and excellent breeding of lady emily she apologised for having used a little art to wile them back to a place which might awaken some painful reflectionsbut as it was to change masters we were very desirous that the baron  mr bradwardine madam if you please said the old gentleman  mr bradwardine then and mr waverley should see what we have done towards restoring the mansion of your fathers to its former state  the baron answered with a low bow indeed when he entered the court excepting that the heavy stables which had been burnt down were replaced by buildings of a lighter and more picturesque appearance all seemed as much as possible restored to the state in which he had left it when he assumed arms some months before the pigeonhouse was replenished the fountain played with its usual activity and not only the bear who predominated over its basin but all the other bears whatsoever were replaced on their several stations and renewed or repaired with so much care that they bore no tokens of the violence which had so lately descended upon them while these minutiae had been so needfully attended to it is scarce necessary to add that the house itself had been thoroughly repaired as well as the gardens with the strictest attention to maintain the original character of both and to remove as far as possible all appearance of the ravage they had sustained the baron gazed in silent wonder at length he addressed colonel talbot  while i acknowledge my obligation to you sir for the restoration of the badge of our family i cannot but marvel that you have nowhere established your own crest whilk is i believe a mastiff anciently called a talbot as the poet has it      a talbot strong a sturdy tyke  at least such a dog is the crest of the martial and renowned earls of shrewsbury to whom your family are probably bloodrelations  i believe said the colonel smiling our dogs are whelps of the same litter for my part if crests were to dispute precedence i should be apt to let them as the proverb says fight dog fight bear  as he made this speech at which the baron took another long pinch of snuff they had entered the house that is the baron rose and lady emily with young stanley and the bailie for edward and the rest of the party remained on the terrace to examine a new greenhouse stocked with the finest plants the baron resumed his favourite topichowever it may please you to derogate from the honour of your burgonet colonel talbot which is doubtless your humour as i have seen in other gentlemen of birth and honour in your country i must again repeat it as a most ancient and distinguished bearing as well as that of my young friend francis stanley which is the eagle and child  the bird and bantling they call it in derbyshire sir said stanley  yere a daft callant sir said the baron who had a great liking to this young man perhaps because he sometimes teased himyere a daft callant and i must correct you some of these days shaking his great brown fist at him but what i meant to say colonel talbot is that yours is an ancient prosapia or descent and since you have lawfully and justly acquired the estate for you and yours which i have lost for me and mine i wish it may remain in your name as many centuries as it has done in that of the late proprietors  that answered the colonel is very handsome mr bradwardine indeed  and yet sir i cannot but marvel that you colonel whom i noted to have so much of the amor patritz when we met in edinburgh as even to vilipend other countries should have chosen to establish your lares or household gods procul a patrice finibus and in a manner to expatriate yourself  why really baron i do not see why to keep the secret of these foolish boys waverley and stanley and of my wife who is no wiser one old soldier should continue to impose upon another you must know then that i have so much of that same prejudice in favour of my native country that the sum of money which i advanced to the seller of this extensive barony has only purchased for me a box inshire called brerewood lodge with about two hundred and fifty acres of land the chief merit of which is that it is within a very few miles of waverleyhonour  and who then in the name of heaven has bought this property  that said the colonel it is this gentlemans profession to explain  the bailie whom this reference regarded and who had all this while shifted from one foot to another with great impatience like a hen as he afterwards said upon a het girdle and chuckling he might have added like the said hen in all the glory of laying an egg now pushed forward that i can that i can your honour drawing from his pocket a budget of papers and untying the red tape with a hand trembling with eagerness here is the disposition and assignation by malcolm bradwardine of inchgrabbit regularly signed and tested in terms of the statute whereby for a certain sum of sterling money presently contented and paid to him he has disponed alienated and conveyed the whole estate and barony of bradwardine tullyveolan and others with the fortalice and manorplace  for gods sake to the point sir i have all that by heart said the colonel  to cosmo comyne bradwardme esq pursued the bailie his heirs and assignees simply and irredeemably to be held either a me vel de me  pray read short sir  on the conscience of an honest man colonel i read as short as is consistent with styleunder the burden and reservation always  mr macwheeble this would outlast a russian winter give me leave in short mr bradwardine your family estate is your own once more in full property and at your absolute disposal but only burdened with the sum advanced to repurchase it which i understand is utterly disproportioned to its value  an auld sangan auld sang if it please your honours cried the bailie rubbing his hands look at the rental book  which sum being advanced by mr edward waverley chiefly from the price of his fathers property which i bought from him is secured to his lady your daughter and her family by this marriage  it is a catholic security shouted the bailie to rose comyne bradwardine alias wauverley in liferent and the children of the said marriage in fee and i made up a wee bit minute of an antenuptial contract intuitu matrimonij so it cannot be subject to reduction hereafter as a donation inter virum et uxorem  it is difficult to say whether the worthy baron was most delighted with the restitution of his family property or with the delicacy and generosity that left him unfettered to pursue his purpose in disposing of it after his death and which avoided as much as possible even the appearance of laying him under pecuniary obligation when his first pause of joy and astonishment was over his thoughts turned to the unworthy heirmale who he pronounced had sold his birthright like esau for a mess o pottage  but wha cookit the parritch for him exclaimed the bailie i wad like to ken thatwha but your honours to command duncan macwheeble his honour young mr wauverley put it a into my hand frae the beginningfrae the first calling o the summons as i may say i circumvented themi played at bogle about the bush wi themi cajolled them and if i havena gien inchgrabbit and jamie howie a bonnie begunk they ken themselves him a writer i didna gae slapdash to them wi our young bra bridegroom to gar them baud up the market na na i scared them wi our wild tenantry and the macivors that are but ill settled yet till they durstna on ony errand whatsoever gang ower the doorstane after gloaming for fear john heatherblutter or some siccan darethedeil should tak a baff at them then on the other hand i beflummed them wi colonel talbot wad they offer to keep up the price again the dukes friend did they na ken wha was master had they na seen eneugh by the sad example of mony a puir misguided unhappy body  who went to derby for example mr macwheeble said the colonel to him aside  o whisht colonel for the love o god let that flee stick i the wa there were mony good folk at derby and its ill speaking of halterswith a sly cast of his eye toward the baron who was in a deep reverie  starting out of it at once he took macwheeble by the button and led him into one of the deep window recesses whence only fragments of their conversation reached the rest of the party it certainly related to stamppaper and parchment for no other subject even from the mouth of his patron and he once more an efficient one could have arrested so deeply the bailies reverent and absorbed attention  i understand your honour perfectly it can be dune as easy as taking out a decreet in absence  to her and him after my demise and to their heirsmale but preferring the second son if god shall bless them with two who is to carry the name and arms of bradwardine of that ilk without any other name or armorial bearings whatsoever  tut your honour whispered the bailie ill mak a slight jotting the morn it will cost but a charter of resignation in favorem and ill hae it ready for the next term in exchequer  their private conversation ended the baron was now summoned to do the honours of tullyveolan to new guests these were major melville of cairnvreckan and the reverend mr morton followed by two or three others of the barons acquaintances who had been made privy to his having again acquired the estate of his fathers the shouts of the villagers were also heard beneath in the courtyard for saunders saunderson who had kept the secret for several days with laudable prudence had unloosed his tongue upon beholding the arrival of the carriages  but while edward received major melville with politeness and the clergyman with the most affectionate and grateful kindness his fatherinlaw looked a little awkward as uncertain how he should answer the necessary claims of hospitality to his guests and forward the festivity of his tenants lady emily relieved him by intimating that though she must be an indifferent representative of mrs edward waverley in many respects she hoped the baron would approve of the entertainment she had ordered in expectation of so many guests and that they would find such other accommodations provided as might in some degree support the ancient hospitality of tullyveolan it is impossible to describe the pleasure which this assurance gave the baron who with an air of gallantry half appertaining to the stiff scottish laird and half to the officer in the french service offered his arm to the fair speaker and led the way in something between a stride and a minuet step into the large dining parlour followed by all the rest of the good company  by dint of saundersons directions and exertions all here as well as in the other apartments had been disposed as much as possible according to the old arrangement and where new movables had been necessary they had been selected in the same character with the old furniture there was one addition to this fine old apartment however which drew tears into the barons eyes it was a large and spirited painting representing fergus macivor and waverley in their highland dress the scene a wild rocky and mountainous pass down which the clan were descending in the background it was taken from a spirited sketch drawn while they were in edinburgh by a young man of high genius and had been painted on a fulllength scale by an eminent london artist raeburn himself whose highland chiefs do all but walk out of the canvas could not have done more justice to the subject and the ardent fiery and impetuous character of the unfortunate chief of glennaquoich was finely contrasted with the contemplative fanciful and enthusiastic expression of his happier friend beside this painting hung the arms which waverley had borne in the unfortunate civil war the whole piece was beheld with admiration and deeper feelings  men must however eat in spite both of sentiment and vertu and the baron while he assumed the lower end of the table insisted that lady emily should do the honours of the head that they might he said set a meet example to the young folk after a pause of deliberation employed in adjusting in his own brain the precedence between the presbyterian kirk and episcopal church of scotland he requested mr morton as the stranger would crave a blessing observing that mr rubrick who was at home would return thanks for the distinguished mercies it had been his lot to experience the dinner was excellent saunderson attended in full costume with all the former domestics who had been collected excepting one or two that had not been heard of since the affair of culloden the cellars were stocked with wine which was pronounced to be superb and it had been contrived that the bear of the fountain in the courtyard should for that night only play excellent brandy punch for the benefit of the lower orders  when the dinner was over the baron about to propose a toast cast a somewhat sorrowful look upon the sideboard which however exhibited much of his plate that had either been secreted or purchased by neighbouring gentlemen from the soldiery and by them gladly restored to the original owner  in the late times he said those must be thankful who have saved life and land yet when i am about to pronounce this toast i cannot but regret an old heirloom lady emily a poculum potatorium colonel talbot  here the barons elbow was gently touched by his majordomo and turning round he beheld in the hands of alexander ab alexandro the celebrated cup of saint duthac the blessed bear of bradwardine i question if the recovery of his estate afforded him more rapture by my honour he said one might almost believe in brownies and fairies lady emily when your ladyship is in presence  i am truly happy said colonel talbot that by the recovery of this piece of family antiquity it has fallen within my power to give you some token of my deep interest in all that concerns my young friend edward but that you may not suspect lady emily for a sorceress or me for a conjuror which is no joke in scotland i must tell you that frank stanley your friend who has been seized with a tartan fever ever since he heard edwards tales of old scottish manners happened to describe to us at secondhand this remarkable cup my servant spontoon who like a true old soldier observes everything and says little gave me afterwards to understand that he thought he had seen the piece of plate mr stanley mentioned in the possession of a certain mrs nosebag who having been originally the helpmate of a pawnbroker had found opportunity during the late unpleasant scenes in scotland to trade a little in her old line and so became the depositary of the more valuable part of the spoil of half the army you may believe the cup was speedily recovered and it will give me very great pleasure if you allow me to suppose that its value is not diminished by having been restored through my means  a tear mingled with the wine which the baron filled as he proposed a cup of gratitude to colonel talbot and the prosperity of the united houses of waverleyhonour and bradwardine  it only remains for me to say that as no wish was ever uttered with more affectionate sincerity there are few which allowing for the necessary mutability of human events have been upon the whole more happily fulfilled     chapter xliii  a postscript which should have been a preface   our journey is now finished gentle reader and if your patience has accompanied me through these sheets the contract is on your part strictly fulfilled yet like the driver who has received his full hire i still linger near you and make with becoming diffidence a trifling additional claim upon your bounty and good nature you are as free however to shut the volume of the one petitioner as to close your door in the face of the other  this should have been a prefatory chapter but for two reasons first that most novel readers as my own conscience reminds me are apt to be guilty of the sin of omission respecting that same matter of prefaces secondly that it is a general custom with that class of students to begin with the last chapter of a work so that after all these remarks being introduced last in order have still the best chance to be read in their proper place  there is no european nation which within the course of half a century or little more has undergone so complete a change as this kingdom of scotland the effects of the insurrection of 1745the destruction of the patriarchal power of the highland chiefsthe abolition of the heritable jurisdictions of the lowland nobility and baronsthe total eradication of the jacobite party which averse to intermingle with the english or adopt their customs long continued to pride themselves upon maintaining ancient scottish manners and customscommenced this innovation the gradual influx of wealth and extension of commerce have since united to render the present people of scotland a class of beings as different from their grandfathers as the existing english are from those of queen elizabeths time  the political and economical effects of these changes have been traced by lord selkirk with great precision and accuracy but the change though steadily and rapidly progressive has nevertheless been gradual and like those who drift down the stream of a deep and smooth river we are not aware of the progress we have made until we fix our eye on the now distant point from which we have been drifted such of the present generation as can recollect the last twenty or twentyfive years of the eighteenth century will be fully sensible of the truth of this statement especially if their acquaintance and connexions lay among those who in my younger time were facetiously called folks of the old leaven who still cherished a lingering though hopeless attachment to the house of stuart  this race has now almost entirely vanished from the land and with it doubtless much absurd political prejudice but also many living examples of singular and disinterested attachment to the principles of loyalty which they received from their fathers and of old scottish faith hospitality worth and honour  it was my accidental lot though not born a highlander which may be an apology for much bad gaelic to reside during my childhood and youth among persons of the above description and now for the purpose of preserving some idea of the ancient manners of which i have witnessed the almost total extinction i have embodied in imaginary scenes and ascribed to fictitious characters a part of the incidents which i then received from those who were actors in them indeed the most romantic parts of this narrative are precisely those which have a foundation in fact  the exchange of mutual protection between a highland gentleman and an officer of rank in the kings service together with the spirited manner in which the latter asserted his right to return the favour he had received is literally true the accident by a musket shot and the heroic reply imputed to flora relate to a lady of rank not long deceased and scarce a gentleman who was in hiding after the battle of culloden but could tell a tale of strange concealments and of wild and hairsbreadthscapes as extraordinary as any which i have ascribed to my heroes of this the escape of charles edward himself as the most prominent is the most striking example the accounts of the battle of preston and skirmish at clifton are taken from the narrative of intelligent eyewitnesses and corrected from the history of the rebellion by the late venerable author of douglas the lowland scottish gentlemen and the subordinate characters are not given as individual portraits but are drawn from the general habits of the period of which i have witnessed some remnants in my younger days and partly gathered from tradition  it has been my object to describe these persons not by a caricatured and exaggerated use of the national dialect but by their habits manners and feelings so as in some distant degree to emulate the admirable irish portraits drawn by miss edgeworth so different from the teagues and dear joys who so long with the most perfect family resemblance to each other occupied the drama and the novel  i feel no confidence however in the manner in which i have executed my purpose indeed so little was i satisfied with my production that i laid it aside in an unfinished state and only found it again by mere accident among other waste papers in an old cabinet the drawers of which i was rummaging in order to accommodate a friend with some fishingtackle after it had been mislaid for several years  two works upon similar subjects by female authors whose genius is highly creditable to their country have appeared in the interval i mean mrs hamiltons glenburnie and the late account of highland superstitions but the first is confined to the rural habits of scotland of which it has given a picture with striking and impressive fidelity and the traditional records of the respectable and ingenious mrs grant of laggan are of a nature distinct from the fictitious narrative which i have here attempted  i would willingly persuade myself that the preceding work will not be found altogether uninteresting to elder persons it will recall scenes and characters familiar to their youth and to the rising generation the tale may present some idea of the manners of their forefathers  yet i heartily wish that the task of tracing the evanescent manners of his own country had employed the pen of the only man in scotland who could have done it justiceof him so eminently distinguished in elegant literature and whose sketches of colonel caustic and umphraville are perfectly blended with the finer traits of national character i should in that case have had more pleasure as a reader than i shall ever feel in the pride of a successful author should these sheets confer upon me that envied distinction and as i have inverted the usual arrangement placing these remarks at the end of the work to which they refer i will venture on a second violation of form by closing the whole with a dedication  these volumes being respectfully inscribed to our scottish addison henry mackenzie by an unknown admirer of his genius  the end     notesvolume i  note 1  long the oracle of the country gentlemen of the high tory party the ancient

knightly family of bradshaigh the proprietors of haigh hall in lancashire where i have been told the event is recorded on a painted glass window the german ballad of the noble moringer turns upon a similar topic but undoubtedly many such incidents may have taken place where the distance being great and the intercourse infrequent false reports concerning the fate of the absent crusaders must have been commonly circulated and sometimes perhaps rather hastily credited at home  note 3  the attachment to this classic was it is said actually displayed in the manner mentioned in the text by an unfortunate jacobite in that unhappy period he escaped from the jail in which he was confined for a hasty trial and certain condemnation and was retaken as he hovered around the place in which he had been imprisoned for which he could give no better reason than the hope of recovering his favourite titus livius i am sorry to add that the simplicity of such a character was found to form no apology

and excellent man and proceed to copy the account of his remarkable conversion as related by doctor doddridge  this memorable event says the pious writer happened towards the middle of july 1719 the major had spent the evening and if i mistake not it was the sabbath in some gay company and had an unhappy assignation with a married woman whom he was to attend exactly at twelve the company broke up about eleven and not judging it convenient to anticipate the time appointed he went into his chamber to kill the tedious hour perhaps with some amusing book or some other way but it very accidentally happened that he took up a religious book which his good mother or aunt had without his knowledge slipped into his portmanteau it was called if i remember the title exactly the christian soldier or heaven taken by storm and it was written by mr thomas watson guessing by the title of it that he would find some phrases of his own profession spiritualised in a manner which he thought might afford him some diversion he resolved to dip into it but he took no serious notice of anything it had in it and yet while this book was in his hand an impression was made upon his mind perhaps god only knows how which drew after it a train of the most important and happy consequences he thought he saw an unusual blaze of light fall upon the book which he was reading which he at first imagined might happen by some accident in the candle but lifting up his eyes he apprehended to his extreme amazement that there was before him as it were suspended in the air a visible representation of the lord jesus christ upon the cross surrounded on all sides with a glory and was impressed as if a voice or something equivalent to a voice had come to him to this effect for he was not confident as to the words oh sinner did i suffer this for thee and are these thy returns struck with so amazing a phenomenon as this there remained hardly any life in him so that he sunk down in the armchair in which he sat and continued he knew not how long insensible  with regard to this vision says the ingenious dr hibbert the appearance of our saviour on the cross and the awful words repeated can be considered in no other light than as so many recollected images of the mind which probably had their origin in the language of some urgent appeal to repentance that the colonel might have casually read or heard delivered from what cause however such ideas were rendered as vivid as actual impressions we have no information to be depended upon this vision was certainly attended with one of the most important of consequences connected with the christian dispensationthe conversion of a sinner and hence no single narrative has perhaps done more to confirm the superstitious opinion that apparitions of this awful kind cannot arise without a divine fiat doctor hibbert adds in a notea short time before the vision colonel gardiner had received a severe fall from his horse did the brain receive some slight degree of injury from the accident so as to predispose him to this spiritual illusionhibberts philosophy of apparitions edinburgh 1824 p 190  note 6  the courtesy of an invitation to partake a travellers meal or at least that of being invited to share whatever liquor the guest called for was expected by certain old landlords in scotland even in the youth of the author in requital mine host was always furnished with the news of the country and was probably a little of a humorist to boot the devolution of the whole actual business and drudgery of the inn upon the poor gudewife was very common among the scottish bonifaces there was in ancient times in the city of edinburgh a gentleman of good family who condescended in order to gain a livelihood to become the nominal keeper of a coffeehouse one of the first places of the kind which had been opened in the scottish metropolis as usual it was entirely managed by the careful and industrious mrs b while her husband amused himself with field sports without troubling his head about the matter once upon a time the premises having taken fire the husband was met walking up the high street loaded with his guns and fishingrods and replied calmly to someone who inquired after his wife that the poor woman was trying to save a parcel of crockery and some trumpery books the last being those which served her to conduct the business of the house  there were many elderly gentlemen in the authors younger days who still held it part of the amusement of a journey to parley with mine host who often resembled in his quaint humour mine host of the garter in the merry wives of windsor or blague of the george in the merry devil of edmonton sometimes the landlady took her share of entertaining the company in either case the omitting to pay them due attention gave displeasure and perhaps brought down a smart jest as on the following occasion  a jolly dame who not sixty years since kept the principal caravansary at greenlaw in berwickshire had the honour to receive under her roof a very worthy clergyman with three sons of the same profession each having a cure of souls be it said in passing none of the reverend party were reckoned powerful in the pulpit after dinner was over the worthy senior in the pride of his heart asked mrs buchan whether she ever had had such a party in her house before here sit i he said a placed minister of the kirk of scotland and here sit my three sons each a placed minister of the same kirk confess luckie buchan you never had such a party in your house before the question was not premised by any invitation to sit down and take a glass of wine or the like so mrs b answered drily indeed sir i cannot just say that ever i had such a party in my house before except once in the fortyfive when i had a highland piper here with his three sons all highland pipers and deil a spring they could play amang them  note 7  there is no particular mansion described under the name of tullyveolan but the peculiarities of the description occur in various old scottish seats the house of warrender upon bruntsfield links and that of old ravelston belonging the former to sir george warrender the latter to sir alexander keith have both contributed several hints to the description in the text the house of dean near edinburgh has also some points of resemblance with tullyveolan the author has however been informed that the house of grandtully resembles that of the baron of bradwardine still more than any of the above  note 8  i am ignorant how long the ancient and established custom of keeping fools has been disused in england swift writes an epitaph on the earl of suffolks fool  whose name was dickie pearce  in scotland the custom subsisted till late in the last century at glamis castle is preserved the dress of one of the jesters very handsome and ornamented with many bells it is not above thirty years since such a character stood by the sideboard of a nobleman of the first rank in scotland and occasionally mixed in the conversation till he carried the joke rather too far in making proposals to one of the young ladies of the family and publishing the bans betwixt her and himself in the public church  note 9  after the revolution of 1688 and on some occasions when the spirit of the presbyterians had been unusually animated against their opponents the episcopal clergymen who were chiefly nonjurors were exposed to be mobbed as we should now say or rabbled as the phrase then went to expiate their political heresies but notwithstanding that the presbyterians had the persecution in charles ii and his brothers time to exasperate them there was little mischief done beyond the kind of petty violence mentioned in the text  note 10  i may here mention that the fashion of compotation described in the text was still occasionally practised in scotland in the authors youth a company after having taken leave of their host often went to finish the evening at the clachan or village in womb of tavern their entertainer always accompanied them to take the stirrupcup which often occasioned a long and late revel  the poculum potatorium of the valiant baron his blessed bear has a prototype at the fine old castle of glamis so rich in memorials of ancient times it is a massive beaker of silver double gilt moulded into the shape of a lion and holding about an english pint of wine the form alludes to the family name of strathmore which is lyon and when exhibited the cup must necessarily be emptied to the earls health the author ought perhaps to be ashamed of recording that he has had the honour of swallowing the contents of the lion and the recollection of the feat served to suggest the story of the bear of bradwardine in the family of scott of thirlestane not thirlestane in the forest but the place of the same name in roxburghshire was long preserved a cup of the same kind in the form of a jackboot each guest was obliged to empty this at his departure if the guests name was scott the necessity was doubly imperative  when the landlord of an inn presented his guests with deoch an doruis that is the drink at the door or the stirrupcup the draught was not charged in the reckoning on this point a learned bailie of the town of forfar pronounced a very sound judgment  a an alewife in forfar had brewed her peck of malt and set the liquor out of doors to cool the cow of b a neighbour of a chanced to come by and seeing the good beverage was allured to taste it and finally to drink it up when a came to take in her liquor she found her tub empty and from the cows staggering and staring so as to betray her intemperance she easily divined the mode in which her browst had disappeared to take vengeance on crummies ribs with a stick was her first effort the roaring of the cow brought b her master who remonstrated with his angry neighbour and received in reply a demand for the value of the ale which crummie had drunk up b refused payment and was conveyed before c the bailie or sitting magistrate he heard the case patiently and then demanded of the plaintiff a whether the cow had sat down to her potation or taken it standing the plaintiff answered she had not seen the deed committed but she supposed the cow drank the ale while standing on her feet adding that had she been near she would have made her use them to some purpose the bailie on this admission solemnly adjudged the cows drink to be deoch an doruis a stirrupcup for which no charge could be made without violating the ancient hospitality of scotland  note 11  the story last told was said to have happened in the south of scotland but cedant arma togae and let the gown have its dues it was an old clergyman who had wisdom and firmness enough to resist the panic which seized his brethren who was the means of rescuing a poor insane creature from the cruel fate which would otherwise have overtaken her the accounts of the trials for witchcraft form one of the most deplorable chapters in scottish story  note 12  although canting heraldry is generally reprobated it seems nevertheless to have been adopted in the arms and mottos of many honourable families thus the motto of the vernons ver non semper viret is a perfect pun and so is that of the onslows festina lente the periissem ni periissem of the anstruthers is liable to a similar objection one of that ancient race finding that an antagonist with whom he had fixed a friendly meeting was determined to take the opportunity of assassinating him prevented the hazard by dashing out his brains with a battleaxe two sturdy arms brandishing such a weapon form the usual crest of the family with the above motto periissem ni periissemi had died unless i had gone through with it  note 13  macdonald of barrisdale one of the very last highland gentlemen who carried on the plundering system to any great extent was a scholar and a wellbred gentleman he engraved on his broadswords the wellknown lines  hae tibi erunt artes pacisque imponere morem parcere subjectis et debellare superbos  indeed the levying of blackmail was before 1745 practised by several chiefs of very high rank who in doing so contended that they were lending the laws the assistance of their arms and swords and affording a protection which could not be obtained from the magistracy in the disturbed state of the country the author has seen a memoir of macpherson of cluny chief of that ancient clan from which it appears that he levied protectionmoney to a very large amount which was willingly paid even by some of his most powerful neighbours a gentleman of this clan hearing a clergyman hold forth to his congregation on the crime of theft interrupted the preacher to assure him he might leave the enforcement of such doctrines to cluny macpherson whose broadsword would put a stop to theft sooner than all the sermons of all the ministers of the synod  note 14  the townguard of edinburgh were till a late period armed with this weapon when on their policeduty there was a hook at the back of the axe which the ancient highlanders used to assist them to climb over walls fixing the hook upon it and raising themselves by the handle the axe which was also much used by the natives of ireland is supposed to have been introduced into both countries from scandinavia  note 15  an adventure very similar to what is here stated actually befell the late mr abercromby of tullibody grandfather of the present lord abercromby and father of the celebrated sir ralph when this gentleman who lived to a very advanced period of life first settled in stirlingshire his cattle were repeatedly driven off by the celebrated rob roy or some of his gang and at length he was obliged after obtaining a proper safeconduct to make the cateran such a visit as that of waverley to bean lean in the text rob received him with much courtesy and made many apologies for the accident which must have happened he said through some mistake mr abercromby was regaled with collops from two of his own cattle which were hung up by the heels in the cavern and was dismissed in perfect safety after having agreed to pay in future a small sum of blackmail in consideration of which rob roy not only undertook to forbear his herds in future but to replace any that should be stolen from him by other freebooters mr abercromby said rob roy affected to consider him as a friend to the jacobite interest and a sincere enemy to the union neither of these circumstances were true but the laird thought it quite unnecessary to undeceive his highland host at the risk of bringing on a political dispute in such a situation this anecdote i received many years since about 1792 from the mouth of the venerable gentleman who was concerned in it  note 16  this celebrated gibbet was in the memory of the last generation still standing at the western end of the town of crieff in perthshire why it was called the kind gallows we are unable to inform the reader with certainty but it is alleged that the highlanders used to touch their bonnets as they passed a place which had been fatal to many of their countrymen with the ejaculation god bless her nain sell and the teil tamn you it may therefore have been called kind as being a sort of native or kindred place of doom to those who suffered there as in fulfilment of a natural destiny  note 17  the story of the bridegroom carried off by caterans on his bridalday is taken from one which was told to the author by the late laird of macnab many years since to carry off persons from the lowlands and to put them to ransom was a common practice with the wild highlanders as it is said to be at the present day with the banditti in the south of italy upon the occasion alluded to a party of caterans carried off the bridegroom and secreted him in some cave near the mountain of schiehallion the young man caught the smallpox before his ransom could be agreed on and whether it was the fine cool air of the place or the want of medical attendance macnab did not pretend to be positive but so it was that the prisoner recovered his ransom was paid and he was restored to his friends and bride but always considered the highland robbers as having saved his life by their treatment of his malady  note 18  this happened on many occasions indeed it was not till after the total destruction of the clan influence after 1745 that purchasers could be found who offered a fair price for the estates forfeited in 1715 which were then brought to sale by the creditors of the york buildings company who had purchased the whole or greater part from government at a very small price even so late as the period first mentioned the prejudices of the public in favour of the heirs of the forfeited families threw various impediments in the way of intending purchasers of such property  note 19  this sort of political game ascribed to macivor was in reality played by several highland chiefs the celebrated lord lovat in particular who used that kind of finesse to the uttermost the laird of macwas also captain of an independent company but valued the sweets of present pay too well to incur the risk of losing them in the jacobite cause his martial consort raised his clan and headed it in 1745 but the chief himself would have nothing to do with kingmaking declaring himself for that monarch and no other who gave the laird of mac  halfaguinea the day and halfaguinea the morn  note 20  in explanation of the military exercise observed at the castle of glennaquoich the author begs to remark that the highlanders were not only well practised in the use of the broadsword firelock and most of the manly sports and trials of strength common throughout scotland but also used a peculiar sort of drill suited to their own dress and mode of warfare there were for instance different modes of disposing the plaid one when on a peaceful journey another when danger was apprehended one way of enveloping themselves in it when expecting undisturbed repose and another which enabled them to start up with sword and pistol in hand on the slightest alarm  previous to 1720 or thereabouts the belted plaid was universally worn in which the portion which surrounded the middle of the wearer and that which was flung around his shoulders were all of the same piece of tartan in a desperate onset all was thrown away and the clan charged bare beneath the doublet save for an artificial arrangement of the shirt which like that of the irish was always ample and for the sporranmollach or goatsskin purse  the manner of handling the pistol and dirk was also part of the highland manual exercise which the author has seen gone through by men who had learned it in their youth  note 21  pork or swines flesh in any shape was till of late years much abominated by the scotch nor is it yet a favourite food amongst them king jamie carried this prejudice to england and is known to have abhorred pork almost as much as he did tobacco ben jonson has recorded this peculiarity where the gipsy in a masque examining the kings hand says  you should by this line  love a horse and a hound but no part of a swine  the gipsies metamorphosed  jamess own proposed banquet for the devil was a loin of pork and a poll of ling with a pipe of tobacco for digestion  note 22  in the number of persons of all ranks who assembled at the same table though by no means to discuss the same fare the highland chiefs only retained a custom which had been formerly universally observed throughout scotland i myself says the traveller fynes morrison in the end of queen elizabeths reign the scene being the lowlands of scotland was at a knights house who had many servants to attend him that brought in his meat with their heads covered with blue caps the table being more than half furnished with great platters of porridge each having a little piece of sodden meat and when the table was served the servants did sit down with us but the upper mess instead of porridge had a pullet with some prunes in the brothtravels p 155  till within this last century the farmers even of a respectable condition dined with their workpeople the difference betwixt those of high degree was ascertained by the place of the party above or below the salt or sometimes by a line drawn with chalk on the diningtable lord lovat who knew well how to feed the vanity and restrain the appetites of his clansmen allowed each sturdy fraser who had the slightest pretensions to be a duinhewassel the full honour of the sitting but at the same time took care that his young kinsmen did not acquire at his table any taste for outlandish luxuries his lordship was always ready with some honourable apology why foreign wines and french brandy delicacies which he conceived might sap the hardy habits of his cousins should not circulate past an assigned point on the table  note 23  in the irish ballads relating to fion the fingal of macpherson there occurs as in the primitive poetry of most nations a cycle of heroes each of whom has some distinguishing attribute upon these qualities and the adventures of those possessing them many proverbs are formed which are still current in the highlands among other characters conan is distinguished as in some respects a kind of thersites but brave and daring even to rashness he had made a vow that he would never take a blow without returning it and having like other heroes of antiquity descended to the infernal regions he received a cuff from the archfiend who presided there which he instantly returned using the expression in the text sometimes the proverb is worded thusclaw for claw and the devil take the shortest nails as conan said to the devil  note 24  the description of the waterfall mentioned in this chapter is taken from that of ledeard at the farm so called on the northern side of lochard and near the head of the lake four or five miles from aberfoyle it is upon a small scale but otherwise one of the most exquisite cascades it is possible to behold the appearance of flora with the harp as described has been justly censured as too theatrical and affected for the ladylike simplicity of her character but something may be allowed to her french education in which point and striking effect always make a considerable object  note 25  the author has been sometimes accused of confounding fiction with reality he therefore thinks it necessary to state that the circumstance of the hunting described in the text as preparatory to the insurrection of 1745 is so far as he knows entirely imaginary but it is well known such a great hunting was held in the forest of braemar under the auspices of the earl of mar as preparatory to the rebellion of 1715 and most of the highland chieftains who afterwards engaged in that civil commotion were present on this occasion     glossaryvolume i  a all  aboon abune above  aby abye endure

holds a commanding station on the banks of the river teith and has been one of the largest castles in scotland murdoch duke of albany the founder of this stately pile was beheaded on the castlehill of stirling from which he might see the towers of doune the monument of his fallen greatness  in 174546 as stated in the text a garrison on the part of the chevalier was put into the castle then less ruinous than at present it was commanded by mr stewart of balloch as governor for prince charles he was a man of property near callander this castle became at that time the actual scene of a romantic escape made by john home the author of douglas and some other prisoners who having been taken at the battle of falkirk were confined there by the insurgents the poet who had in his own mind a large stock of that romantic and enthusiastic spirit of adventure which he has described as animating the youthful hero of his drama devised and undertook the perilous enterprise of escaping from his prison he inspired his companions with his sentiments and when every attempt at open force was deemed hopeless they resolved to twist their bedclothes into ropes and thus to descend four persons with home himself reached the ground in safety but the rope broke with the fifth who was a tall lusty man the sixth was thomas barrow a brave young englishman a particular friend of homes determined to take the risk even in such unfavourable circumstances barrow committed himself to the broken rope slid down on it as far as it could assist him and then let himself drop his friends beneath succeeded in breaking his fall nevertheless he dislocated his ankle and had several of his ribs broken his companions however were able to bear him off in safety  the highlanders next morning sought for their prisoners with great activity an old gentleman told the author he remembered seeing the commandant stewart     bloody with spurring fiery red with haste riding furiously through the country in quest of the fugitives  note 28  to go out or to have been out in scotland was a conventional phrase similar to that of the irish respecting a man having been up both having reference to an individual who had been engaged in insurrection it was accounted illbreeding in scotland about forty years since to use the phrase rebellion or rebel which might be interpreted by some of the parties present as a personal insult it was also esteemed more polite even for stanch whigs to denominate charles edward the chevalier than to speak of him as the pretender and this kind of accommodating courtesy was usually observed in society where individuals of each party mixed on friendly terms  note 29  the jacobite sentiments were general among the western counties and in wales but although the great families of the wynnes the wyndhams and others had come under an actual obligation to join prince charles if he should land they had done so under the express stipulation that he should be assisted by an auxiliary army of french without which they foresaw the enterprise would be desperate wishing well to his cause therefore and watching an opportunity to join him they did not nevertheless think themselves bound in honour to do so as he was only supported by a body of wild mountaineers speaking an uncouth dialect and wearing a singular dress the race up to derby struck them with more dread than admiration but it is difficult to say what the effect might have been had either the battle of preston or falkirk been fought and won during the advance into england  note 30  divisions early showed themselves in the chevaliers little army not only amongst the independent chieftains who were far too proud to brook subjection to each other but betwixt the scotch and charless governor osullivan an irishman by birth who with some of his countrymen bred in the irish brigade in the service of the king of france had an influence with the adventurer much resented by the highlanders who were sensible that their own clans made the chief or rather the only strength of his enterprise there was a feud also between lord george murray and john murray of broughton the princes secretary whose disunion greatly embarrassed the affairs of the adventurer in general a thousand different pretensions divided their little army and finally contributed in no small degree to its overthrow  note 31  this circumstance which is historical as well as the description that precedes it will remind the reader of the war of la vendee in which the royalists consisting chiefly of insurgent peasantry attached a prodigious and even superstitious interest to the possession of a piece of brass ordnance which they called marie jeanne  the highlanders of an early period were afraid of cannon with the noise and effect of which they were totally unacquainted it was by means of three or four small pieces of artillery that the earls of huntly and errol in james vis time gained a great victory at glenlivat over a numerous highland army commanded by the earl of argyle at the battle of the bridge of dee general middleton obtained by his artillery a similar success the highlanders not being able to stand the discharge of muskets mother which was the name they bestowed on great guns in an old ballad on the battle of the bridge of dee these verses occur         the highlandmen are pretty men          for handling sword and shield        but yet they are but simple men          to stand a stricken field          the highlandmen are pretty men           for target and claymore         but yet they are but naked men           to face the cannons roar          for the cannons roar on a summer night           like thunder in the air         was never man in highland garb           would face the cannon fair  but the highlanders of 1745 had got far beyond the simplicity of their forefathers and showed throughout the whole war how little they dreaded artillery although the common people still attached some consequence to the possession of the fieldpiece which led to this disquisition  note 32  the faithful friend who pointed out the pass by which the highlanders moved from tranent to seaton was robert anderson junior of whitburgh a gentleman of property in east lothian he had been interrogated by the lord george murray concerning the possibility of crossing the uncouth and marshy piece of ground which divided the armies and which he described as impracticable when dismissed he recollected that there was a circuitous path leading eastward through the marsh into the plain by which the highlanders might turn the flank of sir john copes position without being exposed to the enemys fire having mentioned his opinion to mr hepburn of keith who instantly saw its importance he was encouraged by that gentleman to awake lord george murray and communicate the idea to him lord george received the information with grateful thanks and instantly awakened prince charles who was sleeping in the field with a bunch of pease under his head the adventurer received with alacrity the news that there was a possibility of bringing an excellently provided army to a decisive battle with his own irregular forces his joy on the occasion was not very consistent with the charge of cowardice brought against him by chevalier johnstone a discontented follower whose memoirs possess at least as much of a romantic as a historical character even by the account of the chevalier himself the prince was at the head of the second line of the highland army during the battle of which he says it was gained with such rapidity that in the second line where i was still by the side of the prince we saw no other enemy than those who were lying on the ground killed and wounded though we were not more than fifty paces behind our first line running always as fast as we could to overtake them  this passage in the chevaliers memoirs places the prince within fifty paces of the heat of the battle a position which would never have been the choice of one unwilling to take a share of its dangers indeed unless the chiefs had complied with the young adventurers proposal to lead the van in person it does not appear that he could have been deeper in the action  note 33  the death of this good christian and gallant man is thus given by his affectionate biographer doctor doddridge from the evidence of eyewitnesses  he continued all night under arms wrapped up in his cloak and generally sheltered under a rick of barley which happened to be in the field about three in the morning he called his domestic servants to him of which there were four in waiting he dismissed three of them with most affectionate christian advice and such solemn charges relating to the performance of their duty and the care of their souls as seemed plainly to intimate that he apprehended it was at least very probable he was taking his last farewell of them there is great reason to believe that he spent the little remainder of the time which could not be much above an hour in those devout exercises of soul which had been so long habitual to him and to which so many circumstances did then concur to call him the army was alarmed by break of day by the noise of the rebels approach and the attack was made before sunrise yet when it was light enough to discern what passed as soon as the enemy came within gunshot they made a furious fire and it is said that the dragoons which constituted the left wing immediately fled the colonel at the beginning of the onset which in the whole lasted but a few minutes received a wound by a bullet in his left breast which made him give a sudden spring in his saddle upon which his servant who led the horse would have persuaded him to retreat but he said it was only a wound in the flesh and fought on though he presently after received a shot in his right thigh in the mean time it was discerned that some of the enemy fell by him and particularly one man who had made him a treacherous visit but a few days before with great professions of zeal for the present establishment  events of this kind pass in less time than the description of them can be written or than it can be read the colonel was for a few moments supported by his men and particularly by that worthy person lieutenantcolonel whitney who was shot through the arm here and a few months after fell nobly at the battle of falkirk and by lieutenant west a man of distinguished bravery as also by about fifteen dragoons who stood by him to the last but after a faint fire the regiment in general was seized with a panic and though their colonel and some other gallant officers did what they could to rally them once or twice they at last took a precipitate flight and just in the moment when colonel gardiner seemed to be making a pause to deliberate what duty required him to do in such circumstances an accident happened which must i think in the judgment of every worthy and generous man be allowed a sufficient apology for exposing his life to so great hazard when his regiment had left him he saw a party of the foot who were then bravely fighting near him and whom he was ordered to support had no officer to head them upon which he said eagerly in the hearing of the person from whom i had this account these brave fellows will be cut to pieces for want of a commander or words to that effect which while he was speaking he rode up to them and cried out fire on my lads and fear nothing but just as the words were out of his mouth a highlander advanced towards him with a scythe fastened to a long pole with which he gave him so dreadful a wound on his right arm that his sword dropped out of his hand and at the same time several others coming about him while he was thus dreadfully entangled with that cruel weapon he was dragged off from his horse the moment he fell another highlander who if the kings evidence at carlisle may be credited as i know not why they should not though the unhappy creature died denying it was one macnaught who was executed about a year after gave him a stroke either with a broadsword or a lochaberaxe for my informant could not exactly distinguish on the hinder part of his head which was the mortal blow all that his faithful attendant saw farther at this time was that as his hat was fallen off he took it in his left hand and waved it as a signal to him to retreat and added what were the last words he ever heard him speak take care of yourself upon which the servant retiredsome remarkable passages in the life of colonel james gardiner by p doddridge dd london 1747 p187  i may remark on this extract that it confirms the account given in the text of the resistance offered by some of the english infantry surprised by a force of a peculiar and unusual description their opposition could not be long or formidable especially as they were deserted by the cavalry and those who undertook to manage the artillery but although the affair was soon decided i have always understood that many of the infantry showed an inclination to do their duty  note 34  it is scarcely necessary to say that the character of this brutal young laird is entirely imaginary a gentleman however who resembled balmawhapple in the article of courage only fell at preston in the manner described a perthshire gentleman of high honour and respectability one of the handful of cavalry who followed the fortunes of charles edward pursued the fugitive dragoons almost alone till near saint clements wells where the efforts of some of the officers had prevailed on a few of them to make a momentary stand perceiving at this moment that they were pursued by only one man and a couple of servants they turned upon him and cut him down with their swords i remember when a child sitting on his grave where the grass long grew rank and green distinguishing it from the rest of the field a female of the family then residing at saint clements wells used to tell me the tragedy of which she had been an eyewitness and showed me in evidence one of the silver clasps of the unfortunate gentlemans waistcoat  note 35  the name of andrea de ferrara is inscribed on all the scottish broadswords which are accounted of peculiar excellence who this artist was what were his fortunes and when he flourished have hitherto defied the research of antiquaries only it is in general believed that andrea de ferrara was a spanish or italian artificer brought over by james iv or v to instruct the scots in the manufacture of sword blades most barbarous nations excel in the fabrication of arms and the scots had attained great proficiency in forging swords so early as the field of pinkie at which period the historian patten describes them as all notably broad and thin universally made to slice and of such exceeding good temper that as i never saw any so good so i think it hard to devise betteraccount of somersets expedition  it may be observed that the best and most genuine andrea ferraras have a crown marked on the blade  note 36  the incident here said to have happened to flora macivor actually befell miss nairne a lady with whom the author had the pleasure of being acquainted as the highland army rushed into edinburgh miss nairne like other ladies who approved of their cause stood waving her handkerchief from a balcony when a ball from a highlanders musket which was discharged by accident grazed her forehead thank god said she the instant she recoveredthat the accident happened to me whose principles are known had it befallen a whig they would have said it was done on purpose  note 37 p 185  the author of waverley has been charged with painting the young adventurer in colours more amiable than his character deserved but having known many individuals who were near his person he has been described according to the light in which those eyewitnesses saw his temper and qualifications something must be allowed no doubt to the natural exaggerations of those who remembered him as the bold and adventurous prince in whose cause they had braved death and ruin but is their evidence to give place entirely to that of a single malcontent  i have already noticed the imputations thrown by the chevalier johnstone on the princes courage but some part at least of that gentlemans tale is purely romantic it would not for instance be supposed that at the time he is favouring us with the highly wrought account of his amour with the adorable peggie the chevalier johnstone was a married man whose grandchild is now alive or that the whole circumstantial story concerning the outrageous vengeance taken by gordon of abbachie on a presbyterian clergyman is entirely apocryphal at the same time it may be admitted that the prince like others of his family did not esteem the services done him by his adherents so highly as he ought educated in high ideas of his hereditary right he has been supposed to have held every exertion and sacrifice made in his cause as too much the duty of the person making it to merit extravagant gratitude on his part dr kings evidence which his leaving the jacobite interest renders somewhat doubtful goes to strengthen this opinion  the ingenious editor of johnstones memoirs has quoted a story said to be told by helvetius stating that prince charles edward far from voluntarily embarking on his daring expedition was literally bound hand and foot and to which he seems disposed to yield credit now it being a fact as well known as any in his history and so far as i know entirely undisputed that the princes personal entreaties and urgency positively forced boisdale and lochiel into insurrection when they were earnestly desirous that he would put off his attempt until he could obtain a sufficient force from france it will be very difficult to reconcile his alleged reluctance to undertake the expedition with his desperately insisting upon carrying the rising into effect against the advice and entreaty of his most powerful and most sage partizans surely a man who had been carried bound on board the vessel which brought him to so desperate an enterprise would have taken the opportunity afforded by the reluctance of his partizans to return to france in safety  it is averred in johnstones memoirs that charles edward left the field of culloden without doing the utmost to dispute the victory and to give the evidence on both sides there is in existence the more trustworthy testimony of lord elcho who states that he himself earnestly exhorted the prince to charge at the head of the left wing which was entire and retrieve the day or die with honour and on his counsel being declined lord elcho took leave of him with a bitter execration swearing he would never look on his face again and kept his word  on the other hand it seems to have been the opinion of almost all the other officers that the day was irretrievably lost one wing of the highlanders being entirely routed the rest of the army outnumbered outflanked and in a condition totally hopeless in this situation of things the irish officers who surrounded charless person interfered to force him off the field a cornet who was close to the prince left a strong attestation that he had seen sir thomas sheridan seize the bridle of his horse and turn him round there is some discrepancy of evidence but the opinion of lord elcho a man of fiery temper and desperate at the ruin which he beheld impending cannot fairly be taken in prejudice of a character for courage which is intimated by the nature of the enterprise itself by the princes eagerness to fight on all occasions by his determination to advance from derby to london and by the presence of mind which he manifested during the romantic perils of his escape the author is far from claiming for this unfortunate person the praise due to splendid talents but he continues to be of opinion that at the period of his enterprise he had a mind capable of facing danger and aspiring to fame  that charles edward had the advantages of a graceful presence courtesy and an address and manner becoming his station the author never heard disputed by any who approached his person nor does he conceive that these qualities are overcharged in the present attempt to sketch his portrait  the following extracts corroborative of the general opinion respecting the princes amiable disposition are taken from a manuscript account of his romantic expedition by james maxwell of kirkconnell of which i possess a copy by the friendship of j menzies esq of pitfoddells the author though partial to the prince whom he faithfully followed seems to have been a fair and candid man and well acquainted with the intrigues among the adventurers council  everybody was mightily taken with the princes figure and personal behaviour there was but one voice about them those whom interest or prejudice made a runaway to his cause could not help acknowledging that they wished him well in all other respects and could hardly blame him for his present undertaking sundry things had concurred to raise his character to the highest pitch besides the greatness of the enterprise and the conduct that had hitherto appeared in the execution of it  there were several instances of good nature and humanity that had made a great impression on peoples minds i shall confine myself to two or three  immediately after the battle as the prince was riding along the ground that copes army had occupied a few minutes before one of the officers came up to congratulate him and said pointing to the killed sir there are your enemies at your feet the prince far from exulting expressed a great deal of compassion for his fathers deluded subjects whom he declared he was heartily sorry to see in that posture  next day while the prince was at pinkie house a citizen of edinburgh came to make some representation to secretary murray about the tents that city was ordered to furnish against a certain day murray happened to be out of the way which the prince hearing of called to have the gentleman brought to him saying he would rather despatch the business whatever it was himself than have the gentleman wait which he did by granting everything that was asked so much affability in a young prince flushed with victory drew encomiums even from his enemies  but what gave the people the highest idea of him was the negative he gave to a thing that very nearly concerned his interest and upon which the success of his enterprise perhaps depended it was proposed to send one of the prisoners to london to demand of that court a cartel for the exchange of prisoners taken and to be taken during this war and to intimate that a refusal would be looked upon as a resolution on their part to give no quarter it was visible a cartel would be of great advantage to the princes affairs his friends would be more ready to declare for him if they had nothing to fear but the chance of war in the field and if the court of london refused to settle a cartel the prince was authorised to treat his prisoners in the same manner the elector of hanover was determined to treat such of the princes friends as might fall into his hands it was urged that a few examples would compel the court of london to comply it was to be presumed that the officers of the english army would make a point of it they had never engaged in the service but upon such terms as are in use among all civilised nations and it could be no stain upon their honour to lay down their commissions if these terms were not observed and that owing to the obstinacy of their own prince though this scheme was plausible and represented as very important the prince could never be brought into it it was below him he said to make empty threats and he would never put such as those into execution he would never in cold blood take away lives which he had saved in heat of action at the peril of his own these were not the only proofs of good nature the prince gave about this time every day produced something new of this kind these things softened the rigour of a military government which was only imputed to the necessity of his affairs and which he endeavoured to make as gentle and easy as possible  it has been said that the prince sometimes exacted more state and ceremonial than seemed to suit his condition but on the other hand some strictness of etiquette was altogether indispensable where he must otherwise have been exposed to general intrusion he could also endure with a good grace the retorts which his affectation of ceremony sometimes exposed him to it is said for example that grant of glenmoriston having made a hasty march to join charles at the head of his clan rushed into the princes presence at holyrood with unceremonious haste without having attended to the duties of the toilet the prince received him kindly but not without a hint that a previous interview with the barber might not have been wholly unnecessary it is not beardless boys answered the displeased chief who are to do your royal highnesss turn the chevalier took the rebuke in good part  on the whole if prince charles had concluded his life soon after his miraculous escape his character in history must have stood very high as it was his station is amongst those a certain brilliant portion of whose life forms a remarkable contrast to all which precedes and all which follows it  note 38  the following account of the skirmish at clifton is extracted from the manuscript memoirs of evan macpherson of cluny chief of the clan macpherson who had the merit of supporting the principal brunt of that spirited affair the memoirs appear to have been composed about 1755 only ten years after the action had taken place they were written in france where that gallant chief resided in exile which accounts for some gallicisms which occur in the narrative  in the princes return from derby back towards scotland my lord george murray lieutenantgeneral cheerfully chargd himself with the command of the rear a post which altho honourable was attended with great danger many difficulties and no small fatigue for the prince being apprehensive that his retreat to scotland might be cut off by marischall wade who lay to the northward of him with an armie much superior to what hrh had while the duke of comberland with his whole cavalrie followed hard in the rear was obliged to hasten his marches it was not therefore possible for the artilirie to march so fast as the princes army in the depth of winter extremely bad weather and the worst roads in england so lord george murray was obliged often to continue his marches long after it was dark almost every night while at the same time he had frequent alarms and disturbances from the duke of comberlands advancd parties  towards the evening of the twentieeight december 1745 the prince entered the town of penrith in the province of comberland but as lord george murray could not bring up the artilirie so fast as he woud have wishd he was obligd to pass the night six miles short of that town together with the regiment of macdonel of glengarrie which that day happened to have the arrear guard the prince in order to refresh his armie and to give my lord george and the artilirie time to come up resolved to sejour the 29th at penrith so ordered his little army to appear in the morning under arms in order to be reviewed and to know in what manner the numbers stood from his haveing entered england it did not at that time amount to 5000 foot in all with about 400 cavalrie composd of the noblesse who servd as volunteers part of whom formd a first troop of guards for the prince under the command of my lord elchoe now comte de weems who being proscribed is presently in france another part formed a second troup of guards under the command of my lord balmirino who was beheaded at the tower of london a third part servd under my lord le comte de kilmarnock who was likewise beheaded at the tower a fourth part servd under my lord pitsligow who is also proscribed which cavalrie tho very few in numbers being all noblesse were very brave and of infinite advantage to the foot not only in the day of battle but in serving as advanced guards on the several marches and in patroling dureing the night on the different roads which led towards the towns where the army happened to quarter  while this small army was out in a body on the 20th december upon a riseing ground to the northward of penrith passing review mons de cluny with his tribe was ordered to the bridge of clifton about a mile to southward of penrith after having passd in review before mons pattullo who was charged with the inspection of the troops and was likeways quartermastergeneral of the army and is now in france they remained under arms at the bridge waiting the arrival of my lord george murray with the artilirie whom mons de cluny had orders to cover in passing the bridge they arrived about sunset closly pursued by the duke of comberland with the whole body of his cavalrie reckoned upwards of 3000 strong about a thousand of whom as near as might be computed dismounted in order to cut off the passage of the artilirie towards the bridge while the duke and the others remained on horseback in order to attack the rear  my lord george murray advanced and although he found mons de cluny and his tribe in good spirits under arms yet the circumstance appeard extremely delicate the numbers were vastly unequall and the attack seemd very dangerous so my lord george declind giving orders to such time as he askd mons de clunys opinion i will attack them with all my heart says mons de cluny if you order me i do order it then answered my lord george and immediately went on himself along with mons de cluny and fought sword in hand on foot at the head of the single tribe of macphersons they in a moment made their way through a strong hedge of thorns under the cover whereof the cavalrie had taken their station in the struggle of passing which hedge my lord george murray being dressed en montagnard as all the army were lost his bonet and wig so continued to fight bareheaded during the action they at first made a brisk discharge of their firearms on the enemy then attacked them with their sabres and made a great slaughter a considerable time which obliged comberland and his cavalrie to fly with precipitation and in great confusion in so much that if the prince had been provided in a sufficient number of cavalrie to have taken advantage of the disorder it is beyond question that the duke of comberland and the bulk of his cavalrie had been taken prisoners  by this time it was so dark that it was not possible to view or number the slain who filled all the ditches which happened to be on the ground where they stood but it was computed that besides those who went off wounded upwards of a hundred at least were left on the spot among whom was colonel honywood who commanded the dismounted cavalrie whose sabre of considerable value mons de cluny brought off and still preserves and his tribe lykeways brought off many armsthe colonel was afterwards taken up and his wounds being dressd with great difficultie recovered mons de cluny lost only in the action twelve men of whom some haveing been only wounded fell afterwards into the hands of the enemy and were sent as slaves to america whence several of them returned and one of them is now in france a sergeant in the regiment of royal scots how soon the accounts of the enemies approach had reached the prince hrh had immediately ordered milord le comte de nairne brigadier who being proscribed is now in france with the three batalions of the duke of athol the batalion of the duke of perth and some other troups under his command in order to support cluny and to bring off the artilirie but the action was entirely over before the comte de nairne with his command coud reach nigh to the place they therefore returnd all to penrith and the artilirie marched up in good order  nor did the duke of comberland ever afterwards dare to come within a days march of the prince and his army dureing the course of all that retreat which was conducted with great prudence and safety when in some manner surrounded by enemies  note 39  as the heathen deities contracted an indelible obligation if they swore by styx the scottish highlanders had usually some peculiar solemnity attached to an oath which they intended should be binding on them very frequently it consisted in laying their hand as they swore on their own drawn dirk which dagger becoming a party to the transaction was invoked to punish any breach of faith but by whatever ritual the oath was sanctioned the party was extremely desirous to keep secret what the especial oath was which he considered as irrevocable this was a matter of great convenience as he felt no scruple in breaking his asseveration when made in any other form than that which he accounted as peculiarly solemn and therefore readily granted any engagement which bound him no longer than he inclined whereas if the oath which he accounted inviolable was once publicly known no party with whom he might have occasion to contract would have rested satisfied with any other  louis xi of france practised the same sophistry for he also had a peculiar species of oath the only one which he was ever known to respect and which therefore he was very unwilling to pledge the only engagement which that wily tyrant accounted binding upon him was an oath by the holy cross of saint lo dangers which contained a portion of the true cross if he prevaricated after taking this oath louis believed he should die within the year the constable saint paul being invited to a personal conference with louis refused to meet the king unless he would agree to ensure him safe conduct under sanction of this oath but says comines the king replied he would never again pledge that engagement to mortal man though he was willing to take any other oath which could be devised the treaty broke oft therefore after much chaffering concerning the nature of the vow which louis was to take such is the difference between the dictates of superstition and those of conscience     glossaryvolume ii  a all  aboon abune above
