5385082	sketches and studies  by  nathaniel hawthorne    contents   life of franklin pierce  chiefly about war matters  alice doanes appeal  the ancestral footstep      life of franklin pierce   preface  the author of this memoirbeing so little of a politician that he scarcely feels entitled to call himself a member of any partywould not voluntarily have undertaken the work here offered to the public  neither can he flatter himself that he has been remarkably successful in the performance of his task viewing it in the light of a political biography and as a representation of the principles and acts of a public man intended to operate upon the minds of multitudes during a presidential canvass  this species of writing is too remote from his customary occupationsand he may add from his tastesto be very satisfactorily done without more time and practice than he would be willing to expend for such a purpose  if this little biography have any value it is probably of another kindas the narrative of one who knew the individual of whom he treats at a period of life when character could be read with undoubting accuracy and who consequently in judging of the motives of his subsequent conduct has an advantage over much more competent observers whose knowledge of the man may have commenced at a later date  nor can it be considered improper at least the author will never feel it so although some foolish delicacy be sacrificed in the undertaking that when a friend dear to him almost from boyish days stands up before his country misrepresented by indiscriminate abuse on the one hand and by aimless praise on the other he should be sketched by one who has had opportunities of knowing him well and who is certainly inclined to tell the truth  it is perhaps right to say that while this biography is so far sanctioned by general pierce as it comprises a generally correct narrative of the principal events of his life the author does not understand him as thereby necessarily indorsing all the sentiments put forth by himself in the progress of the work  these are the authors own speculations upon the facts before him and may or may not be in accordance with the ideas of the individual whose life he writes  that individuals opinions howeverso far as it is necessary to know them may be read in his straightforward and consistent deeds with more certainty than those of almost any other man now before the public  the author while collecting his materials has received liberal aid from all manner of peoplewhigs and democrats congressmen astute lawyers grim old generals of militia and gallant young officers of the mexican warmost of whom however he must needs say have rather abounded in eulogy of general pierce than in such anecdotical matter as is calculated for a biography  among the gentlemen to whom he is substantially indebted he would mention hon c g atherton hon s h ayer hon joseph hall chief justice gilchrist isaac o barnes esq col t j whipple and mr c j smith  he has likewise derived much assistance from an able and accurate sketch that originally appeared in the boston post and was drawn up as he believes by the junior editor of that journal  concord mass august 27 1852     chapter i  his parentage and early life   franklin pierce was born at hillsborough in the state of new hampshire on the 23d of november 1804  his native county at the period of his birth covered a much more extensive territory than at present and might reckon among its children many memorable men and some illustrious ones general stark the hero of bennington daniel webster levi woodbury jeremiah smith the eminent jurist and governor of the state general james miller general mcneil senator atherton were natives of old hillsborough county  general benjamin pierce the father of franklin was one of the earliest settlers in the town of hillsborough and contributed as much as any other man to the growth and prosperity of the county  he was born in 1757 at chelmsford now lowell in massachusetts  losing his parents early he grew up under the care of an uncle amid such circumstances of simple fare hard labor and scanty education as usually fell to the lot of a new england yeomans family some eighty or a hundred years ago  on the 19th of april 1775 being then less than eighteen years of age the stripling was at the plough when tidings reached him of the bloodshed at lexington and concord  he immediately loosened the ox chain left the plough in the furrow took his uncles gun and equipments and set forth towards the scene of action  from that day for more than seven years he never saw his native place  he enlisted in the army was present at the battle of bunker hill and after serving through the whole revolutionary war and fighting his way upward from the lowest grade returned at last a thorough soldier and commander of a company  he was retained in the army as long as that body of veterans had a united existence and being finally disbanded at west point in 1784 was left with no other reward for nine years of toil and danger than the nominal amount of his pay in the continental currencythen so depreciated as to be almost worthless  in 1780 being employed as agent to explore a tract of wild land he purchased a lot of fifty acres in what is now the town of hillsborough in the spring of the succeeding year he built himself a log hut and began the clearing and cultivation of his tract  another year beheld him married to his first wife elizabeth andrews who died within a twelvemonth after their union leaving a daughter the present widow of general john mcneil  in 1789 he married anna kendrick with whom he lived about half a century and who bore him eight children of whom franklin was the sixth  although the revolutionary soldier had thus betaken himself to the wilderness for a subsistence his professional merits were not forgotten by those who had witnessed his military career  as early as 1786 he was appointed brigade major of the militia of hillsborough county then first organized and formed into a brigade  and it was a still stronger testimonial to his character as a soldier that nearly fifteen years afterwards during the presidency of john adams he was offered a high command in the northern division of the army which was proposed to be levied in anticipation of a war with the french republic  inflexibly democratic in his political faith however major pierce refused to be implicated in a policy which he could not approve  no gentlemen said he to the delegates who urged his acceptance of the commission poor as i am and acceptable as would be the position under other circumstances i would sooner go to yonder mountains dig me a cave and live on roast potatoes than be instrumental in promoting the objects for which that army is to be raised  this same fidelity to his principles marked every public as well as private action of his life  in his own neighborhood among those who knew him best he early gained an influence that was never lost nor diminished but continued to spread wider during the whole of his long life  in 1789 he was elected to the state legislature and retained that position for thirteen successive years until chosen a member of the council  during the same period he was active in his military duties as a field officer and finally general of the militia of the county and miller mcneil and others learned of him in this capacity the soldierlike discipline which was afterwards displayed on the battlefields of the northern frontier  the history character and circumstances of general benjamin pierce though here but briefly touched upon are essential parts of the biography of his son both as indicating some of the native traits which the latter has inherited and as showing the influences amid which he grew up  at franklin pierces birth and for many years subsequent his father was the most active and publicspirited man within his sphere a most decided democrat and supporter of jefferson and madison a practical farmer moreover not rich but independent exercising a liberal hospitality and noted for the kindness and generosity of his character a man of the people but whose natural qualities inevitably made him a leader among them  from infancy upward the boy had before his eyes as the model on which he might instinctively form himself one of the best specimens of sterling new england character developed in a life of simple habits yet of elevated action  patriotism such as it had been in revolutionary days was taught him by his father as early as his mother taught him religion  he became early imbued too with the military spirit which the old soldier had retained from his long service and which was kept active by the constant alarms and warlike preparations of the first twelve years of the present century  if any man is bound by birth and youthful training to show himself a brave faithful and able citizen of his native country it is the son of such a father  at the commencement of the war of 1812 franklin pierce was a few months under eight years of age  the old general his father sent two of his sons into the army and as his eldest daughter was soon afterwards married to major mcneil there were few families that had so large a personal stake in the war as that of general benjamin pierce  he himself both in his public capacity as a member of the council and by his great local influence in his own county lent a strenuous support to the national administration  it is attributable to his sagacity and energy that new hampshirethen under a federal governorwas saved the disgrace of participation in the questionable if not treasonable projects of the hartford convention  he identified himself with the cause of the country and was doubtless as thoroughly alive with patriotic zeal at this eventful period as in the old days of bunker hill and saratoga and yorktown  the general not only took a prominent part at all public meetings but was ever ready for the informal discussion of political affairs at all places of casual resort wherein accordance with the custom of the time and countrythe minds of men were made to operate effectually upon each other  franklin pierce was a frequent auditor of these controversies  the intentness with which he watched the old general and listened to his arguments is still remembered and at this day in his most earnest moods there are gesticulations and movements that bring up the image of his father to those who recollect the latter on those occasions of the display of homely native eloquence  no mode of education could be conceived better adapted to imbue a youth with the principles and sentiment of democratic institutions it brought him into the most familiar contact with the popular mind and made his own mind a part of it  franklins father had felt through life the disadvantages of a defective education although in his peculiar sphere of action it might be doubted whether he did not gain more than he lost by being thrown on his own resources and compelled to study men and their actual affairs rather than books  but he determined to afford his son all the opportunities of improvement which he himself had lacked  franklin accordingly was early sent to the academy at hancock and afterwards to that of francestown where he was received into the family of general pierces old and steadfast friend peter woodbury father of the late eminent judge  it is scarcely more than a year ago at the semicentennial celebration of the academy that franklin pierce the mature and distinguished man paid a beautiful tribute to the character of madam woodbury in affectionate remembrance of the motherly kindness experienced at her hands by the schoolboy  the old people of his neighborhood give a very delightful picture of franklin at this early age  they describe him as a beautiful boy with blue eyes light curling hair and a sweet expression of face  the traits presented of him indicate moral symmetry kindliness and a delicate texture of sentiment rather than marked prominences of character  his instructors testify to his propriety of conduct his fellowpupils to his sweetness of disposition and cordial sympathy  one of the latter being older than most of his companions and less advanced in his studies found it difficult to keep up with his class and he remembers how perseveringly while the other boys were at play franklin spent the noon recess for many weeks together in aiding him in his lessons  these attributes proper to a generous and affectionate nature have remained with him through life  lending their color to his deportment and softening his manners they are perhaps even now the characteristics by which most of those who casually meet him would be inclined to identify the man  but there are other qualities not then developed but which have subsequently attained a firm and manly growth and are recognized as his leading traits among those who really know him franklin pierces development indeed has always been the reverse of premature the boy did not show the germ of all that was in the man nor perhaps did the young man adequately foreshow the mature one  in 1820 at the age of sixteen he became a student of bowdoin college at brunswick maine  it was in the autumn of the next year that the author of this memoir entered the class below him but our college reminiscences however interesting to the parties concerned are not exactly the material for a biography  he was then a youth with the boy and man in him vivacious mirthful slender of a fair complexion with light hair that had a curl in it his bright and cheerful aspect made a kind of sunshine both as regarded its radiance and its warmth insomuch that no shyness of disposition in his associates could well resist its influence  we soon became acquainted and were more especially drawn together as members of the same college society  there were two of these institutions dividing the college between them and typifying respectively and with singular accuracy of feature the respectable conservative and the progressive or democratic parties  pierces native tendencies inevitably drew him to the latter  his chum was zenas caldwell several years older than himself a member of the methodist persuasion a pureminded studious devoutly religious character endowed thus early in life with the authority of a grave and sagacious turn of mind  the friendship between pierce and him appeared to be mutually strong and was of itself a pledge of correct deportment in the former  his chief friend i think was a classmate named little a young man of most estimable qualities and high intellectual promise one of those fortunate characters whom an early death so canonizes in the remembrance of their companions that the perfect fulfilment of a long life would scarcely give them a higher place  jonathan cilley of my own classwhose untimely fate is still mournfully remembereda person of very marked ability and great social influence was another of pierces friends  all these have long been dead  there are others still alive who would meet franklin pierce at this day with as warm a pressure of the hand and the same confidence in his kindly feelings as when they parted from him nearly thirty years ago  pierces class was small but composed of individuals seriously intent on the duties and studies of their college life  they were not boys but for the most part well advanced towards maturity and having wrought out their own means of education were little inclined to neglect the opportunities that had been won at so much cost  they knew the value of time and had a sense of the responsibilities of their position  their first scholarthe present professor stowehas long since established his rank among the first scholars of the country  it could have been no easy task to hold successful rivalry with students so much in earnest as these were  during the earlier part of his college course it may be doubted whether pierce was distinguished for scholarship  but for the last two years he appeared to grow more intent on the business in hand and without losing any of his vivacious qualities as a companion was evidently resolved to gain an honorable elevation in his class  his habits of attention and obedience to college discipline were of the strictest character he rose progressively in scholarship and took a highly creditable degree  see note at close of this life  the first civil office i imagine which franklin pierce ever held was that of chairman of the standing committee of the athenaean society of which as above hinted we were both members and having myself held a place on the committee i can bear testimony to his having discharged not only his own share of the duties but that of his colleagues  i remember likewise that the only military service of my life was as a private soldier in a college company of which pierce was one of the officers  he entered into this latter business or pastime with an earnestness with which i could not pretend to compete and at which perhaps he would now be inclined to smile  his slender and youthful figure rises before my minds eye at this moment with the air and step of a veteran of the school of steuben as well became the son of a revolutionary hero who had probably drilled under the old barons orders  indeed at this time and for some years afterwards pierces ambition seemed to be of a military cast  until reflection had tempered his first predilections and other varieties of success had rewarded his efforts he would have preferred i believe the honors of the battlefield to any laurels more peacefully won  and it was remarkable how with all the invariable gentleness of his demeanor he perfectly gave nevertheless the impression of a high and fearless spirit  his friends were as sure of his courage while yet untried as now when it has been displayed so brilliantly in famous battles  at this early period of his life he was distinguished by the same fascination of manner that has since proved so magical in winning him an unbounded personal popularity  it is wronging him however to call this peculiarity a mere effect of manner its source lies deep in the kindliness of his nature and in the liberal generous catholic sympathy that embraces all who are worthy of it  few men possess any thing like it so irresistible as it is so sure to draw forth an undoubting confidence and so true to the promise which it gives  this frankness this democracy of good feeling has not been chilled by the society of politicians nor polished down into mere courtesy by his intercourse with the most refined men of the day  it belongs to him at this moment and will never leave him  a little while ago after his return from mexico he darted across the street to exchange a hearty gripe of the hand with a rough countryman upon his carta man who used to live with his father as the general explained the matter to his companions  other men assume this manner more or less skilfully but with frank pierce it is an innate characteristic nor will it ever lose its charm unless his heart should grow narrower and coldera misfortune not to be anticipated even in the dangerous atmosphere of elevated rank whither he seems destined to ascend  there is little else that it is worth while to relate as regards his college course unless it be that during one of his winter vacations pierce taught a country school  so many of the statesmen of new england have performed their first public service in the character of pedagogue that it seems almost a necessary step on the ladder of advancement     chapter ii  his services in the state and national legislatures   after leaving college in the year 1824 franklin pierce returned to hillsborough  his father now in a green old age continued to take a prominent part in the affairs of the day but likewise made his declining years rich and picturesque with recollections of the heroic times through which he had lived  on the 26th of december 1825 it being his sixtyseventh birthday general benjamin pierce prepared a festival for his comrades in arms the survivors of the revolution eighteen of whom all inhabitants of hillsborough assembled at his house  the ages of these veterans ranged from fiftynine up to the patriarchal venerableness of nearly ninety  they spent the day in festivity in calling up reminiscences of the great men whom they had known and the great deeds which they had helped to do and in reviving the old sentiments of the era of seventysix  at nightfall after a manly and pathetic farewell from their host they separatedprepared as the old general expressed it at the first tap of the shrouded drum to move and join their beloved washington and the rest of their beloved comrades who fought and bled at their sides  a scene like this must have been profitable for a young man to witness as being likely to give him a stronger sense than most of us can attain of the value of that union which these old heroes had risked so much to consolidateof that common country which they had sacrificed everything to create and patriotism must have been communicated from their hearts to his with somewhat of the warmth and freshness of a newborn sentiment  no youth was ever more fortunate than franklin pierce through the whole of his early life in this most desirable species of moral education  having chosen the law as a profession franklin became a student in the office of judge woodbury of portsmouth  allusion has already been made to the friendship between general benjamin pierce and peter woodbury the father of the judge  the early progress of levi woodbury towards eminence had been facilitated by the powerful influence of his fathers friend  it was a worthy and honorable kind of patronage and bestowed only as the great abilities of the recipient vindicated his claim to it few young men have met with such early success in life or have deserved it so eminently as did judge woodbury  at the age of twentyseven he was appointed to the bench of the supreme court of the state on the earnest recommendation of old general pierce  the opponents of the measure ridiculed him as the baby judge but his conduct in that high office showed the prescient judgment of the friend who had known him from a child and had seen in his young manhood already the wisdom of ripened age  it was some years afterwards when franklin pierce entered the office of judge woodbury as a student  in the interval the judge had been elected governor and after a term of office that thoroughly tested the integrity of his democratic principles had lost his second election and returned to the profession of the law  the last two years of pierces preparatory studies were spent at the law school of northampton in massachusetts and in the office of judge parker at amherst  in 1827 being admitted to the bar he began the practice of his profession at hillsborough  it is an interesting fact considered in reference to his subsequent splendid career as an advocate that he did not at the outset give promise of distinguished success his first case was a failure and perhaps a somewhat marked one  but it is remembered that this defeat however mortifying at the moment did but serve to make him aware of the latent resources of his mind the full command of which he was far from having yet attained  to a friend an older practitioner who addressed him with some expression of condolence and encouragement pierce repliedand it was a kind of selfassertion which no triumph would have drawn oati do not need that  i will try nine hundred and ninetynine cases if clients will continue to trust me and if i fail just as i have today will try the thousandth  i shall live to argue cases in this court house in a manner that will mortify neither myself nor my friends  it is in such moments of defeat that character and ability are mot fairly tested they would irremediably crush a youth devoid of real energy and being neither more nor less than his just desert would be accepted as such  but a failure of this kind serves an opposite purpose to a mind in which the strongest and richest qualities lie deep and from their very size and mass cannot at once be rendered available  it provokes an innate selfconfidence while at the same time it sternly indicates the sedulous cultivation the earnest effort the toil the agony which are the conditions of ultimate success  it is indeed one of the best modes of discipline that experience can administer and may reasonably be counted a fortunate event in the life of a young man vigorous enough to overcome the momentary depression  pierces distinction at the bar however did not immediately follow nor did he acquire what we may designate as positive eminence until some years after this period  the enticements of political lifeso especially fascinating to a young lawyer but so irregular in its tendencies and so inimical to steady professional laborhad begun to operate upon him  his fathers prominent position in the politics of the state made it almost impossible that the son should stand aloof  in 1827 the same year when franklin began the practice of the law general benjamin pierce had been elected governor of new hampshire  he was defeated in the election of 1828 but was again successful in that of the subsequent year  during these years the contest for the presidency had been fought with a fervor that drew almost everybody into it on one side or the other and had terminated in the triumph of andrew jackson franklin pierce in advance of his fathers decision though not in opposition to it had declared himself for the illustrious man whose military renown was destined to be thrown into the shade by a civil administration the most splendid and powerful that ever adorned the annals of our country i love to record of the subject of this memoir that his first political faith was pledged to that great leader of the democracy  i remember meeting pierce about this period and catching from him some faint reflection of the zeal with which he was now stepping into the political arena  my sympathies and opinions it is trueso far as i had any in public affairshad from the first been enlisted on the same side with his own  but i was now made strongly sensible of an increased development of my friends mind by means of which he possessed a vastly greater power than heretofore over the minds with which he came in contact  this progressive growth has continued to be one of his remarkable characteristics  of most men you early know the mental gauge and measurement and do not subsequently have much occasion to change it not so with pierce his tendency was not merely high but towards a point which rose higher and higher as the aspirant tended upward  since we parted studious days had educated him life too and his own exertions in it and his native habit of close and accurate observation had likewise begun to educate him  the town of hillsborough in 1829 gave franklin pierce his first public honor by electing him its representative in the legislature of the state  his whole service in that body comprised four years in the two latter of which he was elected speaker by a vote of one hundred and fiftyfive against fiftyeight for other candidates  this overpowering majority evinced the confidence which his character inspired and which during his whole career it has invariably commanded in advance of what might be termed positive proof although the result has never failed to justify it  i still recollect his description of the feelings with which he entered on his arduous dutiesthe feverish night that preceded his taking the chairthe doubt the struggle with himselfall ending in perfect calmness full selfpossession and free power of action when the crisis actually came  he had all the natural gifts that adapted him for the post courtesy firmness quickness and accuracy of judgment and a clearness of mental perception that brought its own regularity into the scene of confused and entangled debate and to these qualities he added whatever was to be attained by laborious study of parliamentary rules  his merit as a presiding officer was universally acknowledged  it is rare that a man combines so much impulse with so great a power of regulating the impulses of himself and others as franklin pierce  the faculty here exercised and improved of controlling an assembly while agitated by tumultuous controversy was afterwards called into play upon a higher field for during his congressional service pierce was often summoned to preside in committee of the whole when a turbulent debate was expected to demand peculiar energy in the chair  he was elected a member of congress in 1833 being young for the station as he has always been for every public station that he has filled  a different kind of mana man conscious that accident alone had elevated him and therefore nervously anxious to prove himself equal to his fortuneswould thus have been impelled to spasmodic efforts  he would have thrust himself forward in debate taking the word out of the mouths of renowned orators and thereby winning notoriety as at least the glittering counterfeit of true celebrity  had pierce with his genuine ability practised this course had he possessed even an ordinary love of display and had he acted upon it with his inherent tact and skill taking advantage of fair occasions to prove the power and substance that were in him it would greatly have facilitated the task of his biographer  to aim at personal distinction however as an object independent of the public service would have been contrary to all the foregone and subsequent manifestations of his life  he was never wanting to the occasion but he waited for the occasion to bring him inevitably forward when he spoke it was not only because he was fully master of the subject but because the exigency demanded him and because no other and older man could perform the same duty as well as himself  of the copious eloquenceand some of it no doubt of a high orderwhich buncombe has called forth not a paragraph nor a period is attributable to franklin pierce  he had no need of these devices to fortify his constituents in their high opinion of him nor did he fail to perceive that such was not the method to acquire real weight in the body of which he was a member in truth he has no fluency of words except when an earnest meaning and purpose supply their own expression  every one of his speeches in congress and we may say in every other hall of oratory or on any stump that he may have mounted was drawn forth by the perception that it was needed was directed to a full exposition of the subject and rarest of all was limited by what he really had to say  even the graces of the orator were never elaborated never assumed for their own sake but were legitimately derived from the force of his conceptions and from the impulsive warmth which accompanies the glow of thought  owing to these peculiaritiesfor such unfortunately they may be termed in reference to what are usually the characteristics of a legislative careerhis position before the country was less conspicuous than that of many men who could claim nothing like pierces actual influence in the national councils  his speeches in their muscular texture and close grasp of their subject resembled the brief but pregnant arguments and expositions of the sages of the continental congress rather than the immeasurable harangues which are now the order of the day  his congressional life though it made comparatively so little show was full of labor directed to substantial objects  he was a member of the judiciary and other important committees and the drudgery of the committee room where so much of the real public business of the country is transacted fell in large measure to his lot  thus even as a legislator he may be said to have been a man of deeds not words and when he spoke upon any subject with which his duty as chairman or member of a committee had brought him in relation his words had the weight of deeds from the meaning the directness and the truth that he conveyed into them  his merits made themselves known and felt in the sphere where they were exercised and he was early appreciated by one who seldom erred in his estimate of men whether in their moral or intellectual aspect his intercourse with president jackson was frequent and free and marked by friendly regard on the part of the latter  in the stormiest periods of his administration pierce came frankly to his aid  the confidence then established was never lost and when jackson was on his deathbed being visited by a gentleman from the north himself formerly a democratic member of congress the old hero spoke with energy of franklin pierces ability and patriotism and remarked as with prophetic foresight of his young friends destiny that the interests of the country would be safe in such hands  one of president jacksons measures which had pierces approval and support was his veto of the maysville road bill  this bill was part of a system of vast public works principally railroads and canals which it was proposed to undertake at the expense of the national treasurya policy not then of recent origin but which had been fostered by john quincy adams and had attained a gigantic growth at the close of his presidency  the estimate of works undertaken or projected at the commencement of jacksons administration amounted to considerably more than a hundred millions of dollars  the expenditure of this enormous sum and doubtless other incalculable amounts in progressive increase was to be for purposes often of unascertained utility and was to pass through the agents and officers of the federal governmenta means of political corruption not safely to be trusted even in the purest hands the peril to the individuality of the states from a system tending so directly to consolidate the powers of government towards a common centre was obvious  the result might have been with the lapse of time and the increased activity of the disease to place the capital of our federative union in a position resembling that of imperial rome where each once independent state was a subject province and all the highways of the world were said to meet in her forum  it was against this system so dangerous to liberty and to public and private integrity that jackson declared war by the famous maysville veto  it would be an absurd interpretation of pierces course in regard to this and similar measures to suppose him hostile either to internal or coastwise improvements so far as they may legitimately be the business of the general government  he was aware of the immense importance of our internal commerce and was ever ready to vote such appropriations as might be necessary for promoting it when asked for in an honest spirit and at points where they were really needed  he doubted indeed the constitutional power of congress to undertake by building roads through the wilderness or opening unfrequented rivers to create commerce where it did not yet exist but he never denied or questioned the right and duty to remove obstructions in the way of inland trade and to afford it every facility when the nature and necessity of things had brought it into genuine existence  and he agreed with the best and wisest statesmen in believing that this distinction involved the true principle on which legislation for the purpose here discussed should proceed  while a member of the house of representatives he delivered a forcible speech against the bill authorizing appropriations for the military academy at west point  he was decidedly opposed to that institution as then and at present organized  we allude to the subject in illustration of the generous frankness with which years afterwards when the battle smoke of mexico had baptized him also a soldier he acknowledged himself in the wrong and bore testimony to the brilliant services which the graduates of the academy trained to soldiership from boyhood had rendered to their country  and if he has made no other such acknowledgment of past error committed in his legislative capacity it is but fair to believe that it is because his reason and conscience accuse him of no other wrong  it was while in the lower house of congress that franklin pierce took that stand on the slavery question from which he has never since swerved a hairs breadth  he fully recognized by his votes and by his voice the rights pledged to the south by the constitution  this at the period when he so declared himself was comparatively an easy thing to do  but when it became more difficult when the first imperceptible movement of agitation had grown to be almost a convulsion his course was still the same  nor did he ever shun the obloquy that sometimes threatened to pursue the northern man who dared to love that great and sacred reality his whole united native countrybetter than the mistiness of a philanthropic theory  he continued in the house of representatives four years  if at this period of his life he rendered unobtrusive though not unimportant services to the public it must also have been a time of vast intellectual advantage to himself  amidst great national affairs he was acquiring the best of all educations for future eminence and leadership in the midst of statesmen he grew to be a statesman  studious as all his speeches prove him to be of history he beheld it demonstrating itself before his eyes  as regards this sort of training much of its good or ill effect depends on the natural force and depth of the man many no doubt by early mixture with politics become the mere politicians of the momenta class of men sufficiently abundant among usacquiring only a knack and cunning which guide them tolerably well through immediate difficulties without instructing them in the great rules of higher policy  but when the actual observation of public measures goes hand in hand with study when the mind is capable of comparing the present with its analogies in the past and of grasping the principle that belongs to both this is to have history for a living tutor  if the student be fit for such instruction he will be seen to act afterwards with the elevation of a high ideal and with the expediency the sagacity the instinct of what is fit and practicable which make the advantage of the man of actual affairs over the mere theorist  and it was another advantage of his being brought early into the sphere of national interests and continuing there for a series of years that it enabled him to overcome any narrow and sectional prejudices  without loving new england less he loved the broad area of the country more  he thus retained that equal sentiment of patriotism for the whole land with which his father had imbued him and which is perhaps apt to be impaired in the hearts of those who come late to the national legislature after long training in the narrower fields of the separate states  his sense of the value of the union which had been taught him at the fireside from earliest infancy by the stories of patriotic valor that he there heard was now strengthened by friendly association with its representatives from every quarter  it is this youthful sentiment of americanism so happily developed by after circumstances that we see operating through all his public life and making him as tender of what he considers due to the south as of the rights of his own land of hills  franklin pierce had scarcely reached the legal age for such elevation when in 1837 he was elected to the senate of the united states  he took his seat at the commencement of the presidency of mr van buren never before nor since has the senate been more venerable for the array of veteran and celebrated statesmen than at that time  calhoun webster and clay had lost nothing of their intellectual might  benton silas wright woodbury buchanan and walker were members and many even of the less eminent names were such as have gained historic placemen of powerful eloquence and worthy to be leaders of the respective parties which they espoused  to this dignified body composed of individuals some of whom were older in political experience than he in his mortal life pierce came as the youngest member of the senate  with his usual tact and exquisite sense of propriety he saw that it was not the time for him to step forward prominently on this highest theatre in the land he beheld these great combatants doing battle before the eyes of the nation and engrossing its whole regards  there was hardly an avenue to reputation save what was occupied by one or another of those gigantic figures  modes of public service remained however requiring high ability but with which few men of competent endowments would have been content to occupy themselves  pierce had already demonstrated the possibility of obtaining an enviable position among his associates without the windy notoriety which a member of congress may readily manufacture for himself by the lavish expenditure of breath that had been better spared  in the more elevated field of the senate he pursued the same course as while a representative and with more than equal results  among other committees he was a member of that upon revolutionary pensions  of this subject he made himself thoroughly master and was recognized by the senate as an unquestionable authority  in 1840 in reference to several bills for the relief of claimants under the pension law he delivered a speech which finely illustrates as well the sympathies as the justice of the man showing how vividly he could feel and at the same time how powerless were his feelings to turn him aside from the strict line of public integrity  the merits and sacrifices of the people of the revolution have never been stated with more earnest gratitude than in the following passage  i am not insensible mr president of the advantages with which claims of this character always come before congress  they are supposed to be based on services for which no man entertains a higher estimate than myselfservices beyond all praise and above all price  but while warm and glowing with the glorious recollections which a recurrence to that period of our history can never fail to awaken while we cherish with emotions of pride reverence and affection the memory of those brave men who are no longer with us while we provide with a liberal hand for such as survive and for the widows of the deceased while we would accord to the heirs whether in the second or third generation every dollar to which they can establish a just claimi trust we shall not in the strong current of our sympathies forget what becomes us as the descendants of such men  they would teach us to legislate upon our judgment upon our sober sense of right and not upon our impulses or our sympathies  no sir we may act in this way if we choose when dispensing our own means but we are not at liberty to do it when dispensing the means of our constituents  if we were to legislate upon our sympathiesyet more i will admitif we were to yield to that sense of just and grateful remuneration which presses itself upon every mans heart there would be scarcely a limit for our bounty  the whole exchequer could not answer the demand  to the patriotism the courage and the sacrifices of the people of that day we owe under providence all that we now most highly prize and what we shall transmit to our children as the richest legacy they can inherit the war of the revolution it has been justly remarked was not a war of armies merelyit was the war of nearly a whole people and such a people as the world had never before seen in a death struggle for liberty  the losses sacrifices and sufferings of that period were common to all classes and conditions of life  those who remained at home suffered hardly less than those who entered upon the active strife  the aged father and another underwent not less than the son who would have been the comfort and stay of their declining years now called to perform a yet higher dutyto follow the standard of his bleeding country  the young mother with her helpless children excites not less deeply our sympathies contending with want and dragging out years of weary and toilsome days and anxious nights than the husband in the field following the fortunes of our arms without the proper habiliments to protect his person or the requisite sustenance to support his strength sir i never think of that patient enduring selfsacrificing army which crossed the delaware in december 1777 marching barefooted upon frozen ground to encounter the foe and leaving bloody footprints for miles behind theni never think of their sufferings during that terrible winter without involuntarily inquiring where then were their families who lit up the cheerful fire upon their hearths at home  who spoke the word of comfort and encouragement  nay sir who furnished protection from the rigors of winter and brought them the necessary means of subsistence  the true and simple answer to these questions would disclose an amount of suffering and anguish mental and physical such as might not have been found in the ranks of the armiesnot even in the severest trial of that fortitude which never faltered and that power of endurance which seemed to know no limit  all this no man feels more deeply than i do but they were common sacrifices in a common cause ultimately crowned with the reward of liberty  they have an everlasting claim upon our gratitude and are destined as i trust by their heroic example to exert an abiding influence upon our latest posterity  with this heartfelt recognition of the debt of gratitude due to those excellent men the senator enters into an analysis of the claims presented and proves them to be void of justice  the whole speech is a good exponent of his character full of the truest sympathy but above all things just and not to be misled on the public behalf by those impulses that would be most apt to sway the private man  the mere pecuniary amount saved to the nation by his scrutiny into affairs of this kind though great was after all but a minor consideration  the danger lay in establishing a corrupt system and placing a wrong precedent upon the statute book  instances might be adduced on the other hand which show him not less scrupulous of the just rights of the claimants than careful of the public interests  another subject upon which he came forward was the military establishment and the natural defences of the country  in looking through the columns of the congressional globe we find abundant evidences of senator pierces laborious and unostentatious discharge of his dutiesreports of committees brief remarks and here and there a longer speech always full of matter and evincing a thoroughlydigested knowledge of the subject  not having been written out by himself however these speeches are no fair specimens of his oratory except as regards the train of argument and substantial thought and adhering very closely to the business in hand they seldom present passages that could be quoted without tearing them forcibly as it were out of the context and thus mangling the fragments which we might offer to the reader  as we have already remarked he seems as a debater to revive the old type of the revolutionary congress or to bring back the noble days of the long parliament of england before eloquence had become what it is now a knack and a thing valued for itself  like those strenuous orators he speaks with the earnestness of honest conviction and out of the fervor of his heart and because the occasion and his deep sense of it constrain him  by the defeat of mr van buren in the presidential election of 1840 the administration of government was transferred for the first time in twelve years to the whigs  an extra session of congress was summoned to assemble in june 1841 by president harrison who however died before it came together  at this extra session it was the purpose of the whig party under the leadership of henry clay to overthrow all the great measures which the successive democratic administrations had established the subtreasury was to be demolished a national bank was to be incorporated a high tariff of duties was to be imposed for purposes of protection and abundant revenue  the whig administration possessed a majority both in the senate and the house  it was a dark period for the democracy so long unaccustomed to defeat and now beholding all that they had won for the cause of national progress after the arduous struggle of so many years apparently about to be swept away  the sterling influence which franklin pierce now exercised is well described in the following remarks of the hon a o p nicholson  the power of an organized minority was never more clearly exhibited than in this contest  the democratic senators acted in strict concert meeting night after night for consultation arranging their plan of battle selecting their champions for the coming day assigning to each man his proper duty and looking carefully to the popular judgment for a final victory  in these consultations no mans voice was heard with more profound respect than that of franklin pierce  his counsels were characterized by so thorough a knowledge of human nature by so much solid common sense by such devotion to democratic principles that although among the youngest of the senators it was deemed important that all their conclusions should be submitted to his sanction  although known to be ardent in his temperament he was also known to act with prudence and caution  his impetuosity in debate was only the result of the deep convictions which controlled his mind  he enjoyed the unbounded confidence of calhoun buchanan wright woodbury walker king benton and indeed of the entire democratic portion of the senate when he rose in the senate or in the committee room he was heard with the profoundest attention and again and again was he greeted by these veteran democrats as one of our ablest champions  his speeches during this session will compare with those of any other senator  if it be asked why he did not receive higher distinction i answer that such men as calhoun wright buchanan and woodbury were the acknowledged leaders of the democracy  the eyes of the nation were on them  the hopes of their party were reposed in them  the brightness of these luminaries was too great to allow the brilliancy of so young a man to attract especial attention  but ask any one of these veterans how franklin pierce ranked in the senate and he will tell you that to stand in the front rank for talents eloquence and statesmanship he only lacked a few more years  in the course of this session he made a very powerful speech in favor of mr buchanans resolution calling on the president to furnish the names of persons removed from office since the 4th of march 1841  the whigs in 1840 as in the subsequent canvass of 1848 had professed a purpose to abolish the system of official removals on account of political opinion but immediately on coming into power had commenced a proscription infinitely beyond the example of the democratic party  this course with an army of officeseekers besieging the departments was unquestionably difficult to avoid and perhaps on the whole not desirable to be avoided  but it was rendered astounding by the sturdy effrontery with which the gentlemen in power denied that their present practice had falsified any of their past professions  a few of the closing paragraphs of senator pierces highly effective speech being more easily separable than the rest may here be cited  one word more and i leave this subjecta painful one to me from the beginning to the end  the senator from north carolina in the course of his remarks the other day asked do gentlemen expect that their friends are to be retained in office against the will of the nation  are they so unreasonable as to expect what the circumstances and the necessity of the case forbid  what our expectations were is not the question now but what were your pledges and promises before the people  on a previous occasion the distinguished senator from kentucky made a similar remark an ungracious task but the nation demands it  sir this demand of the nationthis plea of state necessitylet me tell you gentlemen is as old as the history of wrong and oppression  it has been the standing plea the neverfailing resort of despotism  the great julius found it a convenient plea when he restored the dignity of the roman senate but destroyed its independence  it gave countenance to and justified all the atrocities of the inquisition in spain  it forced out the stifled groans that issued from the black hole of calcutta  it was written in tears upon the bridge of sighs in venice and pointed to those dark recesses upon whose gloomy thresholds there was never seen a returning footprint  it was the plea of the austere and ambitious strafford in the days of charles i  it filled the bastile of france and lent its sanction to the terrible atrocities perpetrated there  it was this plea that snatched the mild eloquent and patriotic camillo desmoulins from his young and beautiful wife and hurried him to the guillotine with thousands of others equally unoffending and innocent  it was upon this plea that the greatest of generals if not menyou cannot mistake mei mean him the presence of whose very ashes within the last few months sufficed to stir the hearts of a continentit was upon this plea that he abjured the noble wife who had thrown light and gladness around his humbler days and by her own lofty energies and high intellect had encouraged his aspirations  it was upon this plea that he committed that worst and most fatal acts of his eventful life  upon this too he drew around his person the imperial purple  it has in all times and in every age been the foe of liberty and the indispensable stay of usurpation  where were the chains of despotism ever thrown around the freedom of speech and of the press but on this plea of state necessity  let the spirit of charles x and of his ministers answer  it is cold selfish heartless and has always been regardless of age sex condition services or any of the incidents of life that appeal to patriotism or humanity  wherever its authority has been acknowledged it has assailed men who stood by their country when she needed strong arms and bold hearts and has assailed them when maimed and disabled in her service they could no longer brandish a weapon in her defence  it has afflicted the feeble and dependent wife for the imaginary faults of the husband  it has stricken down innocence in its beauty youth in its freshness manhood in its vigor and age in its feebleness and decrepitude  whatever other plea or apology may be set up for the sweeping ruthless exercise of this civil guillotine at the present day in the name of liberty let us be spared this fearful one of state necessity in this early age of the republic upon the floor of the american senate in the face of a people yet free  in june 1842 he signified his purpose of retiring from the senate  it was now more than sixteen years since the author of this sketch had been accustomed to meet frank pierce that familiar name which the nation is adopting as one of its household words in habits of daily intercourse  our modes of life had since been as different as could well be imagined our culture and labor were entirely unlike there was hardly a single object or aspiration in common between us  still we had occasionally met and always on the old ground of friendly confidence there were sympathies that had not been suffered to die out  had we lived more constantly together it is not impossible that the relation might have been changed by the various accidents and attritions of life but having no mutual events and few mutual interests the tie of early friendship remained the same as when we parted  the modifications which i saw in his character were those of growth and development new qualities came out or displayed themselves more prominently but always in harmony with those heretofore known  always i was sensible of progress in him a characteristicas i believe has been said in the foregoing pagesmore perceptible in franklin pierce than in any other person with whom i have been acquainted  he widened deepened rose to a higher point and thus ever made himself equal to the everheightening occasion  this peculiarity of intellectual growth continued beyond the ordinary period has its analogy in his physical constitutionit being a fact that he continued to grow in stature between his twentyfirst and twentyfifth years  he had not met with that misfortune which it is to be feared befalls many men who throw their ardor into politics  the pursuit had taken nothing from the frankness of his nature now as ever he used direct means to gain honorable ends and his subtletyfor after all his heart and purpose were not such as he that runs may readhad the depth of wisdom and never any quality of cunning  in great part this undeteriorated manhood was due to his original nobility of nature  yet it may not be unjust to attribute it in some degree to the singular good fortune of his life  he had never in all his career found it necessary to stoop  office had sought him he had not begged it nor manoeuvred for it nor crept towards itarts which too frequently bring a man morally bowed and degraded to a position which should be one of dignity but in which he will vainly essay to stand upright  in our earlier meetings after pierce had begun to come forward in public life i could discern that his ambition was aroused  he felt a young mans enjoyment of success so early and so distinguished  but as years went on such motives seemed to be less influential with him  he was cured of ambition as one after another its objects came to him unsought  his domestic position likewise had contributed to direct his tastes and wishes towards the pursuits of private life  in 1834 he had married jane means a daughter of the rev dr appleton a former president of bowdoin college  three sons the first of whom died in early infancy were born to him and having hitherto been kept poor by his public service he no doubt became sensible of the expediency of making some provision for the future  such it may be presumed were the considerations that induced his resignation of the senatorship greatly to the regret of all parties  the senators gathered around him as he was about to quit the chamber political opponents took leave of him as of a personal friend and no departing member has ever retired from that dignified body amid warmer wishes for his happiness than those that attended franklin pierce  his father had died three years before in 1839 at the mansion which he built after the original logcabin grew too narrow for his rising family and fortunes  the mansion was spacious as the liberal hospitality of the occupant required and stood on a little eminence surrounded by verdure and abundance and a happy population where half a century before the revolutionary soldier had come alone into the wilderness and levelled the primeval forest trees  after being spared to behold the distinction of his son he departed this life at the age of eightyone years in perfect peace and until within a few hours of his death in the full possession of his intellectual powers  his last act was one of charity to a poor neighbora fitting close to a life that had abounded in such deeds  governor pierce was a man of admirable qualitiesbrave active publicspirited endowed with natural authority courteous yet simple in his manners and in his son we may perceive these same attributes modified and softened by a finer texture of character illuminated by higher intellectual culture and polished by a larger intercourse with the world but as substantial and sterling as in the good old patriot  franklin pierce had removed from hillsborough in 1838 and taken up his residence at concord the capital of new hampshire  on this occasion the citizens of his native town invited him to a public dinner in token of their affection and respect  in accordance with his usual taste he gratefully accepted the kindly sentiment but declined the public demonstration of it     chapter iii  his success at the bar   franklin pierces earliest effort at the bar as we have already observed was an unsuccessful one but instead of discouraging him the failure had only served to awaken the consciousness of latent power and the resolution to bring it out  since those days he had indeed gained reputation as a lawyer  so much however was the tenor of his legal life broken up by the months of public service subtracted from each year and such was the inevitable tendency of his thoughts towards political subjects that he could but very partially avail himself of the opportunities of professional advancement  but on retiring from the senate he appears to have started immediately into full practice  though the people of new hampshire already knew him well yet his brilliant achievements as an advocate brought him more into their view and into closer relations with them than he had ever before been  he now met his countrymen as represented in the jury box face to face and made them feel what manner of man he was  their sentiment towards him soon grew to be nothing short of enthusiasm love pride the sense of brotherhood affectionate sympathy and perfect trust all mingled in it  it was the influence of a great heart pervading the general heart and throbbing with it in the same pulsation  it has never been the writers good fortune to listen to one of franklin pierces public speeches whether at the bar or elsewhere nor by diligent inquiry has he been able to gain a very definite idea of the mode in which he produces his effects  to me therefore his forensic displays are in the same category with those of patrick henry or any other orator whose tongue beyond the memory of man has moulded into dust  his power results no doubt in great measure from the earnestness with which he imbues himself with the conception of his clients cause insomuch that he makes it entirely his own and never undertaking a case which he believes to be unjust contends with his whole heart and conscience as well as intellectual force for victory his labor in the preparation of his cases is said to be unremitting and he throws himself with such energy into a trial of importance as wholly to exhaust his strength  few lawyers probably have been interested in a wider variety of business than he its scope comprehends the great causes where immense pecuniary interests are concernedfrom which however he is always ready to turn aside to defend the humble rights of the poor man or give his protection to one unjustly accused  as one of my correspondents observes when an applicant has interested him by a recital of fraud or wrong general pierce never investigates the mans estate before engaging in his business neither does he calculate whose path he may cross  i have been privy to several instances of the noblest independence on his part in pursuing to the disrepute of those who stood well in the community the weal of an obscure client with a good cause  in the practice of the law as pierce pursued it in one or another of the court houses of new hampshire the rumor of each successive struggle and success resounded over the rugged hills and perished without a record  those mighty efforts into which he put all his strength before a county court and addressing a jury of yeomen have necessarily been as regards the evanescent memory of any particular trial like the eloquence that is sometimes poured out in a dream  in other spheres of action with no greater expenditure of mental energy words have been spoken that endure from age to agedeeds done that harden into history but this perhaps the most earnest portion of franklin pierces life has left few materials from which it can be written  there is before me only one report of a case in which he was engagedthe defence of the wentworths at a preliminary examination on a charge of murder  his speech occupied four hours in the delivery and handles a confused medley of facts with masterly skill bringing them to bear one upon another and making the entire mass as it were transparent so that the truth may be seen through it  the whole hangs together too closely to permit the quotation of passages  the writer has been favored with communications from two individuals who have enjoyed the best of opportunities to become acquainted with general pierces character as a lawyer  the following is the graceful and generous tribute of a gentleman who of late more frequently than any other has been opposed to him at the bar  general pierce cannot be said to have commenced his career at the bar in earnest until after his resignation of the office of senator in 1842 and it is a convincing proof of his eminent powers that he at once placed himself in the very first rank at a bar so distinguished for ability as that of new hampshire  it is confessed by all who have the means of knowledge and judgment on this subject that in no state of the union are causes tried with more industry of preparation skill perseverance energy or vehement effort to succeed  during much of this time my practice in our courts was suspended and it is only within three or four years that i have had opportunities of intimately knowing his powers as an advocate by being associated with him at the bar and most of all of appreciating and feeling that power by being opposed to him in the trial of causes before juries  far more than any other man whom it has been my fortune to meet he makes himself felt by one who tries a case against him  from the first he impresses on his opponent a consciousness of the necessity of a deadly struggle not only in order to win the victory but to avoid defeat  his vigilance and perseverance omitting nothing in the preparation and introduction of testimony even to the minutest details which can be useful to his clients his watchful attention seizing on every weak point in the opposite case his quickness and readiness his sound and excellent judgment his keen insight into character and motives his almost intuitive knowledge of men his ingenious and powerful crossexaminations his adroitness in turning aside troublesome testimony and availing himself of every favorable point his quick sense of the ridiculous his pathetic appeals to the feelings his sustained eloquence and remarkably energetic declamationall mark him for a leader  from the beginning to the end of the trial of a case nothing with him is neglected which can by possibility honorably conduce to success  his manner is always respectful and deferential to the court captivating to the jury and calculated to conciliate the good will even of those who would be otherwise indifferent spectators  in short he plays the part of a successful actor successful because he always identifies himself with his part and in him it is not acting  perhaps as would be expected by those who know his generosity of heart and his scorn of everything like oppression or extortion he is most powerful in his indignant denunciations of fraud or injustice and his addresses to the feelings in behalf of the poor and lowly and the sufferers under wrong  i remember to have heard of his extraordinary power on one occasion when a person who had offered to procure arrears of a pension for revolutionary services had appropriated to himself a most unreasonable share of the money  general pierce spoke of the frequency of these instances and before the numerous audience offered his aid freely and gratuitously to redress the wrongs of any widow or representative of a revolutionary officer or soldier who had been made the subject of such extortion  the reply of the poor man in the anecdote related by lord campbell of harry erskine would be applicable as exhibiting a feeling kindred to that with which general pierce is regarded theres no a puir man in a scotland need to want a friend or fear an enemy sae lang as harry erskine lives  we next give his aspect as seen from the bench in the following carefully prepared and discriminating article from the chief justice of new hampshire  in attempting to estimate the character and qualifications of mr pierce as a lawyer and an advocate we undertake a delicate but at the same time an agreeable task  the profession of the law practised by men of liberal and enlightened minds and unstained by the sordidness which more or less affects all human pursuits invariably confers honor upon and is honored by its followers  an integrity above suspicion an eloquence alike vigorous and persuasive and an intuitive sagacity have earned for mr pierce the reputation that always follows them  the last case of paramount importance in which he was engaged as counsel was that of morrison v philbrick tried in the month of february 1852 at the court of common pleas for the county of belknap  there was on both sides an array of eminent professional talent messrs pierce bell and bellows appearing for the defendant and messrs atherton and whipple for the plaintiff  the case was one of almost unequalled interest to the public generally and to the inhabitants of the country lying around the lower part of lake winnipiscogee  a company commonly called the lake company had become the owners of many of the outlets of the streams supplying the lake and by means of their works at such places and at union bridge a few miles below were enabled to keep back the waters of the lake and to use them as occasion should require to supply the mills at lowell  the plaintiff alleged that the dam at union bridge had caused the water to rise higher than was done by the dam that existed in the year 1828 and that he was essentially injured thereby  the case had been on trial nearly seven weeks  evidence equivalent to the testimony of one hundred and eighty witnesses had been laid before the jury  upon this immense mass of facts involving a great number of issues mr pierce was to meet his most formidable opponent in the state mr atherton  in that gentleman are united many of the rarest qualifications of an advocate  of inimitable selfpossession with a coolness and clearness of intellect which no sudden emergencies can disturb with that confidence in his resources which nothing but native strength aided by the most thorough training can bestow with a felicity and fertility of illustration the result alike of an exquisite natural taste and a cultivation of those studies which refine while they strengthen the mind for forensic contestsmr athertons argument was listened to with an earnestness and interest which showed the conviction of his audience that no ordinary man was addressing them  no one who witnessed that memorable trial will soon forget the argument of mr pierce on that occasion  he was the counsel for the defendant and was therefore to precede mr atherton  he was to analyze and unfold to the jury this vast body of evidence under the watchful eyes of an opponent at once enterprising and cautious and before whom it was necessary to be both bold and skilful  he was to place himself in the position of the jury to see the evidence as they would be likely to regard it to understand the character of their minds and what views would be the most likely to impress them  he was not only to be familiar with his own case but to anticipate that of his opponent and answer as he best might the argument of the counsel  and most admirably did he discharge the duties he had assumed on behalf of his client  eminently graceful and attractive in his manner at all times his demeanor was then precisely what it should have been showing a manly confidence in himself and his case and a courteous deference to the tribunal he was addressing  his erect and manly figure his easy and unembarrassed air bespoke the favorable attention of his audience  his earnest devotion to his cause his deep emotion evidently suppressed but for that very reason all the more interesting diffused themselves like electricity through his hearers  and when as often happened in the course of his argument his clear and musical accents fell upon the ear in eloquent and pointed sentences gratifying the taste while they satisfied the reason no man could avoid turning to his neighbor and expressing by his looks that pleasure which the very depth of his interest forbade him to express in words  and when the long trial was over every one remembered with satisfaction that these two distinguished gentlemen had met each other during a most exciting and exhausting trial of seven weeks and that no unkind words or captious passages had occurred between them to diminish their mutual respect or that in which they were held by their fellowcitizens  in the above remarks we have indicated a few of mr pierces characteristics as an advocate but he possesses other endowments to which we have not alluded  in the first place as he is a perfectly fearless man so he is a perfectly fearless advocate and true courage is as necessary to the civilian as to the soldier and smiles and frowns mr pierce disregards alike in the undaunted discharge of his duty  he never fears to uphold his client however unpopular his cause may seem to be for the moment  it is this courage which kindles his eloquence inspires his conduct and gives direction and firmness to his skill  this it is which impels him onward at all risks to lay bare every mystery of iniquity which he believes is threatening his case  he does not ask himself whether his opponent be not a man of wealth and influence of whom it might be for his interest to speak with care and circumspection but he devotes himself with a ready zeal to his cause careless of aught but how he may best discharge his duty  his argumentative powers are of the highest order  he never takes before the court a position which he believes untenable  he has a quick and sure perception of his points and the power of enforcing them by apt and pertinent illustrations  he sees the relative importance and weight of different views and can assign to each its proper place and brings forward the main body of his reasoning in prominent relief without distracting the attention by unimportant particulars  and above all he has the good sense so rarely shown by many to stop when he has said all that is necessary for the elucidation of his subject  with a proper confidence in his own perceptions he states his views so pertinently and in such precise and logical terms that they cannot but be felt and appreciated  he never mystifies he never attempts to pervert words from their proper and legitimate meaning to answer a temporary purpose  his demeanor at the bar nay be pronounced faultless  his courtesy in the court house like his courtesy elsewhere is that which springs from selfrespect and from a kindly heart disposing its owner to say and do kindly things  but he would be a courageous man who presuming upon the affability of mr pierces manner would venture a second time to attack him for he would long remember the rebuke that followed his first attack  there is a ready repartee and a quick and cutting sarcasm in his manner when he chooses to display it which it requires a man of considerable nerve to withstand  he is peculiarly happy in the examination of witnessesthat art in which so few excel  he never browbeats he never attempts to terrify  he is never rude or discourteous  but the equivocating witness soon discovers that his falsehood is hunted out of its recesses with an unsparing determination if he is dogged and surly he is met by a spirit as resolute as his own if he is smooth and plausible the veil is lifted from him by a firm but graceful hand  if he is pompous and vain no ridicule was ever more perfect than that to which he listens with astonished and mortified ears  the eloquence of mr pierce is of a character not to be easily forgotten  he understands men their passions and their feelings  he knows the way to their hearts and can make them vibrate to his touch his language always attracts the hearer  a graceful and manly carriage bespeaking him at once the gentleman and the true man a manner warmed by the ardent glow of an earnest belief an enunciation ringing distinct and impressive beyond that of most men a command of brilliant and expressive language and an accurate taste together with a sagacious and instinctive insight into the points of his case are the secrets of his success  it is thus that audiences are moved and truth ascertained and he will ever be the most successful advocate who can approach the nearest to this lofty and difficult position  mr pierces views as a constitutional lawyer are such as have been advocated by the ablest minds of america  they are those which taking their rise in the heroic age of the country were transmitted to him by a noble father worthy of the times in which he lived worthy of that revolution which he assisted in bringing about  he believes that the constitution was made not to be subverted but to be sacredly preserved that a republic is perfectly consistent with the conservation of law of rational submission to right authority and of true selfgovernment equally removed from that malignant hostility to order which characterizes the demagogues who are eager to rise upon the ruins even of freedom and from that barren and bigoted narrowness which would oppose all rational freedom of opinion he is in its loftiest and most ennobling sense a friend of that union without which the honored name of american citizen would become a byword among the nations  and if as we fervently pray and confidently expect he will mr pierce shall display before the great tribunals of the nation the courage the consistency the sagacity and the sense of honor which have already secured for him so many thousands of devoted friends and which have signalized both his private and professional life his administration will long be held in grateful remembrance as one of which the sense of right and the sagacity to perceive it a clear insight into the true destinies of the country and a determination to uphold them at whatever sacrifice were the predominant characteristics  it may appear singular that franklin pierce has not taken up his residence in some metropolis where his great forensic abilities would so readily find a more conspicuous theatre and a far richer remuneration than heretofore  he himself it is understood has sometimes contemplated a removal and two or three years since had almost determined on settling in baltimore  but his native state where he is known so well and regarded with so much familiar affection which he has served so faithfully and which rewards him so generously with its confidence new hampshire with its granite hills must always be his home  he will dwell there except when public duty for a season shall summon him away he will die there and give his dust to its soil  it was at his option in 1846 to accept the highest legal position in the country setting aside the bench and the one which undoubtedly would most have gratified his professional aspirations  president polk with whom he had been associated on the most friendly terms in congress now offered him the post of attorney general of the united states  in tendering to you this position in my cabinet writes the president i have been governed by the high estimate which i place upon your character and eminent qualifications to fill it  the letter in which this proposal is declined shows so much of the writers real self that we quote a portion of it  although the early years of my manhood were devoted to public life it was never really suited to my taste  i longed as i am sure you must often have done for the quiet and independence that belong only to the private citizen and now at forty i feel that desire stronger than ever  coming so unexpectedly as this offer does it would be difficult if not impossible to arrange the business of an extensive practice between this and the first of november in a manner at all satisfactory to myself or to those who have committed their interests to my care and who rely on my services  besides you know that mrs pierces health while at washington was very delicate  it is i fear even more so now and the responsibilities which the proposed change would necessarily impose upon her ought probably in themselves to constitute an insurmountable objection to leaving our quiet home for a public station at washington  when i resigned my seat in the senate in 1842 i did it with the fixed purpose never again to be voluntarily separated from my family for any considerable length of time except at the call of my country in time of war and yet this consequence for the reason before stated and on account of climate would be very likely to result from my acceptance  these are some of the considerations which have influenced my decision you will i am sure appreciate my motives  you will not believe that i have weighed my personal convenience and case against the public interest especially as the office is one which if not sought would be readily accepted by gentlemen who could bring to your aid attainments and qualifications vastly superior to mine  previous to the offer of the attorneygeneralship the appointment of united states senator had been tendered to pierce by governor steele and declined  it is unquestionable that at this period he hoped and expected to spend a life of professional toil in a private station undistinguished except by the exercise of his great talents in peaceful pursuits  but such was not his destiny  the contingency to which he referred in the above letter as the sole exception to his purpose of never being separated from his family was now about to occur  nor did he fail to comport himself as not only that intimation but the whole tenor of his character gave reason to anticipate  during the years embraced in this chapterbetween 1842 and 1847he had constantly taken an efficient interest in the politics of the state but had uniformly declined the honors which new hampshire was at all times ready to confer upon him  a democratic convention nominated him for governor but could not obtain his acquiescence  one of the occasions on which he most strenuously exerted himself was in holding the democratic party loyal to its principles in opposition to the course of john p hale  this gentleman then a representative in congress had broken with his party on no less important a point than the annexation of texas  he has never since acted with the democracy and has long been a leader of the free soil party  in 1844 died frank robert son of franklin pierce aged four years a little boy of rare beauty and promise and whose death was the greatest affliction that his father has experienced  his only surviving child is a son now eleven years old     chapter iv  the mexican war   when franklin pierce declined the honorable offer of the attorneygeneralship of the united states he intimated that there might be one contingency in which he would feel it his duty to give up the cherished purpose of spending the remainder of his life in a private station  that exceptional case was brought about in 1847 by the mexican war  he showed his readiness to redeem the pledge by enrolling himself as the earliest volunteer of a company raised in concord and went through the regular drill with his fellowsoldiers as a private in the ranks  on the passage of the bill for the increase of the army he received the appointment of colonel of the ninth regiment which was the quota of new england towards the ten that were to be raised  and shortly afterwardsin march 1847he was commissioned as brigadiergeneral in the army his brigade consisting of regiments from the extreme north the extreme west and the extreme south of the union  there is nothing in any other country similar to what we see in our own when the blast of the trumpet at once converts men of peaceful pursuits into warriors  every war in which america has been engaged has done this the valor that wins our battles is not the trained hardihood of veterans but a native and spontaneous fire and there is surely a chivalrous beauty in the devotion of the citizen soldier to his countrys cause which the man who makes arms his profession and is but doing his regular business on the field of battle cannot pretend to rival  taking the mexican war as a specimen this peculiar composition of an american army as well in respect to its officers as its private soldiers seems to create a spirit of romantic adventure which more than supplies the place of disciplined courage  the author saw general pierce in boston on the eve of his departure for vera cruz  he had been intensely occupied since his appointment in effecting the arrangements necessary on leaving his affairs as well as by the preparations military and personal demanded by the expedition the transports were waiting at newport to receive the troops  he was now in the midst of bustle with some of the officers of his command about him mingled with the friends whom he was to leave behind  the severest point of the crisis was over for he had already bidden his family farewell  his spirits appeared to have risen with the occasion  he was evidently in his element nor to say the truth dangerous as was the path before him could it be regretted that his life was now to have the opportunity of that species of success whichin his youth at leasthe had considered the best worth struggling for  he looked so fit to be a soldier that it was impossible to doubtnot merely his good conduct which was as certain before the event as afterwards buthis good fortune in the field and his fortunate return  he sailed from newport on the 27th of may in the bark kepler having on board three companies of the ninth regiment of infantry together with colonel ransom its commander and the officers belonging to the detachment  the passage was long and tedious with protracted calms and so smooth a sea that a sailboat might have performed the voyage in safety  the kepler arrived at vera cruz in precisely a month after her departure from the united states without speaking a single vessel from the south during her passage and of course receiving no intelligence as to the position and state of the army which these reenforcements were to join  from a journal kept by general pierce and intended only for the perusal of his family and friends we present some extracts  they are mere hasty jottingsdown in camp and at the intervals of weary marches but will doubtless bring the reader closer to the man than any narrative which we could substitute  in this reprint it has been thought expedient to omit the passages from general pierces journal                                       general pierces journal here terminates  in its clear and simple narrative the reader cannot fail to seealthough it was written with no purpose of displaying themthe native qualities of a born soldier together with the sagacity of an experienced one  he had proved himself moreover physically apt for war by his easy endurance of the fatigues of the march every step of which as was the case with few other officers was performed either on horseback or on foot  nature indeed has endowed him with a rare elasticity both of mind and body he springs up from pressure like a welltempered sword  after the severest toil a single nights rest does as much for him in the way of refreshment as a week could do for most other men  his conduct on this adventurous march received the high encomiums of military men and was honored with the commendation of the great soldier who is now his rival in the presidential contest  he reached the main army at puebla on the 7th of august with twentyfour hundred men in fine order and without the loss of a single wagon     chapter v  his services in the valley of mexico   general scott who was at puebla with the main army awaiting this reenforcement began his march towards the city of mexico on the day after general pierces arrival  the battle of contreras was fought on the 19th of august  the enemys force consisted of about seven thousand men posted in a stronglyintrenched camp under general valencia one of the bravest and ablest of the mexican commanders  the object of the commanding general appears to have been to cut off the communications of these detached troops with santa annas main army and thus to have them entirely at his mercy  for this purpose a portion of the american forces were ordered to move against valencias left flank and by occupying strong positions in the villages and on the roads towards the city to prevent reenforcements from reaching him  in the mean time to draw the enemys attention from this movement a vigorous onset was made upon his front and as the operations upon his flank were not immediately and fully carried out according to the plan this front demonstration assumed the character of a fierce and desperate attack upon which the fortunes of the day much depended  general pierces brigade formed a part of the force engaged in this latter movement in which four thousand newlyrecruited men unable to bring their artillery to bear contended against seven thousand disciplined soldiers protected by intrenchments and showering round shot and shells against the assailing troops  the ground in front was of the rudest and roughest character  the troops made their way with difficulty over a broken tract called the pedregal bristling with sharp points of rocks and which is represented as having been the crater of a now exhausted and extinct volcano  the enemy had thrown out skirmishers who were posted in great force among the crevices and inequalities of this broken ground and vigorously resisted the american advance while the artillery of the intrenched camp played upon our troops and shattered the very rocks over which they were to pass  general pierces immediate command had never before been under such a fire of artillery  the enemys range was a little too high or the havoc in our ranks must have been dreadful  in the midst of this fire general pierce being the only officer mounted in the brigade leaped his horse upon an abrupt eminence and addressed the colonels and captains of the regiments as they passed in a few stirring wordsreminding them of the honor of their country of the victory their steady valor would contribute to achieve  pressing forward to the head of the column he had nearly reached the practicable ground that lay beyond when his horse slipped among the rocks thrust his foot into a crevice and fell breaking his own leg and crushing his rider heavily beneath him  pierces mounted orderly soon came to his assistance  the general was stunned and almost insensible  when partially recovered he found himself suffering from severe bruises and especially from a sprain of the left knee which was undermost when the horse came down  the orderly assisted him to reach the shelter of a projecting rock and as they made their way thither a shell fell close beside them and exploded covering them with earth  that was a lucky miss said pierce calmly  leaving him in such shelter as the rock afforded the orderly went in search of aid and was fortunate to meet with dr ritchie of virginia who was attached to pierces brigade and was following in close proximity to the advancing column  the doctor administered to him as well as the circumstances would admit  immediately on recovering his full consciousness general pierce had become anxious to rejoin his troops and now in opposition to dr ritchies advice and remonstrances he determined to proceed to the front  with pain and difficulty and leaning on his orderlys arm he reached the battery commanded by captain mcgruder where he found the horse of lieutenant johnson who had just before received a mortal wound  in compliance with his wishes he was assisted into the saddle and in answer to a remark that he would be unable to keep his seat then said the general you must tie me on  whether his precaution was actually taken is a point upon which authorities differ but at all events with injuries so severe as would have sent almost any other man to the hospital he rode forward into the battle  the contest was kept up until nightfall without forcing valencias intrenchment  general pierce remained in the saddle until eleven oclock at night  finding himself at nine oclock the senior officer in the field he in that capacity withdrew the troops from their advanced position and concentrated them at the point where they were to pass the night  at eleven beneath a torrent of rain destitute of a tent or other protection and without food or refreshment he lay down on an ammunition wagon but was prevented by the pain of his injuries especially that of his wounded knee from finding any repose  at one oclock came orders from general scott to put the brigade into a new position in front of the enemys works preparatory to taking part in the contemplated operations of the next morning  during the night the troops appointed for that service under riley shields smith and cadwallader had occupied the villages and roads between valencias position and the city so that with daylight the commanding generals scheme of the battle was ready to be carried out as it had originally existed in his mind  at daylight accordingly valencias intrenched camp was assaulted general pierce was soon in the saddle at the head of his brigade which retained its position in front thus serving to attract the enemys attention and divert him from the true point of attack  the camp was stormed in the rear by the american troops led on by riley cadwallader and dimmick and in the short space of seventeen minutes it had fallen into the hands of the assailants together with a multitude of prisoners the remnant of the routed enemy fled towards churubusco  as pierce led his brigade in pursuit crossing the battlefield and passing through the works that had just been stormed he found the road and adjacent fields everywhere strewn with the dead and dying  the pursuit was continued until one oclock when the foremost of the americans arrived in front of the strong mexican positions at churubusco and san antonio where santa almas army had been compelled to make a stand and where the great conflict of the day commenced  general santa anna entertained the design of withdrawing his forces towards the city  in order to intercept this movement pierces brigade with other troops was ordered to pursue a route by which the enemy could be attacked in the rear  colonel noah e smith a patriotic american long resident in mexico whose local and topographical knowledge proved eminently serviceable had offered to point out the road and was sent to summon general pierce to the presence of the commanderinchief  when he met pierce near coyacan at the head of his brigade the heavy fire of the batteries had commenced  he was exceedingly thin writes colonel smith worn down by the fatigue and pain of the day and night before and then evidently suffering severely  still there was a glow in his eye as the cannon boomed that showed within him a spirit ready for the conflict  he rode up to general scott who was at this time sitting on horseback beneath a tree near the church of coyacan issuing orders to different individuals of his staff  our account of this interview is chiefly taken from the narrative of colonel smith corroborated by other testimony  the commanderinchief had already heard of the accident that befell pierce the day before and as the latter approached general scott could not but notice the marks of pain and physical exhaustion against which only the sturdiest constancy of will could have enabled him to bear up pierce my dear fellow said heand that epithet of familiar kindness and friendship upon the battlefield was the highest of military commendation from such a manyou are badly injured you are not fit to be in your saddle  yes general i am replied pierce in a case like this  you cannot touch your foot to the stirrup said scott one of them i can answered pierce  the general looked again at pierces almost disabled figure and seemed on the point of taking his irrevocable resolution  you are rash general pierce said he we shall lose you and we cannot spare you  it is my duty to order you back to st augustine  for gods sake general exclaimed pierce dont say that  this is the last great battle and i must lead my brigade the commanderinchief made no further remonstrance but gave the order for pierce to advance with his brigade  the way lay through thick standing corn and over marshy ground intersected with ditches which were filled or partially so with water over some of the narrower of these pierce leaped his horse  when the brigade had advanced about a mile however it found itself impeded by a ditch ten or twelve feet wide and six or eight feet deep  it being impossible to leap it general pierce was lifted from his saddle and in some incomprehensible way hurt as he was contrived to wade or scramble across this obstacle leaving his horse on the hither side  the troops were now under fire  in the excitement of the battle he forgot his injury and hurried forward leading the brigade a distance of two or three hundred yards  but the exhaustion of his frame and particularly the anguish of his kneemade more intolerable by such free use of it was greater than any strength of nerve or any degree of mental energy could struggle against  he fell faint and almost insensible within full range of the enemys fire  it was proposed to bear him off the field but as some of his soldiers approached to lift him he became aware of their purpose and was partially revived by his determination to resist it  no said he with all the strength he had left dont carry me off  let me lie here and there he lay under the tremendous fire of churubusco until the enemy in total rout was driven from the field  immediately after the victory when the city of mexico lay at the mercy of the american commander and might have been entered that very night santa anna sent a flag of truce proposing an armistice with a view to negotiation for peace  it cannot be considered in any other light than as a very high and signal compliment to his gallantry in the field that general pierce was appointed by the commanderinchief one of the commissioners on our part together with general quitman and general persifer f smith to arrange the terms of this armistice  pierce was unable to walk or to mount his horse without assistance when intelligence of his appointment reached him  he had not taken off his spurs nor slept an hour for two nights but he immediately obeyed the summons was assisted into the saddle and rode to tacubaya where at the house of the british consulgeneral the american and mexican commissioners were assembled  the conference began late in the afternoon and continued till four oclock the next morning when the articles were signed  pierce then proceeded to the quarters of general worth in the village of tacubaya where he obtained an hour or two of repose  the expectation of general scott that further bloodshed might be avoided by means of the armistice proved deceptive  military operations after a temporary interruption were actively renewed and on the 8th of september was fought the bloody battle of molino del rey one of the fiercest and most destructive of the war  in this conflict general worth with three thousand troops attacked and routed fourteen thousand mexicans driving them under the protection of the castle of chepultepec  perceiving the obstinacy with which the field was contested the commanderinchief dispatched an order to general pierce to advance to the support of general worths division  he moved forward with rapidity and although the battle was won just as he reached the field he interposed his brigade between worth and the retreating enemy and thus drew upon himself the fire of chepultepec  a shell came streaming from the castle and bursting within a few feet of him startled his horse which was near plunging over an adjacent precipice continuing a long time under fire pierces brigade was engaged in removing the wounded and the captured ammunition  while thus occupied he led a portion of his command to repel the attacks of the enemys skirmishers  there remained but one other battlethat of chepultepecwhich was fought on the 13th of september  on the preceding day although the injuries and the overexertion resulting from previous marches and battles had greatly enfeebled him general pierce had acted with his brigade  in obedience to orders it had occupied the field of molino del rey  contrary to expectation it was found that the enemys force had been withdrawn from this position  pierce remained in the field until noon when it being certain that the anticipated attack would not take place before the following day he returned to the quarters of general worth which were near at hand  there he became extremely ill and was unable to leave his bed for the thirtysix hours next ensuing  in the mean time the castle of chepultepec was stormed by the troops under generals pillow and quitman  pierces brigade behaved itself gallantly and suffered severely and that accomplished officer colonel ransom leading the ninth regiment to the attack was shot through the head and fell with many other brave men in that last battle of the war  the american troops under quitman and worth had established themselves within the limits of the city having possession of the gates of belen and of san cosma but up till nightfall had met with a vigorous resistance from the mexicans led on by santa anna in person  they had still apparently a desperate task before them  it was anticipated that with the next mornings light our troops would be ordered to storm the citadel and the city of mexico itself  when this was told to pierce upon his sickbed he rose and attempted to dress himself but captain hardcastle who had brought the intelligence from worth prevailed upon him to remain in bed and not to exhaust his scanty strength until the imminence of the occasion should require his presence pierce acquiesced for the time but again arose in the course of the night and made his way to the trenches where he reported himself to general quitman with whose division was a part of his brigade quitmans share in the anticipated assault it was supposed owing to the position which his troops occupied would be more perilous than that of worth  but the last great battle had been fought  in the morning it was discovered that the citadel had been abandoned and that santa anna had withdrawn his army from the city  there never was a more gallant body of officers than those who came from civil life into the army on occasion of the mexican war  all of them from the rank of general downward appear to have been animated by the spirit of young knights in times of chivalry when fighting for their spurs  hitherto known only as peaceful citizens they felt it incumbent on them by daring and desperate valor to prove their fitness to be intrusted with the guardianship of their countrys honor  the old and trained soldier already distinguished on former fields was free to be discreet as well as brave but these untried warriors were in a different position and therefore rushed on perils with a recklessness that found its penalty on every battlefieldnot one of which was won without a grievous sacrifice of the best blood of america  in this band of gallant men it is not too much to say general pierce was as distinguished for what we must term his temerity in personal exposure as for the higher traits of leadership wherever there was an opportunity for their display  he had manifested moreover other and better qualities than these and such as it affords his biographer far greater pleasure to record  his tenderness of heart his sympathy his brotherly or paternal care for his men had been displayed in a hundred instances and had gained him the enthusiastic affection of all who served under his command  during the passage from america under the tropics he would go down into the stifling air of the hold with a lemon a cup of tea and better and more efficacious than all a kind word for the sick  while encamped before vera cruz he gave up his own tent to a sick comrade and went himself to lodge in the pestilential city  on the march and even on the battlefield he found occasion to exercise those feelings of humanity which show most beautifully there  and in the hospitals of mexico he went among the diseased and wounded soldiers cheering them with his voice and the magic of his kindness inquiring into their wants and relieving them to the utmost of his pecuniary means  there was not a man of his brigade but loved him and would have followed him to death or have sacrificed his own life in his generals defence  the officers of the old army whose profession was war and who well knew what a soldier was and ought to be fully recognized his merit  an instance of their honorable testimony in his behalf may fitly be recorded here  it was after general pierce had returned to the united states  at a dinner in the halls of montezuma at which forty or fifty of the brave men above alluded to were present a young officer of the new england regiment was called on for a toast  he made an address in which he spoke with irrepressible enthusiasm of general pierce and begged to propose his health  one of the officers of the old line rose and observed that none of the recently appointed generals commanded more unanimous and universal respect that general pierce had appreciated the scientific knowledge of the regular military men and had acquired their respect by the independence firmness and promptitude with which he exercised his own judgment and acted on the intelligence derived from them  in concluding this tribute of high but wellconsidered praise the speaker very cordially acquiesced in the health of general pierce and proposed that it should be drunk standing with three times three  general pierce remained in mexico until december when as the warfare was over and peace on the point of being concluded he set out on his return  in nine months crowded full of incident he had seen far more of actual service than many professional soldiers during their whole lives  as soon as the treaty of peace was signed he gave up his commission and returned to the practice of the law again proposing to spend the remainder of his days in the bosom of his family  all the dreams of his youth were now fulfilled the military ardor that had struck an hereditary root in his breast had enjoyed its scope and was satisfied and he flattered himself that no circumstances could hereafter occur to draw him from the retirement of domestic peace  new hampshire received him with even more enthusiastic affection than ever  at his departure he had received a splendid sword at the hands of many of his friends in token of their confidence he had shown himself well worthy to wear and able to use a soldiers weapon and his native state now gave him another the testimonial of approved valor and warlike conduct     chapter vi  the compromise and other matters   the intervening years since general pierces return from mexico and until the present time have been spent in the laborious exercise of the legal professionan employment scarcely varied or interrupted except by those episodes of political activity which a man of public influence finds it impossible to avoid and in which if his opinions are matter of conscience with him he feels it his duty to interest himself  in the presidential canvass of 1848 he used his best efforts and with success so far as new hampshire was concerned in behalf of the candidate of his party  a truer and better speech has never been uttered on a similar occasion than one which he made during a hurried half hour snatched from the court rooms in october of the above year before the democratic state convention then in session at concord  it is an invariable characteristic of general pierces popular addresses that they evince a genuine respect for the people he makes his appeal to their intelligence their patriotism and their integrity and never doubtful of their upright purpose proves his faith in the great mind and heart of the country both by what he says and by what he refrains from saying  he never yet was guilty of an effort to cajole his fellowcitizens to operate upon their credulity or to trick them even into what was right and therefore all the victories which he has ever won in popular assemblies have been triumphs doubly honored being as creditable to his audiences as to himself  when the series of measures known under the collective term of the compromise were passed by congress in 1850 and put to so searching a test here at the north the reverence of the people for the constitution and their attachment to the union general pierce was true to the principles which he had long ago avowed  at an early period of his congressional service he had made known with the perfect frankness of his character those opinions upon the slavery question which he has never since seen occasion to change in the slightest degree  there is an unbroken consistency in his action with regard to this matter  it is entirely of a piece from his first entrance upon public life until the moment when he came forward while many were faltering to throw the great weight of his character and influence into the scale in favor of those measures through which it was intended to redeem the pledges of the constitution and to preserve and renew the old love and harmony among the sisterhood of states  his approval embraced the whole series of these acts as well those which bore hard upon northern views and sentiments as those in which the south deemed itself to have made more than reciprocal concessions  no friend nor enemy that know franklin pierce would have expected him to act otherwise  with his view of the whole subject whether looking at it through the medium of his conscience his feelings or his intellect it was impossible for him not to take his stand as the unshaken advocate of union and of the mutual steps of compromise which that great object unquestionably demanded  the fiercest the least scrupulous and the most consistent of those who battle against slavery recognize the same fact that he does  they see that merely human wisdom and human efforts cannot subvert it except by tearing to pieces the constitution breaking the pledges which it sanctions and severing into distracted fragments that common country which providence brought into one nation through a continued miracle of almost two hundred years from the first settlement of the american wilderness until the revolution  in the days when a young member of congress he first raised his voice against agitation pierce saw these perils and their consequences  he considered too that the evil would be certain while the good was at best a contingency and to the clear practical foresight with which he looked into the future scarcely so much as that attended as the movement was and must be during its progress with the aggravated injury of those whose condition it aimed to ameliorate and terminating in its possible triumphif such possibility there werewith the ruin of two races which now dwelt together in greater peace and affection it is not too much to say than had ever elsewhere existed between the taskmaster and the serf  of course there is another view of all these matters  the theorist may take that view in his closet the philanthropist by profession may strive to act upon it uncompromisingly amid the tumult and warfare of his life but the statesman of practical sagacitywho loves his country as it is and evolves good from things as they exist and who demands to feel his firm grasp upon a better reality before he quits the one already gained will be likely here with all the greatest statesmen of america to stand in the attitude of a conservative  such at all events will be the attitude of franklin pierce  we have sketched some of the influences amid which he grew up inheriting his fathers love of country mindful of the old patriots valor in so many conflicts of the revolution and having close before his eyes the example of brothers and relatives more than one of whom have bled for america both at the extremest north and farthest south himself too in early manhood serving the union in its legislative halls and at a maturer age leading his fellowcitizens his brethren from the widestsundered states to redden the same battlefields with their kindred blood to unite their breath into one shout of victory and perhaps to sleep side by side with the same sod over them  such a man with such hereditary recollections and such a personal experience must not narrow himself to adopt the cause of one section of his native country against another  he will stand up as he has always stood among the patriots of the whole land  and if the work of antislavery agitation which it is undeniable leaves most men who earnestly engage in it with only half a country in their affectionsif this work must be done let others do it  those northern men therefore who deem the great causes of human welfare as represented and involved in this present hostility against southern institutions and who conceive that the world stands still except so far as that goes forwardthese it may be allowed can scarcely give their sympathy or their confidence to the subject of this memoir  but there is still another view and probably as wise a one  it looks upon slavery as one of those evils which divine providence does not leave to be remedied by human contrivances but which in its own good time by some means impossible to be anticipated but of the simplest and easiest operation when all its uses shall have been fulfilled it causes to vanish like a dream  there is no instance in all history of the human will and intellect having perfected any great moral reform by methods which it adapted to that end but the progress of the world at every step leaves some evil or wrong on the path behind it which the wisest of mankind of their own set purpose could never have found the way to rectify whatever contributes to the great cause of good contributes to all its subdivisions and varieties and on this score the lover of his race the enthusiast the philanthropist of whatever theory might lend his aid to put a man like the one before us into the leadership of the worlds affairs  how firm and conscientious was general pierces support of the compromise may be estimated from his conduct in reference to the reverend john atwood  in the foregoing pages it has come oftener in our way to illustrate the bland and prepossessing features of general pierces character than the sterner ones which must necessarily form the bones so to speak the massive skeleton of any man who retains an upright attitude amidst the sinister influences of public life  the transaction now alluded to affords a favorable opportunity for indicating some of these latter traits  in october 1850 a democratic convention held at concord nominated mr atwood as the partys regular candidate for governor  the compromise then recent was inevitably a prominent element in the discussions of the convention and a series of resolutions were adopted bearing reference to this great subject fully and unreservedly indorsing the measures comprehended under it and declaring the principles on which the democracy of the state was about to engage in the gubernatorial contest mr atwood accepted the nomination acceding to the platform thus tendered him taking exceptions to none of the individual resolutions and of course pledging himself to the whole by the very act of assuming the candidacy which was predicated upon them  the reverend candidate we should conceive is a wellmeaning and probably an amiable man  in ordinary circumstances he would doubtless have gone through the canvass triumphantly and have administered the high office to which he aspired with no discredit to the party that had placed him at its head  but the disturbed state of the public mind on the compromise question rendered the season a very critical one and mr atwood unfortunately had that fatal weakness of character which however respectably it may pass in quiet times is always bound to make itself pitiably manifest under the pressure of a crisis  a letter was addressed to him by a committee representing the party opposed to the compromise and with whom it may be supposed were included those who held the more thoroughgoing degrees of antislavery sentiment  the purpose of the letter was to draw out an expression of mr atwoods opinion on the abolition movement generally and with an especial reference to the fugitive slave law and whether as chief magistrate of the state he would favor any attempt for its repeal  in an answer of considerable length the candidate expressed sentiments that brought him unquestionably within the free soil pale and favored his correspondents moreover with a pretty decided judgment as to the unconstitutional unjust and oppressive character of the fugitive slave law  during a space of about two months this very important document was kept from the public eye  rumors of its existence however became gradually noised abroad and necessarily attracted the attention of mr atwoods democratic friends  inquiries being made he acknowledged the existence of the letter but averred that it had never been delivered that it was merely a rough draught and that he had hitherto kept it within his own control with a view to more careful consideration  in accordance with the advice of friends he expressed a determination and apparently in good faith to suppress the letter and thus to sever all connection with the antislavery party  this however was now beyond his power  a copy of the letter had been taken it was published with high commendations in the antislavery newspapers and mr atwood was exhibited in the awkward predicament of directly avowing sentiments on the one hand which he had implicitly disavowed on the other of accepting a nomination based on principles diametrically opposite  the candidate appears to have apprehended this disclosure and he hurried to concord and sought counsel of general pierce with whom he was on terms of personal kindness and between whom and himself heretofore there had never been a shade of political difference  an interview with the general and one or two other gentlemen ensued  mr atwood was cautioned against saying or writing a word that might be repugnant to his feelings or his principles but voluntarily and at his own suggestion he now wrote for publication a second letter in which he retracted every objectionable feature of his former one and took decided ground in favor of the compromise including all its individual measures  had he adhered to this latter position he might have come out of the affair if not with the credit of consistency yet at least as a successful candidate in the impending election  but his evil fate or rather the natural infirmity of his character was not so to be thrown off  the very next day unhappily he fell into the hands of some of his antislavery friends to whom he avowed a constant adherence to the principles of his first letter describing the second as having been drawn from him by importunity in an excited state of his mind and without a full realization of its purport  it would be needlessly cruel to mr atwood to trace with minuteness the further details of this affair  it is impossible to withhold from him a certain sympathy or to avoid feeling that a very worthy man as the world goes had entangled himself in an inextricable knot of duplicity and tergiversation by an illadvised effort to be two opposite things at once  for the sake of true manhood we gladly turn to consider the course adopted by general pierce  the election for governor was now at a distance of only a few weeks and it could not be otherwise than a most hazardous movement for the democratic party at so late a period to discard a candidate with whom the people had become familiar  it involved nothing less than the imminent peril of that political supremacy which the party had so long enjoyed  with mr atwood as candidate success might be considered as certain  to a shortsighted and a weak man it would have appeared the obvious policy to patch up the difficulty and at all events to conquer under whatever leadership and with whatever allies  but it was one of those junctures which test the difference between the man of principle and the mere politicianthe man of moral courage and him who yields to temporary expediency  general pierce could not consent that his party should gain a nominal triumph at the expense of what he looked upon as its real integrity and life  with this view of the matter he had no hesitation in his course nor could the motives which otherwise would have been strongest with himpity for the situation of an unfortunate individual a personal friend a democrat as mr atwood describes himself of nearly fifty years standingincline him to mercy where it would have been fatal to his sense of right  he took decided ground against mr atwood  the convention met again and satisfactory to all parties and one of his political opponents professor sanborn of dartmouth college has ably sketched him both in that aspect and as a debater  in drawing the portraits of the distinguished members of the constitutional convention writes the professor to pass frank pierce unnoticed would be as absurd as to enact one of shakespeares dramas without its principal hero  i give my impressions of the man as i saw him in the convention for i would not undertake to vouch for the truth or falsehood of those veracious organs of public sentiment at the capital which have loaded him in turn with indiscriminate praise and abuse  as a presiding officer it would be difficult to find his equal in proposing questions to the house he never hesitates or blunders  in deciding points of order he is both prompt and impartial  his treatment of every member of the convention was characterized by uniform courtesy and kindness  the deportment of the presiding officer of a deliberative body usually gives tone to the debates  if he is harsh morose or abrupt in his manner the speakers are apt to catch his spirit by the force of involuntary sympathy  the same is true to some extent of the principal debaters in such a body  when a man of strong prejudices and harsh temper rises to address a public assembly his indwelling antipathies speak from every feature of his face and from every motion of his person  the audience at once brace themselves against his assaults and condemn his opinions before they are heard  the wellknown character of an orator persuades or dissuades quite as forcibly as the language he utters  some men never rise to address a deliberative assembly without conciliating good will in advance  the smile that plays upon the speakers face awakens emotions of complacency in those who hear even before he speaks  so does that weight of character which is the matured fruit of long public services and acknowledged worth soothe in advance the irritated and angry crowd  mr pierce possesses unquestionable ability as a public speaker  few men in our country better understand the means of swaying a popular assembly or employ them with greater success  his forte lies in moving the passions of those whom he addresses  he knows how to call into vigorous action both the sympathies and antipathies of those who listen to him  i do not mean to imply by these remarks that his oratory is deficient in argument or sound reasoning  on the contrary he seizes with great power upon the strong points of his subject and presents them clearly forcibly and eloquently  as a prompt and ready debater always prepared for assault or defence he has few equals  in these encounters he appears to great advantage from his happy faculty of turning little incidents unexpectedly occurring to his own account  a word carelessly dropped or an unguarded allusion to individuals or parties by an opponent is frequently converted into a powerful weapon of assault by this skilful advocate  he has been so much in office that he may be said to have been educated in public life  he is most thoroughly versed in all the tactics of debate  he is not only remarkably fluent in his elocution but remarkably correct  he seldom miscalls or repeats a word his style is not overloaded with ornament and yet he draws liberally upon the treasury of rhetoric  his figures are often beautiful and striking never incongruous  he is always listened to with respectful attention if he does not always command conviction  from his whole course in the convention a disinterested spectator could not fail to form a very favorable opinion not only of his talent and eloquence but of his generosity and magnanimity  among other antiquated relics of the past and mouldy types of prejudices that ought now to be forgotten and of which it was the object of the present convention to purge the constitution of new hampshire there is a provision that certain state offices should be held only by protestants since general pierces nomination for the presidency the existence of this religious test has been brought as a charge against him as if in spite of his continued efforts to remove it he were personally responsible for its remaining on the statute book  general pierce has naturally a strong endowment of religious feeling  at no period of his life as is well known to his friends have the sacred relations of the human soul been a matter of indifference with him and of more recent years whatever circumstances of good or evil fortune may have befallen him they have alike served to deepen this powerful sentiment  whether in sorrow or success he has learned in his own behalf the great lesson that religious faith is the most valuable and most sacred of human possessions but with this sense there has come no narrowness or illiberality but a wideembracing sympathy for the modes of christian worship and a reverence for individual belief as a matter between the deity and mans soul and with which no other has a right to interfere  with the feeling here described and with his acute intellectual perception of the abortive character of all intolerant measures as defeating their own ends it strikes one as nothing less than ludicrous that he should be charged with desiring to retain this obsolete enactment standing as it does as a merely gratuitous and otherwise inoperative stigma upon the fair reputation of his native state  even supposing no higher motives to have influenced him it would have sufficed to secure his best efforts for the repeal of the religious test that so many of the catholics have always been found in the advanceguard of freedom marching onward with the progressive party and that whether in peace or war they have performed for their adopted country the hard toil and the gallant services which she has a right to expect from her most faithful citizens  the truth is that ever since his entrance upon public life on all occasionsand often making the occasion where he found nonegeneral pierce has done his utmost to obliterate this obnoxious feature from the constitution  he has repeatedly advocated the calling of a convention mainly for this purpose  in that of 1850 he both spoke and voted in favor of the abolition of the test and with the aid of judge woodbury and other democratic members attained his purpose so far as the convention possessed any power or responsibility in the matter  that the measure was ultimately defeated is due to other causes either temporary or of long continuance and to some of them it is attributable that the enlightened public sentiment of new hampshire was not long since made to operate upon this enactment so anomalous in the fundamental law of a free state  in order to the validity of the amendments passed by the convention it was necessary that the people should subsequently act upon them and pass a vote of two thirds in favor of their adoption  the amendments proposed by the convention of 1850 were numerous  the constitution had been modified in many and very important particulars in respect to which the popular mind had not previously been made familiar and on which it had not anticipated the necessity of passing judgment  in march 1851 when the vote of the people was taken upon these measures the atwood controversy was at its height and threw all matters of less immediate interest into the background  during the interval since the adjournment of the convention the whig newspapers had been indefatigable in their attempts to put its proceedings in an odious light before the people there had been no period for many years in which sinister influences rendered it so difficult to draw out an efficient expression of the will of the democracy as on this occasion  it was the result of all these obstacles that the doings of the constitutional convention were rejected in the mass  in the ensuing april the convention reassembled in order to receive the unfavorable verdict of the people upon its proposed amendments  at the suggestion of general pierce the amendment abolishing the religious test was again brought forward and in spite of the opposition of the leading whig members was a second time submitted to the people  nor did the struggle in behalf of this enlightened movement terminate here  at the democratic caucus in concord preliminary to the town meeting he urged upon his political friends the repeal of the test as a party measure and again at the town meeting itself while the balloting was going forward he advocated it on the higher ground of religious freedom and of reverence for what is inviolable in the human soul  had the amendment passed the credit would have belonged to no man more than to general pierce and that it failed and that the free constitution of new hampshire is still disgraced by a provision which even monarchical england has cast off is a responsibility which must rest elsewhere than on his head  in september 1851 died that eminent statesman and jurist levi woodbury then occupying the elevated post of judge of the supreme court of the united states  the connection between him and general pierce beginning in the early youth of the latter had been sustained through all the subsequent years  they sat together with but one intervening chair between in the national senate they were always advocates of the same great measures and held through life a harmony of opinion and action which was never more conspicuous than in the few months that preceded judge woodburys death  at a meeting of the bar after his decease general pierce uttered some remarks full of sensibility in which he referred to the circumstances that had made this friendship an inheritance on his part  had judge woodbury survived it is not improbable that his more advanced age his great public services and equally distinguished zeal in behalf of the union might have placed him in the position now occupied by the subject of this memoir  fortunate the state which after losing such a son can still point to another not less worthy to take upon him the charge of the nations welfare  we have now finished our record of franklin pierces life and have only to describe the posture of affairs which without his own purpose and against his wish has placed him before the people of the united states as a candidate for the presidency     chapter vii  his nomination for the presidency   on the 12th of june 1852 the democratic national convention assembled at baltimore in order to select a candidate for the presidency of the united states  many names eminently distinguished in peace and war had been brought before the public during several months previous and among them though by no means occupying a very prominent place was the name of franklin pierce  in january of this year the democracy of new hampshire had signified its preference of general pierce as a presidential candidate in the approaching canvassa demonstration which drew from him the following response addressed to his friend mr atherton  i am far from being insensible to the generous confidence so often manifested towards me by the people of this state and although the object indicated in the resolution having particular reference to myself be not one of desire on my part the expression is not on that account less gratifying  doubtless the spontaneous and just appreciation of an intelligent people is the best earthly reward for earnest and cheerful services rendered to ones state and country and while it is a matter of unfeigned regret that my life has been so barren of usefulness i shall ever hold this and similar tributes among my most cherished recollections  to these my sincere and grateful acknowledgments i desire to add that the same motives which induced me several years ago to retire from public life and which since that time controlled my judgment in this respect now impel me to say that the use of my name in any event before the democratic national convention at baltimore to which you are a delegate would be utterly repugnant to my taste and wishes  the sentiments expressed in the above letter were genuine and from his heart  he had looked long and closely at the effects of high public station on the character and happiness and on what is the innermost and dearest part of a mans possessionshis independence and he had satisfied himself that office however elevated should be avoided for ones own sake or accepted only as a good citizen would make any other sacrifice at the call and at the need of his country  as the time for the assembling of the national convention drew near there were other sufficient indications of his sincerity in declining a stake in the great game  a circular letter was addressed by major scott of virginia to the distinguished democrats whose claims had heretofore been publicly discussed requesting a statement of their opinions on several points and inquiring what would be the course of each of these gentlemen in certain contingencies in case of his attaining the presidency  these queries it may be presumed were of such a nature that general pierce might have answered them had he seen fit to do so to the satisfaction of major scott himself or to that of the southern democratic party whom it seemed his purpose to represent with not more than one exception the other statesmen and soldiers to whom the circular had been sent made a response  general pierce preserved an unbroken silence  it was equivalent to the withdrawal of all claims which he might be supposed to possess in reference to the contemplated office and he thereby repeated to the delegates of the national party the same avowal of distaste for public life which he had already made known to the democracy of his native state  he had thus done everything in his power actively or passivelyeverything that he could have done without showing such an estimate of his position before the country as was inconsistent with the modesty of his characterto avoid the perilous and burdensome honor of the candidacy  the convention met at the date above mentioned and continued its sessions during four days  thirtyfive ballotings were held with a continually decreasing prospect that the friends of any one of the gentlemen hitherto prominent before the people would succeed in obtaining the twothirds vote that was requisite for a nomination  thus far not a vote had been thrown for general pierce but at the thirtysixth ballot the delegation of old virginia brought forward his name  in the course of several more trials his strength increased very gradually at first but afterwards with a growing impetus until at the fortyninth ballot the votes were for franklin pierce two hundred and eightytwo and eleven for all other candidates  thus franklin pierce became the nominee of the convention and as quickly as the lightning flash could blazon it abroad his name was on every tongue from end to end of this vast country within an hour he grew to be illustrious  it would be a pretension which we do not mean to put forward to assert that whether considering the length and amount of his public services or his prominence before the country general pierce stood on equal ground with several of the distinguished men whose claims to use the customary phrase had been rejected in favor of his own  but no man be his public services or sacrifices what they might ever did or ever could possess in the slightest degree what we may term a legitimate claim to be elevated to the rulership of a free people  the nation would degrade itself and violate every principle upon which its institutions are founded by offering its majestic obedience to one of its citizens as a reward for whatever splendor of achievement  the conqueror may assert a claim such as it is to the sovereignty of the people whom he subjugates but with us americans when a statesman comes to the chief direction of affairs it is at the summons of the nation addressed to the servant whom it deems best fitted to spend his wisdom his strength and his life in its behalf  on this principle which is obviously the correct one a candidates previous services are entitled to consideration only as they indicate the qualities which may enable him to render higher services in the position which his countrymen choose that he shall occupy  what he has done is of no importance except as proving what he can do  and it is on this score because they see in his public course the irrefragable evidences of patriotism integrity and courage and because they recognize in him the noble gift of natural authority and have a prescience of the stately endowment of administrative genius that his fellowcitizens are about to summon franklin pierce to the presidency  to those who know him well the event comes not like accident but as a consummation which might have been anticipated from its innate fitness and as the final step of a career which all along has tended thitherward  it is not as a reward that he will take upon him the mighty burden of this office of which the toil and awful responsibility whiten the statesmans head and in which as in more than one instance we have seen the warrior encounters a deadlier risk than in the battlefield when general pierce received the news of his nomination it affected him with no thrill of joy but a sadness which for many days was perceptible in his deportment  it awoke in his heart the sense of religious dependencea sentiment that has been growing continually stronger through all the trials and experiences of his life and there was nothing feigned in that passage of his beautiful letter accepting the nomination in which he expresses his reliance upon heavenly support  the committee appointed by the baltimore convention conveyed to him the intelligence of his nomination in the following terms  a national convention of the democratic republican party which met at baltimore on the first tuesday in june unanimously nominated you as a candidate for the high trust of the president of the united states  we have been delegated to acquaint you with the nomination and earnestly to request that you will accept it  persuaded as we are that this office should never be pursued by an unchastened ambition it cannot be refused by a dutiful patriotism  the circumstances under which you will be presented for the canvass of your countrymen seem to be propitious to the interests which the constitution intrusts to our federal union and must be auspicious to your own name  you come before the people without the impulse of personal wishes and free from selfish expectations  you are identified with none of the distractions which have recently disturbed our country whilst you are known to be faithful to the constitutionto all its guaranties and compromises  you will be free to exercise your tried abilities within the path of duty in protecting that repose we happily enjoy and in giving efficacy and control to those cardinal principles that have already illustrated the party which has now selected you as its leaderprinciples that regard the security and prosperity of the whole country and the paramount power of its laws as indissolubly associated with the perpetuity of our civil and religious liberties  the convention did not pretermit the duty of reiterating those principles and you will find them prominently set forth in the resolutions it adopted  to these we respectfully invite your attention  it is firmly believed that to your talents and patriotism the security of our holy union with its expanded and expanding interests may be wisely trusted and that amid all the perils which may assail the constitution you will have the heart to love and the arm to defend it  we quote likewise general pierces reply  i have the honor to acknowledge your personal kindness in presenting me this day your letter officially informing me of my nomination by the democratic national convention as a candidate for the presidency of the united states  the surprise with which i received the intelligence of my nomination was not unmingled with painful solicitude and yet it is proper for me to say that the manner in which it was conferred was peculiarly gratifying  the delegation from new hampshire with all the glow of state pride and with all the warmth of personal regard would not have submitted my name to the convention nor would they have cast a vote for me under circumstances other than those which occurred  i shall always cherish with pride and gratitude the recollection of the fact that the voice which first pronounced and pronounced alone came from the mother of statesa pride and gratitude rising above any consequences that can betide me personally  may i not regard it as a fact pointing to the overthrow of sectional jealousies and looking to the permanent life and vigor of the union cemented by the blood of those who have passed to their rewarda union wonderful in its formation boundless in its hopes amazing in its destiny  i accept the nomination relying upon an abiding devotion to the interests honor and glory of the whole country but above and beyond all upon a power superior to all human mighta power which from the first gun of the revolution in every crisis through which we have passed in every hour of acknowledged peril when the dark clouds had shut down over us has interposed as if to baffle human wisdom outmarch human forecast and bring out of darkness the rainbow of promise  weak myself faith and hope repose there in security  i accept the nomination upon the platform adopted by the convention not because this is expected of me as a candidate but because the principles it embraces command the approbation of my judgment and with them i believe i can safely say there has been no word or act of my life in conflict  the news of his nomination went abroad over the union and far and wide there came a response in which was distinguishable a truer appreciation of some of general pierces leading traits than could have been anticipated considering the unobtrusive tenor of his legislative life and the lapse of time since he had entirely withdrawn himself from the nations eye  it was the marvellous and mystic influence of character in regard to which the judgment of the people is so seldom found erroneous and which conveys the perception of itself through some medium higher and deeper than the intellect  everywhere the country knows that a man of steadfast will true heart and generous qualities has been brought forward to receive the suffrages of his fellowcitizens  he comes before the people of the united states at a remarkable era in the history of this country and of the world  the two great parties of the nation appearat least to an observer somewhat removed from bothto have nearly merged into one another for they preserve the attitude of political antagonism rather through the effect of their old organizations than because any great and radical principles are at present in dispute between them  the measures advocated by the one party and resisted by the other through a long series of years have now ceased to be the pivots on which the election turns  the prominent statesmen so long identified with those measures will henceforth relinquish their controlling influence over public affairs  both parties it may likewise be said are united in one common purposethat of preserving our sacred union as the immovable basis from which the destinies not of america alone but of mankind at large may be carried upward and consummated and thus men stand together in unwonted quiet and harmony awaiting the new movement in advance which all these tokens indicate  it remains for the citizens of this great country to decide within the next few weeks whether they will retard the steps of human progress by placing at its head an illustrious soldier indeed a patriot and one indelibly stamped into the history of the past but who has already done his work and has not in him the spirit of the present or of the coming time or whether they will put their trust in a new man whom a life of energy and various activity has tested but not worn out and advance with him into the auspicious epoch upon which we are about to enter   note  we have done far less than justice to franklin pierces college standing in our statement in chapter i  some circumstances connected with this matter are too characteristic not to be reported  during the first two years pierce was extremely inattentive to his college duties bestowing only such modicum of time upon them as was requisite to supply the merest superficial acquaintance with the course of study for the recitation room  the consequence was that when the relative standing of the members of the class was first authoritatively ascertained in the junior year he found himself occupying precisely the lowest position in point of scholarship  in the first mortification of wounded pride he resolved never to attend another recitation and accordingly absented himself from college exercises of all kinds for several days expecting and desiring that some form of punishment such as suspension or expulsion would be the result  the faculty of the college however with a wise lenity took no notice of this behavior and at last having had time to grow cool and moved by the grief of his friend little and another classmate pierce determined to resume the routine of college duties  but said he to his friends if i do so you shall see a change  accordingly from that time forward he devoted himself to study  his mind having run wild for so long a period could be reclaimed only by the severest efforts of an iron resolution and for three months afterwards he rose at four in the morning toiled all day over his books and retired only at midnight allowing himself but four hours for sleep  with habit and exercise he acquired command over his intellectual powers and was no longer under the necessity of application so intense  but from the moment when he made his resolve until the close of his college life he never incurred a censure never was absent and then unavoidably but from two college exercises never went into the recitation room without a thorough acquaintance with the subject to be recited and finally graduated as the third scholar of his class nothing save the low standard of his previous scholarship prevented his taking a yet higher rank  the moral of this little story lies in the stern and continued exercise of selfcontrolling will which redeemed him from indolence completely changed the aspect of his character and made this the turning point of his life      chiefly about war matters  by a peaceable man   this article appeared in the atlantic monthly for july 1862 and is now first reprinted among hawthornes collected writings  the editor of the magazine objected to sundry paragraphs in the manuscript and these were cancelled with the consent of the author who himself supplied all the footnotes that accompanied the article when it was published  it has seemed best to retain them in the present reproduction  one of the suppressed passages in which president lincoln is described has since been printed and is therefore restored to its proper place in the following pagesg p l   here is no remoteness of life and thought no hermetically sealed seclusion except possibly that of the grave into which the disturbing influences of this war do not penetrate  of course the general heartquake of the country long ago knocked at my cottagedoor and compelled me reluctantly to suspend the contemplation of certain fantasies to which according to my harmless custom i was endeavoring to give a sufficiently lifelike aspect to admit of their figuring in a romance  as i make no pretensions to statecraft or soldiership and could promote the common weal neither by valor nor counsel it seemed at first a pity that i should be debarred from such unsubstantial business as i had contrived for myself since nothing more genuine was to be substituted for it  but i magnanimously considered that there is a kind of treason in insulating ones self from the universal fear and sorrow and thinking ones idle thoughts in the dread time of civil war and could a man be so cold and hardhearted he would better deserve to be sent to fort warren than many who have found their way thither on the score of violent but misdirected sympathies  i remembered the touching rebuke administered by king charles to that rural squire the echo of whose huntinghorn came to the poor monarchs ear on the morning before a battle where the sovereignty and constitution of england were to be set at a stake  so i gave myself up to reading newspapers and listening to the click of the telegraph like other people until after a great many months of such pastime it grew so abominably irksome that i determined to look a little more closely at matters with my own eyes  accordingly we set outa friend and myselftowards washington while it was still the long dreary january of our northern year though march in name nor were we unwilling to clip a little margin off the five months winter during which there is nothing genial in new england save the fireside  it was a clear frosty morning when we started  the sun shone brightly on snowcovered hills in the neighborhood of boston and burnished the surface of frozen ponds and the wintry weather kept along with us while we trundled through worcester and springfield and all those old familiar towns and through the villagecities of connecticut in new york the streets were afloat with liquid mud and slosh  over new jersey there was still a thin covering of snow with the face of nature visible through the rents in her white shroud though with little or no symptom of reviving life  but when we reached philadelphia the air was mild and balmy there was but a patch or two of dingy winter here and there and the bare brown fields about the city were ready to be green we had met the spring halfway in her slow progress from the south and if we kept onward at the same pace and could get through the rebel lines we should soon come to fresh grass fruitblossoms green peas strawberries and all such delights of early summer  on our way we heard many rumors of the war but saw few signs of it the people were staid and decorous according to their ordinary fashion and business seemed about as brisk as usualthough i suppose it was considerably diverted from its customary channels into warlike ones  in the cities especially in new york there was a rather prominent display of military goods at the shop windowssuch as swords with gilded scabbards and trappings epaulets carabines revolvers and sometimes a great iron cannon at the edge of the pavement as if mars had dropped one of his pocketpistols there while hurrying to the field  as railwaycompanions we had now and then a volunteer in his frenchgray greatcoat returning from furlough or a newmade officer travelling to join his regiment in his newmade uniform which was perhaps all of the military character that he had about himbut proud of his eaglebuttons and likely enough to do them honor before the gilt should be wholly dimmed  the country in short so far as bustle and movement went was more quiet than in ordinary times because so large a proportion of its restless elements had been drawn towards the seat of the conflict  but the air was full of a vague disturbance  to me at least it seemed so emerging from such a solitude as has been hinted at and the more impressible by rumors and indefinable presentiments since i had not lived like other men in an atmosphere of continual talk about the war a battle was momentarily expected on the potomac for though our army was still on the hither side of the river all of us were looking towards the mysterious and terrible manassas with the idea that somewhere in its neighborhood lay a ghastly battlefield yet to be fought but foredoomed of old to be bloodier than the one where we had reaped such shame  of all haunted places methinks such a destined field should be thickest thronged with ugly phantoms ominous of mischief through ages beforehand  beyond philadelphia there was a much greater abundance of military people  between baltimore and washington a guard seemed to hold every station along the railroad and frequently on the hillsides we saw a collection of weatherbeaten tents the peaks of which blackened with smoke indicated that they had been made comfortable by stoveheat throughout the winter  at several commanding positions we saw fortifications with the muzzles of cannon protruding from the ramparts the slopes of which were made of the yellow earth of that region and still unsodded whereas till these troublous times there have been no forts but what were grassgrown with the lapse of at least a lifetime of peace  our stoppingplaces were thronged with soldiers some of whom came through the cars asking for newspapers that contained accounts of the battle between the merrimack and monitor which had been fought the day before  a railwaytrain met us conveying a regiment out of washington to some unknown point and reaching the capital we filed out of the station between lines of soldiers with shouldered muskets putting us in mind of similar spectacles at the gates of european cities it was not without sorrow that we saw the free circulation of the nations lifeblood at the very heart moreover clogged with such strictures as these which have caused chronic diseases in almost all countries save our own  will the time ever come again in america when we may live half a score of years without once seeing the likeness of a soldier except it be in the festal march of a company on its summer tour  not in this generation i fear nor in the next nor till the millennium and even that blessed epoch as the prophecies seem to intimate will advance to the sound of the trumpet  one terrible idea occurs in reference to this matter  even supposing the war should end tomorrow and the army melt into the mass of the population within the year what an incalculable preponderance will there be of military titles and pretensions for at least half a century to come  every countryneighborhood will have its general or two its three or four colonels half a dozen majors and captains without endbesides noncommissioned officers and privates more than the recruiting offices ever knew ofall with their campaignstories which will become the staple of fireside talk forevermore  military merit or rather since that is not so readily estimated military notoriety will be the measure of all claims to civil distinctionone bulletheaded general will succeed another in the presidential chair and veterans will hold the offices at home and abroad and sit in congress and the state legislatures and fill all the avenues of public life  and yet i do not speak of this deprecatingly since very likely it may substitute something more real and genuine instead of the many shams on which men have heretofore founded their claims to public regard but it behooves civilians to consider their wretched prospects in the future and assume the military button before it is too late  we were not in time to see washington as a camp  on the very day of our arrival sixty thousand men had crossed the potomac on their march towards manassas and almost with their first step into the virginia mud the phantasmagory of a countless host and impregnable ramparts before which they had so long remained quiescent dissolved quite away  it was as if general mcclellan had thrust his sword into a gigantic enemy and beholding him suddenly collapse had discovered to himself and the world that he had merely punctured an enormously swollen bladder  there are instances of a similar character in old romances where great armies are long kept at bay by the arts of necromancers who build airy towers and battlements and muster warriors of terrible aspect and thus feign a defence of seeming impregnability until some bolder champion of the besiegers dashes forward to try an encounter with the foremost foeman and finds him melt away in the death grapple  with such heroic adventures let the march upon manassas be hereafter reckoned  the whole business though connected with the destinies of a nation takes inevitably a tinge of the ludicrous  the vast preparation of men and warlike materialthe majestic patience and docility with which the people waited through those weary and dreary monthsthe martial skill courage and caution with which our movement was ultimately madeand at last the tremendous shock with which we were brought suddenly up against nothing at all  the southerners show little sense of humor nowadays but i think they must have meant to provoke a laugh at our expense when they planted those quaker guns  at all events no other rebel artillery has played upon us with such overwhelming effect  the troops being gone we had the better leisure and opportunity to look into other matters  it is natural enough to suppose that the centre and heart of washington is the capitol and certainly in its outward aspect the world has not many statelier or more beautiful edifices nor any i should suppose more skilfully adapted to legislative purposes and to all accompanying needs  but etc etc  we omit several paragraphs here in which the author speaks of some prominent members of congress with a freedom that seems to have been not unkindly meant but might be liable to misconstruction  as he admits that he never listened to an important debate we can hardly recognize his qualifications to estimate these gentlemen in their legislative and oratorical capacities                                       we found one man however at the capitol who was satisfactorily adequate to the business which brought him thither  in quest of him we went through halls galleries and corridors and ascended a noble staircase balustraded with a dark and beautifully variegated marble from tennessee the richness of which is quite a sufficient cause for objecting to the secession of that state  at last we came to a barrier of pine boards built right across the stairs  knocking at a rough temporary door we thrust a card beneath and in a minute or two it was opened by a person in his shirtsleeves a middleaged figure neither tall nor short of teutonic build and aspect with an ample beard of a ruddy tinge and chestnut hair  he looked at us in the first place with keen and somewhat guarded eyes as if it were not his practice to vouchsafe any great warmth of greeting except upon sure ground of observation  soon however his look grew kindly and genial not that it had ever been in the least degree repulsive but only reserved and leutze allowed us to gaze at the cartoon of his great fresco and talked about it unaffectedly as only a man of true genius can speak of his own works  meanwhile the noble design spoke for itself upon the wall  a sketch in color which we saw afterwards helped us to form some distant and flickering notion of what the picture will be a few months hence when these bare outlines already so rich in thought and suggestiveness shall glow with a fire of their owna fire which i truly believe will consume every other pictorial decoration of the capitol or at least will compel us to banish those stiff and respectable productions to some less conspicuous gallery  the work will be emphatically original and american embracing characteristics that neither art nor literature have yet dealt with and producing new forms of artistic beauty from the natural features of the rockymountain region which leutze seems to have studied broadly and minutely  the garb of the hunters and wanderers of those deserts too under his free and natural management is shown as the most picturesque of costumes  but it would be doing this admirable painter no kind office to overlay his picture with any more of my colorless and uncertain words so i shall merely add that it looked full of energy hope progress irrepressible movement onward all represented in a momentary pause of triumph and it was most cheering to feel its good augury at this dismal time when our country might seem to have arrived at such a deadly standstill  it was an absolute comfort indeed to find leutze so quietly busy at this great national work which is destined to glow for centuries on the walls of the capitol if that edifice shall stand or must share its fate if treason shall succeed in subverting it with the union which it represents  it was delightful to see him so calmly elaborating his design while other men doubted and feared or hoped treacherously and whispered to one another that the nation would exist only a little longer or that if a remnant still held together its centre and seat of government would be far northward and westward of washington  but the artist keeps right on firm of heart and hand drawing his outlines with an unwavering pencil beautifying and idealizing our rude material life and thus manifesting that we have an indefeasible claim to a more enduring national existence  in honest truth what with the hopeinspiring influence of the design and what with leutzes undisturbed evolvement of it i was exceedingly encouraged and allowed these cheerful auguries to weigh against a sinister omen that was pointed out to me in another part of the capitol  the freestone walls of the central edifice are pervaded with great cracks and threaten to come thundering down under the immense weight of the iron domean appropriate catastrophe enough if it should occur on the day when we drop the southern stars out of our flag  everybody seems to be at washington and yet there is a singular dearth of imperatively noticeable people there  i question whether there are half a dozen individuals in all kinds of eminence at whom a stranger wearied with the contact of a hundred moderate celebrities would turn round to snatch a second glance  secretary seward to be surea pale largenosed elderly man of moderate stature with a decided originality of gait and aspect and a cigar in his mouthetc etc we are again compelled to interfere with our friends license of personal description and criticism  even cabinet ministers to whom the next few pages of the article were devoted had their private immunities which ought to be conscientiously observedunless indeed the writer chanced to have some very piquant motives for violating them                                       of course there was one other personage in the class of statesmen whom i should have been truly mortified to leave washington without seeing since temporarily at least and by force of circumstances he was the man of men  but a private grief had built up a barrier about him impeding the customary free intercourse of americans with their chief magistrate so that i might have come away without a glimpse of his very remarkable physiognomy save for a semiofficial opportunity of which i was glad to take advantage  the fact is we were invited to annex ourselves as supernumeraries to a deputation that was about to wait upon the president from a massachusetts whipfactory with a present of a splendid whip  our immediate party consisted only of four or five including major ben perley poore with his notebook and pencil but we were joined by several other persons who seemed to have been lounging about the precincts of the white house under the spacious porch or within the hall and who swarmed in with us to take the chances of a presentation nine oclock had been appointed as the time for receiving the deputation and we were punctual to the moment but not so the president who sent us word that he was eating his breakfast and would come as soon as he could  his appetite we were glad to think must have been a pretty fair one for we waited about half an hour in one of the antechambers and then were ushered into a receptionroom in one corner of which sat the secretaries of war and of the treasury expecting like ourselves the termination of the presidential breakfast  during this interval there were several new additions to our group one or two of whom were in a workinggarb so that we formed a very miscellaneous collection of people mostly unknown to each other and without any common sponsor but all with an equal right to look our headservant in the face  by and by there was a little stir on the staircase and in the passageway and in lounged a tall loosejointed figure of an exaggerated yankee port and demeanor whom as being about the homeliest man i ever saw yet by no means repulsive or disagreeable it was impossible not to recognize as uncle abe  unquestionably western man though he be and kentuckian by birth president lincoln is the essential representative of all yankees and the veritable specimen physically of what the world seems determined to regard as our characteristic qualities  it is the strangest and yet the fittest thing in the jumble of human vicissitudes that he out of so many millions unlooked for unselected by any intelligible process that could be based upon his genuine qualities unknown to those who chose him and unsuspected of what endowments may adapt him for his tremendous responsibility should have found the way open for him to fling his lank personality into the chair of statewhere i presume it was his first impulse to throw his legs on the counciltable and tell the cabinet ministers a story  there is no describing his lengthy awkwardness nor the uncouthness of his movement and yet it seemed as if i had been in the habit of seeing him daily and had shaken hands with him a thousand times in some village street so true was he to the aspect of the pattern american though with a certain extravagance which possibly i exaggerated still further by the delighted eagerness with which i took it in  if put to guess his calling and livelihood i should have taken him for a country schoolmaster as soon as anything else  he was dressed in a rusty black frockcoat and pantaloons unbrushed and worn so faithfully that the suit had adapted itself to the curves and angularities of his figure and had grown to be an outer skin of the man  he had shabby slippers on his feet  his hair was black still unmixed with gray stiff somewhat bushy and had apparently been acquainted with neither brush nor comb that morning after the disarrangement of the pillow and as to a nightcap uncle abe probably knows nothing of such effeminacies his complexion is dark and sallow betokening i fear an insalubrious atmosphere around the white house he has thick black eyebrows and an impending brow his nose is large and the lines about his mouth are very strongly defined  the whole physiognomy is as coarse a one as you would meet anywhere in the length and breadth of the states but withal it is redeemed illuminated softened and brightened by a kindly though serious look out of his eyes and an expression of homely sagacity that seems weighted with rich results of village experience  a great deal of native sense no bookish cultivation no refinement honest at heart and thoroughly so and yet in some sort slyat least endowed with a sort of tact and wisdom that are akin to craft and would impel him i think to take an antagonist in flank rather than to make a bullrun at him right in front  but on the whole i like this sallow queer sagacious visage with the homely human sympathies that warmed it and for my small share in the matter would as lief have uncle abe for a ruler as any man whom it would have been practicable to put in his place  immediately on his entrance the president accosted our member of congress who had us in charge and with a comical twist of his face made some jocular remark about the length of his breakfast  he then greeted us all round not waiting for an introduction but shaking and squeezing everybodys hand with the utmost cordiality whether the individuals name was announced to him or not  his manner towards us was wholly without pretence but yet had a kind of natural dignity quite sufficient to keep the forwardest of us from clapping him on the shoulder and asking him for a story  a mutual acquaintance being established our leader took the whip out of its case and began to read the address of presentation  the whip was an exceedingly long one its handle wrought in ivory by some artist in the massachusetts state prison i believe and ornamented with a medallion of the president and other equally beautiful devices and along its whole length there was a succession of golden bands and ferrules  the address was shorter than the whip but equally well made consisting chiefly of an explanatory description of these artistic designs and closing with a hint that the gift was a suggestive and emblematic one and that the president would recognize the use to which such an instrument should be put  this suggestion gave uncle abe rather a delicate task in his reply because slight as the matter seemed it apparently called for some declaration or intimation or faint foreshadowing of policy in reference to the conduct of the war and the final treatment of the rebels  but the presidents yankee aptness and nottobecaughtness stood him in good stead and he jerked or wiggled himself out of the dilemma with an uncouth dexterity that was entirely in character although without his gesticulation of eye and monthand especially the flourish of the whip with which he imagined himself touching up a pair of fat horsesi doubt whether his words would be worth recording even if i could remember them  the gist of the reply was that he accepted the whip as an emblem of peace not punishment and this great affair over we retired out of the presence in high goodhumor only regretting that we could not have seen the president sit down and fold up his legs which is said to be a most extraordinary spectacle or have heard him tell one of those delectable stories for which he is so celebrated  a good many of them are afloat upon the common talk of washington and are certainly the aptest pithiest and funniest little things imaginable though to be sure they smack of the frontier freedom and would not always bear repetition in a drawingroom or on the immaculate page of the atlantic   the above passage relating to president lincoln was one of those omitted from the article as originally published and the following note was appended to explain the omission which had been indicated by a line of points  we are compelled to omit two or three pages in which the author describes the interview and gives his idea of the personal appearance and deportment of the president  the sketch appears to have been written in a benign spirit and perhaps conveys a not inaccurate impression of its august subject but it lacks reverence and it pains us to see a gentleman of ripe age and who has spent years under the corrective influence of foreign institutions falling into the characteristic and most ominous fault of young america   good heavens what liberties have i been taking with one of the potentates of the earth and the man on whose conduct more important consequences depend than on that of any other historical personage of the century  but with whom is an american citizen entitled to take a liberty if not with his own chief magistrate  however lest the above allusions to president lincolns little peculiarities already well known to the country and to the world should be misinterpreted i deem it proper to say a word or two in regard to him of unfeigned respect and measurable confidence  he is evidently a man of keen faculties and what is still more to the purpose of powerful character  as to his integrity the people have that intuition of it which is never deceived before he actually entered upon his great office and for a considerable time afterwards there is no reason to suppose that he adequately estimated the gigantic task about to be imposed on him or at least had any distinct idea how it was to be managed and i presume there may have been more than one veteran politician who proposed to himself to take the power out of president lincolns hands into his own leaving our honest friend only the public responsibility for the good or ill success of the career  the extremely imperfect development of his statesmanly qualities at that period may have justified such designs  but the president is teachable by events and has now spent a year in a very arduous course of education he has a flexible mind capable of much expansion and convertible towards far loftier studies and activities than those of his early life and if he came to washington a backwoods humorist he has already transformed himself into as good a statesman to speak moderately as his primeminister  among other excursions to camps and places of interest in the neighborhood of washington we went one day to alexandria  it is a little port on the potomac with one or two shabby wharves and docks resembling those of a fishingvillage in new england and the respectable old brick town rising gently behind  in peaceful times it no doubt bore an aspect of decorous quietude and dulness but it was now thronged with the northern soldiery whose stir and bustle contrasted strikingly with the many closed warehouses the absence of citizens from their customary haunts and the lack of any symptom of healthy activity while armywagons trundled heavily over the pavements and sentinels paced the sidewalks and mounted dragoons dashed to and fro on military errands  i tried to imagine how very disagreeable the presence of a southern army would be in a sober town of massachusetts and the thought considerably lessened my wonder at the cold and shy regards that are cast upon our troops the gloom the sullen demeanor the declared or scarcely hidden sympathy with rebellion which are so frequent here  it is a strange thing in human life that the greatest errors both of men and women often spring from their sweetest and most generous qualities and so undoubtedly thousands of warmhearted sympathetic and impulsive persons have joined the rebels not from any real zeal for the cause but because between two conflicting loyalties they chose that which necessarily lay nearest the heart  there never existed any other government against which treason was so easy and could defend itself by such plausible arguments as against that of the united states  the anomaly of two allegiances of which that of the state comes nearest home to a mans feelings and includes the altar and the hearth while the general government claims his devotion only to an airy mode of law and has no symbol but a flag is exceedingly mischievous in this point of view for it has converted crowds of honest people into traitors who seem to themselves not merely innocent but patriotic and who die for a bad cause with as quiet a conscience as if it were the best  in the vast extent of our countrytoo vast by far to be taken into one small human heartwe inevitably limit to our own state or at farthest to our own section that sentiment of physical love for the soil which renders an englishman for example so intensely sensitive to the dignity and wellbeing of his little island that one hostile foot treading anywhere upon it would make a bruise on each individual breast  if a man loves his individual state therefore and is content to be ruined with her let us shoot him if we can but allow him an honorable burial in the soil he fights for  we do not thoroughly comprehend the authors drift in the foregoing paragraph but are inclined to think its tone reprehensible and its tendency impolitic in the present stage of our national difficulties  in alexandria we visited the tavern in which colonel ellsworth was killed and saw the spot where he fell and saw the stairs below whence jackson fired the fatal shot and where he himself was slain a moment afterwards so that the assassin and his victim must have met on the threshold of the spiritworld and perhaps came to a better understanding before they had taken many steps on the other side  ellsworth was too generous to bear an immortal grudge for a deed like that done in hot blood and by no skulking enemy  the memorialhunters have completely cut away the original woodwork around the spot with their pocketknives and the staircase balustrade and floor as well as the adjacent doors and doorframes have recently been renewed the walls moreover are covered with new paperhangings the former having been torn off in tatters and thus it becomes something like a metaphysical question whether the place of the murder actually exists  driving out of alexandria we stopped on the edge of the city to inspect an old slavepen which is one of the lions of the place but a very poor one and a little farther on we came to a brick church where washington used sometimes to attend servicea prerevolutionary edifice with ivy growing over its walls though not very luxuriantly  reaching the open country we saw forts and camps on all sides some of the tents being placed immediately on the ground while others were raised over a basement of logs laid lengthwise like those of a loghut or driven vertically into the soil in a circlethus forming a solid wall the chinks closed up with virginia mud and above it the pyramidal shelter of the tent  here were in progress all the occupations and all the idleness of the soldier in the tented field some were cooking the companyrations in pots hung over fires in the open air some played at ball or developed their muscular power by gymnastic exercise some read newspapers some smoked cigars or pipes and many were cleaning their arms or accoutrementsthe more carefully perhaps because their division was to be reviewed by the commanderinchief that afternoon others sat on the ground while their comrades cut their hairit being a soldierly fashion and for excellent reasons to crop it within an inch of the skull others finally lay asleep in breasthigh tents with their legs protruding into the open air  we paid a visit to fort ellsworth and from its ramparts which have been heaped up out of the muddy soil within the last few months and will require still a year or two to make them verdant we had a beautiful view of the potomac a truly majestic river and the surrounding country  the fortifications so numerous in all this region and now so unsightly with their bare precipitous sides will remain as historic monuments grassgrown and picturesque memorials of an epoch of terror and suffering they will serve to make our country dearer and more interesting to us and afford fit soil for poetry to root itself in for this is a plant which thrives best in spots where blood has been spilt long ago and grows in abundant clusters in old ditches such as the moat around fort ellsworth will be a century hence  it may seem to be paying dear for what many will reckon but a worthless weed but the more historical associations we can link with our localities the richer will be the daily life that feeds upon the past and the more valuable the things that have been long established so that our children will be less prodigal than their fathers in sacrificing good institutions to passionate impulses and impracticable theories  this herb of grace let us hope will be found in the old footprints of the war  even in an aesthetic point of view however the war has done a great deal of enduring mischief by causing the devastation of great tracts of woodland scenery in which this part of virginia would appear to be very rich  around all the encampments and everywhere along the road we saw the bare sites of what had evidently been tracts of hardwood forest indicated by the unsightly stumps of wellgrown trees not smoothly felled by regular axemen but hacked haggled and unevenly amputated as by a sword or other miserable tool in an unskilful hand  fifty years will not repair this desolation  an army destroys everything before and around it even to the very grass for the sites of the encampments are converted into barren esplanades like those of the squares in french cities where not a blade of grass is allowed to grow  as to the other symptoms of devastation and obstruction such as deserted houses unfenced fields and a general aspect of nakedness and ruin i know not how much may be due to a normal lack of neatness in the rural life of virginia which puts a squalid face even upon a prosperous state of things but undoubtedly the war must have spoilt what was good and made the bad a great deal worse  the carcasses of horses were scattered along the wayside  one very pregnant token of a social system thoroughly disturbed was presented by a party of contrabands escaping out of the mysterious depths of secessia and its strangeness consisted in the leisurely delay with which they trudged forward as dreading no pursuer and encountering nobody to turn them back  they were unlike the specimens of their race whom we are accustomed to see at the north and in my judgment were far more agreeable  so rudely were they attiredas if their garb had grown upon them spontaneouslyso picturesquely natural in manners and wearing such a crust of primeval simplicity which is quite polished away from the northern black man that they seemed a kind of creature by themselves not altogether human but perhaps quite as good and akin to the fawns and rustic deities of olden times  i wonder whether i shall excite anybodys wrath by saying this  it is no great matter  at all events i felt most kindly towards these poor fugitives but knew not precisely what to wish in their behalf nor in the least how to help them  for the sake of the manhood which is latent in them i would not have turned them back but i should have felt almost as reluctant on their own account to hasten them forward to the strangers land and i think my prevalent idea was that whoever may be benefited by the results of this war it will not be the present generation of negroes the childhood of whose race is now gone forever and who must henceforth fight a hard battle with the world on very unequal terms  on behalf of my own race i am glad and can only hope that an inscrutable providence means good to both parties  there is an historical circumstance known to few that connects the children of the puritans with these africans of virginia in a very singular way  they are our brethren as being lineal descendants from the mayflower the fated womb of which in her first voyage sent forth a brood of pilgrims on plymouth rock and in a subsequent one spawned slaves upon the southern soila monstrous birth but with which we have an instinctive sense of kindred and so are stirred by an irresistible impulse to attempt their rescue even at the cost of blood and ruin  the character of our sacred ship i fear may suffer a little by this revelation but we must let her white progeny offset her dark oneand two such portents never sprang from an identical source before  while we drove onward a young officer on horseback looked earnestly into the carriage and recognized some faces that he had seen before so he rode along by our side and we pestered him with queries and observations to which he responded more civilly than they deserved  he was on general mcclellans staff and a gallant cavalier highbooted with a revolver in his belt and mounted on a noble horse which trotted hard and high without disturbing the rider in his accustomed seat  his face had a healthy hue of exposure and an expression of careless hardihood and as i looked at him it seemed to me that the war had brought good fortune to the youth of this epoch if to none beside since they now make it their daily business to ride a horse and handle a sword instead of lounging listlessly through the duties occupations pleasuresall tedious aliketo which the artificial state of society limits a peaceful generation  the atmosphere of the camp and the smoke of the battlefield are morally invigorating the hardy virtues flourish in them the nonsense dies like a wilted weed  the enervating effects of centuries of civilization vanish at once and leave these young men to enjoy a life of hardship and the exhilarating sense of dangerto kill men blamelessly or to be killed gloriouslyand to be happy in following out their native instincts of destruction precisely in the spirit of homers heroes only with some considerable change of mode one touch of nature makes not only the whole world but all time akin set men face to face with weapons in their hands and they are as ready to slaughter one another now after playing at peace and goodwill for so many years as in the rudest ages that never heard of peacesocieties and thought no wine so delicious as what they quaffed from an enemys skull  indeed if the report of a congressional committee may be trusted that oldfashioned kind of goblet has again come into use at the expense of our northern headpiecesa costly drinkingcup to him that furnishes it  heaven forgive me for seeming to jest upon such a subjectonly it is so odd when we measure our advances from barbarism and find ourselves just here  we hardly expected this outbreak in favor of war from the peaceable man but the justness of our cause makes us all soldiers at heart however quiet in our outward life we have heard of twenty quakers in a single company of a pennsylvania regiment  we now approached general mcclellans headquarters which at that time were established at fairfield seminary  the edifice was situated on a gentle elevation amid very agreeable scenery and at a distance looked like a gentlemans seat  preparations were going forward for reviewing a division of ten or twelve thousand men the various regiments composing which had begun to array themselves on an extensive plain where methought there was a more convenient place for a battle than is usually found in this broken and difficult country  two thousand cavalry made a portion of the troops to be reviewed  by and by we saw a pretty numerous troop of mounted officers who were congregated on a distant part of the plain and whom we finally ascertained to be the commanderinchiefs staff with mcclellan himself at their head  our party managed to establish itself in a position conveniently close to the general to whom moreover we had the honor of an introduction and he bowed on his horseback with a good deal of dignity and martial courtesy but no airs nor fuss nor pretension beyond what his character and rank inevitably gave him  now at that juncture and in fact up to the present moment there was and is a most fierce and bitter outcry and detraction loud and low against general mcclellan accusing him of sloth imbecility cowardice treasonable purposes and in short utterly denying his ability as a soldier and questioning his integrity as a man  nor was this to be wondered at for when before in all history do we find a general in command of half a million of men and in presence of an enemy inferior in numbers and no better disciplined than his own troops leaving it still debatable after the better part of a year whether he is a soldier or no  the question would seem to answer itself in the very asking nevertheless being most profoundly ignorant of the art of war like the majority of the generals critics and on the other hand having some considerable impressibility by mens characters i was glad of the opportunity to look him in the face and to feel whatever influence might reach me from his sphere  so i stared at him as the phrase goes with all the eyes i had and the reader shall have the benefit of what i saw to which he is the more welcome because in writing this article i feel disposed to be singularly frank and can scarcely restrain myself from telling truths the utterance of which i should get slender thanks for  the general was dressed in a simple darkblue uniform without epaulets booted to the knee and with a cloth cap upon his head and at first sight you might have taken him for a corporal of dragoons of particularly neat and soldierlike aspect and in the prime of his age and strength  he is only of middling stature but his build is very compact and sturdy with broad shoulders and a look of great physical vigor which in fact he is said to possesshe and beauregard having been rivals in that particular and both distinguished above other men his complexion is dark and sanguine with dark hair  he has a strong bold soldierly face full of decision a roman nose by no means a thin prominence but very thick and firm and if he follows it which i should think likely it may be pretty confidently trusted to guide him aright his profile would make a more effective likeness than the full face which however is much better in the real man than in any photograph that i have seen  his forehead is not remarkably large but comes forward at the eyebrows it is not the brow nor countenance of a prominently intellectual man not a natural student i mean or abstract thinker but of one whose office it is to handle things practically and to bring about tangible results  his face looked capable of being very stern but wore in its repose when i saw it an aspect pleasant and dignified it is not in its character an american face nor an english one  the man on whom he fixes his eye is conscious of him  in his natural disposition he seems calm and selfpossessed sustaining his great responsibilities cheerfully without shrinking or weariness or spasmodic effort or damage to his health but all with quiet deepdrawn breaths just as his broad shoulders would bear up a heavy burden without aching beneath it  after we had had sufficient time to peruse the man so far as it could be done with one pair of very attentive eyes the general rode off followed by his cavalcade and was lost to sight among the troops  they received him with loud shouts by the eager uproar of whichnow near now in the centre now on the outskirts of the division and now sweeping back towards us in a great volume of soundwe could trace his progress through the ranks  if he is a coward or a traitor or a humbug or anything less than a brave true and able man that mass of intelligent soldiers whose lives and honor he had in charge were utterly deceived and so was this present writer for they believed in him and so did i and had i stood in the ranks should have shouted with the lustiest of them  of course i may be mistaken my opinion on such a point is worth nothing although my impression may be worth a little more neither do i consider the generals antecedents as bearing very decided testimony to his practical soldiership  a thorough knowledge of the science of war seems to be conceded to him he is allowed to be a good military critic but all this is possible without his possessing any positive qualities of a great general just as a literary critic may show the profoundest acquaintance with the principles of epic poetry without being able to produce a single stanza of an epic poem  nevertheless i shall not give up my faith in general mcclellans soldiership until he is defeated nor in his courage and integrity even then  another of our excursions was to harpers ferrythe directors of the baltimore and ohio railroad having kindly invited us to accompany them on the first trip over the newly laid track after its breaking up by the rebels  it began to rain in the early morning pretty soon after we left washington and continued to pour a cataract throughout the day so that the aspect of the country was dreary where it would otherwise have been delightful as we entered among the hillscenery that is formed by the subsiding swells of the alleghanies  the latter part of our journey lay along the shore of the potomac in its upper course where the margin of that noble river is bordered by gray overhanging crags beneath whichand sometimes right through themthe railroad takes its way  in one place the rebels had attempted to arrest a train by precipitating an immense mass of rock down upon the track by the side of which it still lay deeply imbedded in the ground and looking as if it might have lain there since the deluge  the scenery grew even more picturesque as we proceeded the bluffs becoming very bold in their descent upon the river which at harpers ferry presents as striking a vista among the hills as a painter could desire to see  but a beautiful landscape is a luxury and luxuries are thrown away amid discomfort and when we alighted in the tenacious mud and almost fathomless puddle on the hither side of the ferry the ultimate point to which the cars proceeded since the railroad bridge had been destroyed by the rebels i cannot remember that any very rapturous emotions were awakened by the scenery  we paddled and floundered over the ruins of the track and scrambling down an embankment crossed the potomac by a pontoonbridge a thousand feet in length over the narrow line of whichlevel with the river and rising and subsiding with itgeneral banks had recently led his whole army with its ponderous artillery and heavy laden wagons  yet our own tread made it vibrate  the broken bridge of the railroad was a little below us and at the base of one of its massive piers in the rocky bed of the river lay a locomotive which the rebels had precipitated there  as we passed over we looked towards the virginia shore and beheld the little town of harpers ferry gathered about the base of a round hill and climbing up its steep acclivity so that it somewhat resembled the etruscan cities which i have seen among the apennines rushing as it were down an apparently breakneck height  about midway of the ascent stood a shabby brick church towards which a difficult path went scrambling up the precipice indicating one would say a very fervent aspiration on the part of the worshippers unless there was some easier mode of access in another direction  immediately on the shore of the potomac and extending back towards the town lay the dismal ruins of the united states arsenal and armory consisting of piles of broken bricks and a waste of shapeless demolition amid which we saw gunbarrels in heaps of hundreds together  they were the relics of the conflagration bent with the heat of the fire and rusted with the wintry rain to which they had since been exposed  the brightest sunshine could not have made the scene cheerful nor have taken away the gloom from the dilapidated town for besides the natural shabbiness and decayed unthrifty look of a virginian village it has an inexpressible forlornness resulting from the devastations of war and its occupation by both armies alternately yet there would be a less striking contrast between southern and new england villages if the former were as much in the habit of using white paint as we are  it is prodigiously efficacious in putting a bright face upon a bad matter  there was one small shop which appeared to have nothing for sale  a single man and one or two boys were all the inhabitants in view except the yankee sentinels and soldiers belonging to massachusetts regiments who were scattered about pretty numerously  a guardhouse stood on the slope of the hill and in the level street at its base were the offices of the provostmarshal and other military authorities to whom we forthwith reported ourselves  the provostmarshal kindly sent a corporal to guide us to the little building which john brown seized upon as his fortress and which after it was stormed by the united states marines became his temporary prison  it is an old enginehouse rusty and shabby like every other work of mans hands in this godforsaken town and stands fronting upon the river only a short distance from the bank nearly at the point where the pontoonbridge touches the virginia shore in its front wall on each side of the door are two or three ragged loopholes which john brown perforated for his defence knocking out merely a brick or two so as to give himself and his garrison a sight over their rifles  through these orifices the sturdy old man dealt a good deal of deadly mischief among his assailants until they broke down the door by thrusting against it with a ladder and tumbled headlong in upon him  i shall not pretend to be an admirer of old john brown any farther than sympathy with whittiers excellent ballad about him may go nor did i expect ever to shrink so unutterably from any apophthegm of a sage whose happy lips have uttered a hundred golden sentences as from that saying perhaps falsely attributed to so honored a source that the death of this bloodstained fanatic has made the gallows as venerable as the cross  nobody was ever more justly hanged  he won his martyrdom fairly and took it firmly  he himself i am persuaded such was his natural integrity would have acknowledged that virginia had a right to take the life which he had staked and lost although it would have been better for her in the hour that is fast coming if she could generously have forgotten the criminality of his attempt in its enormous folly  on the other hand any commonsensible man looking at the matter unsentimentally must have felt a certain intellectual satisfaction in seeing him hanged if it were only in requittal of his preposterous miscalculation of possibilities  can it be a son of old massachusetts who utters this abominable sentiment  for shame  but coolly as i seem to say these things my yankee heart stirred triumphantly when i saw the use to which john browns fortress and prisonhouse has now been put  what right have i to complain of any other mans foolish impulses when i cannot possibly control my own  the enginehouse is now a place of confinement for rebel prisoners  a massachusetts soldier stood on guard but readily permitted our whole party to enter  it was a wretched place  a room of perhaps twentyfive feet square occupied the whole interior of the building having an iron stove in its centre whence a rusty funnel ascended towards a hole in the roof which served the purposes of ventilation as well as for the exit of smoke  we found ourselves right in the midst of the rebels some of whom lay on heaps of straw asleep or at all events giving no sign of consciousness others sat in the corners of the room huddled close together and staring with a lazy kind of interest at the visitors two were astride of some planks playing with the dirtiest pack of cards that i ever happened to see  there was only one figure in the least military among all these twenty prisoners of wara man with a dark intelligent moustached face wearing a shabby cotton uniform which he had contrived to arrange with a degree of soldierly smartness though it had evidently borne the brunt of a very filthy campaign  he stood erect and talked freely with those who addressed him telling them his place of residence the number of his regiment the circumstances of his capture and such other particulars as their northern inquisitiveness prompted them to ask i liked the manliness of his deportment he was neither ashamed nor afraid nor in the slightest degree sullen peppery or contumacious but bore himself as if whatever animosity he had felt towards his enemies was left upon the battlefield and would not be resumed till he had again a weapon in his hand  neither could i detect a trace of hostile feeling in the countenance words or manner of any prisoner there  almost to a man they were simple bumpkinlike fellows dressed in homespun clothes with faces singularly vacant of meaning but sufficiently goodhumored a breed of men in short such as i did not suppose to exist in this country although i have seen their like in some other parts of the world  they were peasants and of a very low order a class of people with whom our northern rural population has not a single trait in common  they were exceedingly respectfulmore so than a rustic newenglander ever dreams of being towards anybody except perhaps his minister and had they worn any hats they would probably have been selfconstrained to take them off under the unusual circumstance of being permitted to hold conversation with welldressed persons  it is my belief that not a single bumpkin of them all the moustached soldier always excepted had the remotest comprehension of what they had been fighting for or how they had deserved to be shut up in that dreary hole nor possibly did they care to inquire into this latter mystery but took it as a godsend to be suffered to lie here in a heap of unwashed human bodies well warmed and well foddered today and without the necessity of bothering themselves about the possible hunger and cold of tomorrow  their dark prisonlife may have seemed to them the sunshine of all their lifetime  there was one poor wretch a wildbeast of a man at whom i gazed with greater interest than at his fellows although i know not that each one of them in their semibarbarous moral state might not have been capable of the same savage impulse that had made this particular individual a horror to all beholders  at the close of some battle or skirmish a wounded union soldier had crept on hands and knees to his feet and besought his assistancenot dreaming that any creature in human shape in the christian land where they had so recently been brethren could refuse it  but this man this fiend if you prefer to call him so though i would not advise it flung a bitter curse at the poor northerner and absolutely trampled the soul out of his body as he lay writhing beneath his feet  the fellows face was horribly ugly but i am not quite sure that i should have noticed it if i had not known his story  he spoke not a word and met nobodys eye but kept staring upward into the smoky vacancy towards the ceiling where it might be he beheld a continual portraiture of his victims horrorstricken agonies i rather fancy however that his moral sense was yet too torpid to trouble him with such remorseful visions and that for his own part he might have had very agreeable reminiscences of the soldiers death if other eyes had not been bent reproachfully upon him and warned him that something was amiss  it was this reproach in other mens eyes that made him look aside  he was a wildbeast as i began with sayingan unsophisticated wildbeastwhile the rest of us are partially tamed though still the scent of blood excites some of the savage instincts of our nature  what this wretch needed in order to make him capable of the degree of mercy and benevolence that exists in us was simply such a measure of moral and intellectual development as we have received and in my mind the present war is so well justified by no other consideration as by the probability that it will free this class of southern whites from a thraldom in which they scarcely begin to be responsible beings  so far as the education of the heart is concerned the negroes have apparently the advantage of them and as to other schooling it is practically unattainable by black or white  looking round at these poor prisoners therefore it struck me as an immense absurdity that they should fancy us their enemies since whether we intend it so or no they have a far greater stake on our success than we can possibly have  for ourselves the balance of advantages between defeat and triumph may admit of question  for them all truly valuable things are dependent on our complete success for thence would come the regeneration of a peoplethe removal of a foul scurf that has overgrown their life and keeps then in a state of disease and decrepitude one of the chief symptoms of which is that the more they suffer and are debased the more they imagine themselves strong and beautiful  no human effort on a grand scale has ever yet resulted according to the purpose of its projectors  the advantages are always incidental  mans accidents are gods purposes  we miss the good we sought and do the good we little cared for  the author seems to imagine that he has compressed a great deal of meaning into these little hard dry pellets of aphoristic wisdom  we disagree with him  the counsels of wise and good men are often coincident with the purposes of providence and the present war promises to illustrate our remark  our government evidently knows when and where to lay its finger upon its most available citizens for quite unexpectedly we were joined by some other gentlemen scarcely less competent than ourselves in a commission to proceed to fortress monroe and examine into things in general  of course official propriety compels us to be extremely guarded in our description of the interesting objects which this expedition opened to our view  there can be no harm however in stating that we were received by the commander of the fortress with a kind of acid goodnature or mild cynicism that indicated him to be a humorist characterized by certain rather pungent peculiarities yet of no unamiable cast  he is a small thin old gentleman set off by a large pair of brilliant epauletsthe only pair so far as my observation went that adorn the shoulders of any officer in the union army  either for our inspection or because the matter had already been arranged he drew out a regiment of zouaves that formed the principal part of his garrison and appeared at their head sitting on horseback with rigid perpendicularity and affording us a vivid idea of the disciplinarian of baron steubens school  there can be no question of the generals military qualities he must have been especially useful in converting raw recruits into trained and efficient soldiers  but valor and martial skill are of so evanescent a character hardly less fleeting than a womans beauty that government has perhaps taken the safer course in assigning to this gallant officer though distinguished in former wars no more active duty than the guardianship of an apparently impregnable fortress  the ideas of military men solidify and fossilize so fast while military science makes such rapid advances that even here there might be a difficulty  an active diversified and therefore a youthful ingenuity is required by the quick exigencies of this singular war  fortress monroe for example in spite of the massive solidity of its ramparts its broad and deep moat and all the contrivances of defence that were known at the not very remote epoch of its construction is now pronounced absolutely incapable of resisting the novel modes of assault which may be brought to bear upon it  it can only be the flexible talent of a young man that will evolve a new efficiency out of its obsolete strength  it is a pity that old men grow unfit for war not only by their incapacity for new ideas but by the peaceful and unadventurous tendencies that gradually possess themselves of the once turbulent disposition which used to snuff the battlesmoke as its congenial atmosphere  it is a pity because it would be such an economy of human existence if timestricken people whose value i have the better right to estimate as reckoning myself one of them could snatch from their juniors the exclusive privilege of carrying on the war  in case of death upon the battlefield how unequal would be the comparative sacrifice on one part a few unenjoyable years the little remnant of a life grown torpid on the other the many fervent summers of manhood in its spring and prime with all that they include of possible benefit to mankind then too a bullet offers such a brief and easy way such a pretty little orifice through which the weary spirit might seize the opportunity to be exhaled  if i had the ordering of these matters fifty should be the tenderest age at which a recruit might be accepted for training at fiftyfive or sixty i would consider him eligible for most kinds of military duty and exposure excluding that of a forlorn hope which no soldier should be permitted to volunteer upon short of the ripe age of seventy  as a general rule these venerable combatants should have the preference for all dangerous and honorable service in the order of their seniority with a distinction in favor of those whose infirmities might render their lives less worth the keeping  methinks there would be no more bull runs a warrior with gout in his toe or rheumatism in his joints or with one foot in the grave would make a sorry fugitive  on this admirable system the productive part of the population would be undisturbed even by the bloodiest war and best of all those thousands upon thousands of our northern girls whose proper mates will perish in camphospitals or on southern battlefields would avoid their doom of forlorn oldmaidenhood  but no doubt the plan will be poohpoohed down by the war department though it could scarcely be more disastrous than the one on which we began the war when a young army was struck with paralysis through the age of its commander  the waters around fortress monroe were thronged with a gallant array of ships of war and transports wearing the union flagold glory as i hear it called in these days  a little withdrawn from our national fleet lay two french frigates and in another direction an english sloop under that banner which always makes itself visible like a red portent in the air wherever there is strife  in pursuance of our official duty which had no ascertainable limits we went on board the flagship and were shown over every part of her and down into her depths inspecting her gallant crew her powerful armament her mighty engines and her furnaces where the fires are always kept burning as well at midnight as at noon so that it would require only five minutes to put the vessel under full steam  this vigilance has been felt necessary ever since the merrimack made that terrible dash from norfolk  splendid as she is however and provided with all but the very latest improvements in naval armament the minnesota belongs to a class of vessels that will be built no more nor ever fight another battlebeing as much a thing of the past as any of the ships of queen elizabeths time which grappled with the galleons of the spanish armada  on her quarterdeck an elderly flagofficer was pacing to and fro with a selfconscious dignity to which a touch of the gout or rheumatism perhaps contributed a little additional stiffness  he seemed to be a gallant gentleman but of the old slow and pompous school of naval worthies who have grown up amid rules forms and etiquette which were adopted fullblown from the british navy into ours and are somewhat too cumbrous for the quick spirit of today  this order of nautical heroes will probably go down along with the ships in which they fought valorously and strutted most intolerably  how can an admiral condescend to go to sea in an iron pot  what space and elbowroom can be found for quarterdeck dignity in the cramped lookout of the monitor or even in the twentyfeet diameter of her cheesebox  all the pomp and splendor of naval warfare are gone by  henceforth there must come up a race of enginemen and smokeblackened cannoneers who will hammer away at their enemies under the direction of a single pair of eyes and even heroism so deadly a gripe is science laying on our noble possibilitieswill become a quality of very minor importance when its possessor cannot break through the iron crust of his own armament and give the world a glimpse of it  at no great distance from the minnesota lay the strangestlooking craft i ever saw  it was a platform of iron so nearly on a level with the water that the swash of the waves broke over it under the impulse of a very moderate breeze and on this platform was raised a circular structure likewise of iron and rather broad and capacious but of no great height it could not be called a vessel at all it was a machineand i have seen one of somewhat similar appearance employed in cleaning out the docks or for lack of a better similitude it looked like a gigantic rattrap  it was ugly questionable suspicious evidently mischievous nay i will allow myself to call it devilish for this was the new warfiend destined along with others of the same breed to annihilate whole navies and batter down old supremacies  the wooden walls of old england cease to exist and a whole history of naval renown reaches its period now that the monitor comes smoking into view while the billows dash over what seems her deck and storms bury even her turret in green water as she burrows and snorts along oftener under the surface than above  the singularity of the object has betrayed me into a more ambitious vein of description than i often indulge and after all i might as well have contented myself with simply saying that she looked very queer  going on board we were surprised at the extent and convenience of her interior accommodations  there is a spacious wardroom nine or ten feet in height besides a private cabin for the commander and sleeping accommodations on an ample scale the whole well lighted and ventilated though beneath the surface of the water  forward or aft for it is impossible to tell stem from stern the crew are relatively quite as well provided for as the officers  it was like finding a palace with all its conveniences under the sea  the inaccessibility the apparent impregnability of this submerged iron fortress are most satisfactory the officers and crew get down through a little hole in the deck hermetically seal themselves and go below and until they see fit to reappear there would seem to be no power given to man whereby they can be brought to light  a storm of cannonshot damages them no more than a handful of dried peas  we saw the shotmarks made by the great artillery of the merrimack on the outer casing of the iron tower they were about the breadth and depth of shallow saucers almost imperceptible dents with no corresponding bulge on the interior surface  in fact the thing looked altogether too safe though it may not prove quite an agreeable predicament to be thus boxed up in impenetrable iron with the possibility one would imagine of being sent to the bottom of the sea and even there not drowned but stifled  nothing however can exceed the confidence of the officers in this new craft  it was pleasant to see their benign exultation in her powers of mischief and the delight with which they exhibited the circumvolutory movement of the tower the quick thrusting forth of the immense guns to deliver their ponderous missiles and then the immediate recoil and the security behind the closed portholes  yet even this will not long be the last and most terrible improvement in the science of war  already we hear of vessels the armament of which is to act entirely beneath the surface of the water so that with no other external symptoms than a great bubbling and foaming and gush of smoke and belch of smothered thunder out of the yeasty waves there shall be a deadly fight going on belowand by and by a sucking whirlpool as one of the ships goes down  the monitor was certainly an object of great interest but on our way to newport news whither we next went we saw a spectacle that affected us with far profounder emotion  it was the sight of the few sticks that are left of the frigate congress stranded near the shoreand still more the masts of the cumberland rising midway out of the water with a tattered rag of a pennant fluttering from one of them  the invisible hull of the latter ship seems to be careened over so that the three masts stand slantwise the rigging looks quite unimpaired except that a few ropes dangle loosely from the yards  the flag which never was struck thank heaven is entirely hidden under the waters of the bay but is still doubtless waving in its old place although it floats to and fro with the swell and reflex of the tide instead of rustling on the breeze  a remnant of the dead crew still man the sunken ship and sometimes a drowned body floats up to the surface  that was a noble fight  when was ever a better word spoken than that of commodore smith the father of the commander of the congress when he heard that his sons ship was surrendered  then joes dead said he and so it proved  nor can any warrior be more certain of enduring renown than the gallant morris who fought so well the final battle of the old system of naval warfare and won glory for his country and himself out of inevitable disaster and defeat  that last gun from the cumberland when her deck was half submerged sounded the requiem of many sinking ships then went down all the navies of europe and our own old ironsides and all and trafalgar and a thousand other fights became only a memory never to be acted over again and thus our brave countrymen come last in the long procession of heroic sailors that includes blake and nelson and so many mariners of england and other mariners as brave as they whose renown is our native inheritance  there will be other battles but no more such tests of seamanship and manhood as the battles of the past and moreover the millennium is certainly approaching because human strife is to be transferred from the heart and personality of man into cunning contrivances of machinery which by and by will fight out our wars with only the clank and smash of iron strewing the field with broken engines but damaging nobodys little finger except by accident such is obviously the tendency of modern improvement  but in the mean while so long as manhood retains any part of its pristine value no country can afford to let gallantry like that of morris and his crew any more than that of the brave worden pass unhonored and unrewarded  if the government do nothing let the people take the matter into their own hands and cities give him swords gold boxes festivals of triumph and if he needs it heaps of gold  let poets brood upon the theme and make themselves sensible how much of the past and future is contained within its compass till its spirit shall flash forth in the lightning of a song  from these various excursions and a good many others including one to manassas we gained a pretty lively idea of what was going on but after all if compelled to pass a rainy day in the hall and parlors of willards hotel it proved about as profitably spent as if we had floundered through miles of virginia mud in quest of interesting matter this hotel in fact may be much more justly called the centre of washington and the union than either the capitol the white house or the state department  everybody may be seen there  it is the meetingplace of the true representatives of the countrynot such as are chosen blindly and amiss by electors who take a folded ballot from the hand of a local politician and thrust it into the ballotbox unread but men who gravitate or are attracted hither by real business or a native impulse to breathe the intensest atmosphere of the nations life or a genuine anxiety to see how this lifeanddeath struggle is going to deal with us nor these only but all manner of loafers  never in any other spot was there such a miscellany of people  you exchange nods with governors of sovereign states you elbow illustrious men and tread on the toes of generals you hear statesmen and orators speaking in their familiar tones  you are mixed up with officeseekers wirepullers inventors artists poets prosers including editors armycorrespondents attaches of foreign journals and longwinded talkers clerks diplomatists mailcontractors railwaydirectors until your own identity is lost among them  occasionally you talk with a man whom you have never before heard of and are struck with the brightness of a thought and fancy that there is more wisdom hidden among the obscure than is anywhere revealed among the famous  you adopt the universal habit of the place and call for mintjulep a whiskeyskin a gincocktail a brandy smash or a glass of pure old rye for the conviviality of washington sets in at an early hour and so far as i had opportunity of observing never terminates at any hour and all these drinks are continually in request by almost all these people  a constant atmosphere of cigarsmoke too envelops the motley crowd and forms a sympathetic medium in which men meet more closely and talk more frankly than in any other kind of air if legislators would smoke in session they might speak truer words and fewer of them and bring about more valuable results  it is curious to observe what antiquated figures and costumes sometimes make their appearance at willards  you meet elderly men with frilled shirtfronts for example the fashion of which adornment passed away from among the people of this world half a century ago  it is as if one of stuarts portraits were walking abroad  i see no way of accounting for this except that the trouble of the times the impiety of traitors and the peril of our sacred union and constitution have disturbed in their honored graves some of the venerable fathers of the country and summoned them forth to protest against the meditated and halfaccomplished sacrilege  if it be so their wonted fires are not altogether extinguished in their ashesin their throats i might rather sayfor i beheld one of these excellent old men quaffing such a horn of bourbon whiskey as a toper of the present century would be loath to venture upon  but really one would be glad to know where these strange figures come from  it shows at any rate how many remote decaying villages and countryneighborhoods of the north and forestnooks of the west and old mansionhouses in cities are shaken by the tremor of our native soil so that men long hidden in retirement put on the garments of their youth and hurry out to inquire what is the matter  the old men whom we see here have generally more marked faces than the young ones and naturally enough since it must be an extraordinary vigor and renewability of life that can overcome the rusty sloth of age and keep the senior flexible enough to take an interest in new things whereas hundreds of commonplace young men come hither to stare with eyes of vacant wonder and with vague hopes of finding out what they are fit for and this war we may say so much in its favor has been the means of discovering that important secret to not a few  we saw at willards many who had thus found out for themselves that when nature gives a young man no other utilizable faculty she must be understood as intending him for a soldier  the bulk of the army had moved out of washington before we reached the city yet it seemed to me that at least two thirds of the guests and idlers at the hotel were one or another token of the military profession  many of them no doubt were selfcommissioned officers and had put on the buttons and the shoulderstraps and booted themselves to the knees merely because captain in these days is so good a travellingname  the majority however had been duly appointed by the president but might be none the better warriors for that  it was pleasant occasionally to distinguish a grizzly veteran among this crowd of carpetknightsthe trained soldier of a lifetime long ago from west point who had spent his prime upon the frontier and very likely could show an indian bulletmark on his breastif such decorations won in an obscure warfare were worth the showing now  the question often occurred to meand to say the truth it added an indefinable piquancy to the scenewhat proportion of all these people whether soldiers or civilians were true at heart to the union and what part were tainted more or less with treasonable sympathies and wishes even if such had never blossomed into purpose  traitors there were among themno doubt of thatcivil servants of the public very reputable persons who yet deserved to dangle from a cord or men who buttoned military coats over their breasts hiding perilous secrets there which might bring the gallant officer to stand palefaced before a file of musketeers with his open grave behind him  but without insisting upon such picturesque criminality and punishment as this an observer who kept both his eyes and heart open would find it by no means difficult to discern that many residents and visitors of washington so far sided with the south as to desire nothing more nor better than to see everything reestablished a little worse than its former basis  if the cabinet of richmond were transferred to the federal city and the north awfully snubbed at least and driven back within its old political limits they would deem it a happy day  it is no wonder and if we look at the matter generously no unpardonable crime  very excellent people hereabouts remember the many dynasties in which the southern character has been predominant and contrast the genial courtesy the warm and graceful freedom of that region with what they call though i utterly disagree with them the frigidity of our northern manners and the western plainness of the president  they have a conscientious though mistaken belief that the south was driven out of the union by intolerable wrong on our part and that we are responsible for having compelled true patriots to love only half their country instead of the whole and brave soldiers to draw their swords against the constitution which they would once have died forto draw them too with a bitterness of animosity which is the only symptom of brotherhood since brothers hate each other best that any longer exists  they whisper these things with tears in their eyes and shake their heads and stoop their poor old shoulders at the tidings of another and another northern victory which in their opinion puts farther off the remote the already impossible chance of a reunion  i am sorry for them though it is by no means a sorrow without hope since the matter has gone so far there seems to be no way but to go on winning victories and establishing peace and a truer union in another generation at the expense probably of greater trouble in the present one than any other people ever voluntarily suffered  we woo the south as the lion wooes his bride it is a rough courtship but perhaps love and a quiet household may come of it at last  or if we stop short of that blessed consummation heaven was heaven still as milton sings after lucifer and a third part of the angels had seceded from its golden palacesand perhaps all the more heavenly because so many gloomy brows and soured vindictive hearts had gone to plot ineffectual schemes of mischief elsewhere   we regret the innuendo in the concluding sentence  the war can never be allowed to terminate except in the complete triumph of northern principles  we hold the event in our own hands and may choose whether to terminate it by the methods already so successfully used or by other means equally within our control and calculated to be still more speedily efficacious  in truth the work is already done  we should be sorry to cast a doubt on the peaceable mans loyalty but he will allow us to say that we consider him premature in his kindly feelings towards traitors and sympathizers with treason  as the author himself says of john brown and so applied we thought it an atrociously coldblooded dictum any commonsensible man would feel an intellectual satisfaction in seeing them hanged were it only for their preposterous miscalculation of possibilities  there are some degrees of absurdity that put reason herself into a rage and affect us like an intolerable crimewhich this rebellion is into the bargain      alice doanes appeal   on a pleasant afternoon of june it was my good fortune to be the companion of two young ladies in a walk  the direction of our course being left to me i led them neither to legges hill nor to the cold spring nor to the rude shores and old batteries of the neck nor yet to paradise though if the latter place were rightly named my fair friends would have been at home there  we reached the outskirts of the town and turning aside from a street of tanners and curriers began to ascend a hill which at a distance by its dark slope and the even line of its summit resembled a green rampart along the road  it was less steep than its aspect threatened  the eminence formed part of an extensive tract of pasture land and was traversed by cow paths in various directions but strange to tell though the whole slope and summit were of a peculiar deep green scarce a blade of grass was visible from the base upward this deceitful verdure was occasioned by a plentiful crop of woodwax which wears the same dark and glossy green throughout the summer except at one short period when it puts forth a profusion of yellow blossoms at that season to a distant spectator the hill appears absolutely overlaid with gold or covered with a glory of sunshine even beneath a clouded sky  but the curious wanderer on the hill will perceive that all the grass and everything that should nourish man or beast has been destroyed by this vile and ineradicable weed its tufted roots make the soil their own and permit nothing else to vegetate among them so that a physical curse may be said to have blasted the spot where guilt and frenzy consummated the most execrable scene that our history blushes to record  for this was the field where superstition won her darkest triumph the high place where our fathers set up their shame to the mournful gaze of generations far remote  the dust of martyrs was beneath our feet  we stood on gallows hill  for my own part i have often courted the historic influence of the spot but it is singular how few come on pilgrimage to this famous hill how many spend their lives almost at its base and never once obey the summons of the shadowy past as it beckons them to the summit  till a year or two since this portion of our history had been very imperfectly written and as we are not a people of legend or tradition it was not every citizen of our ancient town that could tell within half a century so much as the date of the witchcraft delusion  recently indeed an historian has treated the subject in a manner that will keep his name alive in the only desirable connection with the errors of our ancestry by converting the hill of their disgrace into an honorable monument of his own antiquarian lore and of that better wisdom which draws the moral while it tells the tale  but we are a people of the present and have no heartfelt interest in the olden time  every fifth of november in commemoration of they know not what or rather without an idea beyond the momentary blaze the young men scare the town with bonfires on this haunted height but never dream of paying funeral honors to those who died so wrongfully and without a coffin or a prayer were buried here  though with feminine susceptibility my companions caught all the melancholy associations of the scene yet these could but imperfectly overcome the gayety of girlish spirits  their emotions came and went with quick vicissitude and sometimes combined to form a peculiar and delicious excitement the mirth brightening the gloom into a sunny shower of feeling and a rainbow in the mind  my own more sombre mood was tinged by theirs  with now a merry word and next a sad one we trod among the tangled weeds and almost hoped that our feet would sink into the hollow of a witchs grave  such vestiges were to be found within the memory of man but have vanished now and with them i believe all traces of the precise spot of the executions  on the long and broad ridge of the eminence there is no very decided elevation of any one point nor other prominent marks except the decayed stumps of two trees standing near each other and here and there the rocky substance of the hill peeping just above the woodwax  there are few such prospects of town and village woodland and cultivated field steeples and country seats as we beheld from this unhappy spot no blight had fallen on old essex all was prosperity and riches healthfully distributed  before us lay our native town extending from the foot of the hill to the harbor level as a chess board embraced by two arms of the sea and filling the whole peninsula with a close assemblage of wooden roofs overtopped by many a spire and intermixed with frequent heaps of verdure where trees threw up their shade from unseen trunks  beyond was the bay and its islands almost the only objects in a country unmarked by strong natural features on which time and human toil had produced no change  retaining these portions of the scene and also the peaceful glory and tender gloom of the declining sun we threw in imagination a veil of deep forest over the land and pictured a few scattered villages and this old town itself a village as when the prince of hell bore sway there  the idea thus gained of its former aspect its quaint edifices standing far apart with peaked roofs and projecting stories and its single meetinghouse pointing up a tall spire in the midst the vision in short of the town in 1692 served to introduce a wondrous tale of those old times  i had brought the manuscript in my pocket  it was one of a series written years ago when my pen now sluggish and perhaps feeble because i have not munch to hope or fear was driven by stronger external motives and a more passionate impulse within than i am fated to feel again three or four of these tales had appeared in the token after a long time and various adventures but had encumbered me with no troublesome notoriety even in my birthplace  one great heap had met a brighter destiny they had fed the flames thoughts meant to delight the world and endure for ages had perished in a moment and stirred not a single heart but mine  the story now to be introduced and another chanced to be in kinder custody at the time and thus by no conspicuous merits of their own escaped destruction  the ladies in consideration that i had never before intruded my performances on them by any but the legitimate medium through the press consented to hear me read  i made them sit down on a mossgrown rock close by the spot where we chose to believe that the death tree had stood  after a little hesitation on my part caused by a dread of renewing my acquaintance with fantasies that had lost their charm in the ceaseless flux of mind i began the tale which opened darkly with the discovery of a murder    a hundred years and nearly half that time have elapsed since the body of a murdered man was found at about the distance of three miles on the old road to boston  he lay in a solitary spot on the bank of a small lake which the severe frost of december had covered with a sheet of ice beneath this it seemed to have been the intention of the murderer to conceal his victim in a chill and watery grave the ice being deeply hacked perhaps with the weapon that had slain him though its solidity was too stubborn for the patience of a man with blood upon his hand  the corpse therefore reclined on the earth but was separated from the road by a thick growth of dwarf pines  there had been a slight fall of snow during the night and as if nature were shocked at the deed and strove to hide it with her frozen tears a little drifted heap had partly buried the body and lay deepest over the pale dead face  an early traveller whose dog had led him to the spot ventured to uncover the features but was affrighted by their expression  a look of evil and scornful triumph had hardened on them and made death so lifelike and so terrible that the beholder at once took flight as swiftly as if the stiffened corpse would rise up and follow  i read on and identified the body as that of a young man a stranger in the country but resident during several preceding months in the town which lay at our feet  the story described at some length the excitement caused by the murder the unavailing quest after the perpetrator the funeral ceremonies and other commonplace matters in the course of which i brought forward the personages who were to move among the succeeding events  they were but three  a young man and his sister the former characterized by a diseased imagination and morbid feelings the latter beautiful and virtuous and instilling something of her own excellence into the wild heart of her brother but not enough to cure the deep taint of his nature  the third person was a wizard a small gray withered man with fiendish ingenuity in devising evil and superhuman power to execute it but senseless as an idiot and feebler than a child to all better purposes  the central scene of the story was an interview between this wretch and leonard doane in the wizards hut situated beneath a range of rocks at some distance from the town  they sat beside a smouldering fire while a tempest of wintry rain was beating on the roof  the young man spoke of the closeness of the tie which united him and alice the consecrated fervor of their affection from childhood upwards their sense of lonely sufficiency to each other because they only of their race had escaped death in a night attack by the indians  he related his discovery or suspicion of a secret sympathy between his sister and walter brome and told how a distempered jealousy had maddened him  in the following passage i threw a glimmering light on the mystery of the tale  searching continued leonard into the breast of walter brome i at length found a cause why alice must inevitably love him  for he was my very counterpart  i compared his mind by each individual portion and as a whole with mine  there was a resemblance from which i shrunk with sickness and loathing and horror as if my own features had come and stared upon me in a solitary place or had met me in struggling through a crowd  nay the very same thoughts would often express themselves in the same words from our lips proving a hateful sympathy in our secret souls his education indeed in the cities of the old world and mine in the rude wilderness had wrought a superficial difference  the evil of his character also had been strengthened and rendered prominent by a reckless and ungoverned life while mine had been softened and purified by the gentle and holy nature of alice  but my soul had been conscious of the germ of all the fierce and deep passions and of all the many varieties of wickedness which accident had brought to their full maturity in him  nor will i deny that in the accursed one i could see the withered blossom of every virtue which by a happier culture had been made to bring forth fruit in me  now here was a man whom alice might love with all the strength of sisterly affection added to that impure passion which alone engrosses all the heart  the stranger would have more than the love which had been gathered to me from the many graves of our householdand i be desolate   leonard doane went on to describe the insane hatred that had kindled his heart into a volume of hellish flame  it appeared indeed that his jealousy had grounds so far as that walter brome had actually sought the love of alice who also had betrayed an undefinable but powerful interest in the unknown youth  the latter in spite of his passion for alice seemed to return the loathful antipathy of her brother the similarity of their dispositions made them like joint possessors of an individual nature which could not become wholly the property of one unless by the extinction of the other  at last with the sane devil in each bosom they chanced to meet they two on a lonely road  while leonard spoke the wizard had sat listening to what he already knew yet with tokens of pleasurable interest manifested by flashes of expression across his vacant features by grisly smiles and by a word here and there mysteriously filling up some void in the narrative  but when the young man told how walter brome had taunted him with indubitable proofs of the shame of alice and before the triumphant sneer could vanish from his face had died by her brothers hand the wizard laughed aloud leonard started but just then a gust of wind came down the chimney forming itself into a close resemblance of the slow unvaried laughter by which he had been interrupted  i was deceived thought he and thus pursued his fearful story   i trod out his accursed soul and knew that he was dead for my spirit bounded as if a chain had fallen from it and left me free  but the burst of exulting certainty soon fled and was succeeded by a torpor over my brain and a dimness before my eyes with the sensation of one who struggles through a dream  so i bent down over the body of walter brome gazing into his face and striving to make my soul glad with the thought that he in very truth lay dead before me  i know not what space of time i had thus stood nor how the vision came  but it seemed to me that the irrevocable years since childhood had rolled back and a scene that had long been confused and broken in my memory arrayed itself with all its first distinctness  methought i stood a weeping infant by my fathers hearth by the cold and bloodstained hearth where he lay dead i heard the childish wail of alice and my own cry arose with hers as we beheld the features of our parent fierce with the strife and distorted with the pain in which his spirit had passed away  as i gazed a cold wind whistled by and waved my fathers hair  immediately i stood again in the lonesome road no more a sinless child but a man of blood whose tears were falling fast over the face of his dead enemy  but the delusion was not wholly gone that face still wore a likeness of my father and because my soul shrank from the fixed glare of the eyes i bore the body to the lake and would have buried it there  but before his icy sepulchre was hewn i heard the voices of two travellers and fled   such was the dreadful confession of leonard doane  and now tortured by the idea of his sisters guilt yet sometimes yielding to a conviction of her purity stung with remorse for the death of walter brome and shuddering with a deeper sense of some unutterable crime perpetrated as he imagined in madness or a dream moved also by dark impulses as if a fiend were whispering him to meditate violence against the life of alice he had sought this interview with the wizard who on certain conditions had no power to withhold his aid in unravelling the mystery  the tale drew near its close   the moon was bright on high the blue firmament appeared to glow with an inherent brightness the greater stars were burning in their spheres the northern lights threw their mysterious glare far over the horizon the few small clouds aloft were burdened with radiance but the sky with all its variety of light was scarcely so brilliant as the earth  the rain of the preceding night had frozen as it fell and by that simple magic had wrought wonders  the trees were hung with diamonds and manycolored gems the houses were overlaid with silver and the streets paved with slippery brightness a frigid glory was flung over all familiar things from the cottage chimney to the steeple of the meetinghouse that gleamed upward to the sky  this living world where we sit by our firesides or go forth to meet beings like ourselves seemed rather the creation of wizard power with so much of resemblance to known objects that a man might shudder at the ghostly shape of his old beloved dwelling and the shadow of a ghostly tree before his door  one looked to behold inhabitants suited to such a town glittering in icy garments with motionless features cold sparkling eyes and just sensation enough in their frozen hearts to shiver at each others presence   by this fantastic piece of description and more in the same style i intended to throw a ghostly glimmer round the reader so that his imagination might view the town through a medium that should take off its everyday aspect and make it a proper theatre for so wild a scene as the final one  amid this unearthly show the wretched brother and sister were represented as setting forth at midnight through the gleaming streets and directing their steps to a graveyard where all the dead had been laid from the first corpse in that ancient town to the murdered man who was buried three days before  as they went they seemed to see the wizard gliding by their sides or walking dimly on the path before them but here i paused and gazed into the faces of my two fair auditors to judge whether even on the hill where so many had been brought to death by wilder tales than this i might venture to proceed  their bright eyes were fixed on me their lips apart  i took courage and led the fated pair to a new made grave where for a few moments in the bright and silent midnight they stood alone  but suddenly there was a multitude of people among the graves   each family tomb had given up its inhabitants who one by one through distant years had been borne to its dark chamber but now came forth and stood in a pale group together  there was the gray ancestor the aged mother and all their descendants some withered and full of years like themselves and others in their prime there too were the children who went prattling to the tomb and there the maiden who yielded her early beauty to deaths embrace before passion had polluted it  husbands and wives arose who had lain many years side by side and young mothers who had forgotten to kiss their first babes though pillowed so long on their bosoms  many had been buried in the habiliments of life and still wore their ancient garb some were old defenders of the infant colony and gleamed forth in their steelcaps and bright breastplates as if starting up at an indian warcry other venerable shapes had been pastors of the church famous among the new england clergy and now leaned with hands clasped over their gravestones ready to call the congregation to prayer there stood the early settlers those old illustrious ones the heroes of tradition and fireside legends the men of history whose features had been so long beneath the sod that few alive could have remembered them there too were faces of former townspeople dimly recollected from childhood and others whom leonard and alice had wept in later years but who now were most terrible of all by their ghastly smile of recognition  all in short were there the dead of other generations whose mossgrown names could scarce be read upon their tombstones and their successors whose graves were not yet green all whom black funerals had followed slowly thither now reappeared where the mourners left them  yet none but souls accursed were there and fiends counterfeiting the likeness of departed saints  the countenances of those venerable men whose very features had been hallowed by lives of piety were contorted now by intolerable pain or hellish passion and now by an unearthly and derisive merriment  had the pastors prayed all saintlike as they seemed it had been blasphemy  the chaste matrons too and the maidens with untasted lips who had slept in their virgin graves apart from all other dust now wore a look from which the two trembling mortals shrank as if the unimaginable sin of twenty worlds were collected there  the faces of fond lovers even of such as had pined into the tomb because there their treasure was were bent on one another with glances of hatred and smiles of bitter scorn passions that are to devils what love is to the blest  at times the features of those who had passed from a holy life to heaven would vary to and fro between their assumed aspect and the fiendish lineaments whence they had been transformed  the whole miserable multitude both sinful souls and false spectres of good men groaned horribly and gnashed their teeth as they looked upward to the calm loveliness of the midnight sky and beheld those homes of bliss where they must never dwell  such was the apparition though too shadowy for language to portray for here would be the moonbeams on the ice glittering through a warriors breastplate and there the letters of a tombstone on the form that stood before it and whenever a breeze went by it swept the old mens hoary heads the womens fearful beauty and all the unreal throng into one indistinguishable cloud together   i dare not give the remainder of the scene except in a very brief epitome  this company of devils and condemned souls had come on a holiday to revel in the discovery of a complicated crime as foul a one as ever was imagined in their dreadful abode  in the course of the tale the reader had been permitted to discover that all the incidents were results of the machinations of the wizard who had cunningly devised that walter brome should tempt his unknown sister to guilt and shame and himself perish by the hand of his twinbrother  i described the glee of the fiends at this hideous conception and their eagerness to know if it were consummated  the story concluded with the appeal of alice to the spectre of walter brome his reply absolving her from every stain and the trembling awe with which ghost and devil fled as from the sinless presence of an angel  the sun had gone down  while i held my page of wonders in the fading light and read how alice and her brother were left alone among the graves my voice mingled with the sigh of a summer wind which passed over the hilltop with the broad and hollow sound as of the flight of unseen spirits  not a word was spoken till i added that the wizards grave was close beside us and that the woodwax had sprouted originally from his unhallowed bones  the ladies started perhaps their cheeks might have grown pale had not the crimson west been blushing on them but after a moment they began to laugh while the breeze took a livelier motion as if responsive to their mirth  i kept an awful solemnity of visage being indeed a little piqued that a narrative which had good authority in our ancient superstitions and would have brought even a church deacon to gallows hill in old witch times should now be considered too grotesque and extravagant for timid maids to tremble at though it was past supper time i detained them a while longer on the hill and made a trial whether truth were more powerful than fiction  we looked again towards the town no longer arrayed in that icy splendor of earth tree and edifice beneath the glow of a wintry midnight which shining afar through the gloom of a century had made it appear the very home of visions in visionary streets  an indistinctness had begun to creep over the mass of buildings and blend them with the intermingled treetops except where the roof of a statelier mansion and the steeples and brick towers of churches caught the brightness of some cloud that yet floated in the sunshine  twilight over the landscape was congenial to the obscurity of time  with such eloquence as my share of feeling and fancy could supply i called back hoar antiquity and bade my companions imagine an ancient multitude of people congregated on the hillside spreading far below clustering on the steep old roofs and climbing the adjacent heights wherever a glimpse of this spot might be obtained  i strove to realize and faintly communicate the deep unutterable loathing and horror the indignation the affrighted wonder that wrinkled on every brow and filled the universal heart  see the whole crowd turns pale and shrinks within itself as the virtuous emerge from yonder street  keeping pace with that devoted company i described them one by one here tottered a woman in her dotage knowing neither the crime imputed her nor its punishment there another distracted by the universal madness till feverish dreams were remembered as realities and she almost believed her guilt  one a proud man once was so broken down by the intolerable hatred heaped upon him that he seemed to hasten his steps eager to hide himself in the grave hastily dug at the foot of the gallows  as they went slowly on a mother looked behind and beheld her peaceful dwelling she cast her eyes elsewhere and groaned inwardly yet with bitterest anguish for there was her little son among the accusers i watched the face of an ordained pastor who walked onward to the same death his lips moved in prayer no narrow petition for himself alone but embracing all his fellowsufferers and the frenzied multitude he looked to heaven and trod lightly up the hill  behind their victims came the afflicted a guilty and miserable band villains who had thus avenged themselves on their enemies and viler wretches whose cowardice had destroyed their friends lunatics whose ravings had chimed in with the madness of the land and children who had played a game that the imps of darkness might have envied them since it disgraced an age and dipped a peoples hands in blood  in the rear of the procession rode a figure on horseback so darkly conspicuous so sternly triumphant that my hearers mistook him for the visible presence of the fiend himself but it was only his good friend cotton mather proud of his wellwon dignity as the representative of all the hateful features of his time the one bloodthirsty man in whom were concentrated those vices of spirit and errors of opinion that sufficed to madden the whole surrounding multitude  and thus i marshalled them onward the innocent who were to die and the guilty who were to grow old in long remorsetracing their every step by rock and shrub and broken track till their shadowy visages had circled round the hilltop where we stood  i plunged into my imagination for a blacker horror and a deeper woe and pictured the scaffold  but here my companions seized an arm on each side their nerves were trembling and sweeter victory still i had reached the seldom trodden places of their hearts and found the wellspring of their tears  and now the past had done all it could  we slowly descended watching the lights as they twinkled gradually through the town and listening to the distant mirth of boys at play and to the voice of a young girl warbling somewhere in the dusk a pleasant sound to wanderers from old witch times  yet ere we left the hill we could not but regret that there is nothing on its barren summit no relic of old nor lettered stone of later days to assist the imagination in appealing to the heart  we build the memorial column on the height which our fathers made sacred with their blood poured out in a holy cause  and here in dark funereal stone should rise another monument sadly commemorative of the errors of an earlier race and not to be cast down while the human heart has one infirmity that may result in crime      the ancestral footstep  outlines of an english romance   introductory note  septimius felton was the outgrowth of a project formed by hawthorne during his residence in england of writing a romance the scene of which should be laid in that country but this project was afterwards abandoned giving place to a new conception in which the visionary search for means to secure an earthly immortality was to form the principal interest  the new conception took shape in the uncompleted dolliver romance  the two themes of course were distinct but by a curious process of thought one grew directly out of the other the whole history constitutes in fact a chapter in what may be called the genealogy of a romance  there remained after septimius felton had been published certain manuscripts connected with the scheme of an english story  one of these manuscripts was written in the form of a journalized narrative the author merely noting the date of what he wrote as he went along the other was a more extended sketch of much greater bulk and without date but probably produced several years later  it was not originally intended by those who at the time had charge of hawthornes papers that either of these incomplete writings should be laid before the public because they manifestly had not been left by him in a form which he would have considered as warranting such a course  but since the second and larger manuscript has been published under the title of dr grimshawes secret it has been thought best to issue the present sketch so that the two documents may be examined together  their appearance places in the hands of readers the entire process of development leading to the septimius and the dolliver romance  they speak for themselves much more efficiently than any commentator can expect to do and little therefore remains to be said beyond a few words of explanation in regard to the following pages  the notebooks show that the plan of an english romance turning upon the fact that an emigrant to america had carried away a family secret which should give his descendant the power to ruin the family in the mother country had occurred to hawthorne as early as april 1855  in august of the same year he visited smithells hall in bolton le moors concerning which he had already heard its legend of the bloody footstep and from that time on the idea of this footprint on the thresholdstone of the ancestral mansion seems to have associated itself inextricably with the dreamy substance of his yet unshaped romance  indeed it leaves its mark broadly upon sibyl dacys wild legend in septimius felton and reappears in the last paragraph of that story  but so far as we can know at this day nothing definite was done until after his departure for italy  it was then while staying in rome that he began to put upon paper that plot which had first occupied his thoughts three years before in the scant leisure allowed him by his duties at the liverpool consulate  of leisure there was not a great deal at rome either for as the french and italian notebooks show sightseeing and social intercourse took up a good deal of his time and the daily record in his journal likewise had to be kept up  but he set to work resolutely to embody so far as he might his stray imaginings upon the haunting english theme and to give them connected form  april 1 1858 he began and then nearly two weeks passed before he found an opportunity to resume april 13th being the date of the next passage  by may he gets fully into swing so that day after day with but slight breaks he carries on the story always increasing in interest for as who read as for him who improvised  thus it continues until may 19th by which time he has made a tolerably complete outline filled in with a good deal of detail here and there  although the sketch is cast in the form of a regular narrative one or two gaps occur indicating that the author had thought out certain points which he then took for granted without making note of them  brief scenes passages of conversation and of narration follow one another after the manner of a finished story alternating with synopses of the plot and queries concerning particulars that needed further study confidences of the romancer to himself which form certainly a valuable contribution to literary history  the manuscript closes with a rapid sketch of the conclusion and the way in which it is to be executed  succinctly what we have is a romance in embryo one moreover that never attained to a viable stature and constitution during his lifetime it naturally would not have been put forward as demanding public attention and in consideration of that fact it has since been withheld from the press by the decision of his daughter in whom the title to it vests  students of literary art however and many more general readers will i think be likely to discover in it a charm all the greater for its being in parts only indicated since as it stands it presents the precise condition of a work of fiction in its first stage  the unfinished grimshawe was another development of the same theme and the septimius a later sketch with a new element introduced  but the present experimental fragment to which it has been decided to give the title of the ancestral footstep possesses a freshness and spontaneity recalling the peculiar fascination of those chalk or pencil outlines with which great masters in the graphic art have been wont to arrest their fleeting glimpses of a composition still unwrought  it would not be safe to conclude from the large amount of preliminary writing done with a view to that romance that hawthorne always adopted this laborious mode of making several drafts of a book  on the contrary it is understood that his habit was to mature a design so thoroughly in his mind before attempting to give it actual existence on paper that but little rewriting was needed  the circumstance that he was obliged to write so much that did not satisfy him in this case may account partly for his relinquishing the theme as one which for him had lost its seductiveness through too much recasting  it need be added only that the original manuscript from which the following pages are printed through the medium of an exact copy is singularly clear and fluent  not a single correction occurs throughout but here and there a word is omitted obviously by mere accident and these omissions have been supplied  the correction in each case is marked by brackets in this printed reproduction  the sketch begins abruptly but there is no reason to suppose that anything preceded it except the unrecorded musings in the authors mind and one or two memoranda in the english notebooks  we must therefore imagine the central figure middleton who is the american descendant of an old english family as having been properly introduced and then pass at once to the opening sentences  the rest will explain itself  g p l     the ancestral footstep  outlines of an english romance   i  april 1 1858  thursdayhe had now been travelling long in those rich portions of england where he would most have wished to find the object of his pursuit and many had been the scenes which he would willingly have identified with that mentioned in the ancient timeyellowed record which he bore about with him  it is to be observed that undertaken at first half as the amusement the unreal object of a grown mans playday it had become more and more real to him with every step of the way that he followed it up along those green english lanes it seemed as if everything would bring him close to the mansion that he sought every morning he went on with renewed hopes nor did the evening though it brought with it no success bring with it the gloom and heaviness of a real disappointment  in all his life including its earliest and happiest days he had never known such a spring and zest as now filled his veins and gave lightsomeness to his limbs this spirit gave to the beautiful country which he trod a still richer beauty than it had ever borne and he sought his ancient home as if he had found his way into paradise and were there endeavoring to trace out the sight site of eves bridal bower the birthplace of the human race and its glorious possibilities of happiness and high performance  in these sweet and delightful moods of mind varying from one dream to another he loved indeed the solitude of his way but likewise he loved the facility which his pursuit afforded him of coming in contact with many varieties of men and he took advantage of this facility to an extent which it was not usually his impulse to do  but now he came forth from all reserves and offered himself to whomever the chances of the way offered to him with a ready sensibility that made its way through every barrier that even english exclusiveness in whatever rank of life could set up  the plastic character of middleton was perhaps a variety of american nature only presenting itself under an individual form he could throw off the man of our day and put on a ruder nature but then it was with a certain fineness that made this only a distinction between it and the central truth  he found less variety of form in the english character than he had been accustomed to see at home but perhaps this was in consequence of the external nature of his acquaintance with it for the view of one well accustomed to a people and of a stranger to them differs in thisthat the latter sees the homogeneity the one universal character the ground work of the whole while the former sees a thousand little differences which distinguish the individual men apart to such a degree that they seem hardly to have any resemblance among themselves  but just at the period of his journey when we take him up middleton had been for two or three days the companion of an old man who interested him more than most of his wayside companions the more especially as he seemed to be wandering without an object or with such a dreamy object as that which led middletons own steps onward  he was a plain old man enough but with a pale strongfeatured face and white hair a certain picturesqueness and venerableness which middleton fancied might have befitted a richer garb than he now wore  in much of their conversation too he was sensible that though the stranger betrayed no acquaintance with literature nor seemed to have conversed with cultivated minds yet the results of such acquaintance and converse were here  middleton was inclined to think him however an old man one of those itinerants such as wordsworth represented in the excursion who smooth themselves by the attrition of the world and gain a knowledge equivalent to or better than that of books from the actual intellect of man awake and active around them  often during the short period since their companionship originated middleton had felt impelled to disclose to the old man the object of his journey and the wild tale by which after two hundred years he had been blown as it were across the ocean and drawn onward to commence this search  the old mans ordinary conversation was of a nature to draw forth such a confidence as this frequently turning on the traditions of the wayside the reminiscences that lingered on the battlefields of the roses or of the parliament like flowers nurtured by the blood of the slain and prolonging their race through the centuries for the wayfarer to pluck them or the family histories of the castles manorhouses and seats which of various epochs had their parkgates along the roadside and would be seen with dark gray towers or ancient gables or more modern forms of architecture rising up among clouds of ancient oaks  middleton watched earnestly to see if in any of these tales there were circumstances resembling those striking and singular ones which he had borne so long in his memory and on which he was now acting in so strange a manner but though there was a good deal of variety of incident in them there never was any combination of incidents having the peculiarity of this  i suppose said he to the old man the settlers in my country may have carried away with them traditions long since forgotten in this country but which might have an interest and connection and might even piece out the broken relics of family history which have remained perhaps a mystery for hundreds of years  i can conceive even that this might be of importance in settling the heirships of estates but which now only the two insulated parts of the story being known remain a riddle although the solution of it is actually in the world if only these two parts could be united across the sea like the wires of an electric telegraph  it is an impressive idea said the old man  do you know any such tradition as you have hinted at  april 13thmiddleton could not but wonder at the singular chance that had established him in such a place and in such society so strangely adapted to the purposes with which he had been wandering through england he had come hither hoping as it were to find the past still alive and in action and here it was so in this one only spot and these few persons into the midst of whom he had suddenly been cast  with these reflections he looked forth from his window into the oldfashioned garden and at the stone sundial which had numbered all the hoursall the daylight and serene ones at leastsince his mysterious ancestor left the country and is this then he thought to himself the establishment of which some rumor had been preserved  was it here that the secret had its hidingplace in the old coffer in the cupboard in the secret chamber or whatever was indicated by the apparently idle words of the document which he had preserved  he still smiled at the idea but it was with a pleasant mysterious sense that his life had at last got out of the dusty real and that strangeness had mixed itself up with his daily experience  with such feelings he prepared himself to go down to dinner with his host  he found him alone at table which was placed in a dark old room modernized with every english comfort and the pleasant spectacle of a table set with the whitest of napery and the brightest of glass and china  the friendly old gentleman as he had found him from the first became doubly and trebly so in that position which brings out whatever warmth of heart an englishman has and gives it to him if he has none the impressionable and sympathetic character of middleton answered to the kindness of his host and by the time the meal was concluded the two were conversing with almost as much zest and friendship as if they were similar in age even fellowcountrymen and had known one another all their lifetime  middletons secret it may be supposed came often to the tip of his tongue but still he kept it within from a natural repugnance to bring out the one romance of his life  the talk however necessarily ran much upon topics among which this one would have come in without any extra attempt to introduce it  this decay of old families said the master is much greater than would appear on the surface of things  we have such a reluctance to part with them that we are content to see them continued by any fiction through any indirections rather than to dispense with old names  in your country i suppose there is no such reluctance you are willing that one generation should blot out all that preceded it and be itself the newest and only age of the world  not quite so answered middleton at any rate if there be such a feeling in the people at large i doubt whether even in england those who fancy themselves possessed of claims to birth cherish them more as a treasure than we do  it is of course a thousand times more difficult for us to keep alive a name amid a thousand difficulties sedulously thrown around it by our institutions than for you to do where your institutions are anxiously calculated to promote the contrary purpose it has occasionally struck me however that the ancient lineage might often be found in america for a family which has been compelled to prolong itself here through the female line and through alien stocks  indeed my young friend said the master if that be the case i should like to speak further with you upon it for i can assure you there are sometimes vicissitudes in old families that make me grieve to think that a man cannot be made for the occasion  all this while the young lady at table had remained almost silent and middleton had only occasionally been reminded of her by the necessity of performing some of those offices which put people at table under a christian necessity of recognizing one another  he was to say the truth somewhat interested in her yet not strongly attracted by the neutral tint of her dress and the neutral character of her manners  she did not seem to be handsome although with her face full before him he had not quite made up his mind on this point  april 14thso here was middleton now at length seeing indistinctly a thread to which the thread that he had so long held in his handthe hereditary thread that ancestor after ancestor had handed downmight seem ready to join on  he felt as if they were the two points of an electric chain which being joined an instantaneous effect must follow earnestly as he would have looked forward to this moment had he in sober reason ever put any real weight on the fantasy in pursuit of which he had wandered so far he now that it actually appeared to be realizing itself paused with a vague sensation of alarm  the mystery was evidently one of sorrow if not of crime and he felt as if that sorrow and crime might not have been annihilated even by being buried out of human sight and remembrance so long  he remembered to have heard or read how that once an old pit had been dug open in which were found the remains of persons that as the shuddering bystanders traditionally remembered had died of an ancient pestilence and out of that old grave had come a new plague that slew the faroff progeny of those who had first died by it  might not some fatal treasure like this in a moral view be brought to light by the secret into which he had so strangely been drawn  such were the fantasies with which he awaited the return of alice whose light footsteps sounded afar along the passages of the old mansion and then all was silent  at length he heard the sound a great way off as he concluded of her returning footstep approaching from chamber to chamber and along the staircases closing the doors behind her  at first he paid no great attention to the character of these sounds but as they drew nearer he became aware that the footstep was unlike those of alice indeed as unlike as could be very regular slow yet not firm so that it seemed to be that of an aged person sauntering listlessly through the rooms we have often alluded to middletons sensitiveness and the quick vibrations of his sympathies and there was something in this slow approach that produced a strange feeling within him so that he stood breathlessly looking towards the door by which these slow footsteps were to enter  at last there appeared in the doorway a venerable figure clad in a rich faded dressinggown and standing on the threshold looked fixedly at middleton at the same time holding up a light in his left hand  in his right was some object that middleton did not distinctly see  but he knew the figure and recognized the face  it was the old man his long since companion on the journey hitherward  so said the old man smiling gravely you have thought fit at last to accept the hospitality which i offered you so long ago it might have been better for both of usfor all partiesif you had accepted it then  you here exclaimed middleton  and what can be your connection with all the error and trouble and involuntary wrong through which i have wandered since our last meeting  and is it possible that you even then held the clue which i was seeking  nono replied rothermel  i was not conscious at least of so doing  and yet had we two sat down there by the wayside or on that english stile which attracted your attention so much had we sat down there and thrown forth each his own dream each his own knowledge it would have saved much that we must now forever regret  are you even now ready to confide wholly in me  alas said middleton with a darkening brow there are many reasons at this moment which did not exist then to incline me to hold my peace and why has not alice returnedand what is your connection with her  let her answer for herself said rothermel and he called her shouting through the silent house as if she were at the furthest chamber and he were in instant need alicealicealicehere is one who would know what is the link between a maiden and her father  amid the strange uproar which he made alice came flying back not in alarm but only in haste and put her hand within his own  hush father said she  it is not time  here is an abstract of the plot of this story  the middleton who emigrated to america more than two hundred years ago had been a dark and moody man he came with a beautiful though not young woman for his wife and left a family behind him  in this family a certain heirloom had been preserved and with it a tradition that grew wilder and stranger with the passing generations  the tradition had lost if it ever had some of its connecting links but it referred to a murder to the expulsion of a brother from the hereditary house in some strange way and to a bloody footstep which he had left impressed into the threshold as he turned about to make a last remonstrance  it was rumored however or vaguely understood that the expelled brother was not altogether an innocent man but that there had been wrong done as well as crime committed insomuch that his reasons were strong that led him subsequently to imbibe the most gloomy religious views and to bury himself in the western wilderness  these reasons he had never fully imparted to his family but had necessarily made allusions to them which had been treasured up and doubtless enlarged upon  at last one descendant of the family determines to go to england with the purpose of searching out whatever ground there may be for these traditions carrying with him certain ancient documents and other relics and goes about the country half in earnest and half in sport of fancy in quest of the old family mansion  he makes singular discoveries all of which bring the book to an end unexpected by everybody and not satisfactory to the natural yearnings of novel readers  in the traditions that he brought over there was a key to some family secrets that were still unsolved and that controlled the descent of estates and titles  his influence upon these matters involves him in divers strange and perilous adventures and at last it turns out that he himself is the rightful heir to the titles and estate that had passed into another name within the last halfcentury  but he respects both feeling that it is better to make a virgin soil than to try to make the old name grow in a soil that had been darkened with so much blood and misfortune as this  april 27th tuesdayit was with a delightful feeling of release from ordinary rules that middleton found himself brought into this connection with alice and he only hoped that this playday of his life might last long enough to rest him from all that he had suffered  in the enjoyment of his position he almost forgot the pursuit that occupied him nor might he have remembered for a long space if one evening alice herself had not alluded to it  you are wasting precious days she suddenly said why do you not renew your quest  to what do you allude said middleton in surprise  what object do you suppose me to have  alice smiled nay laughed outright  you suppose yourself to be a perfect mystery no doubt she replied  but do not i know youhave not i known you longas the holder of the talisman the owner of the mysterious cabinet that contains the bloodstained secret  nay alice this is certainly a strange coincidence that you should know even thus much of a foolish secret that makes me employ this little holiday time which i have stolen out of a weary life in a wildgoose chase  but believe me you allude to matters that are more a mystery to me than my affairs appear to be to you  will you explain what you would suggest by this badinage  alice shook her head  you have no claim to know what i know even if it would be any addition to your own knowledge  i shall not and must not enlighten you  you must burrow for the secret with your own tools in your own manner and in a place of your own choosing  i am bound not to assist you  alice this is wilful wayward unjust cried middleton with a flushed cheek  i have not told youyet you know wellthe deep and real importance which this subject has for me  we have been together as friends yet the instant when there comes up an occasion when the slightest friendly feeling would induce you to do me a good office you assume this altered tone  my tone is not in the least altered in respect to you said alice all along as you know i have reserved myself on this very point it being i candidly tell you impossible for me to act in your interest in the matter alluded to  if you choose to consider this unfriendly as being less than the terms on which you conceive us to have stood give you a right to demand of meyou must resent it as you please  i shall not the less retain for you the regard due to one who has certainly befriended me in very untoward circumstances  this conversation confirmed the previous idea of middleton that some mystery of a peculiarly dark and evil character was connected with the family secret with which he was himself entangled but it perplexed him to imagine in what way this after the lapse of so many years should continue to be a matter of real importance at the present day  all the actors in the original guiltif guilt it weremust have been long ago in their graves some in the churchyard of the village with those mossgrown letters embossing their names some in the church itself with mural tablets recording their names over the familypew and one it might be far over the sea where his grave was first made under the forest leaves though now a city had grown up around it  yet here was he the remote descendant of that family setting his foot at last in the country and as secretly as might be and all at once his mere presence seemed to revive the buried secret almost to awake the dead who partook of that secret and had acted it  there was a vibration from the other world continued and prolonged into this the instant that he stepped upon the mysterious and haunted ground  he knew not in what way to proceed  he could not but feel that there was something not exactly within the limits of propriety in being here disguisedat least not known in his true characterprying into the secrets of a proud and secluded englishman  but then as he said to himself on his own side of the question the secret belonged to himself by exactly as ancient a tenure and by precisely as strong a claim as to the englishman  his rights here were just as powerful and wellfounded as those of his ancestor had been nearly three centuries ago and here the same feeling came over him that he was that very personage returned after all these ages to see if his foot would fit this bloody footstep left of old upon the threshold  the result of all his cogitation was as the reader will have foreseen that he decided to continue his researches and his proceedings being pretty defensible let the result take care of itself  for this purpose he went next day to the hospital and ringing at the masters door was ushered into the oldfashioned comfortable library where he had spent that wellremembered evening which threw the first ray of light on the pursuit that now seemed developing into such strange and unexpected consequences  being admitted he was desired by the domestic to wait as his reverence was at that moment engaged with a gentleman on business  glancing through the ivy that mantled over the window middleton saw that this interview was taking place in the garden where the master and his visitor were walking to and fro in the avenue of box discussing some matter as it seemed to him with considerable earnestness on both sides  he observed too that there was warmth passion a disturbed feeling on the strangers part while on that of the master it was a calm serious earnest representation of whatever view he was endeavoring to impress on the other  at last the interview appeared to come toward a climax the master addressing some words to his guest still with undisturbed calmness to which the latter replied by a violent and even fierce gesture as it should seem of menace not towards the master but some unknown party and then hastily turning he left the garden and was soon heard riding away  the master looked after him awhile and then shaking his white head returned into the house and soon entered the parlor  he looked somewhat surprised and as it struck middleton a little startled at finding him there yet he welcomed him with all his former cordialityindeed with a friendship that thoroughly warmed middletons heart even to its coldest corner  this is strange said the old gentleman  do you remember our conversation on that evening when i first had the unlookedfor pleasure of receiving you as a guest into my house  at that time i spoke to you of a strange family story of which there was no denouement such as a novelwriter would desire and which had remained in that unfinished posture for more than two hundred years  well perhaps it will gratify you to know that there seems a prospect of that wanting termination being supplied  indeed said middleton  yes replied the master  a gentleman has just parted with me who was indeed the representative of the family concerned in the story  he is the descendant of a younger son of that family to whom the estate devolved about a century ago although at that time there was search for the heirs of the elder son who had disappeared after the bloody incident which i related to you  now singular as it may appear at this late day a person claiming to be the descendant and heir of that eldest son has appeared and if i may credit my friends account is disposed not only to claim the estate but the dormant title which eldredge himself has been so long preparing to claim for himself  singularly enough too the heir is an american  may 2d sundayi believe said middleton that many english secrets might find their solution in america if the two threads of a story could be brought together disjoined as they have been by time and the ocean but are you at liberty to tell me the nature of the incidents to which you allude  i do not see any reason to the contrary answered the master for the story has already come in an imperfect way before the public and the full and authentic particulars are likely soon to follow  it seems that the younger brother was ejected from the house on account of a love affair the elder having married a young woman with whom the younger was in love and it is said the wife disappeared on the bridal night and was never heard of more  the elder brother remained single during the rest of his life and dying childless and there being still no news of the second brother the inheritance and representation of the family devolved upon the third brother and his posterity  this branch of the family has ever since remained in possession and latterly the representation has become of more importance on account of a claim to an old title which by the failure of another branch of this ancient family has devolved upon the branch here settled  now just at this juncture comes another heir from america pretending that he is the descendant of a marriage between the second son supposed to have been murdered on the threshold of the manorhouse and the missing bride is it not a singular story  it would seem to require very strong evidence to prove it said middleton  and methinks a republican should care little for the title however he might value the estate  bothboth said the master smiling would be equally attractive to your countryman  but there are further curious particulars in connection with this claim  you must know they are a family of singular characteristics humorists sometimes developing their queer traits into something like insanity though oftener i must say spending stupid hereditary lives here on their estates rusting out and dying without leaving any biography whatever about them  and yet there has always been one very queer thing about this generally very commonplace family  it is that each father on his deathbed has had an interview with his son at which he has imparted some secret that has evidently had an influence on the character and after life of the son making him ever after a discontented man aspiring for something he has never been able to find now the american i am told pretends that he has the clue which has always been needed to make the secret available the key whereby the lock may be opened the something that the lost son of the family carried away with him and by which through these centuries he has impeded the progress of the race  and wild as the story seems he does certainly seem to bring something that looks very like the proof of what he says  and what are those proofs inquired middleton wonderstricken at the strange reduplication of his own position and pursuits  in the first place said the master the english marriagecertificate by a clergyman of that day in london after publication of the banns with a reference to the register of the parish church where the marriage is recorded  then a certified genealogy of the family in new england where such matters can be ascertained from town and church records with at least as much certainty it would appear as in this country  he has likewise a manuscript in his ancestors autograph containing a brief account of the events which banished him from his own country the circumstances which favored the idea that he had been slain and which he himself was willing should be received as a belief the fortune that led him to america where he wished to found a new race wholly disconnected with the past and this manuscript he sealed up with directions that it should not be opened till two hundred years after his death by which time as it was probable to conjecture it would matter little to any mortal whether the story was told or not  a whole generation has passed since the time when the paper was at last unsealed and read so long it had no operation yet now at last here comes the american to disturb the succession of an ancient family  there is something very strange in all this said middleton  and indeed there was something stranger in his view of the matter than he had yet communicated to the master  for taking into consideration the relation in which he found himself with the present recognized representative of the family the thought struck him that his coming hither had dug up as it were a buried secret that immediately assumed life and activity the moment that it was above ground again  for seven generations the family had vegetated in the quietude of english country gentility doing nothing to make itself known passing from the cradle to the tomb amid the same old woods that had waved over it before his ancestor had impressed the bloody footstep and yet the instant that he came back an influence seemed to be at work that was likely to renew the old history of the family  he questioned with himself whether it were not better to leave all as it was to withdraw himself into the secrecy from which he had but half emerged and leave the family to keep on to the end of time perhaps in its rusty innocence rather than to interfere with his wild american character to disturb it  the smell of that dark crimethat brotherly hatred and attempted murderseemed to breathe out of the ground as he dug it up  was it not better that it should remain forever buried for what to him was this old english titlewhat this estate so far from his own native land located amidst feelings and manners which would never be his own  it was late to be sureyet not too late for him to turn back the vibration the fear which his footsteps had caused would subside into peace  meditating in this way he took a hasty leave of the kind old master promising to see him again at an early opportunity  by chance or however it was his footsteps turned to the woods of  chace and there he wandered through its glades deep in thought yet always with a strange sense that he was treading on the soil where his ancestors had trodden and where he himself had best right of all men to be  it was just in this state of feeling that he found his course arrested by a hand upon his shoulder  what business have you here was the question sounded in his ear and starting he found himself in the grasp as his blood tingled to know of a gentleman in a shootingdress who looked at him with a wrathful brow are you a poacher or what  be the case what it might middletons blood boiled at the grasp of that hand as it never before had done in the coarse of his impulsive life he shook himself free and stood fiercely before his antagonist confronting him with his uplifted stick while the other likewise appeared to be shaken by a strange wrath  fellow muttered heyankee blackguardimpostertake yourself off these grounds  quick or it will be the worse for you  middleton restrained himself  mr eldredge said he for i believe i speak to the man who calls himself owner of this land on which we stand mr eldredge you are acting under a strange misapprehension of my character  i have come hither with no sinister purpose and am entitled at the hands of a gentleman to the consideration of an honorable antagonist even if you deem me one at all  and perhaps if you think upon the blue chamber and the ebony cabinet and the secret connected with it  villain no more said eldredge and utterly mad with rage he presented his gun at middleton but even at the moment of doing so he partly restrained himself so far as instead of shooting him to raise the butt of his gun and strike a blow at him  it came down heavily on middletons shoulder though aimed at his head and the blow was terribly avenged even by itself for the jar caused the hammer to come down the gun went off sending the bullet downwards through the heart of the unfortunate man who fell dead upon the ground  eldredge evidently a slip of the pen middleton being intended stood stupefied looking at the catastrophe which had so suddenly occurred  may 3d mondayso here was the secret suddenly made safe in this so terrible way its keepers reduced from two parties to one interest the other who alone knew of this agelong mystery and trouble now carrying it into eternity where a long line of those who partook of the knowledge in each successive generation might now be waiting to inquire of him how he had held his trust  he had kept it well there was no doubt of it for there he lay dead upon the ground having betrayed it to no one though by a method which none could have foreseen the whole had come into the possession of him who had brought hither but half of it middleton looked down in horror upon the form that had just been so full of life and wrathful vigorand now lay so quietly  being wholly unconscious of any purpose to bring about the catastrophe it had not at first struck him that his own position was in any manner affected by the violent death under such circumstances of the unfortunate man  but now it suddenly occurred to him that there had been a train of incidents all calculated to make him the object of suspicion and he felt that he could not under the english administration of law be suffered to go at large without rendering a strict account of himself and his relations with the deceased  he might indeed fly he might still remain in the vicinity and possibly escape notice  but was not the risk too great  was it just even to be aware of this event and not relate fully the manner of it lest a suspicion of bloodguiltiness should rest upon some innocent head but while he was thus cogitating he heard footsteps approaching along the woodpath and halfimpulsively half on purpose he stept aside into the shrubbery but still where he could see the dead body and what passed near it  the footsteps came on and at the turning of the path just where middleton had met eldredge the newcomer appeared in sight  it was hoper in his usual dress of velveteen looking now seedy povertystricken and altogether in illcase trudging moodily along with his hat pulled over his brows so that he did not see the ghastly object before him till his foot absolutely trod upon the dead mans hand being thus made aware of the proximity of the corpse he started back a little yet evincing such small emotion as did credit to his english reserve then uttering a low exclamationcautiously low indeedhe stood looking at the corpse a moment or two apparently in deep meditation  he then drew near bent down and without evincing any horror at the touch of death in this horrid shape he opened the dead mans vest inspected the wound satisfied himself that life was extinct and then nodded his head and smiled gravely  he next proceeded to examine seriatim the dead mans pockets turning each of them inside out and taking the contents where they appeared adapted to his needs for instance a silken purse through the interstices of which some gold was visible a watch which however had been injured by the explosion and had stopt just at the momenttwentyone minutes past fivewhen the catastrophe took place  hoper ascertained by putting the watch to his ear that this was the case then pocketing it he continued his researches  he likewise secured a notebook on examining which he found several banknotes and some other papers  and having done this the thief stood considering what to do next nothing better occurring to him he thrust the pockets back gave the corpse as nearly as he could the same appearance that it had worn before he found it and hastened away leaving the horror there on the woodpath  he had been gone only a few minutes when another step a light womans step was heard coming along the pathway and alice appeared having on her usual white mantle straying along with that fearlessness which characterized her so strangely and made her seem like one of the denizens of nature  she was singing in a low tone some one of those airs which have become so popular in england as negro melodies when suddenly looking before her she saw the bloodstained body on the grass the face looking ghastly upward  alice pressed her hand upon her heart it was not her habit to scream not the habit of that strong wild selfdependent nature and the exclamation which broke from her was not for help but the voice of her heart crying out to herself  for an instant she hesitated as if not knowing what to do then approached and with her white maiden hand felt the brow of the dead man tremblingly but yet firm and satisfied herself that life had wholly departed  she pressed her hand that had just touched the dead mans on her forehead and gave a moment to thought  what her decision might have been we cannot say for while she stood in this attitude middleton stept from his seclusion and at the noise of his approach she turned suddenly round looking more frightened and agitated than at the moment when she had first seen the dead body  she faced middleton however and looked him quietly in the eye  you see this said she gazing fixedly at him  it is not at this moment that you first discover it  no said middleton frankly  it is not  i was present at the catastrophe  in one sense indeed i was the cause of it but alice i need not tell you that i am no murderer  a murdererno said alice still looking at him with the same fixed gaze  but you and this man were at deadly variance  he would have rejoiced at any chance that would have laid you cold and bloody on the earth as he is now nay he would most eagerly have seized on any fairlooking pretext that would have given him a chance to stretch you there  the world will scarcely believe when it knows all about your relations with him that his blood is not on your hand  indeed said she with a strange smile i see some of it there now  and in very truth so there was a broad bloodstain that had dried on middletons hand  he shuddered at it but essayed vainly to rub it off  you see said she  it was foreordained that you should shed this mans blood foreordained that by digging into that old pit of pestilence you should set the contagion loose again  you should have left it buried forever  but now what do you mean to do  to proclaim this catastrophe replied middleton  it is the only honest and manly way  what else can i do  you can and ought to leave him on the woodpath where he has fallen said alice and go yourself to take advantage of the state of things which providence has brought about  enter the old house the hereditary house wherenow at leastyou alone have a right to tread  now is the hour  all is within your grasp  let the wrong of three hundred years be righted and come back thus to your own to these hereditary fields this quiet longdescended home to title to honor  yet as the wild maiden spoke thus there was a sort of mockery in her eyes on her brow gleaming through all her face as if she scorned what she thus pressed upon him the spoils of the dead man who lay at their feet  middleton with his susceptibility could not but be sensible of a wild and strange charm as well as horror in the situation it seemed such a wonder that here in formal orderly wellgoverned england so wild a scene as this should have occurred that they too two should stand here deciding on the descent of an estate and the inheritance of a title holding a court of their own  come then said he at length  let us leave this poor fallen antagonist in his blood and go whither you will lead me  i will judge for myself  at all events i will not leave my hereditary home without knowing what my power is  come responded alice and she turned back but then returned and threw a handkerchief over the dead mans face which while they spoke had assumed that quiet ecstatic expression of joy which often is observed to overspread the faces of those who die of gunshot wounds however fierce the passion in which their spirits took their flight  with this strange grand awful joy did the dead man gaze upward into the very eyes and hearts as it were of the two that now bent over him  they looked at one another  whence comes this expression said middleton thoughtfully  alice methinks he is reconciled to us now and that we are members of one reconciled family all of whom are in heaven but me  tuesday may 4thhow strange is this whole situation between you and me said middleton as they went up the winding pathway that led towards the house  shall i ever understand it  do you mean ever to explain it to me  that i should find you here with that old man the allusion here is apparently to the old man who proclaims himself alices father in the portion dated april 14th  he figures hereafter as the old hospitaller hammond  the reader must not take this present passage as referring to the death of eldredge which has just taken place in he preceding section  the author is now beginning to elaborate the relation of middleton and alice  as will be seen farther on the death of eldredge is ignored and abandoned eldredge is revived and the story proceeds in another wayg p l so mysterious apparently so poor yet so powerful  what is his relation to you  a close one replied alice sadly  he was my father  your father repeated middleton starting back  it does but heighten the wonder  your father  and yet by all the tokens that birth and breeding and habits of thought and native character can show you are my countrywoman  that wild free spirit was never born in the breast of an englishwoman that slight frame that slender beauty that frail envelopment of a quick piercing yet stubborn and patient spiritare those the properties of an english maiden  perhaps not replied alice quietly  i am your countrywoman  my father was an american and one of whom you have heardand no good alasfor many a year  and who then was he asked middleton  i know not whether you will hate me for telling you replied alice looking him sadly though firmly in the face  there was a manlong years since in your childhoodwhose plotting brain proved the ruin of himself and many another a man whose great designs made him a sort of potentate whose schemes became of national importance and produced results even upon the history of the country in which he acted  that man was my father a man who sought to do great things and like many who have had similar aims disregarded many small rights strode over them on his way to effect a gigantic purpose  among other men your father was trampled under foot ruined done to death even by the effects of his ambition  how is it possible exclaimed middleton  was it wentworth  even so said alice still with the same sad calmness and not withdrawing her steady eyes from his face  after his ruin after the catastrophe that overwhelmed him and hundreds more he took to flight guilty perhaps but guilty as a fallen conqueror is guilty to such an extent that he ceased to be a cheat as a conqueror ceases to be a murderer  he came to england  my father had an original nobility of nature and his life had not been such as to debase it but rather such as to cherish and heighten that selfesteem which at least keeps the possessor of it from many meaner vices  he took nothing with him nothing beyond the bare means of flight with the world before him although thousands of gold would not have been missed out of the scattered fragments of ruin that lay around him  he found his way hither led as you were by a desire to reconnect himself with the place whence his family had originated for he too was of a race which had something to do with the ancient story which has now been brought to a close  arrived here there were circumstances that chanced to make his talents and habits of business available to this mr eldredge a man ignorant and indolent unknowing how to make the best of the property that was in his hands  by degrees he took the estate into his management acquiring necessarily a preponderating influence over such a man  and you said middleton  have you been all along in england  for you must have been little more than an infant at the time  a mere infant said alice and i remained in our own country under the care of a relative who left me much to my own keeping much to the influences of that wild culture which the freedom of our country gives to its youth  it is only two years that i have been in england  this then said middleton thoughtfully accounts for much that has seemed so strange in the events through which we have passed for the knowledge of my identity and my halfdefined purpose which has always glided before me and thrown so many strange shapes of difficulty in my path  but whencewhence came that malevolence which your fathers conduct has so unmistakably shown  i had done him no injury though i had suffered much  i have often thought replied alice that my father though retaining a preternatural strength and acuteness of intellect was really not altogether sane  and besides he had made it his business to keep this estate and all the complicated advantages of the representation of this old family secure to the person who was deemed to have inherited them a succession of ages and generations might be supposed to have blotted out your claims from existence for it is not just that there should be no term of time which can make security for lack of fact and a few formalities  at all events he had satisfied himself that his duty was to act as he has done  be it so  i do not seek to throw blame on him said middleton besides alice he was your father  yes said she sadly smiling let him have what protection that thought may give him even though i lose what he may gain  and now here we are at the house  at last come in  it is your own there is none that can longer forbid you  they entered the door of the old mansion now a farmhouse and there were its old hall its old chambers all before them  they ascended the staircase and stood on the landingplace above while middleton had again that feeling that had so often made him dizzythat sense of being in one dream and recognizing the scenery and events of a former dream so overpowering was this feeling that he laid his hand on the slender arm of alice to steady himself and she comprehended the emotion that agitated him and looked into his eyes with a tender sympathy which she had never before permitted to be visibleperhaps never before felt  he steadied himself and followed her till they had entered an ancient chamber but one that was finished with all the comfortable luxury customary to be seen in english homes  whither have you led me now inquired middleton  look round said alice  is there nothing here that you ought to recognizenothing that you kept the memory of long ago  he looked around the room again and again and at last in a somewhat shadowy corner he espied an old cabinet made of ebony and inlaid with pearl one of those tall stately and elaborate pieces of furniture that are rather articles of architecture than upholstery and on which a higher skill feeling and genius than now is ever employed on such things was expended  alice drew near the stately cabinet and threw wide the doors which like the portals of a palace stood between two pillars it all seemed to be unlocked showing within some beautiful old pictures in the panel of the doors and a mirror that opened a long succession of mimic halls reflection upon reflection extending to an interminable nowhere  and what is this said middletona cabinet  why do you draw my attention so strongly to it  look at it well said she  do you recognize nothing there  have you forgotten your description  the stately palace with its architecture each pillar with its architecture those pilasters that frieze you ought to know them all  somewhat less than you imagined in size perhaps a fairy reality inches for yards that is the only difference and you have the key  and there then was that palace to which tradition so false at once and true had given such magnitude and magnificence in the traditions of the middleton family around their shifting fireside in america  looming afar through the mists of time the little fact had become a gigantic vision  yes here it was in miniature all that he had dreamed of a palace of four feet high  you have the key of this palace said alice it has waitedthat is its secret and precious chamber has for you to open it these three hundred years  do you know how to find that secret chamber  middleton still in that dreamy mood threw open an inner door of the cabinet and applying the oldfashioned key at his watchchain to a hole in the mimic pavement within pressed one of the mosaics and immediately the whole floor of the apartment sank and revealed a receptacle withal alice had come forward eagerly and they both looked into the hidingplace expecting what should be there  it was empty  they looked into each others faces with blank astonishment  everything had been so strangely true and so strangely false up to this moment that they could not comprehend this failure at the last moment  it was the strangest saddest jest  it brought middleton up with such a sudden revulsion that he grew dizzy and the room swam round him and the cabinet dazzled before his eyes  it had been magnified to a palace it had dwindled down to liliputian size and yet up till now it had seemed to contain in its diminutiveness all the riches which he had attributed to its magnitude  this last moment had utterly subverted it the whole great structure seemed to vanish  see here are the dust and ashes of it observed alice taking something that was indeed only a pinch of dust out of the secret compartment  there is nothing else   ii  may 5th wednesdaythe father of these two sons an aged man at the time took much to heart their enmity and after the catastrophe he never held up his head again  he was not told that his son had perished though such was the belief of the family but imbibed the opinion that he had left his home and native land to become a wanderer on the face of the earth and that some time or other he might return  in this idea he spent the remainder of his days in this idea he died  it may be that the influence of this idea might be traced in the way in which he spent some of the latter years of his life and a portion of the wealth which had become of little value in his eyes since it had caused dissension and bloodshed between the sons of one household  it was a common mode of charity in those daysa common thing for rich men to doto found an almshouse or a hospital and endow it for the support of a certain number of old and destitute men or women generally such as had some claim of blood upon the founder or at least were natives of the parish the district the county where he dwelt  the eldredge hospital was founded for the benefit of twelve old men who should have been wanderers upon the face of the earth men they should be of some education but defeated and hopeless cast off by the world for misfortune but not for crime  and this charity had subsisted on terms varying little or nothing from the original ones from that day to this and at this very time twelve old men were not wanting of various countries of various fortunes but all ending finally in ruin who had centred here to live on the poor pittance that had been assigned to them three hundred years ago  what a series of chronicles it would have been if each of the beneficiaries of this charity since its foundation had left a record of the events which finally led him hither  middleton often as he talked with these old men regretted that he himself had no turn for authorship so rich a volume might he have compiled from the experience sometimes sunny and triumphant though always ending in shadow which he gathered here  they were glad to talk to him and would have been glad and grateful for any auditor as they sat on one or another of the stone benches in the sunshine of the garden or at evening around the great fireside or within the chimneycorner with their pipes and ale  there was one old man who attracted much of his attention by the venerableness of his aspect by something dignified almost haughty and commanding in his air  whatever might have been the intentions and expectations of the founder it certainly had happened in these latter days that there was a difficulty in finding persons of education of good manners of evident respectability to put into the places made vacant by deaths of members whether that the paths of life are surer now than they used to be and that men so arrange their lives as not to be left in any event quite without resources as they draw near its close at any rate there was a little tincture of the vagabond running through these twelve quasi gentlementhrough several of them at least  but this old man could not well be mistaken in his manners in his tones in all his natural language and deportment there was evidence that he had been more than respectable and viewing him middleton could not help wondering what statesman had suddenly vanished out of public life and taken refuge here for his head was of the statesmanclass and his demeanor that of one who had exercised influence over large numbers of men  he sometimes endeavored to set on foot a familiar relation with this old man but there was even a sternness in the manner in which he repelled these advances that gave little encouragement for their renewal  nor did it seem that his companions of the hospital were more in his confidence than middleton himself  they regarded him with a kind of awe a shyness and in most cases with a certain dislike which denoted an imperfect understanding of him  to say the truth there was not generally much love lost between any of the members of this family they had met with too much disappointment in the world to take kindly now to one another or to anything or anybody  i rather suspect that they really had more pleasure in burying one another when the time came than in any other office of mutual kindness and brotherly love which it was their part to do not out of hardness of heart but merely from soured temper and because when people have met disappointment and have settled down into final unhappiness with no more gush and spring of good spirits there is nothing any more to create amiability out of  so the old people were unamiable and cross to one another and unamiable and cross to old hammond yet always with a certain respect and the result seemed to be such as treated the old man well enough  and thus he moved about among them a mystery the histories of the others in the general outline were well enough known and perhaps not very uncommon this old mans history was known to none except of course to the trustees of the charity and to the master of the hospital to whom it had necessarily been revealed before the beneficiary could be admitted as an inmate  it was judged by the deportment of the master that the old man had once held some eminent position in society for though bound to treat them all as gentlemen he was thought to show an especial and solemn courtesy to hammond  yet by the attraction which two strong and cultivated minds inevitably have for one another there did spring up an acquaintanceship an intercourse between middleton and this old man which was followed up in many a conversation which they held together on all subjects that were supplied by the news of the day or the history of the past  middleton used to make the newspaper the opening for much discussion and it seemed to him that the talk of his companion had much of the character of that of a retired statesman on matters which perhaps he would look at all the more wisely because it was impossible he could ever more have a personal agency in them  their discussions sometimes turned upon the affairs of his own country and its relations with the rest of the world especially with england and middleton could not help being struck with the accuracy of the old mans knowledge respecting that country which so few englishmen know anything about his shrewd appreciation of the american charactershrewd and caustic yet not without a good degree of justice the sagacity of his remarks on the past and prophecies of what was likely to happenprophecies which in one instance were singularly verified in regard to a complexity which was then arresting the attention of both countries  you must have been in the united states said he one day  certainly my remarks imply personal knowledge was the reply  but it was before the days of steam  and not i should imagine for a brief visit said middleton  i only wish the administration of this government had the benefit today of your knowledge of my countrymen  it might be better for both of these kindred nations  not a whit said the old man  england will never understand america for england never does understand a foreign country and whatever you may say about kindred america is as much a foreign country as france itself these two hundred years of a different climate and circumstancesof life on a broad continent instead of in an island to say nothing of the endless intermixture of nationalities in every part of the united states except new englandhave created a new and decidedly original type of national character  it is as well for both parties that they should not aim at any very intimate connection  it will never do  i should be very sorry to think so said middleton they are at all events two noble breeds of men and ought to appreciate one another  and america has the breadth of idea to do this for england whether reciprocated or not  thursday may 6ththus middleton was established in a singular way among these old men in one of the surroundings most unlike anything in his own country  so old it was that it seemed to him the freshest and newest thing that he had ever met with  the residence was made infinitely the more interesting to him by the sense that he was near the placeas all the indications warned himwhich he sought whither his dreams had tended from his childhood that he could wander each day round the park within which were the old gables of what he believed was his hereditary home  he had never known anything like the dreamy enjoyment of these days so quiet such a contrast to the turbulent life from which he had escaped across the sea  and here he set himself still with that sense of shadowiness in what he saw and in what he did in making all the researches possible to him about the neighborhood visiting every little church that raised its square battlemented norman tower of gray stone for several miles round about making himself acquainted with each little village and hamlet that surrounded these churches clustering about the graves of those who had dwelt in the same cottages aforetime  he visited all the towns within a dozen miles and probably there were few of the inhabitants who had so good an acquaintance with the neighborhood as this native american attained within a few weeks after his coming thither  in course of these excursions he had several times met with a young womana young lady one might term her but in fact he was in some doubt what rank she might hold in englandwho happened to be wandering about the country with a singular freedom  she was always alone always on foot he would see her sketching some picturesque old church some ivied ruin some fine drooping elm  she was a slight figure much more so than englishwomen generally are and though healthy of aspect had not the ruddy complexion which he was irreverently inclined to call the coarse tint that is believed the great charm of english beauty  there was a freedom in her step and whole little womanhood an elasticity an irregularity so to speak that made her memorable from first sight and when he had encountered her three or four times he felt in a certain way acquainted with her  she was very simply dressed and quite as simple in her deportment there had been one or two occasions when they had both smiled at the same thing soon afterwards a little conversation had taken place between them and thus without any introduction and in a way that somewhat puzzled middleton himself they had become acquainted  it was so unusual that a young english girl should be wandering about the country entirely aloneso much less usual that she should speak to a strangerthat middleton scarcely knew how to account for it but meanwhile accepted the fact readily and willingly for in truth he found this mysterious personage a very likely and entertaining companion there was a strange quality of boldness in her remarks almost of brusqueness that he might have expected to find in a young countrywoman of his own if bred up among the strongminded but was astonished to find in a young englishwoman  somehow or other she made him think more of home than any other person or thing he met with and he could not but feel that she was in strange contrast with everything about her  she was no beauty very piquant very pleasing in some points of view and at some moments pretty always goodhumored but somewhat too selfpossessed for middletons taste  it struck him that she had talked with him as if she had some knowledge of him and of the purposes with which he was there not that this was expressed but only implied by the fact that on looking back to what had passed he found many strange coincidences in what she had said with what he was thinking about  he perplexed himself much with thinking whence this young woman had come where she belonged and what might be her history when the next day he again saw her not this time rambling on foot but seated in an open barouche with a young lady  middleton lifted his hat to her and she nodded and smiled to him and it appeared to middleton that a conversation ensued about him with the young lady her companion  now what still more interested him was the fact that on the panel of the barouche were the arms of the family now in possession of the estate of smithells so that the young lady his new acquaintance or the young lady her seeming friend one or the other was the sister of the present owner of that estate  he was inclined to think that his acquaintance could not be the miss eldredge of whose beauty he had heard many tales among the people of the neighborhood  the other young lady a tall reserved fairhaired maiden answered the description considerably better  he concluded therefore that his acquaintance must be a visitor perhaps a dependent and companion though the freedom of her thought action and way of life seemed hardly consistent with this idea however this slight incident served to give him a sort of connection with the family and he could but hope that some further chance would introduce him within what he fondly called his hereditary walls  he had come to think of this as a dreamland and it seemed even more a dreamland now than before it rendered itself into actual substance an old house of stone and timber standing within its park shaded about with its ancestral trees  but thus at all events he was getting himself a little wrought into the network of human life around him secluded as his position had at first seemed to be in the farmhouse where he had taken up his lodgings  for there was the hospital and its old inhabitants in whose monotonous existence he soon came to pass for something with his liveliness of mind his experience his good sense his patience as a listener his comparative youth evenhis power of adapting himself to these stiff and crusty characters a power learned among other things in his political life where he had acquired something of the faculty good or bad as might be of making himself all things to all men  but though he amused himself with them all there was in truth but one man among them in whom he really felt much interest and that one we need hardly say was hammond  it was not often that he found the old gentleman in a conversible mood always courteous indeed but generally cool and reserved often engaged in his one room to which middleton had never yet been admitted though he had more than once sent in his name when hammond was not apparent upon the bench which by common consent of the hospital was appropriated to him  one day however notwithstanding that the old gentleman was confined to his room by indisposition he ventured to inquire at the door and considerably to his surprise was admitted  he found hammond in his easychair at a table with writingmaterials before him and as middleton entered the old gentleman looked at him with a stern fixed regard which however did not seem to imply any particular displeasure towards this visitor but rather a severe way of regarding mankind in general  middleton looked curiously around the small apartment to see what modification the character of the man had had upon the customary furniture of the hospital and how much of individuality he had given to that general type  there was a shelf of books and a row of them on the mantelpiece works of political economy they appeared to be statistics and things of that sort very dry reading with which however middletons experience as a politician had made him acquainted  besides there were a few works on local antiquities a countyhistory borrowed from the masters library in which hammond appeared to have been lately reading  they are delightful reading observed middleton these old countyhistories with their great folio volumes and their minute account of the affairs of families and the genealogies and descents of estates bestowing as much blessed space on a few hundred acres as other historians give to a principality  i fear that in my own country we shall never have anything of this kind  our space is so vast that we shall never come to know and love it inch by inch as the english antiquarians do the tracts of country with which they deal and besides our land is always likely to lack the interest that belongs to english estates for where land changes its ownership every few years it does not become imbued with the personalities of the people who live on it it is but so much grass so much dirt where a succession of people have dwelt too little to make it really their own  but i have found a pleasure that i had no conception of before in reading some of the english local histories  it is not a usual course of reading for a transitory visitor said hammond  what could induce you to undertake it  simply the wish so common and natural with americans said middleton the wish to find out something about my kindredthe local origin of my own family  you do not show your wisdom in this said his visitor  america had better recognize the fact that it has nothing to do with england and look upon itself as other nations and people do as existing on its own hook  i never heard of any people looking back to the country of their remote origin in the way the angloamericans do  for instance england is made up of many alien races german danish norman and what not it has received large accessions of population at a later date than the settlement of the united states  yet these families melt into the great homogeneous mass of englishmen and look back no more to any other country  there are in this vicinity many descendants of the french huguenots but they care no more for france than for timbuctoo reckoning themselves only englishmen as if they were descendants of the aboriginal britons  let it be so with you  so it might be replied middleton only that our relations with england remain far more numerous than our disconnections through the bonds of history of literature of all that makes up the memories and much that makes up the present interests of a people  and therefore i must still continue to pore over these old folios and hunt around these precincts spending thus the little idle time i am likely to have in a busy life  possibly finding little to my purpose but that is quite a secondary consideration  if you choose to tell me precisely what your aims are said hammond it is possible i might give you some little assistance  may 7th fridaymiddleton was in fact more than half ashamed of the dreams which he had cherished before coming to england and which since at times had been very potent with him assuming as strong a tinge of reality as those scenes into which he had strayed  he could not prevail with himself to disclose fully to this severe and as he thought cynical old man how strong within him was the sentiment that impelled him to connect himself with the old life of england to join on the broken thread of ancestry and descent and feel every link well established  but it seemed to him that he ought not to lose this fair opportunity of gaining some light on the abstruse field of his researches and he therefore explained to hammond that he had reason from old family traditions to believe that he brought with him a fragment of a history that if followed out might lead to curious results  he told him in a tone half serious what he had heard respecting the quarrel of the two brothers and the bloody footstep the impress of which was said to remain as a lasting memorial of the tragic termination of that enmity  at this point hammond interrupted him  he had indeed at various points of the narrative nodded and smiled mysteriously as if looking into his mind and seeing something there analogous to what he was listening to  he now spoke  this is curious said he  did you know that there is a manorhouse in this neighborhood the family of which prides itself on having such a bloodstained threshold as you have now described  no indeed exclaimed middleton greatly interested  where  it is the old manorhouse of smithells replied hammond one of those old wood and timber plaster mansions which are among the most ancient specimens of domestic architecture in england  the house has now passed into the female line and by marriage has been for two or three generations in possession of another family  but the blood of the old inheritors is still in the family  the house itself or portions of it are thought to date back quite as far as the conquest  smithells said middleton  why i have seen that old house from a distance and have felt no little interest in its antique aspect  and it has a bloody footstep  would it be possible for a stranger to get an opportunity to inspect it  unquestionably said hammond nothing easier  it is but a moderate distance from here and if you can moderate your young footsteps and your american quick walk to an old mans pace i would go there with you some day  in this languor and ennui of my life i spend some time in local antiquarianism and perhaps i might assist you in tracing out how far these traditions of yours may have any connection with reality  it would be curious would it not if you had come after two hundred years to piece out a story which may have been as much a mystery in england as there in america  an engagement was made for a walk to smithells the ensuing day and meanwhile middleton entered more fully into what he had received from family traditions and what he had thought out for himself on the matter in question  are you aware asked hammond that there was formerly a title in this family now in abeyance and which the heirs have at various times claimed and are at this moment claiming  do you know toobut you can scarcely know itthat it has been surmised by some that there is an insecurity in the title to the estate and has always been so that the possessors have lived in some apprehension from time immemorial that another heir would appear and take from them the fair inheritance  it is a singular coincidence  very strange exclaimed middleton  no i was not aware of it and to say the truth i should not altogether like to come forward in the light of a claimant  but this is a dream surely  i assure you sir continued the old man that you come here in a very critical moment and singularly enough there is a perplexity a difficulty that has endured for as long a time as when your ancestors emigrated that is still rampant within the bowels as i may say of the family  of course it is too like a romance that you should be able to establish any such claim as would have a valid influence on this matter but still being here on the spot it may be worth while if merely as a matter of amusement to make some researches into this matter  surely i will said middleton with a smile which concealed more earnestness than he liked to show as to the title a republican cannot be supposed to think twice about such a bagatelle  the estatethat might be a more serious consideration  they continued to talk on the subject and middleton learned that the present possessor of the estates was a gentleman nowise distinguished from hundreds of other english gentlemen a country squire modified in accordance with the type of today a frank free friendly sort of a person enough who had travelled on the continent who employed himself much in fieldsports who was unmarried and had a sister who was reckoned among the beauties of the county  while the conversation was thus going on to middletons astonishment there came a knock at the door of the room and without waiting for a response it was opened and there appeared at it the same young woman whom he had already met  she came in with perfect freedom and familiarity and was received quietly by the old gentleman who however by his manner towards middleton indicated that he was now to take his leave  he did so after settling the hour at which the excursion of the next day was to take place  this arranged he departed with much to think of and a light glimmering through the confused labyrinth of thoughts which had been unilluminated hitherto  to say the truth he questioned within himself whether it were not better to get as quickly as he could out of the vicinity and at any rate not to put anything of earnest in what had hitherto been nothing more than a romance to him  there was something very dark and sinister in the events of family history which now assumed a reality that they had never before worn so much tragedy so much hatred had been thrown into that deep pit and buried under the accumulated debris the fallen leaves the rust and dust of more than two centuries that it seemed not worth while to dig it up for perhaps the deadly influences which it had taken so much time to hide might still be lurking there and become potent if he now uncovered them  there was something that startled him in the strange wild light which gleamed from the old mans eyes as he threw out the suggestions which had opened this prospect to him  what right had hean american republican disconnected with this country so long alien from its habits of thought and life reverencing none of the things which englishmen reverencedwhat right had he to come with these musty claims from the dim past to disturb them in the life that belonged to them there was a higher and a deeper law than any connected with ancestral claims which he could assert and he had an idea that the law bade him keep to the country which his ancestor had chosen and to its institutions and not meddle nor make with england  the roots of his family tree could not reach under the ocean he was at most but a seedling from the parent tree  while thus meditating he found that his footsteps had brought him unawares within sight of the old manorhouse of smithells and that he was wandering in a path which if he followed it further would bring him to an entrance in one of the wings of the mansion  with a sort of shame upon him he went forward and leaning against a tree looked at what he considered the home of his ancestors  may 9th sundayat the time appointed the two companions set out on their little expedition the old man in his hospital uniform the long black mantle with the bear and ragged staff engraved in silver on the breast and middleton in the plain costume which he had adopted in these wanderings about the country  on their way hammond was not very communicative occasionally dropping some shrewd remark with a good deal of acidity in it now and then too favoring his companion with some reminiscence of local antiquity but oftenest silent  thus they went on and entered the park of pemberton manor by a bypath over a stile and one of those footways which are always so well worth threading out in england leading the pedestrian into picturesque and characteristic scenes when the highroad would show him nothing except what was commonplace and uninteresting  now the gables of the old manorhouse appeared before them rising amidst the hereditary woods which doubtless dated from a time beyond the days which middleton fondly recalled when his ancestors had walked beneath their shade  on each side of them were thickets and copses of fern amidst which they saw the hares peeping out to gaze upon them occasionally running across the path and comporting themselves like creatures that felt themselves under some sort of protection from the outrages of man though they knew too much of his destructive character to trust him too far  pheasants too rose close beside them and winged but a little way before they alighted they likewise knew or seemed to know that their hour was not yet come  on all sides in these woods these wastes these beasts and birds there was a character that was neither wild nor tame  man had laid his grasp on them all and done enough to redeem them from barbarism but had stopped short of domesticating them although nature in the wildest thing there acknowledged the powerful and pervading influence of cultivation  arriving at a side door of the mansion hammond rang the bell and a servant soon appeared  he seemed to know the old man and immediately acceded to his request to be permitted to show his companion the house although it was not precisely a showhouse nor was this the hour when strangers were usually admitted  they entered and the servant did not give himself the trouble to act as a cicerone to the two visitants but carelessly said to the old gentleman that he knew the rooms and that he would leave him to discourse to his friend about them  accordingly they went into the old hall a dark oakenpanelled room of no great height with many doors opening into it  there was a fire burning on the hearth indeed it was the custom of the house to keep it up from morning to night and in the damp chill climate of england there is seldom a day in some part of which a fire is not pleasant to feel  hammond here pointed out a stuffed fox to which some story of a famous chase was attached a pair of antlers of enormous size and some old family pictures so blackened with time and neglect that middleton could not well distinguish their features though curious to do so as hoping to see there the lineaments of some with whom he might claim kindred  it was a venerable apartment and gave a good foretaste of what they might hope to find in the rest of the mansion  but when they had inspected it pretty thoroughly and were ready to proceed an elderly gentleman entered the hall and seeing hammond addressed him in a kindly familiar way not indeed as an equal friend but with a pleasant and not irksome conversation  i am glad to see you here again said he  what  i have an hour of leisure for to say the truth the day hangs rather heavy till the shooting season begins  come as you have a friend with you i will be your cicerone myself about the house and show you whatever mouldy objects of interest it contains  he then graciously noticed the old mans companion but without asking or seeming to expect an introduction for after a careless glance at him he had evidently set him down as a person without social claims a young man in the rank of life fitted to associate with an inmate of pembertons hospital  and it must be noticed that his treatment of middleton was not on that account the less kind though far from being so elaborately courteous as if he had met him as an equal  you have had something of a walk said he and it is a rather hot day  the beer of pemberton manor has been reckoned good these hundred years will you taste it  hammond accepted the offer and the beer was brought in a foaming tankard but middleton declined it for in truth there was a singular emotion in his breast as if the old enmity the ancient injuries were not yet atoned for and as if he must not accept the hospitality of one who represented his hereditary foe  he felt too as if there were something unworthy a certain want of fairness in entering clandestinely the house and talking with its occupant under a veil as it were and had he seen clearly how to do it he would perhaps at that moment have fairly told mr eldredge that he brought with him the character of kinsman and must be received in that grade or none  but it was not easy to do this and after all there was no clear reason why he should do it so he let the matter pass merely declining to take the refreshment and keeping himself quiet and retired  squire eldredge seemed to be a good ordinary sort of gentleman reasonably well educated and with few ideas beyond his estate and neighborhood though he had once held a seat in parliament for part of a term  middleton could not but contrast him with an inward smile with the shrewd alert politicians their faculties all sharpened to the utmost whom he had known and consorted with in the american congress hammond had slightly informed him that his companion was an american and mr eldredge immediately gave proof of the extent of his knowledge of that country by inquiring whether he came from the state of new england and whether mr webster was still president of the united states questions to which middleton returned answers that led to no further conversation  these little preliminaries over they continued their ramble through the house going through tortuous passages up and down little flights of steps and entering chambers that had all the charm of discoveries of hidden regions loitering about in short in a labyrinth calculated to put the head into a delightful confusion  some of these rooms contained their timehonored furniture all in the best possible repair heavy dark polished beds that had been marriage beds and dying beds over and over again chairs with carved backs and all manner of old world curiosities family pictures and samplers and embroidery fragments of tapestry an inlaid floor everything having a story to it though to say the truth the possessor of these curiosities made but a bungling piece of work in telling the legends connected with them  in one or two instances hammond corrected him  by and by they came to what had once been the principal bedroom of the house though its gloom and some circumstances of family misfortune that had happened long ago had caused it to fall into disrepute in latter times and it was now called the haunted chamber or the ghosts chamber the furniture of this room however was particularly rich in its antique magnificence and one of the principal objects was a great black cabinet of ebony and ivory such as may often be seen in old english houses and perhaps often in the palaces of italy in which country they perhaps originated  this present cabinet was known to have been in the house as long ago as the reign of queen elizabeth and how much longer neither tradition nor record told  hammond particularly directed middletons attention to it  there is nothing in this house said he better worth your attention than that cabinet  consider its plan it represents a stately mansion with pillars an entrance with a lofty flight of steps windows and everything perfect  examine it well  there was such an emphasis in the old mans way of speaking that middleton turned suddenly round from all that he had been looking at and fixed his whole attention on the cabinet and strangely enough it seemed to be the representative in small of something that he had seen in a dream  to say the truth if some cunning workman had been employed to copy his idea of the old family mansion on a scale of half an inch to a yard and in ebony and ivory instead of stone he could not have produced a closer imitation  everything was there  this is miraculous exclaimed he  i do not understand it  your friend seems to be curious in these matters said mr eldredge graciously  perhaps he is of some trade that makes this sort of manufacture particularly interesting to him  you are quite at liberty my friend to open the cabinet and inspect it as minutely as you wish it is an article that has a good deal to do with an obscure portion of our family history  look here is the key and the mode of opening the outer door of the palace as we may well call it  so saying he threw open the outer door and disclosed within the mimic likeness of a stately entrance hall with a floor chequered of ebony and ivory  there were other doors that seemed to open into apartments in the interior of the palace but when mr eldredge threw them likewise wide they proved to be drawers and secret receptacles where papers jewels money anything that it was desirable to store away secretly might be kept  you said sir said middleton thoughtfully that your family history contained matter of interest in reference to this cabinet  might i inquire what those legends are  why yes said mr eldredge musing a little  i see no reason why i should have any idle concealment about the matter especially to a foreigner and a man whom i am never likely to see again  you must know then my friend that there was once a time when this cabinet was known to contain the fate of the estate and its possessors and if it had held all that it was supposed to hold i should not now be the lord of pemberton manor nor the claimant of an ancient title  but my father and his father before him and his father besides have held the estate and prospered on it and i think we may fairly conclude now that the cabinet contains nothing except what we see  and he rapidly again threw open one after another all the numerous drawers and receptacles of the cabinet  it is an interesting object said middleton after looking very closely and with great attention at it being pressed thereto indeed by the owners goodnatured satisfaction in possessing this rare article of vertu  it is admirable work repeated he drawing back  that mosaic floor especially is done with an art and skill that i never saw equalled  there was something strange and altered in middletons tones that attracted the notice of mr eldredge  looking at him he saw that he had grown pale and had a rather bewildered air  is your friend ill said he  he has not our english ruggedness of look  he would have done better to take a sip of the cool tankard and a slice of the cold beef  he finds no such food and drink as that in his own country i warrant  his color has come back responded hammond briefly  he does not need any refreshment i think except perhaps the open air  in fact middleton recovering himself apologized to mr hammond eldredge and as they had now seen nearly the whole of the house the two visitants took their leave with many kindly offers on mr eldredges part to permit the young man to view the cabinet whenever he wished  as they went out of the house it was by another door than that which gave them entrance hammond laid his hand on middletons shoulder and pointed to a stone on the threshold on which he was about to set his foot take care said he  it is the bloody footstep  middleton looked down and saw something indeed very like the shape of a footprint with a hue very like that of blood  it was a twilight sort of a place beneath a porch which was much overshadowed by trees and shrubbery  it might have been blood but he rather thought in his wicked skepticism that it was a natural reddish stain in the stone  he measured his own foot however in the bloody footstep  may 10th mondaythis is the present aspect of the story middleton is the descendant of a family long settled in the united states his ancestor having emigrated to new england with the pilgrims or perhaps at a still earlier date to virginia with raleighs colonists  there had been a family dissensiona bitter hostility between two brothers in england on account probably of a love affair the two both being attached to the same lady  by the influence of the family on both sides the young lady had formed an engagement with the elder brother although her affections had settled on the younger  the marriage was about to take place when the younger brother and the bride both disappeared and were never heard of with any certainty afterwards but it was believed at the time that he had been killed and in proof of it a bloody footstep remained on the threshold of the ancestral mansion  there were rumors afterwards traditionally continued to the present day that the younger brother and the bride were seen and together in england and that some voyager across the sea had found them living together husband and wife on the other side of the atlantic  but the elder brother became a moody and reserved man never married and left the inheritance to the children of a third brother who then became the representative of the family in england and the better authenticated story was that the second brother had really been slain and that the young lady for all the parties may have been catholic had gone to the continent and taken the veil there such was the family history as known or surmised in england and in the neighborhood of the manorhouse where the bloody footstep still remained on the threshold and the posterity of the third brother still held the estate and perhaps were claimants of an ancient baronage long in abeyance  now on the other side of the atlantic the second brother and the young lady had really been married and became the parents of a posterity still extant of which the middleton of the romance is the surviving male  perhaps he had changed his name being so much tortured with the evil and wrong that had sprung up in his family so remorseful so outraged that he wished to disconnect himself with all the past and begin life quite anew in a new world  but both he and his wife though happy in one another had been remorsefully and sadly so and with such feelings they had never again communicated with their respective families nor had given their children the means of doing so  there must i think have been something nearly approaching to guilt on the second brothers part and the bride should have broken a solemnly plighted troth to the elder brother breaking away from him when almost his wife  the elder brother had been known to have been wounded at the time of the second brothers disappearance and it had been the surmise that he had received this hurt in the personal conflict in which the latter was slain  but in truth the second brother had stabbed him in the emergency of being discovered in the act of escaping with the bride and this was what weighed upon his conscience throughout life in america the american family had prolonged itself through various fortunes and all the ups and downs incident to our institutions until the present day  they had some old family documents which had been rather carelessly kept but the present representative being an educated man had looked over them and found one which interested him strongly  it waswhat was itperhaps a copy of a letter written by his ancestor on his deathbed telling his real name and relating the above incidents these incidents had come down in a vague wild way traditionally in the american family forming a wondrous and incredible legend which middleton had often laughed at yet been greatly interested in and the discovery of this document seemed to give a certain aspect of veracity and reality to the tradition  perhaps however the document only related to the change of name and made reference to certain evidences by which if any descendant of the family should deem it expedient he might prove his hereditary identity  the legend must be accounted for by having been gathered from the talk of the first ancestor and his wife there must be in existence in the early records of the colony an authenticated statement of this change of name and satisfactory proofs that the american family long known as middleton were really a branch of the english family of eldredge or whatever  and in the legend though not in the written document there must be an account of a certain magnificent almost palatial residence which middleton shall presume to be the ancestral house and in this palace there shall be said to be a certain secret chamber or receptacle where is reposited a document that shall complete the evidence of the genealogical descent  middleton is still a young man but already a distinguished one in his own country he has entered early into politics been sent to congress but having met with some disappointments in his ambitious hopes and being disgusted with the fierceness of political contests in our country he has come abroad for recreation and rest  his imagination has dwelt much in his boyhood on the legendary story of his family and the discovery of the document has revived these dreams  he determines to search out the family mansion and thus he arrives bringing half of a story being the only part known in america to join it on to the other half which is the only part known in england  in an introduction i must do the best i can to state his side of the matter to the reader he having communicated it to me in a friendly way at the consulate as many people have communicated quite as wild pretensions to english genealogies  he comes to the midland counties of england where he conceives his claims to lie and seeks for his ancestral home but there are difficulties in the way of finding it the estates having passed into the female line though still remaining in the blood  by and by however he comes to an old town where there is one of the charitable institutions bearing the name of his family by whose beneficence it had indeed been founded in queen elizabeths time  he of course becomes interested in this hospital he finds it still going on precisely as it did in the old days and all the character and life of the establishment must be picturesquely described  here he gets acquainted with an old man an inmate of the hospital who if the uncontrollable fatality of the story will permit must have an active influence on the ensuing events  i suppose him to have been an american but to have fled his country and taken refuge in england he shall have been a man of the nicholas biddle stamp a mighty speculator the ruin of whose schemes had crushed hundreds of people and middletons father among the rest  here he had quitted the activity of his mind as well as he could becoming a local antiquary etc and he has made himself acquainted with the family history of the eldredges knowing more about it than the members of the family themselves do  he had known in america from middletons father who was his friend the legends preserved in this branch of the family and perhaps had been struck by the way in which they fit into the english legends at any rate this strikes him when middleton tells him his story and shows him the document respecting the change of name  after various conversations together in which however the old man keeps the secret of his own identity and indeed acts as mysteriously as possible they go together to visit the ancestral mansion  perhaps it should not be in their first visit that the cabinet representing the stately mansion shall be seen  but the bloody footstep may which shall interest middleton much both because hammond has told him the english tradition respecting it and because too the legends of the american family made some obscure allusions to his ancestor having left blooda bloody footstepon the ancestral threshold  this is the point to which the story has now been sketched out  middleton finds a commonplace old english country gentleman in possession of the estate where his forefathers had lived in peace for many generations but there must be circumstances contrived which shall cause middletons conduct to be attended by no end of turmoil and trouble  the old hospitaller i suppose must be the malicious agent in this and his malice must be motived in some satisfactory way  the more serious question what shall be the nature of this tragic trouble and how can it be brought about  may 11th tuesdayhow much better would it have been if this secret which seemed so golden had remained in the obscurity in which two hundred years had buried it  that deep old grassgrown grave being opened out from it streamed into the sunshine the old fatalities the old crimes the old misfortunes the sorrows that seemed to have departed from the family forever  but it was too late now to close it up he must follow out the thread that led him onthe thread of fate if you choose to call it so but rather the impulse of an evil will a stubborn selfinterest a desire for certain objects of ambition which were preferred to what yet were recognized as real goods  thus reasoned thus raved eldredge as he considered the things that he had done and still intended to do nor did these perceptions make the slightest difference in his plans nor in the activity with which he set about their performance  for this purpose he sent for his lawyer and consulted him on the feasibility of the design which he had already communicated to him respecting middleton  but the man of law shook his head and though deferentially declined to have any active concern with the matter that threatened to lead him beyond the bounds which he allowed himself into a seductive but perilous region  my dear sir said he with some earnestness you had much better content yourself with such assistance as i can professionally and consistently give you  believe me i am willing to do a lawyers utmost and to do more would be as unsafe for the client as for the legal adviser  thus left without an agent and an instrument this unfortunate man had to meditate on what means he would use to gain his ends through his own unassisted efforts  in the struggle with himself through which he had passed he had exhausted pretty much all the feelings that he had to bestow on this matter and now he was ready to take hold of almost any temptation that might present itself so long as it showed a good prospect of success and a plausible chance of impunity  while he was thus musing he heard a female voice chanting some song like a birds among the pleasant foliage of the trees and soon he saw at the end of a woodwalk alice with her basket on her arm passing on toward the village  she looked towards him as she passed but made no pause nor yet hastened her steps not seeming to think it worth her while to be influenced by him  he hurried forward and overtook her  so there was this poor old gentleman his comfort utterly overthrown decking his white hair and wrinkled brow with the semblance of a coronet and only hoping that the reality might crown and bless him before he was laid in the ancestral tomb  it was a real calamity though by no means the greatest that had been fished up out of the pit of domestic discord that had been opened anew by the advent of the american and by the use which had been made of it by the cantankerous old man of the hospital middleton as he looked at these evil consequences sometimes regretted that he had not listened to those forebodings which had warned him back on the eve of his enterprise yet such was the strange entanglement and interest which had wound about him that often he rejoiced that for once he was engaged in something that absorbed him fully and the zeal for the development of which made him careless for the result in respect to its good or evil but only desirous that it show itself  as for alice she seemed to skim lightly through all these matters whether as a spirit of good or ill he could not satisfactorily judge  he could not think her wicked yet her actions seemed unaccountable on the plea that she was otherwise  it was another characteristic thread in the wild web of madness that had spun itself about all the prominent characters of our story  and when middleton thought of these things he felt as if it might be his duty supposing he had the power to shovel the earth again into the pit that he had been the means of opening but also felt that whether duty or not he would never perform it  for you see on the americans arrival he had found the estate in the hands of one of the descendants but some disclosures consequent on his arrival had thrown it into the hands of another or at all events had seemed to make it apparent that justice required that it should be so disposed of  no sooner was the discovery made than the possessor put on a coronet the new heir had commenced legal proceedings the sons of the respective branches had come to blows and blood and the devil knows what other devilish consequences had ensued  besides this there was much falling in love at crosspurposes and a general animosity of every body against everybody else in proportion to the closeness of the natural ties and their obligation to love one another  the moral if any moral were to be gathered from these petty and wretched circumstances was let the past alone do not seek to renew it press on to higher and better thingsat all events to other things and be assured that the right way can never be that which leads you back to the identical shapes that you long ago left behind  onward onward onward  what have you to do here said alice  your lot is in another land you have seen the birthplace of your forefathers and have gratified your natural yearning for it now return and cast in your lot with your own people let it be what it will  i fully believe that it is such a lot as the world has never yet seen and that the faults the weaknesses the errors of your countrymen will vanish away like morning mists before the rising sun  you can do nothing better than to go back  this is strange advice alice said middleton gazing at her and smiling  go back with such a fair prospect before me that were strange indeed  it is enough to keep me here that here only i shall see youenough to make me rejoice to have come that i have found you here  do not speak in this foolish way cried alice panting  i am giving you the best advice and speaking in the wisest way i am capable of speaking on good grounds tooand you turn me aside with a silly compliment  i tell you that this is no comedy in which we are performers but a deep sad tragedy and that it depends most upon you whether or no it shall be pressed to a catastrophe  think well of it  i have thought alice responded the young man and i must let things take their course if indeed it depends at all upon me which i see no present reason to suppose  yet i wish you would explain to me what you mean  to take up the story from the point where we left it by the aid of the americans revelations some light is thrown upon points of family history which induce the english possessor of the estate to suppose that the time has come for asserting his claim to a title which has long been in abeyance  he therefore sets about it and engages in great expenses besides contracting the enmity of many persons with whose interests he interferes  a further complication is brought about by the secret interference of the old hospitaller and alice goes singing and dancing through the whole in a way that makes her seem like a beautiful devil though finally it will be recognized that she is an angel of light middleton half bewildered can scarcely tell how much of this is due to his own agency how much is independent of him and would have happened had he stayed on his own side of the water  by and by a further and unexpected development presents the singular fact that he himself is the heir to whatever claims there are whether of property or rankall centring in him as the representative of the eldest brother  on this discovery there ensues a tragedy in the death of the present possessor of the estate who has staked everything upon the issue and middleton standing amid the ruin and desolation of which he has been the innocent cause resigns all the claims which he might now assert and retires arm in arm with alice who has encouraged him to take this course and to act up to his character  the estate takes a passage into the female line and the old name becomes extinct nor does middleton seek to continue it by resuming it in place of the one long ago assumed by his ancestor thus he and his wife become the adam and eve of a new epoch and the fitting missionaries of a new social faith of which there must be continual hints through the book  a knot of characters may be introduced as gathering around middleton comprising expatriated americans of all sorts the wandering printer who came to me so often at the consulate who said he was a native of philadelphia and could not go home in the thirty years that he had been trying to do so for lack of the money to pay his passage the large banker the consul of leeds the woman asserting her claims to half liverpool the gifted literary lady maddened by shakespeare etc etc the yankee who had been driven insane by the queens notice slight as it was of the photographs of his two children which he had sent her  i have not yet struck the true keynote of this romance and until i do and unless i do i shall write nothing but tediousness and nonsense  i do not wish it to be a picture of life but a romance grim grotesque quaint of which the hospital might be the fitting scene  it might have so much of the hues of life that the reader should sometimes think it was intended for a picture yet the atmosphere should be such as to excuse all wildness  in the introduction i might disclaim all intention to draw a real picture but say that the continual meetings i had with americans bent on such errands had suggested this wild story  the descriptions of scenery etc and of the hospital might be correct but there should be a tinge of the grotesque given to all the characters and events  the tragic and the gentler pathetic need not be excluded by the tone and treatment  if i could but write one central scene in this vein all the rest of the romance would readily arrange itself around that nucleus  the begginggirl would be another american character the actress too the caravan people  it must be humorous work or nothing   iii  may 12th wednesdaymiddleton found his abode here becoming daily more interesting and he sometimes thought that it was the sympathies with the place and people buried under the supergrowth of so many ages but now coming forth with the life and vigor of a fountain that long hidden beneath earth and ruins gushes out singing into the sunshine as soon as these are removed  he wandered about the neighborhood with insatiable interest sometimes and often lying on a hillside and gazing at the gray tower of the church sometimes coming into the village clustered round that same church and looking at the old timber and plaster houses the same except that the thatch had probably been often renewed that they used to be in his ancestors days  in those old cottages still dwelt the families the s the prices the hopnorts the copleys that had dwelt there when america was a scattered progeny of infant colonies and in the churchyard were the graves of all the generations sinceincluding the dust of those who had seen his ancestors face before his departure  the graves outside the church walls indeed bore no marks of this antiquity for it seems not to have been an early practice in england to put stones over such graves and where it has been done the climate causes the inscriptions soon to become obliterated and unintelligible but within the church there were rich words of the personages and times with whom middletons musings held so much converse  but one of his greatest employments and pastimes was to ramble through the grounds of smithells making himself as well acquainted with its wood paths its glens its woods its venerable trees as if he had been bred up there from infancy  some of those old oaks his ancestor might have been acquainted with while they were already sturdy and wellgrown trees might have climbed them in boyhood might have mused beneath them as a lover might have flung himself at full length on the turf beneath them in the bitter anguish that must have preceded his departure forever from the home of his forefathers  in order to secure an uninterrupted enjoyment of his rambles here middleton had secured the goodwill of the gamekeepers and other underlings whom he was likely to meet about the grounds by giving them a shilling or a halfcrown and he was now free to wander where he would with only the advice rather than the caution to keep out of the way of their old masterfor there might be trouble if he should meet a stranger on the grounds in any of his tantrums but in fact mr eldredge was not much in the habit of walking about the grounds and there were hours of every day during which it was altogether improbable that he would have emerged from his own apartments in the manorhouse  these were the hours therefore when middleton most frequented the estate although to say the truth he would gladly have so timed his visits as to meet and form an acquaintance with the lonely lord of this beautiful property his own kinsman though with so many ages of dark oblivion between  for middleton had not that feeling of infinite distance in the relationship which he would have had if his branch of the family had continued in england and had not intermarried with the other branch through such a long waste of years he rather felt as if he were the original emigrant who long resident on a foreign shore had now returned with a heart brimful of tenderness to revisit the scenes of his youth and renew his tender relations with those who shared his own blood  there was not however much in what he heard of the character of the present possessor of the estateor indeed in the strong family characteristic that had become hereditaryto encourage him to attempt any advances  it is very probable that the religion of mr eldredge as a catholic may have excited a prejudice against him as it certainly had insulated the family in a great degree from the sympathies of the neighborhood  mr eldredge moreover had resided long on the continent long in italy and had come back with habits that little accorded with those of the gentry of the neighborhood so that in fact he was almost as much of a stranger and perhaps quite as little of a real englishman as middleton himself  be that as it might middleton when he sought to learn something about him heard the strangest stories of his habits of life of his temper and of his employments from the people with whom he conversed  the old legend turning upon the monomania of the family was revived in full force in reference to this poor gentleman and many a time middletons interlocutors shook their wise heads saying with a knowing look and under their breath that the old gentleman was looking for the track of the bloody footstep  they fabledor said for it might not have been a false storythat every descendant of this house had a certain portion of his life during which he sought the track of that footstep which was left on the threshold of the mansion that he sought it far and wide over every foot of the estate not only on the estate but throughout the neighborhood not only in the neighborhood but all over england not only throughout england but all about the world  it was the belief of the neighborhoodat least of some old men and women in itthat the long period of mr eldredges absence from england had been spent in the search for some trace of those departing footsteps that had never returned  it is very possibleprobable indeedthat there may have been some ground for this remarkable legend not that it is to be credited that the family of eldredge being reckoned among sane men would seriously have sought years and generations after the fact for the first track of those bloody footsteps which the first rain of drippy england must have washed away to say nothing of the leaves that had fallen and the growth and decay of so many seasons that covered all traces of them since  but nothing is more probable than that the continual recurrence to the family genealogy which had been necessitated by the matter of the dormant peerage had caused the eldredges from father to son to keep alive an interest in that ancestor who had disappeared and who had been supposed to carry some of the most important family papers with him  but yet it gave middleton a strange thrill of pleasure that had something fearful in it to think that all through these ages he had been waited for sought for anxiously expected as it were it seemed as if the very ghosts of his kindred a long shadowy line held forth their dim arms to welcome him a line stretching back to the ghosts of those who had flourished in the old old times the doubletted and beruffled knightly shades of queen elizabeths time a long line stretching from the mediaeval ages and their duskiness downward downward with only one vacant space that of him who had left the bloody footstep  there was an inexpressible pleasure airy and evanescent gone in a moment if he dwelt upon it too thoughtfully but very sweet to middletons imagination in this idea when he reflected however that his revelations if they had any effect at all might serve only to quench the hopes of these long expectants it of course made him hesitate to declare himself  one afternoon when he was in the midst of musings such as this he saw at a distance through the park in the direction of the manorhouse a person who seemed to be walking slowly and seeking for something upon the ground  he was a long way off when middleton first perceived him and there were two clumps of trees and underbrush with interspersed tracts of sunny lawn between them  the person whoever he was kept on and plunged into the first clump of shrubbery still keeping his eyes on the ground as if intensely searching for something  when he emerged from the concealment of the first clump of shrubbery middleton saw that he was a tall thin person in a dark dress and this was the chief observation that the distance enabled him to make as the figure kept slowly onward in a somewhat wavering line and plunged into the second clump of shrubbery  from that too he emerged and soon appeared to be a thin elderly figure of a dark man with gray hair bent as it seemed to middleton with infirmity for his figure still stooped even in the intervals when he did not appear to be tracking the ground  but middleton could not but be surprised at the singular appearance the figure had of setting its foot at every step just where a previous footstep had been made as if he wanted to measure his whole pathway in the track of somebody who had recently gone over the ground in advance of him  middleton was sitting at the foot of an oak and he began to feel some awkwardness in the consideration of what he would do if mr eldredgefor he could not doubt that it was hewere to be led just to this spot in pursuit of his singular occupation  and even so it proved  middleton could not feel it manly to fly and hide himself like a guilty thing and indeed the hospitality of the english country gentleman in many cases gives the neighborhood and the stranger a certain degree of freedom in the use of the broad expanse of ground in which they and their forefathers have loved to sequester their residences  the figure kept on showing more and more distinctly the tall meagre not unvenerable features of a gentleman in the decline of life apparently in illhealth with a dark face that might once have been full of energy but now seemed enfeebled by time passion and perhaps sorrow  but it was strange to see the earnestness with which he looked on the ground and the accuracy with which he at last set his foot apparently adjusting it exactly to some footprint before him and middleton doubted not that having studied and restudied the family records and the judicial examinations which described exactly the track that was seen the day after the memorable disappearance of his ancestor mr eldredge was now in some freak or for some purpose best known to himself practically following it out  and follow it out he did until at last he lifted up his eyes muttering to himself at this point the footsteps wholly disappear  lifting his eyes as we have said while thus regretfully and despairingly muttering these words he saw middleton against the oak within three paces of him  may 13th thursdaymr eldredge for it was he first kept his eyes fixed full on middletons face with an expression as if he saw him not but graduallyslowly at firsthe seemed to become aware of his presence then with a sudden flush he took in the idea that he was encountered by a stranger in his secret mood  a flush of anger or shame perhaps both reddened over his face his eyes gleamed and he spoke hastily and roughly  who are you he said  how come you here  i allow no intruders in my park  begone fellow  really sir i did not mean to intrude upon you said middleton blandly  i am aware that i owe you an apology but the beauties of your park must plead my excuse and the constant kindness of the english gentleman which admits a stranger to the privilege of enjoying so much of the beauty in which he himself dwells as the strangers taste permits him to enjoy  an artist perhaps said mr eldredge somewhat less uncourteously  i am told that they love to come here and sketch those old oaks and their vistas and the old mansion yonder  but you are an obtrusive set you artists and think that a pencil and a sheet of paper may be your passport anywhere  you are mistaken sir  my park is not open to strangers  i am sorry then to have intruded upon you said middleton still in good humor for in truth he felt a sort of kindness a sentiment ridiculous as it may appear of kindred towards the old gentleman and besides was not unwilling in any way to prolong a conversation in which he found a singular interest  i am sorry especially as i have not even the excuse you kindly suggest for me  i am not an artist only an american who have strayed hither to enjoy this gentle cultivated tamed nature which i find in english parks so contrasting with the wild rugged nature of my native land  i beg your pardon and will retire  an american repeated mr eldredge looking curiously at him  ah you are wild men in that country i suppose and cannot conceive that an english gentleman encloses his groundsor that his ancestors have done so before himfor his own pleasure and convenience and does not calculate on having it infringed upon by everybody like your own forests as you say  it is a curious country that of yours and in italy i have seen curious people from it  true sir said middleton smiling  we send queer specimens abroad but englishmen should consider that we spring from them and that we present after all only a picture of their own characteristics a little varied by climate and in situation  mr eldredge looked at him with a certain kind of interest and it seemed to middleton that he was not unwilling to continue the conversation if a fair way to do so could only be afforded to him  a secluded man often grasps at any opportunity of communicating with his kind when it is casually offered to him and for the nonce is surprisingly familiar running out towards his chancecompanion with the gush of a dammedup torrent suddenly unlocked  as middleton made a motion to retire he put out his hand with an air of authority to restrain him  stay said he  now that you are here the mischief is done and you cannot repair it by hastening away  you have interrupted me in my mood of thought and must pay the penalty by suggesting other thoughts  i am a lonely man here having spent most of my life abroad and am separated from my neighbors by various circumstances  you seem to be an intelligent man  i should like to ask you a few questions about your country  he looked at middleton as he spoke and seemed to be considering in what rank of life he should place him his dress being such as suited a humble rank  he seemed not to have come to any very certain decision on this point  i remember said he you have no distinctions of rank in your country a convenient thing enough in some respects  when there are no gentlemen all are gentlemen  so let it be  you speak of being englishmen and it has often occurred to me that englishmen have left this country and been much missed and sought after who might perhaps be sought there successfully  it is certainly so mr eldredge said middleton lifting his eyes to his face as he spoke and then turning them aside  many footsteps the track of which is lost in england might be found reappearing on the other side of the atlantic ay though it be hundreds of years since the track was lost here  middleton though he had refrained from looking full at mr eldredge as he spoke was conscious that he gave a great start and he remained silent for a moment or two and when he spoke there was the tremor in his voice of a nerve that had been struck and still vibrated  that is a singular idea of yours he at length said not singular in itself but strangely coincident with something that happened to be occupying my mind  have you ever heard any such instances as you speak of  yes replied middleton i have had pointed out to me the rightful heir to a scottish earldom in the person of an american farmer in his shirtsleeves  there are many americans who believe themselves to hold similar claims  and i have known one family at least who had in their possession and had had for two centuries a secret that might have been worth wealth and honors if known in england  indeed being kindred as we are it cannot but be the case  mr eldredge appeared to be much struck by these last words and gazed wistfully almost wildly at middleton as if debating with himself whether to say more  he made a step or two aside then returned abruptly and spoke  can you tell me the name of the family in which this secret was kept said he and the nature of the secret  the nature of the secret said middleton smiling was not likely to be extended to any one out of the family  the name borne by the family was middleton  there is no member of it so far as i am aware at this moment remaining in america  and has the secret died with them asked mr eldredge  they communicated it to none said middleton  it is a pity  it was a villainous wrong said mr eldredge  and so it may be some ancient line in the old country is defrauded of its rights for want of what might have been obtained from this yankee whose democracy has demoralized them to the perception of what is due to the antiquity of descent and of the bounden duty that there is in all ranks to keep up the honor of a family that has had potence enough to preserve itself in distinction for a thousand years  yes said middleton quietly we have sympathy with what is strong and vivacious today none with what was so yesterday  the remark seemed not to please mr eldredge he frowned and muttered something to himself but recovering himself addressed middleton with more courtesy than at the commencement of their interview and with this graciousness his face and manner grew very agreeable almost fascinating he was still haughty however  well sir said he i am not sorry to have met you  i am a solitary man as i have said and a little communication with a stranger is a refreshment which i enjoy seldom enough to be sensible of it  pray are you staying hereabouts  middleton signified to him that he might probably spend some little time in the village  then during your stay maid mr eldredge make free use of the walks in these grounds and though it is not probable that you will meet me in them again you need apprehend no second questioning of your right to be here  my house has many points of curiosity that may be of interest to a stranger from a new country  perhaps you have heard of some of them  i have heard some wild legend about a bloody footstep answered middleton indeed i think i remember hearing something about it in my own country and having a fanciful sort of interest in such things i took advantage of the hospitable custom which opens the doors of curious old houses to strangers to go to see it  it seemed to me i confess only a natural stain in the old stone that forms the doorstep  there sir said mr eldredge let me say that you came to a very foolish conclusion and so goodby sir  and without further ceremony he cast an angry glance at middleton who perceived that the old gentleman reckoned the bloody footstep among his ancestral honors and would probably have parted with his claim to the peerage almost as soon as have given up the legend  present aspect of the story middleton on his arrival becomes acquainted with the old hospitaller and is familiarized at the hospital  he pays a visit in his company to the manorhouse but merely glimpses at its remarkable things at this visit among others at the old cabinet which does not at first view strike him very strongly  but on musing about his visit afterwards he finds the recollection of the cabinet strangely identifying itself with his previous imaginary picture of the palatial mansion so that at last he begins to conceive the mistake he has made at this first visit he does not have a personal interview with the possessor of the estate but as the hospitaller and himself go from room to room he finds that the owner is preceding them shyly flitting like a ghost so as to avoid them  then there is a chapter about the character of the eldredge of the day a catholic a morbid shy man representing all the peculiarities of an old family and generally thought to be insane  and then comes the interview between him and middleton where the latter excites such an interest that he dwells upon the old mans mind and the latter probably takes pains to obtain further intercourse with him and perhaps invites him to dinner and to spend a night in his house  if so this second meeting must lead to the examination of the cabinet and the discovery of some family documents in it  perhaps the cabinet may be in middletons sleepingchamber and he examines it by himself before going to bed and finds out a secret which will perplex him how to deal with it  may 14th fridaywe have spoken several times already of a young girl who was seen at this period about the little antiquated village of smithells a girl in manners and in aspect unlike those of the cottages amid which she dwelt  middleton had now so often met her and in solitary places that an acquaintance had inevitably established itself between them  he had ascertained that she had lodgings at a farmhouse near by and that she was connected in some way with the old hospitaller whose acquaintance had proved of such interest to him but more than this he could not learn either from her or others  but he was greatly attracted and interested by the free spirit and fearlessness of this young woman nor could he conceive where in staid and formal england she had grown up to be such as she was so without manner so without art yet so capable of doing and thinking for herself  she had no reserve apparently yet never seemed to sin against decorum it never appeared to restrain her that anything she might wish to do was contrary to custom she had nothing of what could be called shyness in her intercourse with him and yet he was conscious of an unapproachableness in alice  often in the old mans presence she mingled in the conversation that went on between him and middleton and with an acuteness that betokened a sphere of thought much beyond what could be customary with young english maidens and middleton was often reminded of the theories of those in our own country who believe that the amelioration of society depends greatly on the part that women shall hereafter take according to their individual capacity in all the various pursuits of life  these deeper thoughts these higher qualities surprised him as they showed themselves whenever occasion called them forth under the light gay and frivolous exterior which she had at first seemed to present  middleton often amused himself with surmises in what rank of life alice could have been bred being so free of all conventional rule yet so nice and delicate in her perception of the true proprieties that she never shocked him  one morning when they had met in one of middletons rambles about the neighborhood they began to talk of america and middleton described to alice the stir that was being made in behalf of womens rights and he said that whatever cause was generous and disinterested always in that country derived much of its power from the sympathy of women and that the advocates of every such cause were in favor of yielding the whole field of human effort to be shared with women  i have been surprised said he in the little i have seen and heard of englishwomen to discover what a difference there is between them and my own countrywomen  i have heard said alice with a smile that your countrywomen are a far more delicate and fragile race than englishwomen pale feeble hothouse plants unfit for the wear and tear of life without energy of character or any slightest degree of physical strength to base it upon if now you had these largeframed englishwomen you might i should imagine with better hopes set about changing the system of society so as to allow them to struggle in the strife of politics or any other strife hand to hand or side by side with men  if any countryman of mine has said this of our women exclaimed middleton indignantly he is a slanderous villain unworthy to have been borne by an american mother if an englishman has said itas i know many of them have and dolet it pass as one of the many prejudices only half believed with which they strive to console themselves for the inevitable sense that the american race is destined to higher purposes than their own  but pardon me i forgot that i was speaking to an englishwoman for indeed you do not remind me of them  but i assure you the world has not seen such women as make up i had almost said the mass of womanhood in my own country slight in aspect slender in frame as you suggest but yet capable of bringing forth stalwart men they themselves being of inexhaustible courage patience energy soft and tender deep of heart but high of purpose  gentle refined but bold in every good cause  oh you have said quite enough replied alice who had seemed ready to laugh outright during this encomium  i think i see one of those paragons now in a bloomer i think you call it swaggering along with a bowie knife at her girdle smoking a cigar no doubt and tippling sherrycobblers and mintjuleps  it must be a pleasant life  i should think you at least might form a more just idea of what women become said middleton considerably piqued in a country where the roles of conventionalism are somewhat relaxed where woman whatever you may think is far more profoundly educated than in england where a few illtaught accomplishments a little geography a catechism of science make up the sum under the superintendence of a governess the mind being kept entirely inert as to any capacity for thought  they are cowards except within certain rules and forms they spend a life of old proprieties and die and if their souls do not die with them it is heavens mercy  alice did not appear in the least moved to anger though considerably to mirth by this description of the character of english females  she laughed as she replied i see there is little danger of your leaving your heart in england  she added more seriously and permit me to say i trust mr middleton that you remain as much american in other respects as in your preference of your own race of women  the american who comes hither and persuades himself that he is one with englishmen it seems to me makes a great mistake at least if he is correct in such an idea he is not worthy of his own country and the high development that awaits it  there is much that is seductive in our life but i think it is not upon the higher impulses of our nature that such seductions act i should think ill of the american who for any causes of ambitionany hope of wealth or rankor even for the sake of any of those old delightful ideas of the past the associations of ancestry the loveliness of an agelong homethe old poetry and romance that haunt these ancient villages and estates of englandwould give up the chance of acting upon the unmoulded future of america  and you an englishwoman speak thus exclaimed middleton  you perhaps speak truly and it may be that your words go to a point where they are especially applicable at this moment  but where have you learned these ideas  and how is it that you know how to awake these sympathies that have slept perhaps too long  think only if what i have said be the truth replied alice  it is no matter who or what i am that speak it  do you speak asked middleton from a sudden impulse with any secret knowledge affecting a matter now in my mind  alice shook her head as she turned away but middleton could not determine whether the gesture was meant as a negative to his question or merely as declining to answer it  she left him and he found himself strangely disturbed with thoughts of his own country of the life that he ought to be leading there the struggles in which he ought to be taking part and with these motives in his impressible mind the motives that had hitherto kept him in england seemed unworthy to influence him  may 15th saturdayit was not long after middletons meeting with mr eldredge in the park of smithells that he receivedwhat it is precisely the most common thing to receivean invitation to dine at the manorhouse and spend the night  the note was written with much appearance of cordiality as well as in a respectful style and middleton could not but perceive that mr eldredge must have been making some inquiries as to his social status in order to feel him justified in putting him on this footing of equality  he had no hesitation in accepting the invitation and on the appointed day was received in the old house of his forefathers as a guest  the owner met him not quite on the frank and friendly footing expressed in his note but still with a perfect and polished courtesy which however could not hide from the sensitive middleton a certain coldness a something that seemed to him italian rather than english a symbol of a condition of things between them undecided suspicious doubtful very likely  middletons own manner corresponded to that of his host and they made few advances towards more intimate acquaintance  middleton was however recompensed for his hosts unapproachableness by the society of his daughter a young lady born indeed in italy but who had been educated in a catholic family in england so that here was another relationthe first female oneto whoa he had been introduced  she was a quiet shy undemonstrative young woman with a fine bloom and other charms which she kept as much in the background as possible with maiden reserve  there is a catholic priest at table  mr eldredge talked chiefly during dinner of art with which his long residence in italy had made him thoroughly acquainted and for which he seemed to have a genuine taste and enjoyment  it was a subject on which middleton knew little but he felt the interest in it which appears to be not uncharacteristic of americans among the earliest of their developments of cultivation nor had he failed to use such few opportunities as the english public or private galleries offered him to acquire the rudiments of a taste  he was surprised at the depth of some of mr eldredges remarks on the topics thus brought up and at the sensibility which appeared to be disclosed by his delicate appreciation of some of the excellencies of those great masters who wrote their epics their tender sonnets or their simple ballads upon canvas and middleton conceived a respect for him which he had not hitherto felt and which possibly mr eldredge did not quite deserve  taste seems to be a department of moral sense and yet it is so little identical with it and so little implies conscience that some of the worst men in the world have been the most refined  after miss eldredge had retired the host appeared to desire to make the dinner a little more social than it had hitherto been he called for a peculiar species of wine from southern italy which he said was the most delicious production of the grape and had very seldom if ever before been imported pure into england  a delicious perfume came from the cradled bottle and bore an ethereal evanescent testimony to the truth of what he said and the taste though too delicate for wine quaffed in england was nevertheless delicious when minutely dwelt upon  it gives me pleasure to drink your health mr middleton said the host  we might well meet as friends in england for i am hardly more an englishman than yourself bred up as i have been in italy and coming back hither at my age unaccustomed to the manners of the country with few friends and insulated from society by a faith which makes most people regard me as an enemy  i seldom welcome people here mr middleton but you are welcome  i thank you mr eldredge and may fairly say that the circumstances to which you allude make me accept your hospitality with a warmer feeling than i otherwise might  strangers meeting in a strange land have a sort of tie in their foreignness to those around them though there be no positive relation between themselves  we are friends then said mr eldredge looking keenly at middleton as if to discover exactly how much was meant by the compact  he continued you know i suppose mr middleton the situation in which i find myself on returning to my hereditary estate which has devolved to me somewhat unexpectedly by the death of a younger man than myself there is an old flaw here as perhaps you have been told which keeps me out of a property long kept in the guardianship of the crown and of a barony one of the oldest in england  there is an ideaa traditiona legend founded however on evidence of some weight that there is still in existence the possibility of finding the proof which we need to confirm our cause  i am most happy to hear it mr eldredge said middleton  but continued his host i am bound to remember and to consider that for several generations there seems to have been the same idea and the same expectation whereas nothing has ever come of it  now among other suppositionsperhaps wild onesit has occurred to me that this testimony the desirable proof may exist on your side of the atlantic for it has long enough been sought here in vain  as i said in our meeting in your park mr eldredge replied middleton such a suggestion may very possibly be true yet let me point out that the long lapse of years and the continual melting and dissolving of family institutionsthe consequent scattering of family documents and the annihilation of traditions from memory all conspire against its probability  and yet mr middleton said his host when we talked together at our first singular interview you made use of an expressionof one remarkable phrasewhich dwelt upon my memory and now recurs to it  and what was that mr eldredge asked middleton  you spoke replied his host of the bloody footstep reappearing on the threshold of the old palace of s  now where let me ask you did you ever hear this strange name which you then spoke and which i have since spoken  from my fathers lips when a child in america responded middleton  it is very strange said mr eldredge in a hasty dissatisfied tone i do not see my way through this  may 16th sundaymiddleton had been put into a chamber in the oldest part of the house the furniture of which was of antique splendor well befitting to have come down for ages well befitting the hospitality shown to noble and even royal guests  it was the same room in which at his first visit to the house middletons attention had been drawn to the cabinet which he had subsequently remembered as the palatial residence in which he had harbored so many dreams  it still stood in the chamber making the principal object in it indeed and when middleton was left alone he contemplated it not without a certain awe which at the same time he felt to be ridiculous  he advanced towards it and stood contemplating the mimic facade wondering at the singular fact of this piece of furniture having been preserved in traditionary history when so much had been forgottenwhen even the features and architectural characteristics of the mansion in which it was merely a piece of furniture had been forgotten  and as he gazed at it he half thought himself an actor in a fairy portal tale and would not have been surprisedat least he would have taken it with the composure of a dreamif the mimic portal had unclosed and a form of pigmy majesty had appeared within beckoning him to enter and find the revelation of what had so long perplexed him  the key of the cabinet was in the lock and knowing that it was not now the receptacle of anything in the shape of family papers he threw it open and there appeared the mosaic floor the representation of a stately pillared hall with the doors on either side opening as would seem into various apartments  and here should have stood the visionary figures of his ancestry waiting to welcome the descendant of their race who had so long delayed his coming  after looking and musing a considerable timeeven till the old clock from the turret of the house told twelve he turned away with a sigh and went to bed  the wind moaned through the ancestral trees the old house creaked as with ghostly footsteps the curtains of his bed seemed to waver  he was now at home yes he had found his home and was sheltered at last under the ancestral roof after all those long long wanderingsafter the little logbuilt hut of the early settlement after the straight roof of the american house after all the many roofs of two hundred years here he was at last under the one which he had left on that fatal night when the bloody footstep was so mysteriously impressed on the threshold as he drew nearer and nearer towards sleep it seemed more and more to him as if he were the very individualthe selfsame one throughout the wholewho had done seen suffered all these long toils and vicissitudes and were now come back to rest and found his weariness so great that there could be no rest  nevertheless he did sleep and it may be that his dreams went on and grew vivid and perhaps became truer in proportion to their vividness when he awoke he had a perception an intuition that he had been dreaming about the cabinet which in his sleeping imagination had again assumed the magnitude and proportions of a stately mansion even as he had seen it afar from the other side of the atlantic  some dim associations remained lingering behind the dying shadows of very vivid ones which had just filled his mind but as he looked at the cabinet there was some idea that still seemed to come so near his consciousness that every moment he felt on the point of grasping it  during the process of dressing he still kept his eyes turned involuntarily towards the cabinet and at last he approached it and looked within the mimic portal still endeavoring to recollect what it was that he had heard or dreamed about itwhat half obliterated remembrance from childhood what fragmentary last nights dream it was that thus haunted him  it must have been some association of one or the other nature that led him to press his finger on one particular square of the mosaic pavement and as he did so the thin plate of polished marble slipt aside  it disclosed indeed no hollow receptacle but only another leaf of marble in the midst of which appeared to be a keyhole to this middleton applied the little antique key to which we have several times alluded and found it fit precisely  the instant it was turned the whole mimic floor of the hall rose by the action of a secret spring and discovered a shallow recess beneath  middleton looked eagerly in and saw that it contained documents with antique seals of wax appended he took but one glance at them and closed the receptacle as it was before  why did he do so  he felt that there would be a meanness and wrong in inspecting these family papers coming to the knowledge of them as he had through the opportunities offered by the hospitality of the owner of the estate nor on the other hand did he feel such confidence in his host as to make him willing to trust these papers in his hands with any certainty that they would be put to an honorable use  the case was one demanding consideration and he put a strong curb upon his impatient curiosity conscious that at all events his first impulsive feeling was that he ought not to examine these papers without the presence of his host or some other authorized witness  had he exercised any casuistry about the point however he might have argued that these papers according to all appearance dated from a period to which his own hereditary claims ascended and to circumstances in which his own rightful interest was as strong as that of mr eldredge  but he had acted on his first impulse closed the secret receptacle and hastening his toilet descended from his room and it being still too early for breakfast resolved to ramble about the immediate vicinity of the house as he passed the little chapel he heard within the voice of the priest performing mass and felt how strange was this sign of mediaeval religion and foreign manners in homely england  as the story looks now eldredge bred and perhaps born in italy and a catholic with views to the church before he inherited the estate has not the english moral sense and simple honor can scarcely be called an englishman at all  dark suspicions of past crime and of the possibility of future crime may be thrown around him an atmosphere of doubt shall envelop him though as regards manners he may be highly refined middleton shall find in the house a priest and at his first visit he shall have seen a small chapel adorned with the richness as to marbles pictures and frescoes of those that we see in the churches at rome and here the catholic forms of worship shall be kept up  eldredge shall have had an italian mother and shall have the personal characteristics of an italian  there shall be something sinister about him the more apparent when middletons visit draws to a conclusion and the latter shall feel convinced that they part in enmity so far as eldredge is concerned  he shall not speak of his discovery in the cabinet  may 17th mondayunquestionably the appointment of middleton as minister to one of the minor continental courts must take place in the interval between eldredges meeting him in the park and his inviting him to his house  after middletons appointment the two encounter each other at the mayors dinner in st marys hall and eldredge startled at meeting the vagrant as he deemed him under such a character remembers the hints of some secret knowledge of the family history which middleton had thrown out  he endeavors both in person and by the priest to make out what middleton really is and what he knows and what he intends but middleton is on his guard yet cannot help arousing eldredges suspicions that he has views upon the estate and title  it is possible too that middleton may have come to the knowledgemay have had some knowledgeof some shameful or criminal fact connected with mr eldredges life on the continent the old hospitaller possibly may have told him this from some secret malignity hereafter to be accounted for  supposing eldredge to attempt his murder by poison for instance bringing back into modern life his old hereditary italian plots and into english life a sort of crime which does not belong to itwhich did not at least although at this very period there have been fresh and numerous instances of it there might be a scene in which middleton and eldredge come to a fierce and bitter explanation for in eldredges character there must be the english surly boldness as well as the italian subtlety and here middleton shall tell him what he knows of his past character and life and also what he knows of his own hereditary claims  eldredge might have committed a murder in italy might have been a patriot and betrayed his friends to death for a bribe bearing another name than his own in italy indeed he might have joined them only as an informer  all this he had tried to sink when he came to england in the character of a gentleman of ancient name and large estate  but this infamy of his previous character must be foreboded from the first by the manner in which eldredge is introduced and it must make his evil designs on middleton appear natural and probable  it may be that middleton has learned eldredges previous character through some italian patriot who had taken refuge in america and there become intimate with him and it should be a piece of secret history not known to the world in general so that middleton might seem to eldredge the sole depositary of the secret then in england  he feels a necessity of getting rid of him and thenceforth middletons path lies always among pitfalls indeed the first attempt should follow promptly and immediately on his rupture with eldredge  the utmost pains must be taken with this incident to give it an air of reality or else it must be quite removed out of the sphere of reality by an intensified atmosphere of romance  i think the old hospitaller must interfere to prevent the success of this attempt perhaps through the means of alice  the result of eldredges criminal and treacherous designs is somehow or other that he comes to his death and middleton and alice are left to administer on the remains of the story perhaps the mayor being his friend he may be brought into play here  the foreign ecclesiastic shall likewise come forward and he shall prove to be a man of subtile policy perhaps yet a man of religion and honor with a jesuits principles but a jesuits devotion and selfsacrifice  the old hospitaller must die in his bed or some other how or perhaps notwe shall see  he may just as well be left in the hospital  eldredges attempt on middleton must be in some way peculiar to italy and which he shall have learned there and by the way at his dinnertable there shall be a venice glass one of the kind that were supposed to be shattered when poison was put into them when eldredge produces his rare wine he shall pour it into this with a jesting allusion to the legend  perhaps the mode of eldredges attempt on middletons life shall be a reproduction of the attempt made two hundred years before and middletons knowledge of that incident shall be the means of his salvation  that would be a good idea in fact i think it must be done so and no otherwise  it is not to be forgotten that there is a taint of insanity in eldredges blood accounting for much that is wild and absurd at the same time that it must be subtile in his conduct one of those perplexing mad people whose lunacy you are continually mistaking for wickedness or vice versa  this shall be the priests explanation and apology for him after his death  i wish i could get hold of the newgate calendar the older volumes or any other book of murdersthe causes celebres for instance  the legendary murder or attempt at it will bring its own imaginative probability with it when repeated by eldredge and at the same time it will have a dreamlike effect so that middleton shall hardly know whether he is awake or not  this incident is very essential towards bringing together the past time and the present and the two ends of the story  may 18th tuesdayall down through the ages since edward had disappeared from home leaving that bloody footstep on the threshold there had been legends and strange stories of the murder and the manner of it  these legends differed very much among themselves  according to some his brother had awaited him there and stabbed him on the threshold  according to others he had been murdered in his chamber and dragged out  a third story told that he was escaping with his lady love when they were overtaken on the threshold and the young man slain it was impossible at this distance of time to ascertain which of these legends was the true one or whether either of them had any portion of truth further than that the young man had actually disappeared from that night and that it never was certainly known to the public that any intelligence had ever afterwards been received from him  now middleton may have communicated to eldredge the truth in regard to the matter as for instance that he had stabbed him with a certain dagger that was still kept among the curiosities of the manorhouse  of course that will not do  it must be some very ingenious and artificially natural thing an artistic affair in its way that should strike the fancy of such a man as eldredge and appear to him altogether fit mutatis mutandis to be applied to his own requirements and purposes  i do not at present see in the least how this is to be wrought out  there shall be everything to make eldredge look with the utmost horror and alarm at any chance that he may be superseded and ousted from his possession of the estate for he shall only recently have established his claim to it tracing out his pedigree when the family was supposed to be extinct and he is come to these comfortable quarters after a life of poverty uncertainty difficulty hanging loose on society and therefore he shall be willing to risk soul and body both rather than return to his former state  perhaps his daughter shall be introduced as a young italian girl to whom middleton shall decide to leave the estate  on the failure of his design eldredge may commit suicide and be found dead in the wood at any rate some suitable end shall be contrived adapted to his wants  this character must not be so represented as to shut him out completely from the readers sympathies he shall have taste sentiment even a capacity for affection nor i think ought he to have any hatred or bitter feeling against the man whom he resolves to murder  in the closing scenes when he thinks the fate of middleton approaching there might even be a certain tenderness towards him a desire to make the last drops of life delightful if well done this would produce a certain sort of horror that i do not remember to have seen effected in literature  possibly the ancient emigrant might be supposed to have fallen into an ancient mine down a precipice into some pitfall no not so  into a river into a moat  as middletons pretensions to birth are not publicly known there will be no reason why at his sudden death suspicion should fix on eldredge as the murderer and it shall be his object so to contrive his death as that it shall appear the result of accident  having failed in effecting middletons death by this excellent way he shall perhaps think that he cannot do better them to make his own exit in precisely the same manner  it might be easy and as delightful as any death could be no ugliness in it no blood for the bloody footstep of old times might be the result of the failure of the old plot not of its success  poison seems to be the only elegant method but poison is vulgar and in many respects unfit for my purpose  it wont do  whatever it may be it must not come upon the reader as a sudden and new thing but as one that might have been foreseen from afar though he shall not actually have foreseen it until it is about to happen  it must be prevented through the agency of alice alice may have been an artist in rome and there have known eldredge and his daughter and thus she may have become their guest in england or he may be patronizing her nowat all events she shall be the friend of the daughter and shall have a just appreciation of the fathers character it shall be partly due to her high counsel that middleton foregoes his claim to the estate and prefers the life of an american with its lofty possibilities for himself and his race to the position of an englishman of property and title and she for her part shall choose the condition and prospects of woman in america to the emptiness of the life of a woman of rank in england  so they shall depart lofty and poor out of the home which might be their own if they would stoop to make it so possibly the daughter of eldredge may be a girl not yet in her teens for whom alice has the affection of an elder sister  it should be a very carefully and highly wrought scene occurring just before eldredges actual attempt on middletons life in which all the brilliancy of his characterwhich shall before have gleamed upon the readershall come out with pathos with wit with insight with knowledge of life  middleton shall be inspired by this and shall vie with him in exhilaration of spirits but the ecclesiastic shall look on with singular attention and some appearance of alarm and the suspicion of alice shall likewise be aroused  the old hospitaller may have gained his situation partly by proving himself a man of the neighborhood by right of descent so that he too shall have a hereditary claim to be in the romance  eldredges own position as a foreigner in the midst of english home life insulated and dreary shall represent to middleton in some degree what his own would be were he to accept the estate  but middleton shall not come to the decision to resign it without having to repress a deep yearning for that sense of long long rest in an ageconsecrated home which he had felt so deeply to be the happy lot of englishmen  but this ought to be rejected as not belonging to his country nor to the age nor any longer possible  may 19th wednesdaythe connection of the old hospitaller with the story is not at all clear  he is an american by birth but deriving his english origin from the neighborhood of the hospital where he has finally established himself  some one of his ancestors may have been somehow connected with the ancient portion of the story  he has been a friend of middletons father who reposed entire confidence in him trusting him with all his fortune which the hospitaller risked in his enormous speculations and lost it all  his fame had been great in the financial world  there were circumstances that made it dangerous for his whereabouts to be known and so he had come hither and found refuge in this institution where middleton finds him but does not know who he is in the vacancy of a mind formerly so active he has taken to the study of local antiquities and from his former intimacy with middletons father he has a knowledge of the american part of the story which he connects with the english portion disclosed by his researches here so that he is quite aware that middleton has claims to the estate which might be urged successfully against the present possessor  he is kindly disposed towards the son of his friend whom he had so greatly injured but he is now very old and   middleton has been directed to this old man by a friend in america as one likely to afford him all possible assistance in his researches and so he seeks him out and forms an acquaintance with him which the old man encourages to a certain extent taking an evident interest in him but does not disclose himself nor does middleton suspect him to be an american  the characteristic life of the hospital is brought out and the individual character of this old man vegetating here after an active career melancholy and miserable sometimes torpid with the slow approach of utmost age sometimes feeble peevish wavering sometimes shining out with a wisdom resulting from originally bright faculties ripened by experience  the character must not be allowed to get vague but with gleams of romance must yet be kept homely and natural by little touches of his daily life  as for alice i see no necessity for her being anywise related to or connected with the old hospitaller  as originally conceived i think she may be an artista sculptresswhom eldredge had known in rome  no she might be a granddaughter of the old hospitaller born and bred in america but who had resided two or three years in rome in the study of her art and have there acquired a knowledge of the eldredges and have become fond of the little italian girl his daughter  she has lodgings in the village and of course is often at the hospital and often at the hall she makes busts and little statues and is free wild tender proud domestic strange natural artistic and has at bottom the characteristics of the american woman with the principles of the strongminded sect and middleton shall be continually puzzled at meeting such a phenomenon in england  by and by the internal influence evidence of her sentiments though there shall be nothing to confirm it in her manner shall lead him to charge her with being an american  now as to the arrangement of the romanceit begins as an integral and essential part with my introduction giving a pleasant and familiar summary of my life in the consulate at liverpool the strange species of americans with strange purposes in england whom i used to meet there and especially how my countrymen used to be put out of their senses by the idea of inheritances of english property  then i shall particularly instance one gentleman who called on me on first coming over a description of him must be given with touches that shall puzzle the reader to decide whether it is not an actual portrait  and then this romance shall be offered half seriously as the account of the fortunes that he met with in his search for his hereditary home  enough of his ancestral story may be given to explain what is to follow in the romance or perhaps this may be left to the scenes of his intercourse with the old hospitaller  the romance proper opens with middletons arrival at what he has reason to think is the neighborhood of his ancestral home and here he makes application to the old hospitaller  middleton shall be described as approaching the hospital which shall be pretty literally copied after leicesters although the surrounding village must be on a much smaller scale of course  much elaborateness may be given to this portion of the book  middleton shall have assumed a plain dress and shall seek to make no acquaintances except that of the old hospitaller the acquaintance of alice naturally following  the old hospitaller and he go together to the old hall where as they pass through the rooms they find that the proprietor is flitting like a ghost before them from chamber to chamber they catch his reflection in a glass etc etc  when these have been wrought up sufficiently shall come the scene in the wood where eldredge is seen yielding to the superstition that he has inherited respecting the old secret of the family on the discovery of which depends the enforcement of his claim to a title  all this while middleton has appeared in the character of a man of no note and now through some political change not necessarily told he receives a packet addressed to him as an ambassador and containing a notice of his appointment to that dignity  a paragraph in the times confirms the fact and makes it known in the neighborhood  middleton immediately becomes an object of attention the gentry call upon him the mayor of the neighboring countytown invites him to dinner which shall be described with all its antique formalities  here he meets eldredge who is surprised remembering the encounter in the wood but passes it all off like a man of the world makes his acquaintance and invites him to the hall perhaps he may make a visit of some time here and become intimate to a certain degree with all parties and here things shall ripen themselves for eldredges attempt upon his life   the end
